Silicon speculators:::::EXCHANGE-TRADED funds (ETFs) were supposed to make investing easy.Instead of spending hours researching individual stocks and bonds or paying an expert fund manager, investors could simply buy a few ETFs.But now there are too many to choose from.BlackRock offers 346 in America alone.Some investors need help allocating their money between different funds.Many companies now offer automated wealth managers (AWMs) that perform this service.AWMs have been around for less than ten years, but they have proliferated, offering different services in different countries.Often, they are called robo-advisers, but this term can be misleading.Some offer clients detailed advice about how to save.For example, Wealthfront, an American AWM, predicts the cost of sending a student to a given college, taking into account increases in tuition fees and likely financial aid.It then suggests how parents can save in a tax-efficient way.Other AWMs are simpler.Wealthify, based in Cardiff, rejects the term robo-adviser because it does not provide advice.It merely allocates clients funds based on how much they wish to invest, when they expect to need the money and the degree of risk they will accept.Nonetheless, AWMs have a few things in common.They typically invest in low-cost ETFs and charge very low fees.Annual charges are usually only a fraction of a percentage point of an investors total savings, plus any fees levied by the ETFs.AWMs target cash-conscious investors who cannot afford or do not wish to pay a human adviser.Millennials are considered good customers because they are used to doing things online and are starting to earn money.But generally they do not have a lot of it.Individual savers tend to have small portfolios.At Betterment, the largest independent American AWM measured by assets under management, the average client had $27,400 in June 2017.At Wealthfront, its rival, the average client had $40,900.Their business model leaves AWMs with a problem.To make a profit despite low fees, they must attract lots of client money.Michael Wong, an analyst at Morningstar, an investment research firm, estimates that, depending on its model, an AWM would need between $16bn and $40bn to cover its costs.No independent AWMs have reached profitability, though some are close.Betterment says it has $11bn under management.But for most AWMs, profitability remains distant.Only a few manage over $1bn or have more than 100,000 clients.To get more clients, many are tying up with established wealth managers.On October 5th Aviva, a British insurer, said it would buy a majority stake in Wealthify.Michelle Pearce, Wealthifys co-founder and chief investment officer, noted that Aviva has 15m customers in Britain, who can use her firms services through Avivas portal.To stay independent, AWMs need to get big quickly, in part by seeking customers established firms neglect.Similarly, acquired AWMs often pitch their products to people their parent firms would not otherwise serve.These customers tend to have little wealth and to be new investors.There are dangers in this: they may place too much faith in AWMs more optimistic projections of future riches.Wealthfront even allows customers to borrow at 3.5-4.75% against the value of their savings without selling off their portfolios and disrupting their investment strategies.Like their human counterparts, robos may have a tendency to oversell their investing prowess.Clarification (October 27th, 2017): This piece has been updated to clarify Wealthfronts policy on allowing people to borrow against their savings.
Millennials are doing better than the baby-boomers did at their age:::::ALL men are created equal, but they do not stay that way for long.That is one message of a report this month by the OECD, a club of 35 mostly rich democracies.Many studies show how income gaps have evolved over time or between countries.The OECDs report looks instead at how inequality evolves with age.As people build their careers, or dont, their incomes tend to diverge.This inequality peaks when a generation reaches its late 50s.But it tends to fall thereafter, as people draw redistributive public pensions and quit the rat race, a contest that tends to give more unto every one that hath.Old age, the OECD notes, is a leveller.Will it remain so?Retirement, after all, flattens incomes not by redistributing from rich seniors to poor, but by transferring money to old people from younger, working taxpayers.There will be fewer of them around in the future for every retired person, reducing the role of redistributive public pensions.One logical response to the diminishing number of workers per pensioner is to raise the retirement age.But that will exacerbate old-age inequality, if mildly.Longer careers will give richer workers more time to compound their advantages.And when retirement eventually arrives, the poor, who die earlier, will have less time to enjoy their pensions.Todays youngsters may resent having to provide for more pensioners, not least because they feel that older generations have it easier than them.The OECD provides qualified support for this complaint.Baby-boomers (mostly born in the 1950s) have accumulated far more wealth (property, shares and other savings) than Generation X (mostly in the 1970s) and millennials (the 1980s and after).But that is partly because they have had more time to do so.Comparing generations at a similar stage of life paints a different picture.Todays young adults have a significantly higher disposable income than previous generations had at the same age.OECD citizens now in their early 30s have 7% more than members of Generation X had at that age and over 40% more than boomers enjoyed when they were similarly short in the tooth (see chart).Youngsters may sigh with impatience when an old codger tells them how life was tougher when I was your age.But it was.This millennial privilege is, however, smaller in America, which tends to set the tone for the generation wars.(Indeed Americans in their early 30s are slightly worse off than the preceding generation was at a similar age.)The gap also appears to close as the later generations get older.Gen-Xers were far more comfortable in their 30s than the people born a decade or two before them.But now they are in their 40s, their incomes have stopped rising, whereas their seniors enjoyed strong gains at the same age.This may reflect the lingering influence of the global financial crisis.But if this trajectory persists, a time may soon come when old folk sigh with impatience as youngsters tell them how much easier life was when you were my age.
India recapitalises its state-owned banks:::::ONE of the perks of owning a bank is the ability to tap it when you need money.The Indian government, which has majority stakes in 21 lenders, is no exception.As it happens, it needs to finance a bail-out of the banks it owns, most of which are in trouble.So under a cunning plan unveiled on October 24th, the ailing banks will lend the government 1.35trn rupees ($21bn), about a third of their combined market value.The government will reinvest this money in bank shares, thus ensuring they no longer need a bail-out.Steadying a tottering financial system is never a graceful exercise, as American and European authorities discovered after the financial crisis.Indias lenders withstood the meltdown of 2007-08 well, but then embarked on an ill-advised lending spree, backing lots of infrastructure projects that got snarled in bureaucracy.Bad loans piled up.State-owned lenders, which account for around two-thirds of the sector, now have stressed loans of 10.5trn rupees, about a fifth of their book.Banks have been reluctant to acknowledge that money they have lent is unlikely to be repaid, in part because that would trigger a loss, which in turn depletes the banks equity (the money shareholders invest).State-owned banks already have equity levels close to regulatory minimums, so they have preferred to pretend that even their ropiest borrowers will pay them back in full.At the very least, they dont have the capacity to extend new loans.Predictably, bank-credit growth has slumped, recently nearing record lows.That is one reason why year-on-year GDP growth slowed to 5.7% in the second quarter, from well over 7% a year ago.Despite the roundabout method of recapitalisation, getting money into the banking system is good policy.Bankers are being encouraged to use a new bankruptcy code to deal with bust borrowers; having fresh equity makes it easier for them to acknowledge past mistakes and move on.Details of the bail-out scheme are pending, but may resemble a rescue plan in the 1990s, whereby banks financed recapitalisation bonds issued by the government.The proceeds were used to subscribe to banks rights issues.(Banks will have to raise 580bn rupees themselves, perhaps by selling non-core assets, and receive a further 180bn rupees from government coffers left over from a previous scheme.)One attraction is that the money the government will have to borrow, roughly 1% of GDP, will not be reflected in its deficit, saving the finance ministrys blushes.The prospect of fresh funds sent most state-owned banks share prices soaring by well over 25%.Unlike recent Indian bank-rescue schemes, the package is large enough to make a difference.It should allow banks to lend again, if they can find willing borrowers.Indian businesses have plenty of spare capacity and many are still over-indebted.Some are still dealing with the effects of a sudden demonetisation of the economy last November, which has dented output.The complex implementation of a new goods-and-services tax in July has also frayed corporate confidence.The government also says its banks will be run more efficiently, to prevent further incontinent lending.There is reason to doubt that.Reform of their corporate governance is long overdue; and letting the private sector take over the reins at public banks remains taboo.Still, repair of the balance-sheets is at last under way.
Firms should make more information about salaries public:::::SWEDES discuss their incomes with a frankness that would horrify Britons or Americans.They have little reason to be coy; in Sweden you can learn a strangers salary simply by ringing the tax authorities and asking.Pay transparency can be a potent weapon against persistent inequities.When hackers published e-mails from executives at Sony Pictures, a film studio, the world learned that some of Hollywoods most bankable female stars earned less than their male co-stars.The revelation has since helped women in the industry drive harder bargains.Yet outside Nordic countries transparency faces fierce resistance.Donald Trump recently cancelled a rule set by Barack Obama requiring large firms to provide more pay data to anti-discrimination regulators.Even those less temperamentally averse to sunlight than Mr Trump balk at what can seem an intrusion into a private matter.That is a shame.Despite the discomfort that transparency can cause, it would be better to publish more information.There is a straightforward economic argument for making pay public.A salary is a pricethat of an individual workers labourand markets work best when prices are known.Public pay data should help people make better decisions about which skills to acquire and where to work.Yet experiments with transparency are motivated only rarely by a love of market efficiency, and more often by worry about inequality.In the early 1990s, it was outrage at soaring executive salaries which led American regulators to demand more disclosure of CEOs pay.Such transparency does not always work as intended.Compensation exploded in the 1990s, as firms worried that markets would interpret skimpy pay-packets as an indicator of the quality of executive hires.Despite this, bosses tend to oppose transparency, for understandable reasons.Firms have an easier time in pay negotiations when they know more about salaries than workers do.What is more, shining a light on pay gaps can poison morale, as some workers learn that they earn substantially less than their peers.A study of employees at the University of California, for instance, found that when workers were given access to a database listing the salary of every public employee, job satisfaction among those on relatively low wages fell.In industries in which competition for talented workers is intense, the pernicious effects on morale of unequal pay create an incentive to split the high-wage parts of the business from the rest.Research published in 2016 concluded that diverging pay between firms (as opposed to within them) could account for most of the increase in American inequality in recent decades.That divergence in turn resulted from increased segregation of workers into high- and low-wage firms.Yet transparency increases dissatisfaction not because it introduces information where there was none before, but because it corrects misperceptions.Surveys routinely find that workers overestimate their performance and pay relative to their peers.This is true across economies as well as within firms.In 2001, tax records in Norway were put online, allowing anyone to see easily what other Norwegians had earned and paid in tax.Reported happiness among the rich rose significantly, while the well-being of poorer people fell as they learned their true position on the economic ladder.Better information changes behaviour.Low-paid workers at the University of California became more likely to seek new jobs after salary data became public.In Norway the poor became more likely to support redistribution.Transparency might threaten the function of capitalist economies if people were implacably opposed to pay gaps, but they are not.A study published in 2015 of factory workers in India, for instance, found that unequal pay worsened morale and led to reduced effort when workers could not see others contributions, but not when productivity differences were easily observable.Yet in the modern economy, individual contributions are often devilishly hard to assess.Simple theory suggests that workers are paid according to their productivity.Were they to earn more, their employers would lose money; were they to earn less, other firms could profit by hiring away underpaid employees.But although it is easy enough to see how many shirts a textile worker stitches in an hour, it is much harder to evaluate the contribution of one member of a team that has spent years developing new software.When it is difficult to observe important parts of a job, economists believe that trying to link pay closely to narrow measures of performance can be misguided.Workers inevitably neglect murky but critical tasks in favour of those the boss can easily quantify.In the knowledge economy, therefore, the relationship between pay and productivity is often loose.Pay gaps are often nonetheless justified.Workers with scarce and valuable skills can easily threaten to leave, and can therefore bargain for higher pay.Those fat pay-packets serve the economy by encouraging young workers to develop skills that are in short supplyprovided, of course, that they know how much they can expect to earn.But the difficulty in observing productivity allows factors to influence pay, such as office politics, discrimination or a simple tendency to silence the squeakiest wheels with grease.Open-plan offices Not every country will opt for radical transparency.Even Nordic governments continue to tweak their policies: in 2014 Norway banned anonymous searching of its tax database, so citizens could see who had nosed around their finances.But increased openness about pay could improve both the fairness and the functioning of the economy.When pay is public, it is not the justifiable inequities that create the most discomfort, but those firms cannot defend.Sources
For American Express, competition will only intensify:::::HE IS leaving with the share price rising and the announcement, on October 18th, of earnings that were largely well received.Better still, Kenneth Chenault, American Expresss chief executive for 16 years, accomplished a feat rare in the upper reaches of American finance: to stand down without an obvious helping shove.No grandstanding senators hounded him out (see Wells Fargo).No boardroom coup hastened the end (Citigroup).The financial crisis left him untouched (take your pick).His successor, Stephen Squeri, promoted from within and apparently groomed for the job, takes over in February.For all that, Mr Chenaults long tenure has not been an unequivocal triumph.Though generating strong returns on assets and equity, American Express has continued its slide within the fast-changing and competitive payments industry.According to Nilson, an industry bible, in 1974 the amount of money for purchases channelled through American Express was equivalent to 50% of what went through MasterCard and 70% of what went through Visa.By 2016, those ratios had shrunk to 30% and 14%.American Express has grown nonetheless, as credit-card usage has surged.But the best days may be over.Its share price, revenues and profits all peaked in 2014.Buried in the details of its latest earnings release are hints that raise questions about how strong its numbers are, and suggestions that its strategywhich increasingly relies on lending to replace diminishing transaction feesmay be heading into more turbulent conditions.Cutting the cards Competitive pressure looms on all sides.MasterCards market capitalisation is twice that of American Express; Visas, three times as big.PayPal, spun off from eBay in 2015 and run by a former American Express executive, has a tiny fraction of Amexs revenues and profits but on the eve of the earnings announcement passed it in market value (see chart).Its sales and profits have grown much faster, and it was born online.Rather than a card, PayPal provides a payments platform for individuals, on smartphones or computers, using accounts at their bank or tied to American Express, Visa or MasterCard.In the process it collects a fee.It also offers systems such as Venmo (intended for payments between individuals but sometimes used by businesses, too), Braintree, a financial link used by Uber and Airbnb, and Xoom, a remittance service.Competition abroad is just as keen.American Express entered Asia early and once had an enviable position there, but its presence has faded.In 2007 it sold (to Standard Chartered) a private bank created almost a century ago that had languished from inattention.Japans JCB has issued almost as many cards (but still accounts for far less in transactions).Chinas UnionPay boasts the worlds biggest transaction volume, eight times that of American Express, and 55% of cards issued globally.These conventional competitors may matter less than electronic networks such as Alibabas Alipay and Tencents Tenpay and a profusion of still little-known startups.The entire mechanics of payments are being rethought, with cards being replaced by QR codes, biometrics and more.In this noisy hothouse, Mr Chenault deserves respect for keeping American Express healthy.It has supported its market share through deals with banks and other financial institutions that can now issue American Express cards (and generate fees by transacting through Amexs systems).In the past decade the number of businesses accepting its cards has doubled.But these victories have come at a cost.Twenty-five years ago American Express collected a 3.2% fee on every transaction, according to Sanford Bernstein, an investment research firm.Now, it makes less than 1.8%.Competitive pressure will squeeze this further.In the past, merchants were willing to pay for American Express transactions because its cardholders were well-off and willing to spend.But now large banks are going after these customers.JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, both with card businesses headed by ex-Amexers, have issued cards that provide benefits broadly regarded as better than those from American Express.Soon Bank of America will follow.Banks have also taken aim at lucrative co-branding deals carrying exclusive rewards for customers.In 2015 American Express lost one such deal with Costco, a large retailer that accounted for 10% of its transaction volume, to Citigroup.Another, with JetBlue, an airline, went to Barclays.To rely less on revenue from transaction fees, American Express has become more banklike, lending more.Net interest income made up 18% of revenues in 2012 and should bring in 28% in 2018, predicts Nomura/Instinet, a brokerage.That has looked good lately, because funds have been cheap and credit quality high, but the environment may be changing.Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, among others, began expanding their consumer-loan portfolios in 2015.Now quality may be worsening.In the two most recent quarters, analysts were surprised by the size of American Expresss provisions for credit losses.Other banks also increased provisions.Credit is cyclical and it would be a surprise if this time were different.A new concern is electronic fraud, notwithstanding companies efforts to thwart it.Still, the business that American Express joined 60 years ago will continue to grow, and American Express may well be a beneficiary.But others may be better placed.Mr Chenaults tenure may thus be remembered merely as a pause before the end of an era.
Apple should shrink its finance arm before it goes bananas:::::IT IS fashionable to say that tech firms will conquer the financial services industry.Yet in the case of Apple, it seems that the opposite is happening and finance is taking over tech by stealth.Since the death of Steve Jobs, its co-founder, in 2011, the worlds biggest firm by market value has sold hundreds of millions of phones with bionic chips and know-it-all digital assistants.But it has also grown a financial operation that is already, on some measures, roughly half the size of Goldman Sachs.Apple does not organise its financial activities into one subsidiary, but Schumpeter has lumped them together.The resultcall it Apple Capitalhas $262bn of assets, $108bn of debt, and has traded $1.6trn of securities since 2011.It appears to be run fairly cautiously and is part of a thriving firm, but it still deserves scrutiny.Companies have a history of being hurt by their financial arms; think General Electric (GE) or General Motors (GM).Apple Capital has lots of responsibilities but three stand out.It invests the firms mountain of surplus profits, mainly in highly rated instruments (this task seems to fall to Braeburn Capital, a subsidiary in Nevada, which uses some external fund managers).Apple Capital also uses derivatives in order to protect the firm against currency and interest-rate gyrations.And it manages Americas fifth-biggest corporate-debt pile by issuing Apple bonds as part of an elaborate strategy to limit tax bills.Apple Capital has become important to its parent.Since Jobs died, its assets have risen by 221%, twice as fast as the companys sales, reflecting Apples huge build-up of profits.Its investments are worth 32% of Apples market value, and its profits (investment income, plus gains on derivatives, less interest costs) have been 7% of Apples pre-tax profits so far this year.It is also sizeable compared with other financial firms.Consider four measures: assets, debt, credit exposure and profits.Depending on the yardstick, Apple Capital is 30-85% as big as Goldman Sachs.It is 22-42% as large as GE Capital was at its peak in 2007, just before things went down the tubes during the subprime crisis.Apple Capital is different from these firms in important ways.It does not take deposits and has much lower leverage.In their prime Goldman and GE Capital were run by hard-charging financiers, and made lots of loans.By contrast, Apple Capital does not make loans, and is not meant to be a profit centre in its own right.Nonetheless, it has become riskier, in three ways.First, Apple Capital is investing in racier assets, which involves taking credit risk.In 2011 a majority of its assets were risk-free: cash or government bonds.Today 68% are invested in other kinds of securities, mainly corporate bonds, which Apple says are generally investment grade.The shift may explain why Apples annual interest rate earned on its portfolio (2%) is now higher than that of the four other Silicon Valley firms with money mountains, Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco and Oracle.In total, they still have 66% of their portfolios squirrelled away in risk-free assets.Second, Apples derivatives book has got much bigger.Since 2011 its notional sizethe face value of its contractshas risen by 425%, to $124bn.This is still much smaller than big banks positions, but is the third-largest book of any non-financial firm in America, after GE and Ford.For every dollar of foreign sales, Apple has 89 cents of derivatives, compared with 57 cents for the other four tech giants.At points these derivatives have yielded big rewards.In 2015 they contributed $4bn, or 6% of Apples profits.But they have dangers, too.Apple says that its value-at-risk (VAR), a statistical measure of the maximum likely loss in an average day, is $434m.That is huge: similar to the combined VAR of the worlds top ten investment banks.In theory losses on derivatives would be offset by gains in the value of Apples underlying business.But the sheer size of these positions gives pause for thought.The last area of higher risk is Apples divided geography.Its foreign operation swims in cash while its domestic one drowns in debt.Profits made abroad are kept in foreign subsidiaries.That way Apple does not pay the 35% levy America charges when earnings are repatriated.Some 94% of Apple Capitals assets are offshore and cannot be tapped for ordinary purposes.The domestic business must do the hard work of paying for dividends and buy-backs.Its profits are not big enough to cover these, so it borrows.Domestic net debts have risen to $92bn, or five times domestic gross operating profits.Each year Apple must issue $30bn of bonds (including refinancing), similar to the average of Wall Streets five largest firms.Apples core business is so profitable that it isalmostinconceivable that a blow-up at Apple Capital could lead to it needing taxpayer or central-bank support, as was the case for GM and GE.Still, it is easy to imagine how Apple Capital could hurt its parent.A market shock could lead to losses on its portfolios.A two-percentage-point rise in interest rates would result in a loss of $10bn.If bond markets dried up, Apple might struggle to issue so much debt and have to bring home funds, incurring a big tax bill.It might also become tricky to run such a big derivatives portfolio.Dont upset the Apple cart Apple Capital has grown in a forgiving period for financial markets.That wont last.Over time, the risk of mission creep will rise, as will the temptation to invest in riskier assets.On the current trajectory, by 2022 its assets will reach $400bn and debts $250bn.By then financial regulators, who do not supervise Apple, will be grinding their teeth at night.According to a former manager who left in 2012, Apples financial gurus were careful because nobody wanted that 3am call from Steve Jobs.But Jobs isnt there any more.In any case, a fear of rebuke is not enough.If the tax laws change Tim Cook, Apples boss should wind down the structure that the firm has created.But even if the rules dont Apple Capital should be shrunk.Tech firms should seek to disrupt finance, not be seduced by it.
American business schools dominate our MBA ranking:::::American business schools dominate The Economist s 2017 Which MBA?ranking, taking 16 of the top 20 places.Northwestern Universitys Kellogg School of Management returns to the top spot for the first time since 2004.Kellogg students praise its facilities and collaborative culture.Their career opportunities are among the best, thanks in part to one of the largest alumni networks in the world; 97% of students find a job within three months of graduation, pocketing a 72% pay bump.All of the top ten slots in the ranking are now occupied by large, prestigious American schools, for which students are happy to pay extra.Their average tuition fee is $134,600, and has risen quickly in recent years.Employers, too, are willing to shell out for the best students.Their average basic salary was $127,300, a 70% increase on their pre-MBA pay cheques.But life, like rankings, isnt just about money.So we weight data according to what students tell us is important.The four categories covered are: opening new career opportunities (35%), personal development and educational experience (35%), better salary (20%) and networking potential (10%).See the full ranking and methodology .
Military and civil-aviation bosses are stepping up their efforts to recruit new pilots:::::FOR MANY people, the Hollywood blockbuster Top Gun captures the allure of becoming a pilot.In it, fighter-pilot trainees don aviator sunglasses and flight suits, and zipp about the skies to a soaring 1980s soundtrack.But despite such pop-culture appeal, Americas Air Force is struggling to capture the imagination of would-be recruits.This year it will be short of around 900 new airmen.To counter this, the Air Force is stepping up its efforts to recruit new cadets.This month they introduced a $35,000 signing-on bonus for newly hired military airmen, the first new incentive of its kind since 1999.Commercial carriers, too, are trying to entice more newcomers with better financial rewards.The average pay for new pilots in that sector has nearly tripled from $20,000 to $59,000 in the past three years.One of the main barriers for would-be pilots is training.To become a pilot requires an investment of $200,000, often more than student loans will cover.In addition trainees are required by law to fly 1,500 hours before being hired by a commercial airline.This delays the moment of fully paid employment and is another cost that student loans do not finance.The shortfall is most severely felt by regional carriers which experienced a steep hiring drop between 2014 and 2016.Another part of the problem is that an ageing workforce is coupled with a mandatory retirement age.Over the next ten years, 42% of civil-aviation pilots will have to retire at 65.Boeing estimates that 117,000 new pilots will have to be hired to offset this and accommodate the future growth of the industry.Pilot shortfalls are already having an effect, particularly on regional carriers.Short-distance flights operated by regional airlines are often more expensive than longer routes run by well-staffed major carriers.For example, a quick check of flight prices shows that a five-hour trip from Seattle to New York is only $30 more expensive than a 50-minute jaunt from Seattle to Bellingham in Washington.More concerning, however, are the increased service disruptions.Between 2013 and 2016, 23% of all American airports experienced a reduction of scheduled services of at least 20%, according to figures from OAG, a data provider.Much of this is because of pilot shortages, argues the Regional Airline Association, a trade group.Though the largest carriers have been less disrupted, regional airlines have been forced to cut flights to more-remote destinations.Military leaders and commercial-airline bosses are already lobbying congress to alter the rules that govern flying.High on their wishlist are changes like student loans tailored for those pursuing a career in aviation and easier ways for pilots to clock up more flying hours.In the past being a pilot was considered a glamorous job.Though some of that appeal still lingers, today public policymakers just need to focus on making it financially feasible.
Will corporate tax cuts boost workers’ wages?:::::THE presidents tax promise has always been clear: he will reduce the amount middle-earners, but not rich Americans, must pay.Yet every time Donald Trump releases a plan, analysts say it does almost the opposite.The Tax Policy Centre, a think-tank, recently filled in the blanks in the latest Republican tax proposals and concluded that more than half of its giveaways would go to the top 1% of earners.Their incomes would rise by an average of $130,000; middle-earners would get just $660.The White House maintains that tax reform will deliver a much heftier boost to workers pay packets.Who is right?The disagreement boils down to who benefits when taxes on corporations fall.The Tax Policy Centre says it is mainly rich investors.But in a report released on October 16th, Mr Trumps Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) claimed that cutting the corporate-tax rate from 35% to 20%, as Republicans propose, would eventually boost annual wages by a staggering $4,000-9,000 for the average household.The claim has sparked a debate among economists that is as ill-tempered as it is geeky.Left-leaning economists are incredulous.Writing in the Wall Street Journal , Jason Furman, who led the CEA under Barack Obama, pointed out that if the report is right, wage increases would total about three to six times the cost of the tax cut.Larry Summers, a former treasury secretary, wrote that if a student submitted the CEA paper, he would be hard pressed to give it a passing grade.Conservative economists, such as Gregory Mankiw of Harvard University and Casey Mulligan of the University of Chicago, have responded with a barrage of algebra and diagrams.They note that taxes, because they distort incentives, can cost the economy more than they raise in revenues.Economists call the extra cost deadweight loss.Once it is reclaimed, tax cuts could benefit workers and firms by more than they cost the Treasury.For instance, investment might rise after corporate taxes fall, sparking competition for workers and pushing wages up.Whats more, standard theory says that, in a small economy integrated with global markets, workers will pay for taxes on capital, because firms can up sticks when levies rise.Paul Krugman and Brad DeLong, two left-wing economists, have fired back their own Greek and graphs, laced with snark.But Messrs Mankiw and Mulligan showed that the CEAs prediction is at least logically possible.That does not mean it is reasonable.There are three reasons to doubt it.First, to calculate its figures, the White House relied on two studies, neither from a peer-reviewed journal, of how wages have varied with corporate-tax rates internationally and across American states.A recent review of such papers, by Jane Gravelle of the Congressional Research Service, found both to be statistically flawed.In any case, Mihir Desai of Harvard Business School, who co-wrote one of them, says that the CEA misinterpreted his work.If you assumed the corporate tax creates a deadweight loss worth ten times the revenue it raises, you might justify the CEAs numbers, he says.But that is implausible.(As The Economist went to press, the CEA was preparing a second report using other methods to justify the figures.)Second, the American economy is plainly not small.This makes capital less flighty.And although it may have become more mobile because of globalisation, many investment opportunities in Americain Silicon Valley, sayare hard to replicate elsewhere.This also makes a high corporate-tax rate less likely to send investment abroad.Third, the White Houses analysis ignores other features of the Republican tax plan, like a proposal to switch to a territorial corporate-tax system.Because this would stop taxing the foreign profits of American firms, it might actually encourage investment abroad.And if, as is likely, the tax cut is financed by borrowing, it is likely to push up interest rates and the dollar.That would create an economic drag.The White House has rushed to include the CEAs paper in its argument for tax cuts.Yet the estimate is more than a little optimistic.There is no clear relationship between recent corporate-tax cuts and wage growth in rich countries (see chart).Even the Tax Foundation, a think-tank that looks favourably on corporate-tax cuts, predicts a much smaller wage boost.Should Republicans get their way, Americans can expect a pay risejust not a bumper one.
How leading American newspapers got people to pay for news:::::SOMETIMES it feels like the 1970s in the New York Times and Washington Post newsrooms: reporters battling each other to break news about scandals that threaten to envelop the White House and the presidency of Donald Trump.Only now their scoops come not in the morning edition but in a tweet or iPhone alert near the end of the day.It is like old times in another way: both newspapers are getting readers to pay, offsetting advertising revenue relinquished to the internet.After years of giving away scoops for nothing online, and cutting staff, the Times and Post are focusing on subscriptionsmostly digital oneswhich now rake in more money than ads do.Their experiences offer lessons for the industry in America, although only a handful of newspapers have a chance at matching their success.A subscription-first approach relies on tapping a national and international market of hundreds of millions of educated English-language readers and converting a fraction of those into paying customers.With enough digital subscribersMark Thompson, chief executive of the New York Times , believes his newspaper can get to 10m, from 2m todaythe subscriptions-first model could (in theory) generate more profits than business models dependent on print advertising used to.Such optimism is hard to summon after two decades of accelerating decline.In that period American newspapers lost nearly 40% of their daily circulation, which fell to 35m last year, estimates the Pew Research Centre.Annual ad revenues have shrunk by 63%, or $30bn, just in the past ten years (see chart).Newsrooms have shed 40% of reporters and editors since 2006.High returns on equity turned into single digits, losses or bankruptcy.Like Detroit carmakers before the arrival of the Japanese, in pre-internet days newspapers flush with profits from a captive market grew lazy and complacent.Some big-city papers, like the Philadelphia Inquirer or the Baltimore Sun , splurged on foreign bureaus and fluffy suburban sections whether or not readers wanted them; classified ads alone covered these costs many times over.Now such newspapers are struggling to remain relevant to diminished readerships.A tier below, hundreds of local ones are dying or turning into advertiser sheets; newspaper chains, some managed by investment funds, have snapped up many of them, maintaining high profits by sacking journalists.From the ashes of newsprint The Times and Post have been buffeted by the same forces.But now each is in turnaround.The Times has doubled its digital-only subscribers in less than two years; the Post has managed the feat in ten months, and now has more than 1m.Both have staunched losses.Revenue at the Times had fallen by more than 20% in three years to less than $1.6bn in 2009; this year they are on pace to climb back above $1.6bn, led by digital subscriptions.(Return on equity still fell, to 3% last year from 37% in 2001.)The Post had also been losing millions before Jeff Bezos, boss of Amazon, bought it in 2013.The newspaper is now privately held and does not disclose revenues and profits, but Fred Ryan, the publisher, says both are growing and the newspaper is on track for its most profitable year in a decade.The Wall Street Journal added more than 300,000 digital subscriptions in the year to June, but a sharp fall in advertising crimped revenues by 6% at Dow Jones, the division of News Corp, Rupert Murdochs media empire, that houses the newspaper.How have they done it?Early attempts by newspapers to put up digital paywalls floundered, and met with derision from critics and competitors vaunting the internets ability to generate huge audiences for free content.How could anyone hope to attract paying digital customers when they could go elsewhere online for free?The Times hit upon the answer in 2011, when it introduced a metered paywall, something the Financial Times was also trying.Visitors to the website could read a few free articles a month, after which they would be asked to pay.This approach is now standard across journalism (including at this newspaper), but it was controversial at the time.At News Corp Mr Murdoch erected a hard paywall at all his newspapers in the belief that giving away his product online would cripple the more profitable print editions.Those suffered anyway, and he later dropped the paywall at the Sun , a tabloid, and has allowed some flexibility at the Journal .Softer paywalls have created funnels to suck in customers.On a whiteboard in Mr Thompsons office at the Times is a diagram to illustrate the approach.At the top, where the funnel is widest, are all those who visit its digital site.(In September 104m people in America did so, according to comScore.)At the narrow end are its 2m paying digital-only subscribers (plus 1m print subscribers).Mr Thompsons main preoccupation is to tweak the geometry of the funnel to shift more people from free to paid.At the Post , Mr Ryan is also busy funnelling.The job of funnel mathematician did not exist at newspapers six years ago.Now it is one of the most important functions a digital site has.The Times and Post conduct numerous tests of different ways to trigger the paywall, for instance if a visitor returns to the same columnist.It is A/B testing like at a technology company, Mr Ryan says, except it is more like A to Z testing.The Post has settled on three site visits a month before hitting the paywall, which means 85% of visitors will not encounter it.The other 15% are asked to subscribe at the introductory rate of 99 cents for the first four weeks.Both newspapers sift through data about what visitors do just before stumping up.The Post looks at the month zero of a readers pre-subscription activity on the site.Mr Ryan credits the effort, which began a year ago, with helping to convert more visitors to subscribers this year.Another factor has helped the two papers: Mr Trump.Since his election they have revived an old rivalry, vying for sensational scoops, sometimes several in a day.Mr Trumps attacks on both newspapersthe failing New York Times, more fake news from the Amazon Washington Posthave almost certainly helped their bottom lines.His presidency has created an urgency around news that has made old-fashioned journalism more in vogue than it has been probably since Watergate.Fake news shared on social media has reinforced a feeling that real news costs money.Trump bump The newspapers bosses agree Mr Trump has been good for business, but add they were ready for the moment.As Mr Bezos is fond of saying, you cant shrink your way to profitability.He invested in the Post after buying it, hiring technologists to improve its digital presence.He has also added reporters (the Post now has 750 newsroom employees and counting).Marty Baron, editor of the Post , added a rapid-response investigative team of eight people this year.Dean Baquet, executive editor of the Times , has expanded the Washington bureau twice since the election.(The Times paid for new reporters in part by cutting dozens of other editorial jobs.)The subscription-first approach justifies adding reporters.By increasing the quality of the product, newspapers hope to lure subscribers.But it is not clear others can replicate that virtuous circle so easily.Many regional papers are nurturing digital subscribersthey all have their funnels now, toobut are doing so on a much smaller scale.They will have to come up with other ways to make money to survive.They have to do everything, says Jay Rosen, a professor of journalism at New York University.... is present By everything media experts like Mr Rosen mean ending a reliance on two traditional sources of revenue: ads and subscriptions.At regional papers, unlike the national ones, prospects for both are limited by the size of the metropolitan market.Savings from printing fewer copies are smallprinting and distribution costs are mostly fixedso they must either cut staff or find other ways to make money.This may include staging trade fairs, offering memberships with perks, even e-commerce partnerships.Such sidelines help to ward off staff cuts; to be a community hub, newspapers must also cover communities effectively.They may forgo costly (and wasteful) foreign and national bureaus.But to attract local readers, they must provide relevant coverage of city halls, courthouses, police precincts or schools.Take the Star Tribune in Minneapolis, a privately owned newspaper which has managed to keep the newsroom humming along.Almost annually Mike Klingensmith, the publisher, and a few of his senior executives meet with their counterparts at the Dallas Morning News , Boston Globe and one or two other independently owned newspapers.They sign non-disclosure agreements and then share ideas about how to make money.In the past year Mr Klingensmith has adopted three of them, adding several million dollars in revenue: organising an advertiser fair to attract new clients; putting on a consumer travel show; and starting a glossy quarterly print magazine.The Star Tribune now sells digital subscriptions (nearly 50,000) and adverts; delivers a thick Sunday paper full of features (which accounts for 54% of print ad revenue); and is expanding the Saturday print edition.It conducts in-depth investigations that wins awards, including the Pulitzer Prize in 2013, and makes podcasts and daily videos.Several reporters cover city hall.In the past year an additional one was dispatched to Washington.Mr Klingensmith and Rene Sanchez, the editor, believe quality is key; nearly 20% of the budget goes to the newsroom, which has kept a headcount of 245 for seven years.That gives the Star Tribune s funnel mathematician a product to sell.Patrick Johnston, a digital executive poached from Target, the retail store, and his boss Jim Bernard, a former executive at Marketwatch, a business-news website, explain how a local newspapers funnel vision is different.They are, like the big papers, interested in the visitors who they call intenders, people whose browsing behaviour suggests they may be ready to subscribe.But whereas many visitors to the Times and Post are potential intenders, the Star Tribune can dismiss about 50% of its online trafficthe grazers from outside Minnesota who clicked a linkand focus on the other half.Reducing friction is vital; they have got 25% more intenders to subscribe since installing PayPal as a payment option.Hold the presses The downside to the ease of online subscriptions is the ease of cancelling them.Newspapers guard their rates of digital churn closely because they are so highdespite an all-out effort the Star Tribune keeps only one in two subscribers after 14 months (the Times and Post numbers are better, executives there say, without giving figures).A subscribers early days are essential.Keeping a visitor engaged with the site is similar to getting a guest on Targets website to put another item in their basket, Mr Johnston says.It also means competing with ever more rivals for peoples attention: bigger fish like the Times and Post , but also Netflix, Spotify or Candy Crush.The virtue of digital subscriptions is that they build a deeper relationship between readers and newspapers than when distribution meant throwing broadsheets onto doorsteps.Newspapers nowadays know a lot more about their customers tastes.That lets them tailor the experience to readers individually, with the aim of keeping them around longer.It can be, as Mr Thompson says, an annuity for the newspaper.But the newspaper has to be worth the cover price.
Reports of the MBA’s demise are exaggerated:::::THE MBA is both revered and reviled.To boosters it has advanced the science of management and helped firms, and countries, to grow.Detractors say it offers little of practical value and instils in students a sense of infallibility that can sink companies, and knock economies sideways.The critics are currently the louder of the two, claiming that particularly the full-time, campus-based MBAs have reached saturation point, with too many mediocre courses chasing too few candidates.The Financial Times recently likened them to the Grand Tour of business education in an age of Airbnb.There is a widespread feeling that full-time MBAs are on their last legs, concedes Sangeet Chowfla, the president of the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), a business-school association.Decline is allegedly hastened by competing qualifications, such as the Masters in Management.MiMs have much the same syllabus as MBAs, but unlike them, take students without management experience straight from undergraduate degrees.They often cost half as much and do not make participants interrupt their careers to study.Such degrees have long been popular at European business schools.Now Americans are following suit.Non-MBAs now attract 35% of people who sit the GMAT, the de facto business-school entrance exam, up from 30% five years ago.MBAs share has dipped proportionately.When Kings College London launches a business school in November, it will offer specialised Masters courses but no MBAs.Stephen Bach, its dean, says that employers like to recruit younger students because they are more flexible and culturally attuned.But look across the world and MBA programmes are thriving.The popular myth of their demise is just that, says Mr Chowfla.Rapid growth in the overall business-education market has offset MBAs declining share.Global applications to MBA programmes in the 2016/17 academic year grew by 6%, according to GMAC.In Asia, they rose by 13%; 132,000 students now apply to Asian schools, nearly as many as to American ones.Applications in Europe increased by 3%.American courses that enroll more than 200 MBA studentswhich dominate The Economist s ranking of MBA programmes (see article )report a 4% rise.Demand has, it is true, fallen at smaller American schools.Those with fewer than 200 students saw applications drop by 6% this year.These schools enroll around half of all students in America.But they face distinct pressures.One is Donald Trump.In a survey by Carrington Crisp, a consultancy, around 40% of potential applicants said that the new president had discouraged them from studying in the country (just 3% said he made them more likely to study there).His anti-immigrant administrations plans to tighten the rules for graduate work visas may have something to do with this.International students are feeling left behind, explains one who opted to study in France over America.Dislike of Trumpism will not deter applicants from the finest American establishments.Few institutions anywhere can match the cachet of Harvard, Wharton or Kellogg, which charge a premium as a result.Second-tier American programmes are nearly as expensive, but nothing like as prestigious.Foreign students may opt for cheaper courses in countries with brighter job prospects.That bodes well for non-American MBAs.One partial exception is Britain.British schools lure students from the European Union, in part because they enjoy an automatic right to work at Londons big banks and professional-services firms.Brexit would change that.But British courses are at least getting cheaper for non-Brits.The collapse in the pound since the Brexit vote in June 2016 has cut the cost to Europeans of attending London Business School by 14,000 ($16,000), for instance.That may help explain why three in four British schools report a rise in applications this year, according to GMAC.If Britain crashes out of the EU the pound could weaken again, making courses look cheaper still.By then, however, the discount may not be sufficient to attract anyone.
Italy’s fourth-biggest bank returns to the stockmarket:::::A TELEVISION advertisement for Monte dei Paschi di Siena begins with a toddler tumbling and a gymnast stumbling.Falling is the first thing we learn, declares the voice-over.The second is getting up again.Italys fourth-biggest bank and the worlds oldest, which was bailed out by the Italian government in July, has had several bruising falls over the years.On October 25th it returned to the stockmarket after a ten-month hiatusthe latest stage of its plan to get back on its feet.The shares closed higher on the day, at 4.55 ($5.37), but still far below the 6.49 the government paid.Trading was suspended last December, after a failed private-sector attempt to save the bank through a share issue.The government said it would get involved.In July the European Commission approved a 8.1bn precautionary recapitalisation.European rules say banks receiving such aid must be solvent, the capital injection must not distort competition and the capital shortfall must be identified by a stress test, such as the one Monte dei Paschi failed in July 2016.Shareholders and junior bondholders must share the pain.Therefore, alongside the injection of 3.9bn by the government, 4.3bn-worth of subordinated bonds are being converted to equity.Much of this is held by retail investors, many of whom may have thought they were buying a safe investment.Some of these can choose to swap their new shares for senior bonds.The exchange will run from October 30th to November 17th.If, as expected, they all make the swap, the governments stake will rise from 52% to 68%, at an additional cost of 1.5bn.By 2021 Monte dei Paschi must return to the private sector.The plan also disposes of 28.6bn-worth, at gross value, of non-performing loans, of which most are being offloaded into a separate vehicle and securitised.Atlante 2, a private bank-rescue fund, will buy most of the mezzanine and junior tranches for 1.6bn; the senior debt will be sold on the market, partly backed by a state-guarantee scheme.The scheme is rounded off by the banks restructuring.This includes simplifying and digitising retail banking, strengthening the wealth-management business and improving credit-risk management.The number of branches will be cut from 2,000 to 1,400; 350 have already closed.Monte dei Paschis headcount of 25,500 will be reduced by 5,500; 1,800 staff have already departed.In August Marco Morelli, the banks boss, sent an e-mail to all staff asking for ideas.He received 1,000 replies.He then spent two weeks touring the country, meeting staff in several cities.At each encounter Mr Morelli projected onto a screen three of the most critical e-mailed responses.The message he sought to transmit: no more alibis.Things may be looking up.Pavilion, an investment services firm, suggests that new regulation and accounting rules will make life harder for Italian banks dealing with bad loans, but cyclical factors will offset this.In August net non-performing loans fell to 65.3bn, down from 86.8bn in December, according to Italys banking association.UniCredit, the countrys biggest lender, announced preliminary third-quarter earnings on October 24th: pre-tax profits rose by 45%, year on year, helped by the sale of Pioneer, a fund manager.But the Sienese lender has a lot of work to do.Its gross non-performing exposure ratio is projected to fall from 34.5% in December 2016 to 12.9% within five years.That is a little below last Decembers Italian average, but still much higher than the European average of 5.1%.Meanwhile, new inquiries are under way into two of the banks former managers for allegedly obstructing supervisors.Getting up again may be a struggle.
Janet Yellen has made a lot of mistakes:::::Dear John: Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen misses more than you said in a recent column.She overestimates the strength of the job market, and is underestimating the amount of inflation in part of the economy housing while underestimating the weakness in prices and wages in a ton of the economy.And she radically underestimates the drag of government spending and debt, taxes and regulation on the economy.When states start going bankrupt, Congress will federalize those debts and load the nation with more national debt, heading for our own Greek crisis.The key is that Yellen was misreading the data , and the data she was reading were wrong.And she is not reading other data at all.The model she reads leaves out key factors.So she/they keep wondering, if the jobs are this good, where is the inflation?R.W.Dear R.W.: And she might still get reappointed for another term.God bless America and God help us.
Why don’t conductors realize subway announcements are impossible to hear?:::::Dear John: On Oct. 17, I was taking the F train from Brooklyn to Manhattan.Because of work on the tracks that day, the F became the D train, making the same stops.The problem was with the voice on the platform giving people information about the changes.Riders could not make out the information because it was not clear.Why dont the people who work on the train go sit out on the platform to hear that the information is not clear?B.S.Dear B.S.: For the train conductor (garble) to hear the announcements (garble), theyd actually have to get (garble) out of the train and walk a couple of (garble) steps.That would require more effort (garble) than a city employee (garble) is used to.You should (garble) sign up for notifications at mymtaalerts.com, and youll know about changes (garble) that will affect your commute.You (garble) will also find out (garble) about a lot of other (garble) problems you dont care about, but (garble) thats the price you pay.Oh, and its (garble) free.Didnt I just make you feel like you are in the subway?Now if I could just reproduce the smell, this would be (garble) perfect.I asked the MTA what it was doing about the lousy sound system on most trains and in most stations.I was told: Were not aware of anything the agency is doing with regard to the quality of the announcements.There was a fair amount of material on customer experience and agency communications in [MTA Chairman Joe] Lhotas action plan released earlier this year, but it did not address the quality of announcements on the trains.Well, (garble) that.Dear John: Every day brings a new news story into focus Harvey Weinstein, hurricanes, wildfires, North Korea, hacking, etc.and it seems that Equifax is fading from coverage.I am sure that company is pleased about that.Can you keep the spotlight on what it is doing to address the massive security breach?When will letters be sent to those whose personal information was hacked?Dont let Equifax fade from scrutiny.T.A.Dear T.A.: Everyone wants you to pay less attention to the possibility of nuclear war and concentrate on the possible destruction of your credit score.Is that good enough?I think this country is on information overload.When you worry about too many things at one time, you worry about nothing.Dear John: Thanks for your recent article on problems with the Census Bureau data.What is so wildly frustrating on employment data is that the Labor Department or the Federal Reserve could go to this little outfit down the street called the IRS and get the exact correct data in near real time.Sadly, that would put a lot of seasonal adjusting economists out of work.R.L.M.Dear R.L.M.: What about me?!Not only would those economists be put out of business, but Id have a hard time filling my column if the government did the sensible thing and went to the IRS for raw data.So lets not go too crazy on simplifying the system.
Raiding 401(k)s should not be the solution for sourcing tax cuts:::::Its time to start paying attention, America.Once again, there is a big problem brewing on Capitol Hill, where some politicians still dont have their priorities straight.The pols are under the disconcerting delusion that raiding workers 401(k) plans is a way for them to pay for the tax cuts they will grudgingly give us.They would rather reach into your pocket and jeopardize your retirement than make common-sense adjustments elsewhere.They want to change the only well-functioning retirement self-savings plans, which would be a disaster for the American family, the economy and the stock market.Lets start with the basics.Saving for retirement is just about the only way to make sure you dont spend your golden years living in squalor.After the stagnant wage and unemployment picture of the last decade, we need to encourage more people to save more, not less.Ask a retired person how they would fare on just $1,369 per month from Social Security.Due entirely to Washingtons mismanagement of the trillions theyve collected, Social Security is expected to run out of money in just over 15 years, anyway.Every working American pays 6.2 percent of his or her paycheck, and employers match an additional 6.2 percent, to Uncle Sam for their entire working life.And they are still going broke.What pols should do is expand 401(k) deductions in order to bail out Social Security.I cannot comprehend why the Washington half-wits cant just do a simple tax cut and walk away.Just cut every tax rate by 5 percent, and let the paychecks rise, let businesses find America a more appealing place to do business, and bask in the glory of growth.Think about it.The lowest bracket would go to 5 percent thats a 50 percent tax cut for them.The big earners would go to 34.6 percent, a 13 percent reduction, and corporate would go from 35 percent to 30 percent, saving 14 percent.That would help the poorest the most, and all brackets would spend more.But I like to keep things simple and make mathematical sense.As for politicians, they wouldnt know simple if it knocked at the door.Anything the feds touch, they break.Home mortgages: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the multitrillion mortgage byproducts that nobody in Washington wants to talk about, are a disaster.To this day, they sit in receivership, and its still much too hard to get a mortgage.Student loans: Sallie Mae destroyed the private student loan market while tuitions have grown in the double-digits, and well-endowed universities are allowed to shelter all their billions tax free without any tuition reduction mandates.Health care: Obamacare was going to save the typical family $2,500 per year.The truth is that insurance rates have skyrocketed and competition is nonexistent.Now big government is encroaching on our retirement savings?Its our last bastion of economic freedom.I cant be more emphatic about this.Hands off our 401(k)s!
Loan sharks are preying on the city’s poorest residents:::::New York loan sharks are circling the desperate residents of the citys poorest neighborhoods to reap gigantic profits.In a shocking new sign of economic distress among many New Yorkers, payday loans the shadowy, multimillion-dollar underground banking business is finding fresh prey.see also Regulators are planning a crackdown on payday loans A federal agency on Thursday announced tough, long-awaited rules on... Local consumers in vulnerable neighborhoods are being plunged into a vicious cycle of unsustainable debt.And despite the latest crackdown on these already illegal practices in New York, civil and criminal usury is happening right under regulators noses, according to a Post investigation.Payday lenders, check cashiers, number racketeers and now prestamistas (Spanish for lender) in Latino communities are in on the latest predatory lending gone awry.Their annual percentage yield: 400 percent or higher.It is a crime to charge consumers interest of 25 percent or more in New York state.While many payday lenders have been kicked to the curb, an unscrupulous bunch appears to be sneaking in the back door by trolling online for New Yorkers.Some go door to door.As much as it wants to, the attorney generals office in New York does not have enough staff to police this terrible business, warned Isaac Rodriguez, chief executive of Provident Loan Society, the nonprofit lender founded in 1893 as an alternative to the loan sharks.These bad lending practices are taking place in community centers, barber shops, dry cleaners and in other places people gather.You could be strapped for cash, or be one of the so-called affluent poor, so you take out the loans with sky-high interest rates.The Washington Heights section of Manhattan may be ground zero for these predators.Local neighborhood lenders are part of an unregulated, informal network making the practical equivalent of payday loans to local residents with a spotty or no credit history.Maria Ramos, 64, who runs a neighborhood beauty salon, is one of the victims.The polite Dominican-born businesswoman has a history with numerous prestamistas, having borrowed individual sums ranging from $2,000 to $35,000 over the years, according to a recent project of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.During one 12-month period, Ramos paid 208 percent interest on two loans, and 156 percent on a third.She was reluctant to speak at length when reached by The Post.But the businesswoman, who turned to the unregulated lending market three years ago and borrowed around $14,000 for her salon after the traditional banking sector rejected her admits she has had some sleepless nights.Earlier this year, Ramos said she still owed $10,800 on her original loan to the lenders, who could be best described as intimidating.Thats even as she paid back $2,600 monthly through 2016.A conventional loan in the regulated sector, had she qualified, might have set her back $350 monthly, financial analysts say.Several payday entities with New York addresses purport to offer these loans in New York.Loans are often secured against the borrowers upcoming paychecks.Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for the New York Attorney Generals office, dismissed claims the agency does not have enough resources to curb payday lending.Our office follows all leads that are referred to us, and our investigations have resulted in relief for thousands of New Yorkers, she said.
Steph Curry’s Under Armour sneaker is MIA:::::The Steph Curry 4 sneaker is missing in action or at least its late to the court.The Golden State Warriors Under Armour shoe was supposed to debut Friday, but only the kids version was available.The adult version of the sneaker was just taking pre-orders for delivery on Nov. 18 on major retailers Web sites, according to footwear analyst Sam Poser of Susquehanna Financial Group.Retailers, Poser wrote in a note, are not happy and concerned that when the Curry 4 does arrive, the target customer will have already moved on to other things namely, the latest Nike shoe.Since Nike controls 95 percent of the basketball biz, we believe the Curry 4 will become an afterthought when it finally comes out, Poser wrote.A source at Under Armour said the adult version of the shoe was available on the companys Web site on Friday and sold out under two hours.Poser says the shoe was late because of last-minute design changes.A UA source said there was no design change.
Simons: Thiel’s skip-college plan is ‘dumbest thing I’ve ever heard’:::::Billionaire hedge funder James Simons had some harsh words for Peter Thiels efforts to pay students to skip college.I think its the dumbest thing I ever heard.I mean, really, We dont need training, lets just get out there and do it, the old-school Simons said incredulously at a breakfast hosted by the IESE Business School on Thursday.Thiel, the entrepreneur known for co-founding PayPal as well as funding Hulk Hogans lawsuit against Gawker Media, has long been critical of higher education.He founded the Thiel Fellowship in 2011.The two-year program pays students $100,000 to skip college and pursue their entrepreneurial ideas with guidance.Maybe theres one or two people a year who could benefit from that, Simons said.Simons holds a Ph.D. in mathematics and worked in acadamia prior to launching his $50 billion Renaissance Technologies fund in 1982.
GDP sails on in face of hurricane havoc:::::The US economy just blew past a pair of hurricanes.Growth domestic product hit 3 percent in the third quarter the second time since 2014 that the economy saw two consecutive quarters of growth at or above 3 percent, according to data released Friday by the Commerce Department.Economists had forecast 2.5 percent growth for the quarter, which was hit by Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Irma in Florida and Puerto Rico.Hurricane Maria, which slammed Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, had no impact as the islands are not included in the US national accounts.This is a remarkable achievement in view of the recent hurricanes which have shattered so many lives, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement Friday.Wall Street seemed to agree.This is a surprisingly good number, especially in light of the storms, Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, told The Post.Inventory investing which represents goods to be sold in the future added three quarters of a percent to GDP in the third quarter.That could be a drag next quarter.Not a bad streak, though, Ablin said.Most of [the growth] came in the form of trade.Consumer spending [also] held up, Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial, told The Post.He expects that GDP growth in the fourth quarter will also hit 3 percent.GDP grew 3.1 percent in the second quarter.Growth has failed to reach 3 percent on an annual basis since the financial crisis.Going into next week, there will be a slew of economic data to digest as well.The Labor Department will release jobs data Friday, and the Federal Open Market Committee will be holding its meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Wells Fargo probed over suspicious trade for Burger King’s owner:::::Nobody rips off Warren Buffett not even Warren Buffett.The Justice Department is probing Wells Fargo the scandal-ridden bank that counts the Omaha-based billionaire as its biggest shareholder over a suspicious, money-losing transaction its traders made for the company that owns Burger King, where Buffett is also a big investor, according to reports.The investigation revolves around a single currency trade involving an order from Restaurant Brands International, which also owns Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and Tim Hortons, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday (paywall).The trade happened within the last three years and involved billions of dollars, according to the report.It resulted in a loss for Restaurant Brands, and Wells Fargo is going to refund the company hundreds of thousands of dollars, the report said.The San Francisco office of the DOJ is still in the early stages of the investigation, according to the report.The revelations come just one week after reports the bank fired four FX traders, and another senior banker resigned over a suspicious transaction.Its unclear what the nature of the transaction was.In a statement, Wells Fargo said the departure of these employees was not related to issues involving market collusion, front running, or market manipulation.Wells Fargo learned of an issue associated with a foreign exchange transaction for a single client.The matter was reviewed, the client was promptly notified regarding the issue, and Wells Fargo leadership took steps to hold accountable the individuals who were involved, spokeswoman Jessica Ong told The Post.A spokesperson for the DOJ declined to comment.The investigation is the latest black eye for Wells Fargo.Earlier this month, US Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)told CEO Tim Sloan that he should be fired because he was a manager during the period when millions of fake accounts and credit cards were opened in peoples names.That scandal, which broke last year, led to the resignation of Sloans predecessor John Stumpf.Since then, the bank has dealt with numerous other scandals involving forced payments for auto insurance the people didnt need and excessive fees and rates for mortgages.The bank is facing multiple criminal and civil investigations from states and federal agencies, as well as class-action suits seeking damages.
Expedia reports awful quarter after its CEO leaves for Uber:::::Dara Khosrowshahi knows when to get out of Dodge.The former chief executive of Expedia who jumped ship to take the top job at Uber in August just missed a stunningly awful quarter for the travel website.Expedias shares sank 15.9 percent on Friday to $123.79 after it slashed its 2017 profit outlook and posted earnings for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 that were well below Wall Streets forecasts.Management blamed the hurricane season and the underperformance of its Trivago hotel search site as it slashed its earnings growth forecast to the single-digit range from its previous guidance of 10 to 15 percent for the year.Expedia, which owns a dozen travel brands, including Hotels.com, Orbitz and Travelocity, said its profit for the quarter was $2.51 per share compared with Wall Streets estimate of $2.62 per share.Though we are not at all satisfied with our Q3 performance, our sights are clearly aimed at the longer-term opportunity ahead, said Expedia Chief Executive Mark Okerstrom in an earnings call with analysts.
The wait for an iPhone X is already backed up to December:::::Its official: The iPhone X is hard to get.Pre-orders for Apples $999 smartphone went live around the world at 3:01 a.m. EDT Friday and within minutes, shipping dates were backed up several weeks.According to Apples website, customers who placed a pre-order at midday Friday wont receive their iPhone X until mid-December more than a full month after the phones launch, slated for Nov. 3.In a statement, Apple confirmed customer demand for the iPhone X was off the charts, adding that it is working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible.Stragglers who didnt secure a launch-day pre-order but want to get an iPhone X next Friday still have options but they may involve queueing up for hours or even days at their local Apple Store.Earlier this week, Apple said phones would be available in Apple Stores in limited quantities, but that customers are encouraged to arrive early.Those who value their comfort more than their bank accounts can take to eBay, where savvy sellers have begun listing their successful pre-orders at eye-watering prices.A 256-gigabyte, space-gray iPhone X thats slated to arrive Nov. 3 went live on eBay 30 minutes after pre-orders were made available, with bidding starting at $1,129.The bidding was recently at $2,630.Earlier this week, Japanese news service Nikkei reported that Apple will only be able to move 20 million units this year half of what was expected.Compare that to the iPhone 6S, which moved 13 million units in its first weekend.Supplies are getting strained by production delays that reportedly have plagued the iPhone X for months.Manufacturers reportedly are struggling to produce components for the iPhone Xs new face recognition technology.Currently, 10 million handsets are produced per month, according to Nikkei.Apple shares were up 3.3 percent at 1:25 p.m. to $162.56.
JCPenney’s fire sales on fall fashions clobber its stock:::::JCPenneys stock plunged more than 17 percent after it slashed its financial forecasts, citing slower-than-expected sales in the crucial back-to-school period.The struggling department store said Friday it got forced into a fire sale to clear unsold fall fashions in September and October.That, in turn, will fuel a third-quarter loss between 40 cents and 45 cents a share, versus Wall Streets expectation of an 18-cent-per-share loss.Comparable sales or sales at stores open at least a year will inch up by less than a percentage point, Penney said.We made the strategic decision to accelerate a wider transformation of the entire womens department by clearing slow-moving inventory primarily in womens and other apparel categories, Chief Executive Marvin Ellison said in a statement.JCPenney shares were recently off 14.5 percent at $3.13.The clearance sales dont bode well for the budget-friendly department store, Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said in a note.Its concerning given its the back-to-school period and weather was very favorable, Grom wrote, adding that JCPenneys problems are its own and are not reflective of all department stores.For the full year, the Plano, Texas company expects comparable sales to be down 1 percent or to be flat and for earnings to be an anemic 2 cents to 8 cents a share.Thats sorely short of Penneys previous forecast of 40 cents to 65 cents a share, with comparable sales either declining or rising by a percentage point.In the second quarter, JCPenney closed as many as 127 stores the largest one-time liquidation in the chains history leaving it with 875 locations.JCPenney will release its third-quarter results on Nov. 10.
Inventory, trade deficit lifts economy to third-quarter growth:::::WASHINGTON The U.S. economy unexpectedly maintained a brisk pace of growth in the third quarter as an increase in inventory investment and a smaller trade deficit offset a hurricane-related slowdown in consumer spending and a decline in construction.Gross domestic product increased at a 3.0 percent annual rate in the July-September period after expanding at a 3.1 percent pace in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said on Friday.The department said while it was impossible to estimate the overall impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on third-quarter GDP, preliminary estimates showed that the back-to-back storms had caused losses of $121.0 billion in privately owned fixed assets and $10.4 billion in government-owned fixed assets.Harvey and Irma struck parts of Texas and Florida in late August and early September.Hurricane Maria, which destroyed infrastructure in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, had no impact on third-quarter GDP growth as the islands are not included in the United States national accounts.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the economy growing at a 2.5 percent pace in the third quarter.Excluding inventory investment, the economy grew at a 2.3 percent rate, slowing from the second quarters 2.9 percent pace.With post-hurricane labor market, retail sales and industrial production data already showing an acceleration in underlying economic activity, Fridays report will probably have no impact on monetary policy in the near term.Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen cautioned last month that economic growth in the third quarter will be held down by the severe disruptions caused by the hurricanes.The U.S. central bank is expected to increase interest rates for a third time this year in December.The economic recovery since the 2007-2009 recession is now in its eighth year and showing little signs of fatigue.The economy is being powered by a tightening labor market, which has largely maintained a strong performance that started during former President Barack Obamas first term.Though U.S. stocks have risen in anticipation of President Donald Trumps tax reform, the administration has yet to enact any significant new economic policies.Trump wants big tax cuts and fewer regulations to boost annual GDP growth to 3 percent.Inventory Boost Businesses accumulated inventories at a $35.8 billion pace in the third quarter in anticipation of strong demand.As a result, inventory investment contributed 0.73 percentage point to third-quarter GDP growth, after adding just over a tenth of a percentage point to growth in the prior period.Exports increased at a 2.3 percent rate in the third quarter, while imports fell at a 0.8 percent pace.That left a smaller trade deficit, leading to trade adding 0.41 percentage point to GDP growth.Trade has contributed to output for three quarters in a row.Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which hurt incomes and undercut retail sales in August, crimped consumer spending in the third quarter.Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, slowed to a 2.4 percent rate following a robust 3.3 percent pace in the second quarter.The storms also weighed on investment in nonresidential structures like oil and gas wells.Spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts grew at a 21.7 percent rate, decelerating from the second-quarters 116.3 percent pace.As result, spending on residential structures fell at a 5.2 percent pace in the third quarter after rising at a 7.0 percent rate in the second quarter.Investment in homebuilding, which was already undermined by land and labor shortages, also took a hit from Harvey and Irma.Spending on residential construction declined at a 6.0 percent rate, contracting for a second straight quarter.Business investment on equipment rose at an 8.6 percent rate, increasing for a fourth straight quarter.Government investment fell for a third straight quarter.
Mattel shares hammered as Barbie maker suspends dividend:::::Shares of Mattel sank to their lowest since the 2008 financial crisis on Friday after the Barbie maker suspended its dividend and warned it would miss forecasts for revenue this year.The toymaker was the second in a week to report trouble with existing plans from the bankruptcy of major retailer ToysRUs and analysts said Mattels streak of sales declines could now persist into 2018.Performance across top brands Barbie, Fisher-Price and Monster High was much worse than most had expected, putting more pressure on management after sales have declined in four of the past six quarters.We suspected a rough quarterbut that was really tough, Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink said in a note on the results.Mattel shares were off 15.5 percent at $12.99 in early Friday trades.New CEO Margo Georgiadis has already embarked on a turnaround plan that has seen the departure of many top-level executives as well as cost cuts.But the surprise bankruptcy of ToysRUs in September added pressure to an industry that has been struggling with online competition and lackluster demand for traditional toys.Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz said the ToysRUs bankruptcy was delaying Mattels recovery.Slower shipments to ToysRUs on top of weakening domestic demand for Mattels products, led to a total sales decline of 13 percent, markedly worse than single-digit gain we forecast, Katz said.Georgiadis on Thursday said the company would cut $650 million of costs and reinvest $170 million from that in areas such as emerging markets and developing its ability to seamlessly sell in stores as well as online.Jefferies Wissink said the ratio of cost cuts to reinvestment looked unrealistic.From our observation of MAT and the industry, revival cycles take longer, cost cuts are always narrower, and reinvestment is always larger than initially expected, she said.Wissink cut her price target on the stock to $12.50 from $14.The median price target on the stock is $18.At least three other brokerages also cut their price targets.A relatively new top management which lacks experience in toys could also prolong the execution of Mattels turnaround plan, the analysts said.We do not see an easy rescue effort, Wissink said.Reengaging the sales and profit model will be a grind not impossible, but may not prove as simple as a mega cost cutting exercise.
Tesla slashes orders for Model 3 parts in production bottleneck:::::Tesla plans to slash by 40 percent its orders for parts for the new Model 3 mass-market sedan from Taiwanese auto component maker Hota Industrial from December, according to a media report.Tesla shares tipped 2 percent to $319.50 in early Friday trading.Shares of the parts maker Hota dropped nearly 9 percent after the Economic Daily News reported, citing Hota Chairman Shen Kuo-jung, that Tesla had told the firm orders would be cut to 3,000 sets per week from 5,000 sets starting December, due to a bottleneck in the production of Model 3.Tesla may delay scheduled weekly shipments of 10,000 parts in March by a few weeks until May or June, the report added.Hota, which makes gears and axles for vehicles, and Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Earlier this month, Tesla said production bottlenecks had left the company behind its planned ramp-up for the new Model 3 sedan.It began production of the model in July.
CVS reportedly offers over $66B to acquire Aetna:::::US pharmacy operator CVS Health Corp. has made an offer to acquire No.3 US health insurer Aetna Inc. for more than $200 per share, or over $66 billion, people familiar with the matter said Thursday.A deal would merge one of the nations largest pharmacy benefits managers and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer health care to government plans nationwide.Aetna shares rose more than 11 percent, or $18.48, to $178.60, while CVS shares fell 3 percent, or $2.22, to $73.31, after the Wall Street Journal (paywall) first reported on the talks earlier Thursday.Health care consolidation has been a popular route for insurers and pharmacies, under pressure from the government and large corporations to lower soaring medical costs.Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) such as CVS negotiate drug benefits for health insurance plans and employers, and in recent years have taken an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with drugmakers.They often extract discounts and after-market rebates from drugmakers in exchange for including their medicines in PBM formularies with low co-payments.A tie-up with Aetna could give CVS more leverage in its price negotiations with drugmakers.But it would also subject it to more antitrust scrutiny.The deal could also help counter pressure on CVS stock following speculation that Amazon.com Inc. is preparing to enter the drug prescription market, using its vast e-commerce platform to take market share from traditional pharmacies.CVS made the offer earlier this month, although the two companies have been in discussions about a potential deal for several months, the sources said.These talks were carried out primarily between CVS chief executive officer Larry Merlo and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, and were aimed at making executives comfortable with the idea of a merger, the sources said.CVS and Aetna started discussing terms only recently, and a deal is not expected for a few weeks, one of the sources added, cautioning that the pace of the talks could accelerate given the publication of the negotiations.The sources did not specify how much of CVS bid is cash versus stock, but given CVS and Aetnas market capitalizations of $77 billion and $54 billion, respectively, a substantial stock component is likely in any deal.Aetna and CVS declined to comment.Aetna earlier this year closed the door on a deal with rival insurer Humana Inc. after antitrust regulators said that combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc. and Cigna Corp. were anti-competitive.Uncertain times ahead The deal comes after years of major changes to the US health insurance industry under former President Barack Obama, whose 2010 Affordable Care Act created new ground rules for how insurers operate and expanded insurance to 20 million more Americans.Republican President Donald Trump has promised to turn back many of the Affordable Care Acts facets, but Congress has not been able to agree on a repeal or a replacement.The lack of progress as well as Trumps executive order to bring down health care costs has created uncertainty for insurers as they head into 2018.After the deal with Humana fell apart, Bertolini has said he did not believe large deals were possible in the insurance industry.But analysts have speculated about a tighter partnership between Aetna and CVS since early in the year.CVS and Aetna have a long-term contract in which CVS has provided pharmacy benefits for Aetna customers.Aetna really makes the best sense, said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.Its their largest client on the PBM side.They really have similar views as to where health care should go, which is to the retail setting.Jonas, who owns both Aetna and CVS shares, noted the two companies were already talking about working together on Minute Clinic, on home infusion and other services.To go from that to a full merger is a big step, but its not huge, he said.Last week, No.2 insurer Anthem Inc. announced plans to manage its own pharmacy benefits with the help of CVS, a move that would give it a set-up similar to UnitedHealth Group Inc. and its Optum unit.Insurers want more control over the pharmaceutical component of care as they implement pricing schemes with doctors and hospitals that are based on health outcomes, not just procedures.They also want to work on driving down costs, and as a pharmacy benefit manager, would negotiate directly with drugmakers.
$1B suit claims LuLaRoe encouraged women to sell breast milk for inventory:::::CORONA, Calif. A California clothing company has been hit with lawsuits claiming it recruited women to sell its goods from home and left thousands of them with unreturnable merchandise.The Riverside Press-Enterprise says a federal class-action suit filed Monday seeks at least $1 billion in damages from LuLaRoe, which had $2 billion in sales this year.The suit says the Corona firm encouraged women who wanted to sell its leggings, skirts and other clothing to take out loans, run up credit cards and even sell their breast milk, then left some in financial ruin with unsold goods.The suit says as many as 80,000 people paid thousands up front for inventory.Another suit takes aim at changes in the companys refund policy for its sellers.LuLaRoe calls the suits baseless and inaccurate.
Ugg maker steps off the auction block:::::see also Ugg maker's board may get the boot The board of Ugg maker Deckers Outdoor is being warned... Deckers Outdoor, the maker of Uggs boots, on Thursday pulled itself off the block after finding no suitors interested in buying the $2.25 billion company.Share of the Goleta, Calif., company sank as much as 1.6 percent in after- hours trading in the wake of the news.Deckers has put itself on the block in April but said in a regulatory filing that it is no longer actively pursuing a sale after reaching out to 90 potential bidders.The after-hours drop came despite Deckers reporting better than expected earnings for its second fiscal quarter ending Sept. 30.Last month, activist investor Marcato Capital, threatened to nominate a full slate of candidates to Deckers board if the bootmakers review process didnt result in a desirable outcome.Marcato sued Deckers earlier this week to force it to hold its shareholder meeting on Dec. 14.Deckers reported adjusted earnings of $1.54 a share, beating analyst expectations of $1.02.Shares ended up 2.2 percent, at $70.16, in regular trading hours.
George Soros’ investment firm sheds employees:::::Nine people, including two portfolio managers, left George Soros massive $26 billion investment office this week, The Post has learned.One manager exited to start his own fund with money seeded from Soros, sources told The Post.The other left after posting lackluster returns, the sources said.Seven others, said to be back-office workers, were let go, sources said.In addition, three analysts who worked with one of the departing managers may also leave by the end of the year if they dont find new roles, sources added.These moves and shuffles youre seeing are related to the fact that we hired a new CIO [Dawn Fitzpatrick] in April, and this is the normal course of reshuffling, Michael Vachon, a spokesman for Soros Fund Management, told The Post.The roughly 300-person fund has hired five new portfolio managers and three traders this year, and is looking to increase the assets managed internally, he added.
iHeartMedia woos creditors with 50-50 deal:::::Radio and billboard giant iHeartMedia said on Thursday it offered creditors a new restructuring deal but the two sides remain far apart, sources said.Suffering under a staggering $20 billion pile of debt, iHeart, whose stable of radio stations includes Z100 and 103.5 KTU in New York, is racing to restructure its debt as it could run out of cash in the first half of 2018, sources said.If iHeartMedia, which is owned by Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners, cant reach a deal with creditors, it could be forced into Chapter 11.One person close to the talks said, with the current proposal not being well received, there is a 75 percent chance of a court-supervised restructuring.In the most recent proposal, money-losing iHeart offered creditors a near 50-50 ownership split in an out-of-court restructuring but allowed the PE owners to recoup more than $3 billion, including equity and bonds.Three months ago, the PE firms offer would have allowed them to recoup about half that much through a prepack Chaper 11, one source said.Were back at square one, the source noted.Meanwhile, iHearts biggest creditor, mutual fund Franklin Resources, which owns about $2.3 billion of its $20 billion in debt, is offering the private equity firms about a $300 million recovery, the source said.In a bankruptcy, the PE firms will likely be wiped out, the source said.None of the sides have anything responsible to say, the source said.Franklin believes it will get almost a full recovery in a bankruptcy, so its not desperate to settle, the source said.Reached for reaction, iHeart declined comment.
Twitter may turn a quarterly profit for the first time ever:::::Twitter got Wall Street buzzing as it said it could turn a quarterly profit for the first time ever despite admitting it has been overstating monthly user numbers for the past three years.see also Twitter admits what everyone already knew Twitter on Thursday said it had overstated the number of...The social network has never had a profitable quarter based on generally accepted accounting principles, but it said Thursday it will likely be GAAP profitable in the fourth quarter if it reaches the high end of its own estimates.The news sent Twitters stock soaring 18 percent, to $20.31.The prospect of a first-time profit made Twitters reveal that it had exaggerated the size of its user base easier to swallow.Despite adding 4 million users this quarter, Twitters user base grew by only 2 million, as the company had to revise previous estimates.Any growth was welcome, however, as the company reported zero new users added during the previous quarter.Twitter said the error in past user estimates was caused when it wrongly counted people who logged into applications associated with the companys Fabric software platform, which Twitter sold this year to Alphabet Inc.s Google.The San Francisco-based company headed by Jack Dorsey reported it has 330 million monthly active users in the quarter ended on Sept. 30.The growth was helped by greater use of e-mail and push notifications to point people toward tweets they want to read.Twitter has stepped up efforts to keep people hooked through live-streaming deals, including broadcasts of concerts, professional golfing events and news programs.Last month, Twitter began a test of tweets that are as long as 280 characters, double the existing cap, to allow people to better express themselves.The company is diversifying its revenue further beyond advertising.Revenue from data licensing and other sources was $87 million in the third quarter, up 22 percent from a year earlier, Twitter said, adding that it signed a significant number of new enterprise deals in the quarter.The social network reported third-quarter revenue of $590 million, beating the analyst consensus of $587 million, but down 4 percent from last years $616 million.
GE was kept in the dark about Immelt's use of a shadow jet: WSJ:::::The use of a spare business jet by former General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt was kept from board members until just this month, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday a practice that reportedly drew internal scrutiny several years ago and that Immelt himself claims he didn't know about.The Journal reported that the company had curbed the backup jet's use in mid-2014, adding that its use was in fact limited to isolated locations that involved potentially risky travel.However, he board members were previously unaware, several sources told the WSJ.The situation came to light earlier this month, after The Journal reported that Immelt, who was at the helm of GE for nearly 20 years before being stepping down recently, sometimes utilized a backup plane to follow his regular corporate jet on several trips around the world.However, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC a couple of weeks ago that version was an exaggeration of Immelt's travel practices.These people told CNBC it was not a regular practice to fly, or even keep on standby, multiple planes at the same time.The sources said a second plane was kept on standby on the ground in certain locations while Immelt was visiting for security purposes, or in case his GE-owned plane had mechanical issues.Last week, Immelt told The Journal that he was unaware of the backup jet's use."This is not a practice I would have allowed," he said in an emailed statement to the publication.Representatives for GE did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.--CNBC's Morgan Brennan and Michael Sheetz contributed to this article.The Journal's full story can be found on its website.
Tropical storm warnings issued for western Cuba, northwestern Bahamas:::::Tropical storm warnings have been issued for western Cuba and northwestern Bahamas, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Friday, as an area of low pressure over the northwest Caribbean Sea is expected to strengthen into a tropical cyclone.The system is about 415 miles (670 km) south southwest of Havana, Cuba with maximum sustained winds of 40 miles per hour (65 km/hour), the Miami-based weather forecaster said.A tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours, according to the NHC's website.
Apple investors don't need to worry about a long wait for the iPhone X, analyst says:::::iPhone X pre-orders sell out in minutes.Now what?5:13 PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 | 02:29 Apple fans may be miffed about the supply chain delays hitting the much-anticipated new iPhone X, but Apple investors don't have much to worry about, according to a Wall Street analyst."It's certainly better than the alternative," meaning lower demand, Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at KeyBanc, told CNBC's Power Lunch on Friday.Pre-orders for Apple's flagship new mobile device began overnight, and the company said demand was "off the charts."For many people who pre-order the phones, however, that heavy interest means the $1,000 phone won't ship until at least December.One analyst said Apple had at most 3 million devices on hand, despite selling as many as 13 million iPhones in the opening weekend of the iPhone 6S.That shouldn't be a problem for Apple shares, however.Hargreaves said that if revenue misses because of supply, "that's something that investors would largely look through."Apple customers will be able to pick up the 10th anniversary Apple phone in stores starting Nov. 3."We're working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible," Apple told CNBC.Apple shares rose more than 3.5 percent late Friday afternoon, at $162.99.The stock is up more than 40 percent so far this year.
Rising home prices, stagnant wages burden home buyers:::::Home ownership remains elusive for many Americans a decade after the collapse of the real estate market sent the U.S. economy into a tailspin.More than one-third of Americans ages 18 to 34 said they are likely to opt out of home ownership over the next decade, according to an annual survey conducted by the U.K.-based consumer credit reporting agency Experian.About a quarter of Americans of any age also said they were likely to opt out of home ownership in that period.The number of Americans who said they are likely to opt out of homeownership increased 8 percentage points in this year's survey, compared to 2016.More from Smart Investing: Bitcoin too risky for "serious" investing, say advisors Millennials lack confidence to invest: Bank executive What investors should do before market gets gored The price of buying a home has accelerated since about 2011, after tanking in the wake of the 2007 financial crisis.The median home price last month was about $320,000, according to government data, more than 20 percent higher than the pre-crisis peak set in March 2007.Meanwhile, real wages have grown less than 10 percent in that period, even for those employed full time."There's a mismatch," said Lawrence Yun, the chief economist at the National Association of Realtors."Even over the last five years, home prices have easily exceeded income and wage growth."Yun was not involved in the Experian survey.
Opponents of marijuana legalization warned of pot-laced Halloween candy. It never happened.:::::After Colorado legalized marijuana in 2012 and began sales in 2014, opponents warned of a spooky but unwanted outcome that Halloween: marijuana-laced candy.As opponents put it at the time, deviants would take advantage of the state's lax cannabis laws to give trick-or-treaters pot-laced candy without their knowledge.USA Today reported in 2014, "Marijuana-infused candy raises Colo. Halloween concerns."Denver police put out a video telling parents how to watch out for marijuana-laced candy.Anti-legalization activist Kevin Sabet echoed the concerns, tweeting a news story about marijuana-laced candy in Maryland (though law enforcement said there was no evidence the candy was destined for trick-or-treaters).So here's the good news: This never happened.Not even once, based on the available evidence.More from Vox: There's less than meets the eye to the Trump stock rally This is the nightmare scenario for the Children's Health Insurance Program Nurses returning from Puerto Rico accuse the federal government of leaving people to die I reviewed media reports surrounding Halloween and contacted police departments, hospital networks, and poison centers in Colorado and Washington state, the first two states to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012, to see if there had been any incidents of someone slipping marijuana candy to a trick-or-treater.None of them were aware of any such cases.This response, from the Denver Police Department, was standard: "We are not aware of any cases of children ingesting marijuana candy during Halloween season."This isn't a scientific study, given that there is simply no comprehensive data available for this kind of thing.But it shows that at the very least, initial fears about pot candy were overwrought.To some extent, this shouldn't be surprising.The truth is that scares of dangerous or otherwise contaminated candy, despite playing a prominent role in American culture, are completely unfounded.As Joel Best, the nation's top (and perhaps only) researcher on Halloween candy contamination, told me, "I've done research, and I can't find any evidence that any child has been killed or seriously hurt by any candy picked up in the course of trick-or-treating.My view is this is overblown.You can't prove a negative, but it seems unlikely."
Extent of VW emissions cheating reportedly discussed earlier than known:::::Volkswagen engineers told top managers that diesel emissions manipulations went far beyond issues in the United States two days before the carmaker made a public announcement to that effect in 2015, Der Spiegel reported Friday.Volkswagen (VW) admitted on September 20, 2015, to installing secret software in hundreds of thousands of U.S. diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and make them appear cleaner than they were on the road.The news wiped billions of euros off its market value, but its stock price took another hit when it said two days later, on September 22, 2015, that the issue affected not only vehicles in the United States but rather around 11 million cars worldwide.German securities law requires firms to publish any market sensitive news in a timely fashion.A probe by German prosecutors includes investigating whether VW disclosed the possible financial damage to its investors promptly.VW said in a statement it believed its management fulfilled its obligations under German disclosure rules.It declined to comment further, citing the prosecutors' ongoing investigation.Der Spiegel said, without citing sources, that former Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn and finance chief Hans Dieter Poetsch were told by engineers in a meeting on September 20 that the emissions manipulation was a global issue.It said the participants of that meeting also discussed whether VW was obliged to inform the public under German disclosure rules.Winterkorn, who resigned shortly after the diesel scandal broke, has told a government committee that he informed Germany's Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt on September 21, a day before the public statement, that VW's problems were global.Der Spiegel quoted a document drawn up by VW's lawyers as saying the company did not have reliable numbers on the possible damage until the evening of September 21.
UK government: North Korea was behind the WannaCry cyber-attack that crippled health service:::::North Korea was behind a cyber-attack that derailed Britain's state-owned health service's IT systems, the U.K. government said Friday."I think we should perhaps remember that this attack, we believe quite strongly, that this came from a foreign state," U.K. Security Minister Ben Wallace told the BBC.Asked which foreign state he believed was involved, Wallace said: "North Korea was the state we believe was involved in this worldwide attack on our systems."Malicious software called "WannaCry" targeted a number of businesses, government entities and the U.K.'s National Health Service (NHS) earlier this year.A form of "ransomware", the software blocked access to a user's computer until a sum of money was paid to the attacker.Asked how sure he was that North Korea was the actor behind the cyber-attack, Wallace said: "We can be sure as possible.I can't obviously go into the detail of intelligence, but it is widely believed in the (intelligence) community and across a number of countries that North Korea had taken this role."Wallace called on Western nations to develop a "doctrine of deterrent," similar to nuclear deterrent strategy, to prevent further cyber-attacks."On a weekly basis, our systems are under attack from serious organized criminals using malware from abroad or even at home," he said.
Wal-Mart adds another private-label grocery line:::::Wal-Mart may already be a giant, but it still has big ambitions for its food aisles.The big-box retailer announced Friday the addition of another private-label, called Sam's Choice Italia.Under the nameplate, Wal-Mart will initially roll out 40 items, including Italian boxed dinners, gnocchi, risotto, sauces and salad dressings.The products can be purchased in stores and online."Sam's Choice Italia is just the latest example of how Walmart is continuing to improve and innovate our Private Brand offerings while staying true to quality and everyday low prices," Jack Pestello, senior vice president of the Private Brands division in the U.S., said in a statement.At an investor conference earlier this year, Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon discussed the retailer's plans to expand its private-label lines, such as Great Value.McMillon said the company would put an even bigger emphasis on those brands."Having a private brand from a margin mix point of view has always been important, but it is even more important now," he told investors.For grocery retailers, private-label options offer the opportunity to make up for dollars that are lost because profit margins are generally thin in the supermarket business.Rivals including Kroger, Target, Aldi, Lidl, Costco, Whole Foods and even Amazon are beefing up their private-label food lines.Kroger has Simple Truth, for example.Amazon has a line of trail mixes and coffee, called Happy Belly.Target's popular in-house line is Market Pantry, and Costco has Kirkland Signature.A recent study by consumer packaged goods market research firm IRI found that shoppers young and old are still turning to private-label options in grocery stores, even in a more stable economy.Two-thirds of consumers plan to purchase private-label items more frequently in the coming six months, according to IRI's survey, which were released Wednesday.Just this month, Wal-Mart's Jet.com launched a private-label business called Uniquely J.With Jet, Wal-Mart is able to cater to a greater urban millennial market than it is with Sam's Club, for example, which competes with Costco.Wal-Mart's overarching Sam's Choice moniker was initially introduced in the early '90s as Sam's American Choice, named after founder Sam Walton.The brand was revamped in 2013 to focus more on premium items with organic ingredients.
Why taking care of the ‘human capital’ of your employees is vital: Arianna Huffington:::::Taking care of well-being in the workplace is becoming an "incredibly important investment" to companies, to the point where it's likely to be as vital as investing in technology, media mogul Arianna Huffington said Thursday.The start-up that Huffington founded, Thrive Global, is dedicated to providing strategies and tools to enhance well-being, purpose and performance for individuals and businesses.In a recent Paychex report that surveyed over 2,000 U.S. full-time employees, it was revealed how prominent stress actually is in the workplace.More than 60 percent of participants stated that, on average, they were feeling levels of stress at least three days a week highlighting that it is an issue that needs to be taken seriously in the workplace.In fact, according to Huffington, the world is currently facing an "epidemic" of stress and burnout."What we are finding at the moment is we are dealing with an epidemic of stress and burnout everywhere and it's affecting all outcomes," Arianna Huffington, Thrive Global's founder and CEO, said at a CNBC-hosted panel.
Activist investors torpedo Clariant, Huntsman $20 billion merger:::::Swiss specialty chemicals maker Clariant and U.S. group Huntsman abandoned their $20 billion merger deal on Friday, notching a win for activist investors who fought against the deal for months on the grounds it would destroy shareholder value.White Tale, the investment vehicle of hedge fund manager Keith Meister and New York City-based fund 40 North, had increased its Clariant stake to more than 20 percent, Reuters reported on Thursday ahead of the announcement of the tie-up being dropped.White Tale's rising stake, coupled with other Clariant shareholders who came out against the deal, left the Swiss company doubtful of mustering the two-thirds support necessary for the merger to go through.The successful revolt comes amid a wave of investor activism in Switzerland, where Credit Suisse is under attack and Nestle also faces demands for change.Chief Executive Hariolf Kottmann said Clariant still had options to explore after further talks with White Tale."To do a merger of equals ... is one option, to make a large transformational transaction is another option, to continue to stand alone is a third option," Kottmann told reporters on a call where he vowed to remain CEO."There are four or five of these options, and they have all pros and cons."
UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti not hot on cryptocurrency, but likes blockchain:::::Cryptocurrencies still need to be "defined" but the technology behind them will be pivotal in transforming the financial services, the chief executive of Swiss lender UBS said Friday.Sergio Ermotti told CNBC that while the bank has seen success in its trade finance blockchain platform, he was "not necessarily" a believer in cryptocurrencies.When asked whether he liked virtual currencies, he said: "Not necessarily cryptocurrencies, I think that needs to be defined, but I believe there is a future for blockchain technology, and technology will play a big role in changing and reshaping our industry."Also known as distributed ledger technology, blockchain allows data to be stored across a network of computers around the world rather than at one single location.UBS has been involved in a blockchain project called Batavia with IBM and other banks, including Commerzbank and Bank of Montreal."Our strategy there is very simple.We try to initiate and get as many other financial institutions and clients into teams like trade finance with other banks and IBM was a successful venture," Ermotti said.Ermotti added that the technology would form an ecosystem that enables financial institutions to "operate and transact at a cheaper, more efficient level."
Swiss bank UBS posts 14% rise in net profit, but misses estimates:::::Asia is a very important part of our business model: UBS CEO 2:25 AM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 | 04:03 The Swiss bank UBS reported a net income below market expectations, but 14 percent higher than the same period last year.The number is nonetheless above the bank's own consensus report, which polls more analysts than Thomson Reuters, which indicated a net income of 0.897 billion Swiss francs.Here are the key metrics: Net income: 0.9 billion Swiss francs vs 1.043 billion Swiss francs, expected by Thomson Reuters Earnings per share: 0.31 Swiss francs vs 0.35 Swiss francs, expected by Thomson Reuters Revenue: 7.145 billion Swiss francs vs 7.060 billion, expected by Thomson Reuters UBS said it saw good results across its business divisions with Asia Pacific as an important driver of growth.
Growth in China's industrial profits accelerates to over 27% in September:::::Profits earned by China's industrial firms in September surged 27.7 percent from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said on Friday, accelerating from a 24 percent rise in August.Industrial profits increased 22.8 percent in the first nine months of 2017 from the same period last year, versus a 21.6 percent rise in January-August.China's long-ailing industrial sector has seen a sharp turnaround this year as a building boom boosts demand and factory-gate prices, producing the strongest profits in years and giving them more room to start tackling a mountain of debt.Total profits in September rose to 662.18 billion yuan, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on its website.The data covers large companies with annual revenue of more than 20 million yuan from their main operations.
Wynn CEO: Las Vegas massacre hasn't measurably hurt business:::::Wynn Resorts chief Steve Wynn insisted Thursday the mass shooting in Las Vegas didn't measurably hurt business for the company's Las Vegas operations.In fact, the CEO said the company's Las Vegas business turned in its "best third quarter in its existence, since 2005.And we're particularly happy because our non-casino revenue was so strong."The casino company beat estimates on total revenue and on the earnings per share in the quarter.During the company's earnings call, the CEO commented on trends following the Oct. 1 massacre that killed 58 people and injured hundreds of others.According to Wynn, one of the groups that canceled after the shooting later re-booked for a different date.He added, "So if you're going to ask us what did the tragedy at Mandalay have on us?None that we can measure."Wynn said the casino giant has been proactive when it comes to security, pointing out the company invested "close to $6 million or $7 million a year, beyond our normal security."The CEO said the company had a series of consultations about two years ago with security firms and experts "to harden this as a target.""I believe that the self-consciousness about security has been continuous with all of the operators in Las Vegas for some time," Wynn said."I know what we did here because as one of my competitors described it, 'Wynn is paranoid.'"Wynn also spoke about Stephen Paddock, the man police say shot people from his hotel room at the Mandalay Bay."He just had a screw loose and snapped or something," said Wynn, adding that "this particular fella that did the shooting at Mandalay" was a customer at the Wynn property since 2006."We first pick him up on our records as a typical slot player with a modest credit limit of $50,000," Wynn said."I had the chance to interview the people in the high-limit slot area.He was a loser over the six, seven, eight years here."At the same time, Wynn said the man "never owed any money" at the casino, but also "didn't meet the profile of a problem gambler, anything like that.He was a very controlled person."Meantime, Wynn said the company is preparing to embark on an ambitious expansion in Las Vegas."I'm feeling really great about Las Vegas for the next 20 years," he said."My board of directors is committed to maximizing the non-casino touristic profile of this complex known as Wynn in the next five years.We'll be in construction continually."The expansion in Las Vegas includes a "full-scale destination hotel" off the Strip along with convention space and a lake attraction.Construction of new buildings is slated to begin Jan. 3."We'll be demolishing the north villas where the 1,500-room high-rise is going to go," he said.Wynn is doing much of the development on land that is currently a large golf course the company owns.The project includes an irregular-shaped lake surrounded by a boardwalk that is a mile long.
Intel earnings Q3 2017:::::Intel raised its full-year outlook and reported quarterly earnings that easily topped analysts' expectations on Thursday.Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: Adjusted EPS: $1.01 vs. 80 cents expected, according to Thomson Reuters Overall revenue: $16.15 billion vs. $15.73 billion expected, according to Thomson Reuters Client computing revenue: $8.86 billion vs. $8.68 billion expected, according to StreetAccount Data center revenue: $4.88 billion vs. $4.79 billion expected, according to StreetAccount Intel said it now expects full-year earnings of $3.25 per share on revenue of $62 billion.That's up from its previous forecast for earnings of $3.00 per share on $61.3 billion in revenue.The company reported net income of $4.52 billion.That figure represent's 34 percent year-over-year growth.In the year-ago quarter, Intel reported adjusted earnings of 80 cents a share on $15.78 billion in revenue.Shares of Intel gained more than 1 percent in after-hours trade.The stock has been on a tear this year, gaining 14 percent as of its Thursday close.During the normal session, shares of Intel set a fresh 52-week intraday high of $41.58.While the client computing group still brings in the lion's share of overall revenue, Intel has been shifting its focus away from the personal computer market amid declining PC shipments.The segment reported better-than-expected revenue of $8.86 billion, or roughly flat year-over-year.The company has instead highlighted its opportunities in new markets such as artificial intelligence and cloud infrastructure.Earlier this month, Intel said it is collaborating with Facebook to develop artificial intelligence chips for data centers.This is breaking news.Please check back for updates.
Aetna shares jump 12% after CVS Health offers to buy big health insurer for $200 or more per share:::::CVS-Aetna deal is a reflection of the larger health care market: RBC Capital's Frank Morgan 8:12 AM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 | 02:39 Pharmacy behemoth CVS Health is in talks to buy Aetna, sources familiar said, in a surprising deal that would amount to the biggest ever for the health insurance industry.Aetna shares soared by a much as 12 percent Thursday when news of the deal first broke.CVS Health has proposed to pay more than $200 per share for Aetna, the sources familiar confirmed to CNBC.Aetna, which as of Thursday had a market value of $53 billion, was trading at about $175 per share after news.CVS Health shares were down nearly 3 percent for the day and continued lower in premarket trading Friday.In addition to a chain of retail pharmacies, CVS Health also operates the Caremark pharmacy benefit manager, which has more than 75 million plan members.Asked about the potential deal, an Aetna spokesman told CNBC, "We don't comment on rumor or speculation."A spokesman for CVS Health said, "As a matter of policy we don't comment on market rumors such as this."The Wall Street Journal first reported the proposed acquisition.Aetna in February abandoned an effort to merge with another large health insurer, Humana, after that $34 billion deal was blocked on antitrust grounds by a federal judge.
Former Dallas Fed CEO: Why would Yellen want to stay?:::::Former Dallas Fed president weighs in on the three Fed chair frontrunners 7:54 PM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 | 04:37 With President Donald Trump reportedly changing his mind "every day" about who he will appoint to chair the Federal Reserve, many are doubting whether Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen is likely to stay on for a second term.One former Dallas Federal Reserve CEO said she should not even want the appointment."If I could wear her flats, I would be saying to myself, 'Do I want to stay?'"Richard Fisher said Thursday.Fisher was president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas from 2005 to 2015."There's no upside for Janet to stay," he said."She can go anywhere she wants.She can be chancellor of any university, be a professor anywhere, be on any boards," he said.Fisher said that in his mind, Yellen has done a good job steering the central bank.But as Fed Governor Jerome "Jay" Powell and Stanford economist John Taylor seem to be closing in on the job, Fisher said there's little in it for Yellen.Fisher was speaking on CNBC's Power Lunch.Fisher's remarks come as Trump is struggling with members of his own party over the crucial appointment.Three House Republicans have called on the president not to reappoint Yellen when her term expires in February.It's unclear when Trump will announce his decision, though he has previously indicated it could beas soon as Nov. 3.Trump has reportedly met with Yellen multiple times to interview her for the position."I also met with Janet Yellen, who I like a lot, I really like her a lot," he's said.Fisher also commented on which Fed chair he thought would be best for the stock market.The appointment of Taylor or Powell would be equally likely to juice stock returns, he said.
Amazon HQ2: Not Newark, as per the Uber test:::::On Facebook, a friend who grew up in Memphis suggested that city for Amazon HQ2.This was in response to The New York Times' analysis saying HQ2 would go to Denver.Memphis isn't an obvious choice, and I don't know how it lines up with the official criteria.So how can one quickly weigh if Memphis, or any other location, would be a good choice for Amazon?Amazon is a company where it is always "Day 1".Among other things, that means it tends to pursue disruptive ideas, such as using drones for deliveries.Amazon would want HQ2 to be in a location that is supportive of a Day 1 company, if not outright still in Day 1 itself.What I needed was a simple test for Day 1 type disruptions, and the last decade presented us with a perfect one: Ride sharing, and more specifically Uber.Uber has been disruptive in applying technology to an urban transportation system (taxis) that hasn't changed significantly in almost a century, and has deeply entrenched interests.Moreover, that system had become highly regulated with substantial public bureaucracies and government revenue streams linked to them.So wherever Uber (or Lyft) went, it was going against "the system" and friction was to be expected.What you could measure, very quickly thanks to Google and Bing, was just how much friction (or support) Uber ran into with local government.So I did a search on Memphis and Uber and discovered that in 2013 the city of Memphis had sent its police force to arrest Uber drivers.That seemed like a pretty extreme case of being unfriendly to Day 1 type disruptions, and I pointed that out to my friend.He pointed out this was 2013 -- four years ago -- so I did a search on Denver and Uber and discovered that in 2013 the Colorado Legislature became the first in the country to explicitly legalize ride-sharing.What Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper said at the time was, "Colorado is once again in the vanguard in promoting innovation and competition while protecting consumers and public safety."And when there was some friction in the city of Denver after that, the Police Chief acted quickly to resolve it.Which makes more sense to locate the headquarters of a Day 1 company in: A place that sent the police to arrest Uber drivers or one that acted quickly to accept and encourage the disruption?So let's get back to Newark.There are many reasons I could think of for picking Newark as HQ2.In particular the close proximity to New York City and all its benefits, with much better housing costs.Making the reverse commute from Manhattan to nearby New Jersey cities has even become reasonably common in the last 20 years.The incentives being offered are nice, but again they are a short-term benefit in a long-term play.So I applied the Uber test to Newark, and it failed miserably.Newark was still trying to force Uber into their taxi regulatory scheme as recently as 2016, banning them from Newark Airport and train station in February and planning to enact further regulation in April.Uber was planning to abandon the city when a last minute deal was reached.Compare what Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said about Uber "Just because they have a great idea, doesn't mean they have an exemption from rules and regulations that have been in existence for decades," with the earlier quote from Colorado Governor Hickenlooper.I was particularly caught by the "rules and regulations that have been in existence for decades" part.That doesn't read like a Day 1 supportive location to me.It is quite possible that those words will come back to haunt Mayor Baraka when Amazon is evaluating the HQ2 proposals.The Uber test isn't perfect for a couple of reasons.One is that pretty much any locality that regulates taxis and limousines will try to put some regulatory regime around ride sharing.The other is that Uber itself has valued confrontation with local governments and agencies over reaching an accommodation, and that in some cases has raised the heat significantly.For example, I know of airports where Lyft was able to pick up months before Uber, because they negotiated a deal while Uber was still trying to fight the local airport authority.So the Uber test isn't black and white, it is varying shades of grey.But compare the light grey of Denver to the very dark grey of Newark and it, at the very least, gives an indication of which city would be more accommodating to a company where it is always Day 1.This post was originally published on Berenson's blog on Oct. 17.Hal Berenson is President of True Mountain Group, LLC which provides technology and management consulting.He previously worked at Amazon Web Services and Microsoft.
Morningstar fires back at report over ratings; shares surge:::::Morningstar fired back at The Wall Street Journal after the business newspaper published a 4,000-word takedown of the Chicago, Illinois-based company's mutual fund ratings system.In an article titled "Setting the Record Straight on Our Fund Ratings," Jeffrey Ptak wrote that the Journal's findings were "selectively disclosed" and that "highly rated funds were far more likely to outperform low-rated funds."A spokesperson for Morningstar also said Thursday that the company had contacted the Journal to request corrections to "numerous points that mischaracterize our business."Ptak is the head of global manager research for Morningstar, according to his company bio.The Journal's story raised serious questions about the effectiveness of Morningstar's coveted rating system.The paper examined the performance of thousands of funds that the company reviewed over nearly 15 years and found that funds the company rated highly failed to deliver."We strongly disagree with the interpretations that they drew," Ptak said on CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Thursday afternoon.Shares of 'MORN' fell 4.6 percent to a close of $82.75 Wednesday on the news, the biggest loss in two years.The stock came roaring back on Thursday, rising more than 5 percent.
Nike will open 'pant studios' for women, sending Lululemon shares lower:::::Nike could be about to hit Lululemon where it hurts.The Oregon-based sporting goods company is preparing to open "pant studios" in 5,000 of its stores, according to supplemental documents handed out at Nike's investor day."We are #1 globally in the bottoms market, but we aren't satisfied, so we talked with women around the world and heard a common thememake product by activity," Nike wrote."Our Pant Studio features a range of new silhouettes because it's not only about tights anymore."Bloomberg first reported on the news Thursday.The studios will feature a curated assortment of women's wear, like yoga pants items Trevor Edwards, president of the Nike brand, highlighted during his latest presentation to investors and analysts.The spaces are slated to open on Nov. 1, right ahead of the holidays, and can also be shopped through Nike.com."This $7 billion business will continue to be fueled by more women engaging in sport, wellness and activity," Edwards said Wednesday about Nike's ambitions."Our growth in our women's business is outpacing our men's business, and it will continue to do so."Shares of Lululemon fell about 2 percent Thursday afternoon on the news, closing the day down less than 1 percent.This isn't the first time Lululemon has taken a hit from competitors lately.Just earlier this month, it was reported that Amazon is getting into sportswear and plans to create its own private-label lines.The e-commerce giant has reportedly teamed up with companies that manufacture clothes for Nike, Lululemon and Under Armour.Vancouver-based Lululemon has 421 stores open today throughout the U.S. and Canada.In June, the athletic apparel maker known for its yoga pants unveiled plans to close most of its unprofitable Ivivva girls stores, and to focus investments online instead.On its latest quarterly earnings conference call, Lululemon management discussed plans to lure more male shoppers to the brand.Lululemon competes in a "very different playground" than Amazon, Chief Executive Laurent Potdevin told CNBC in September.Lululemon is also aiming to grow its brand penetration overseas.
American Eagle to open redesigned store where you can 'curate' your jeans and do your laundry:::::Teen apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters is opening a prototype store that it hopes will entice younger shoppers to stay longer by customizing their jeans and doing their laundry there.The company announced this week that its first AE Studio store will open Nov. 10 in New York's Union Square neighborhood."As we celebrate the success of the last four decades, we look ahead to create new brand experiences to inspire today's customer, and broaden our leadership in jeans," Chad Kessler, American Eagle's global brand president, said in a statement."AE Studio is a perfect example of our evolution where we invite customers to enjoy a unique brand experience, feel at home, and curate their distinct individual style."AE Studio will have a heavy focus on jeans, with a gallery for American Eagle's denim products on the first floor.There will also be a "Maker's Shop" on the jeans floor, where shoppers can create their own bespoke pair, personalized to their fit and style.Other additions include iPads in the dressing rooms to serve as "digital concierges."American Eagle said its own social media team will also operate an office in the store to be closer to shoppers and "keep their finger on the pulse of the brand."Looking to get shoppers to stick around longer, American Eagle is putting a wall of washers and dryers in the AE Studio, where customers like students can do their laundry.Shoppers can "hang out with friends or study in the studio bar and seating area," the company said."The integration of services like laundry and study spaces may seem a little wacky, but it's exactly the type of thing that will drive footfall, especially among younger shoppers," GlobalData Retail managing director Neil Saunders said."That said, American Eagle will need to work hard to publicize and communicate this as it is an unusual facility to have and most shoppers would not expect it," Saunders added."The bottom line is that AEO is innovating and testing new things which puts it on the right side of the tracks as far as retail is concerned."American Eagle is one of many apparel brands seeking to keep the physical shopping experience exciting to win back shoppers from online merchants.Newer entrants to the U.S. fashion market, like H&M and Zara, have also managed to steal a share of sales.In August, the company reported upbeat second-quarter profit and revenue and a month later announced a new loyalty program, AEO Connected, that promises to draw shoppers in with more rewards.American Eagle has also found a bright spot in its Aerie nameplate, for women's intimate apparel.Comparable sales for Aerie jumped an impressive 26 percent in the second quarter.
The Fed chair contest is Trump's version of 'The Bachelor':::::Like pretty much every big personnel call in this White House, President Donald Trump has turned his selection of a Federal Reserve chair into a version of "The Bachelor" with everyone feverishly guessing who will get the role of leading the world's most important central bank.Trump has gone so far as to solicit advice from Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs in a televised interview."Tell me who your preference is," Trump asked Dobbs."I'd love to hear it.You could even cut it out if you want.You don't have to I would love to hear you.I only want that from people I respect."Dobbs went on to suggest keeping Janet Yellen, something that I'm told is at least somewhat attractive to Trump given that markets love the current chair and would likely react favorably to her status quo renomination.But a source who talks to the president regularly about the Fed and other economic matters tells me that while Trump does like Yellen, he is not going to renominate her because he wants to put his own mark on the central bank something the president also suggested to Dobbs.Just after this conversation, another senior source close to the Fed nomination process cautioned me not to rule Yellen or anyone else out."He changes his mind about it every day," this person said.But a consensus among people close to the process has emerged that the race is likely down to either current Fed Governor Jerome "Jay" Powell or Stanford economist John Taylor.Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh sparked increasing speculation after a meeting last week with Vice President Mike Pence.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is pushing against Warsh and in favor of Powell, whom he got to know in recent months working on financial reform issues.National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn has been mostly out of the running for weeks now both because of his clash with Trump over the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and because the president wants the former Goldman Sachs president to keep working on the high-stakes tax cut push.An announcement on the Fed chair pick could come any day, but sources close to the matter say it will most likely happen next week before the president departs for a 12-day trip to Asia.Even that is not assured, however.If Trump can't make up his mind, the announcement could wait until he gets back.The Senate needs to have hearings before the Banking Committee and a full vote prior to Yellen's term expiring on Feb. 3.Ideally, the process of sending up the next nominee would start soon.The Senate can move quickly when it wants to it's basically up to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell so next week is really not a hard deadline for the president.The arguments favoring a Powell chairmanship include that it would allow Trump to install his own pick while also likely continuing the very modest approach to rate normalization and balance sheet drawdown initiated by the Yellen Fed.Taylor, while much more beloved by conservatives on the Hill and places like The Wall Street Journal editorial board, would present at least something more of a hawkish risk that might spark jitters on Wall Street.Some conservatives on Capitol Hill have led a behind-the-scenes campaign against Powell and in favor of Taylor or Warsh.But it's not clear that those efforts will produce results, especially given that Trump generally does whatever he wants with limited regard for what Republicans in Congress say.And Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., is among the few on record arguing against Powell.Taylor won a straw poll when Trump met with Senate Republicans earlier this week and quizzed them on their Fed preference, but there is very little chance many would vote "no" if Trump actually sends up a Powell nomination.And Powell is a former banker rather than a wonky economist like Taylor, a style Trump tends to prefer in his nominees.So the betting line remains on Powell for chair and perhaps Taylor for vice chair, if he is willing.Heavy caveats continue to apply.Trump could change his mind at the last minute and turn the process on its head, possibly even electing to simply stick with Yellen, though that remains unlikely.The rose is still up for grabs.Ben White is Politico's chief economic correspondent and a CNBC contributor.He also authors the daily tip sheet Politico Morning Money [politico.com/morningmoney].Follow him on Twitter @morningmoneyben.
Arianna Huffington: Why the Weinstein scandal is a ‘catalyst for dramatic changes’:::::Arianna Huffington on sexual harassment in the business world 5:00 AM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 | 01:00 The recent flood of sexual harassment allegations made against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has marked a "catalyst" for dramatic changes, media mogul Arianna Huffington has told CNBC."Now, whatever needs to come out into the light, will come out into the light," the founder and CEO of Thrive Global told CNBC on Thursday, when asked about the recent developments surrounding the Weinstein scandal.Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative, a summit held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Huffington said that living in an increasingly digital world has made it more difficult for individuals and companies to hide."Obviously, a lot is coming into the light, as right now, we're living through this period where especially because of social media it's very hard for companies and CEOs to hide behind amazing advertising and a public relations team."More from Global Investing Hot Spots: Hollywood super-agent calls Weinstein's behavior 'disgusting' Uber board member Arianna Huffington still 'optimistic' SoftBank mega-deal will happen 'Fearless Girl' CEO, after discrimination fine, says we're committed to 'equal pay for equal work' In early October, The New York Times published an investigation uncovering sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein, a co-founder of both Miramax and The Weinstein Company.In the initial report, two company officials told the Times that Weinstein had reached at least eight settlements with women over alleged harassment.Subsequent reports from dozens of women accusing Weinstein of sexual harassment and/or assault have since emerged via media outlets worldwide, and the producer was fired by the board of his namesake company.Weinstein has repeatedly denied accusations of non-consensual sex.
Rep: Budget bill is a ‘gimmick’ but I voted for it anyway-commentary:::::"I plan to vote in support of the Senate-passed budget.Not because it's the right thing to do fiscally, but because it's the Washington gimmick needed to get tax reform done.Yes, another D.C.gimmick."And while I'm relieved that we can finally move ahead with delivering tax reform for the American people, the fact that we are yet again failing to address our nation's budget and debt crisis is deeply troubling.The simple fact is that we are on an unsustainable fiscal path.Our mandatory spending now represents 70 percent of federal spending and by 2026 will have doubled compared to 2013.Yet once again Washington will shirk its responsibility to pass and actually implement a responsible budget.As a member of the House Budget Committee, we spent months putting together a budget that balanced over the next ten years and that would make real strides in addressing mandatory spending.I fought for 400 plus billion mandatory spending cuts and agreed to 200 billion -- only to see it get reduced to zero in the Senate budget.Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the Senate chose to take an easier path and decided not to include mandatory spending reforms in their budgetagain ignoring the true drivers of our over $20 trillion national debt.God help our children and future generations of Americans as we continue to bury them in unsustainable debt.I just celebrated my first child's wedding this past weekend and wondered: how my future grandchildren will thrive under the reign of Chinese dollars?How will we repair our bridges?How will we provide for our seniors?How will we remain competitive with the world and fund our military?Yet having said that, this week I voted in support of the Senate-passed budget.Not because it's the right thing to do fiscally, but because it's the Washington gimmick needed to get tax reform done.Yes, another D.C. gimmick.We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to pass tax reform in order to raise wages for hard working Americans, simplify the tax code, and make our businesses more competitive.But make no mistake, when it comes putting our nation on a responsible and sustainable fiscal trajectory, this 'blueprint' is a stunt, not a solution.As wholeheartedly as I welcome the advancement of pro-growth tax reform, I just forcefully implore Congress to end its long and ugly history of budget gimmicks and finally address the true drivers of our country's crippling debtmandatory entitlement spending.Commentary by Congressman Jim Renacci (R-OH).He is serving his fourth term representing the 16th district of Ohio.Currently he serves on the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Budget Committee.Follow him on Twitter @RepJimRenacci.For more insight from CNBC contributors, follow @CNBCopinion on Twitter.
Deutsche Boerse CEO to step down amid insider trading probe:::::Deutsche Boerse's embattled chief executive Carsten Kengeter is stepping down amid continuing allegations of insider trading, the German exchange operator announced on Thursday.The decision came at an extraordinary meeting of the supervisory board.No successor was named, and Kengeter will stay on until there's a transition plan.Deutsche Boerse said that the resignation was "in order to allow the company to focus its energy back onto clients, business and growth and to avoid further burdens caused by the ongoing investigation".Kengeter and Deutsche Boerse have been dogged by an insider trading investigation since early this year.The probe stems from shares Kengeter bought in December 2015, just months before formal merger talks with London Stock Exchange were announced.The shares soared and investigators have been looking into whether Kengeter was already in merger talks before he bought his shares.The merger eventually failed.Kengeter and Deutsche Boerse have denied wrongdoing.Kengeter's position became more tenuous earlier this week when a Frankfurt court ruled against a settlement that would have helped him and Deutsche Boerse put the case behind them.The resignation means two top exchanges will be seeking new chiefs.Last week, Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange Group, said he would step down at the end of next year.Deutsche Boerse and LSE, which had sought to merge, are now competing for market share in the run-up to Britain's exit from the European Union.
Comcast CEO: NFL ratings are getting better but it's hard to grow audience with so many choices:::::Comcast CEO: NFL ratings are improving but it's hard to grow audience 10:16 AM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 | 01:32 NFL ratings are improving, but it's harder to grow an audience when consumers have so many choices, Comcast Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts told CNBC on Thursday."It's early in the season.We're down about 5 percent," said Roberts."That's a lot lower [decline] than people originally thought."Comcast airs NFL games on its NBC network Sunday nights and Thursday nights.NBC also has the Super Bowl this year.Each year gets more difficult for traditional media players to grow audiences as new platforms emerge, Roberts said."There are a lot more choices," he noted."The world has changed, and so does the NFL.And they'll have to look at their own business."According to an ESPN report, citing metrics from Nielsen, total viewership has fallen about 7.5 percent to an average of 15 million people through the first six weeks of the NFL season.President Donald Trump has claimed the NFL ratings decline is due to the controversy of players kneeling during the national anthem.The president has repeatedly criticized the protests, and said owners should fire players who don't stand.The anthem firestorm started last season when then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the anthem to protest the treatment of African-Americans in the United States.Despite the ratings declines, Roberts said the NFL has demonstrated it is "the best in sports at what they do" in delivering a quality experience to fans.Roberts appeared on "Squawk Box" after Comcast reported better-than-expected earnings but revenue that slightly missed estimates.Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.
House Republicans tell Trump not to pick Yellen as Fed Chair:::::Some House Republicans are calling on President Donald Trump not to reappoint Janet Yellen as Fed chair when her term expires in February.In a letter sent to the president, the legislators tell Trump that "new leadership" is needed at the central bank to push the economy forward."As general mistrust of government and public institutions continues to rise, we believe that new leadership at the Federal Reserve will help restore its reputation as a forward-thinking monetary institution instead of a slow growth regulator," said the letter, authored by Reps. Warren Davidson, Ted Budd and Alex Mooney.The letter comes as Trump nears the end of a selection process that has become convoluted and volatile in determining the next Fed chair.In recent days, Trump has indicated his decision likely is between Fed Governor Jerome "Jay" Powell and Stanford economist John Taylor.However, he also has indicated that Yellen remains in the mix.Trump has expressed pleasure at how well the stock market has performed while Yellen has led the Fed and has been complimentary of her leadership.The market has jumped since Trump won election last November, with the Dow industrials up more than 30 percent.The index is up about 45 percent since Yellen became Fed chair in February 2014.However, the GOP members insist the Fed has overstepped its bounds elsewhere thanks to the "virtually unlimited regulatory authority" over the nation's banking system.They cite the Fed's "radical monetary experiment" that has included the central bank balance sheet swelling to $4.5 trillion thanks to three rounds of bond buying it engaged in to lower interest rates and stimulate the flow of money to riskier assets like stocks."These actions have blurred the line between fiscal and monetary policy almost beyond recognition, facilitating the Obama Administration's trail of reckless spending and doing so at the borrowed time of an unsustainable national debt on the backs of the American taxpayer," the letter stated.Trump has said he expects to pick a new Fed chair before he leaves for his next foreign trip Nov. 3.
California begins 'historic cleanup' from fires but faces serious hurdles in rebuilding:::::As California begins cleaning up from this month's deadly wildfires, concerns are rising that the rebuilding could take years and will be hampered by shortages of contractors and labor.The governor has ordered the suspension of tough zoning, planning and other requirements to help the fire ravaged communities in Northern California bounce back faster.California, which is known for having some of the nation's strictest environmental and building regulations, also is encouraging local agencies to streamline paperwork to make the rebuilding go smoother.Regardless, some contractors in the affected region say a shortage of skilled labor that existed before the disaster could worsen, and they worry construction material costs will jump and shortages may create additional hurdles.Some firms are swamped with requests by homeowners, including people seeking original plans for their homes and asking for help rebuilding."Our phone is ringing off the hook," said longtime contractor David Leff, owner of Leff Construction Design/Build in Sebastopol, a Sonoma County town about 50 miles north of San Francisco."We're getting calls from people who we built homes for as long as 30 years ago."Leff added, "There are more burned homes than there are contractors in the county.Some builders are going to be gearing up as much as possible.The problem is we were all so busy before the fire, and there was a fairly significant labor shortage before the wildfires, that it's going to be even more difficult now."
The Weinstein ripple effect: Famous men accused of sexual harassment and assault:::::For nearly three decades, Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein faced allegations of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact, The New York Times reported on Oct. 5.More than three dozen women have since publicly accused the entertainment mogul of abuse."I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it," Weinstein told the Times.Spike network is also investigating reports of sexual harassment by Harvey Weinstein's brother, Bob Weinstein, against the female showrunner of a series produced by The Weinstein Co. that aired on the network.Weinstein's lawyer Bert Fields denied the allegations in a statement to Deadline.These allegations have set off a ripple effect, empowering people who say they also were victims to come forward with stories of abuse by people in power.Here are some of those accused:
ECB chief Draghi delivers speech on monetary policy decision:::::ECB did not discuss composition of quantitative easing, Draghi says 9:54 AM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 | 03:09 European Central Bank President Mario Draghi delivered a speech on the central bank's monetary policy decision Thursday.The ECB decided Thursday to cut the level of bonds it purchases every month, but extend the length of time that its stimulus program runs.Its purchases will fall to 30 billion euros ($35 billion) from 60 billion euros, starting in January.The central bank said it will extend its monetary stimulus program until at last September of next year.
Mark Warner: Tech Millionaire Who Became Tech’s Critic in Congress:::::This week, Mr. Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, will push for new answers.Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter are set to testify at congressional hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday about the election and the power of their platforms.Lawmakers are increasingly taking a critical tone with Silicon Valley, with Mr. Warner among the harshest.He has already pushed a bill requiring the companies to disclose who paid for digital political ads, the biggest legislative effort so far to regulate the companies.Mr. Warners position is a sharp reversal.Before entering politics, he built a fortune that at one time was estimated at around $200 million as a technology and telecommunications investor and executive.His political identity, first as governor of Virginia and then as a senator, has been wrapped in promises to bring 21st century jobs.He has a broad and close network of tech executives and investors.Photo Mr. Warner is emblematic of the shifting politics for technology.Mark didnt come to this point with the social media companies lightly, said Saxby Chambliss, a retired Republican senator from Georgia who regularly meets with Mr. Warner and the Intelligence Committee chairman, Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, a Republican, to discuss the Russia investigation.The reluctance of the technology companies to take seriously the investigation into Russian election meddling pushed Mr. Warner over the edge, Mr. Chambliss said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That is a poor attitude for American companies, Mr. Chambliss added.Mark will make sure this issue is highlighted because it needs to stop.Ahead of the hearings, Twitter and Facebook have scrambled to disarm lawmakers with announcements of voluntary changes to their advertising businesses.Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, for example, spent a couple days in Washington promising more disclosures.Twitter announced it would disclose who buys political ads on its site, and it blocked two Russia-based media organizations from purchasing advertisements.Twitter is taking an appropriate and welcome step, Representative Adam Schiff of California, the leading Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said last week.The companies say the internal investigations and answering lawmakers questions are a top priority.In their announcements on voluntary ad disclosures, Twitter and Facebook said their stricter policies for who can place political ads and promises to make those purchases public are signs of their commitment to correcting their mistakes.We look forward to answering lawmakers questions, said Joel Kaplan, vice president of global public policy for Facebook, in a statement.We take this issue very seriously and think its important Congress gets the full picture of what happened, including what we know about Russian activity on our platform, and is able to share its assessment with the American public.But lawmakers said the companies, who have been interacting privately for months, still have a long way to go.Last week, congressional aides said the online giants were pushing back against lawmakers.The companies argued against the ad disclosure bill and dragged their feet to participate in a hearing on Tuesday.Lobbyists for Facebook explained how their voluntary efforts on political ad disclosures could work better than regulations.Twitter has not addressed its problems with automated accounts, known as bots, that can quickly spread propaganda or fake news.In addition, not all social media companies have announced that they will tighten rules for buying political ads, one of the most pressing issues.And even if they do, lawmakers should still make more disclosure a legal requirement, said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota, who is a co-sponsor of the disclosure bill with Mr. Warner and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If their policies comply with our bill, they should support our bill and maybe can use their policy as a standard when we pass our bill, Ms. Klobuchar said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Much of the harshest criticism so far is coming from Democrats like Mr. Warner and Ms. Klobuchar, which could limit the fallout for the tech companies.The Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Burr, has been more reserved than Mr. Warner, for example.Many Republicans are reluctant to add any regulations to businesses.Some are also afraid of crossing other party members or President Trump, who regularly play down Russian interference in the election.Photo Republicans have slowly begun calling for more scrutiny of the companies.But lawmakers who are more oriented toward free markets have been reluctant to regulate the rapidly evolving industry.Other top regulators, particularly those appointed by Mr. Trump, are also considered unlikely to take strong action against the industry.The top antitrust enforcer at the Justice Department, Makan Delrahim, said in an interview last week that his agency would watch to see whether the size of technology companies hurts competition, but that size alone was not justification for action against them.There are people who think big is just bad, Mr. Delrahim said.He invoked the name of Robert Jackson, the top antitrust enforcer for the agency about 80 years ago, who said he was reluctant to try to break up big companies just for the sake of doing so.That has made it easier for Mr. Warner to assert himself as a leading voice about the power of the tech companies as unexpected as it may be.Mr. Warner accumulated his wealth with an early investment in the cellular service provider Nextel, which was sold to Sprint in 2005 for $35 billion.Mr. Warner then became a start-up investor at Columbia Capital, which had an office in Alexandria, Va.He used his fortune to run for governor of Virginia, talking on the campaign trail about bringing work force training and tech-oriented economic development to rural parts of the state.After serving a term, he was elected to the Senate in 2008.And even with his recent criticism of the industry, he regularly taps a broad network of tech executives and investors for counsel.Advertisement Continue reading the main story During the summer, Steve Case, the founder of AOL, stayed at Mr. Warners vacation home on Marthas Vineyard.For years, the two have met regularly to talk about techology-related policy issues, like how artificial intelligence could alter the future of labor.But during this years trip, they discussed the Senate intelligence committees Russia investigation and the power of social media platforms and their role in the election.His thinking has evolved, Mr. Case said.Even though Im sure this has some benefit with his profile, all things being equal, I think he has approached this with some reluctance because hed rather be focused on issues like the future of work.And Mr. Warner sees no contradiction in his evolution to being considered a sharp prod of Silicon Valley.Look, Im pro-tech.Im pro-innovation, he said, standing and shuffling side to side like a basketball player on defense.On the bookshelf near him was a textbook, Science and Engineering, and a small business self-help book called Grow Regardless: Of Your Businesss Size, Your Industry or the Economy ... and Despite the Government!He went on: What I fear is 2018.If you look at Russian intervention in the American elections, in terms of sowing chaos, they had pretty good R.O.I., he said, pulling from his past life with the business acronym for return on investment.There is too much at stake, he said.
Forget Washington. Facebook’s Problems Abroad Are Far More Disturbing.:::::In Myanmar, the rise in anti-Rohingya sentiment coincided with a huge boom in social media use that was partly attributable to Facebook itself.In 2016, the company partnered with MTP, the state-run telecom company, to give subscribers access to its Free Basics program.Free Basics includes a limited suite of internet services, including Facebook, that can be used without counting toward a cellphone data plan.As a result, the number of Facebook users in Myanmar has skyrocketed to more than 30 million today from 2 million in 2014.Photo We work hard to educate people about our services, highlight tools to help them protect their accounts and promote digital literacy, said Debbie Frost, a Facebook spokeswoman.To be more effective in these efforts, we are working with civil society, safety partners, and governments an approach we have found to be particularly important and effective in countries where people are rapidly coming online and experiencing the internet for the first time through a mobile phone.In India, where internet use has also surged in recent years, WhatsApp, the popular Facebook-owned messaging app, has been inundated with rumors, hoaxes and false stories.In May, the Jharkhand region in Eastern India was destabilized by a viral WhatsApp message that falsely claimed that gangs in the area were abducting children.The message incited widespread panic and led to a rash of retaliatory lynchings, in which at least seven people were beaten to death.A local filmmaker, Vinay Purty, told the Hindustan Times that many of the local villagers simply believed the abduction myth was real, since it came from WhatsApp.Everything shared on the phone is regarded as true, Mr. Purty said.In a statement, WhatsApp said, WhatsApp has made communications cheaper, easier and more reliable for millions of Indians with all the benefits that brings.Though we understand that some people, sadly, have used WhatsApp to intimidate others and spread misinformation.Its why we encourage people to report problematic messages to WhatsApp so that we can take action.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Facebook is not directly responsible for violent conflict, of course, and viral misinformation is hardly unique to its services.Before social media, there were email hoaxes and urban legends passed from person to person.But the speed of Facebooks growth in the developing world has made it an especially potent force among first-time internet users, who may not be appropriately skeptical of what they see online.The company has made many attempts to educate users about the dangers of misinformation.In India and Malaysia, it has taken out newspaper ads with tips for spotting false news.In Myanmar, it has partnered with local organizations to distribute printed copies of its community standards, as well as created educational materials to teach citizens about proper online behavior.But these efforts, as well-intentioned as they may be, have not stopped the violence, and Facebook does not appear to have made them a top priority.The company has no office in Myanmar, and neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor Ms. Sandberg has made any public statements about the Rohingya crisis.Correcting misinformation is a thorny philosophical problem for Facebook, which imagines itself as a neutral platform that avoids making editorial decisions.Facebooks community standards prohibit hate speech and threats, but many harmful viral posts such as a WhatsApp thread in Southern India that spread false rumors about a government immunization campaign are neither hateful nor directly threatening, and they wouldnt be prohibited under Facebooks community standards as long as they came from authentic accounts.Fighting misinformation is especially difficult on WhatsApp, an app for private messaging, since there is no public information trail to fact-check.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Facebook has argued that the benefits of providing internet access to international users will ultimately outweigh the costs.Adam Mosseri, a Facebook vice president who oversees the News Feed, told a journalism gathering this month, In the end, I dont think we as a human race will regret the internet.Mr. Zuckerberg echoed that sentiment in a 2013 manifesto titled Is Connectivity a Human Right?, in which he said that bringing the worlds population online would be one of the most important things we all do in our lifetimes.That optimism may be cold comfort to people in places like South Sudan.Despite being one of the poorest and least-wired countries in the world, with only around 20 percent of its citizens connected to the internet, the African nation has become a hotbed of social media misinformation.As BuzzFeed News has reported, political operatives inside and outside the country have used Facebook posts to spread rumors and incite anger between rival factions, fostering violence that threatens to escalate into a civil war.A United Nations report last year determined that in South Sudan, social media has been used by partisans on all sides, including some senior government officials, to exaggerate incidents, spread falsehoods and veiled threats, or post outright messages of incitement.These are incredibly complex issues, and it may be impossible for Facebook which is, remember, a technology company, not a global peacekeeping force to solve them overnight.But as the companys response to the Russia crisis has proved, its capable of acting swiftly and powerfully when it feels its interests are threatened.Information wars in emerging markets may not represent as big a threat to Facebooks business as angry lawmakers in Washington.But people are dying, and communities are tearing themselves apart with the tools Facebook has built.That should qualify as an even greater emergency in Menlo Park.
How Do You Stop Bullying? Advertisers Try to Help:::::The impetus to take on bullying is not only altruistic.Social media increasingly has made brands the target of rumors, boycotts and other attacks.Now that word of mouth and social are playing such a large role, and more and more consumers have figured out how to use social, they can get on their soapbox, said Allen Adamson, a brand strategy consultant.The angrier they are, the more effective they are online.As a result, advertisers have a greater sense of what bullied individuals face and are learning what kind of communication serves to counter it.I think maybe more brands, more people, more entities are experiencing it, said Heidi Arthur, the Ad Councils head of campaign development.These insights have helped shape the conversation around bullying in the past few years, said Ross Ellis, the founder of STOMP Out Bullying, a nonprofit that is promoting the first Wednesday in November as National Block It Out Day, an anti-cyberbullying initiative.Photo Five years ago, the Ad Council spearheaded an anti-bullying campaign that targeted parents; today, it speaks directly to bystanders, both kids and adults.The group has homed in on the language used to characterize harassment and abuse to sharpen the focus on what bullying looks like.It now urges people who witness such behavior to intercede.Just saying bullying is fairly broad and speaks to you being on one side of it, Ms. Arthur said.When you can connect it be back to specific behaviors, you can have more of those aha moments.Ms. Lewinsky hopes that her work will help.The campaigns flagship video depicts what would happen if internet trolls confronted their targets in public rather than online.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Theres an online disinhibition effect, where people hiding behind anonymity and a screen will tend to depart from their normal persona, she said.The video depicts confrontations like one woman mocking anothers weight in a cafe, a pedestrian accosting two men with homophobic hate speech and a woman being labeled a terrorist.The perpetrators and targets were played by actors, but the stunned responses of passers-by who intervened were unscripted.The shoot we did was really emotional, not only for the actors, but also for the crew, Ms. Lewinsky said.We all had very strong reactions to ones that hit home in different ways.Mr. Hahn said the hateful comments the actors used were taken verbatim from social media accounts.Sadly, it was all too easy to find them, he said.Of course, advertisers were well-versed in navigating unacknowledged or buried emotions long before the advent of the internet, which some experts suggest has made the industry uniquely positioned to take on todays trolls.And if the industry can position its clients at the forefront of this conversation, those brands stand to benefit.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I think advertising is really a reflection of whats going on in the times, said Val DiFebo, the chief executive of Deutsch in New York.I think the value proposition is really about creating a contact point with your consumer thats meaningful to them beyond the product that youre selling.Mr. Adamson noted that attempting to fight bullying through advertising will have to rely on some of the time-tested strategies marketers have long used.Most brands have always been sold on an emotional basis, Mr. Adamson said.People buy a coffee because it says something about who they are.The only way to deal with this is to make people emotionally motivated to say something.Ultimately, if theyre going to change behavior, its not about a rational argument.
Limit on 401(k) Savings? It’s About Paying for Tax Cuts:::::A retirement crisis already looms.Three out of four Americans worry that they will not have enough money to get through their retirements, according to the National Institute on Retirement Security.About 45 percent have not saved a cent toward it.Mr. Trump, sensitive to the firestorm that could be provoked by limits on 401(k) contributions, tweeted that there would be NO change to this great and popular middle class tax break before conceding it might be a part of legislative horse-trading.Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the principal Republican architect of the tax plan in the House, also scrambled to reassure critics that a rewrite would not undermine retirement savings.All the focus is on, can we help people save more, he said.Yet for all the alarming rhetoric about crushed nest eggs, there are a couple of things to keep in mind.First, the debate on Capitol Hill is not really about retirement; its about lawmakers feverish hunt for revenue to finance tax cuts.Second, no matter what happens, it wont solve the fundamental problem that many Americans will outlive their savings.There are several types of subsidized retirement accounts.People who work at larger companies tend to set aside money in a 401(k); they dont pay taxes until they withdraw funds.By contrast, Americans who open an account known as a Roth get a different kind of break.They pay tax on money before it is deposited, but then get to withdraw it and the subsequent earnings tax-free in the future.Details of the Republican tax plan have not yet been released, but the talk has been of imposing a cap of $2,400 a year on tax-deferred contributions to 401(k) plans a sharp reduction from the current ceiling of $18,000 a year for people under 50, and $24,000 for people age 50 and above.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There would still be a tax benefit, but it would probably be under a Roth-style structure.To some people, enjoying the break when they withdraw money instead of when they deposit it may not make a difference.But for Republicans in Washington desperately seeking a fast boost in revenue, timing is everything.Their tax bill includes giant reductions in business taxes.Figuring out how to pay for tax cuts is always a grueling task, but it is especially complicated in todays bitterly partisan atmosphere.Republican lawmakers intend to push through a bill without any Democratic support but there is a catch.The single-party strategy in this case triggers a rule that requires the policy to have no impact on the budget at the end of 10 years.To make the math work, lawmakers need to come up with the revenue to pay for the cuts sooner rather than later.Photo Thats where 401(k)s come in.Rather than allow workers to continue delaying their tax payments, the Republican leadership wants to collect tax revenue on most new contributions upfront so they can use it to pay for those expensive corporate tax cuts.Thats the equivalent of a middle-class tax increase.Its just an enormous budget gimmick, said William Gale of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.Its raiding future revenues to pay for current tax cuts.This is not a retirement security story.The accounting sleight-of-hand irks Mr. Gale, a former economic adviser to President George H.W.Bush, because, he says, it is financially irresponsible.Its just government borrowing by another name, he said.Youre not really raising revenue, just changing when its collected.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The question of whether deferring taxes on retirement savings is actually good policy, however, is a separate matter.Tax-subsidized retirement accounts have long roused fans and critics.Budget cutters point to the trillions of dollars they cost the Treasury Department.Groups concerned about growing inequality complain that the tax break primarily benefits higher-income Americans who would save for retirement anyway.Those with more modest salaries generally have less access to work-based plans or cant afford to save.Consumer advocates worry they are too vulnerable to the vagaries of the stock market.Still, these retirement plans are extremely popular among middle and upper-income voters and many of the politicians who represent them which is why previous attempts to eliminate them have failed.Whether a tax-deferred 401(k) or a Roth is a better deal is not clear.Younger workers starting out can reasonably assume they are in a lower tax bracket now and benefit from a Roth, while middle-age workers may assume they will be in a lower bracket after they retire.But mostly there are question marks.Who knows if Congress will raise or lower tax rates 30 years from now, or if someone will shift from a higher tax bracket to a lower one?(It wouldnt be the first time taxes on retirement income changed Social Security benefits were shielded from federal income taxes for decades before the law changed in 1983.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Gale says he thinks the immediacy of the 401(k) tax break encourages people to save more than they otherwise might.So does Mr. Benna, the 401(k)s inventor.Although he says the tax deferral alone without employers matching some of their employees contributions was probably insufficient to persuade lower-wage workers to participate, it has nudged up middle-class savings.Its harder to save the same amount after taxes, he said.There will be a drop-off in contributions.But other experts arent so sure.Andrew Biggs, formerly a principal deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration, said that for most people, it makes little difference whether they pay taxes on retirement savings now or in the future.Automatic enrollment and the employer matches are much more important than the delayed taxes, said Mr. Biggs, now a retirement specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.Some studies have confirmed his hunch.One team of researchers looked at a handful of companies that offered a tax-deferred savings plan and then added a Roth option to the menu.They found the total amount of contributions didnt change much.The tax deduction was a pretty minor force, said James Choi, a finance professor at the Yale School of Management and a part of that team.And depending on future tax law, Mr. Choi said that retirees with Roth accounts could get by with smaller contributions than those with 401(k)s because they wont have to pay as much tax on the savings they withdraw.The possibility that people may save less overall is fueling financial services industry opposition to the tax proposal currently in Congress.Plan administrators which include major mutual fund companies like Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group are paid a share of the assets under their control; if the assets shrink, so do their fees.What worries Mr. Choi, though, is the Republicans idea to cap the amount of tax-deferred contributions at $2,400 a year, while treating the rest like Roth contributions.Setting the cap there could drag down savings because people tend to interpret such thresholds as recommendations, he said.From that perspective, it would be better to eliminate tax deferrals altogether rather than set such a low ceiling.Yet whether the 401(k) caps are untouched, slashed or abandoned altogether, the prospect remains that millions of Americans will face retirement with no savings.
How to Be a C.E.O., From a Decade’s Worth of Them:::::And I have been endlessly surprised by the creative approaches that chief executives take to interviewing people for jobs, including tossing their car keys to a job candidate to drive them to a lunch spot, or asking them how weird they are, on a scale of 1 to 10.Granted, not all chief executives are fonts of wisdom.And some of them, as headlines regularly remind us, are deeply challenged people.That said, theres no arguing that C.E.O.s have a rare vantage point for spotting patterns about management, leadership and human behavior.After almost a decade of writing the Corner Office column, this will be my final one and from all the interviews, and the five million words of transcripts from those conversations, I have learned valuable leadership lessons and heard some great stories.Here are some standouts.So You Want to Be a C.E.O.?James Nieves/The New York Times The problem with values like respect and courage is that everybody interprets them differently.Theyre too ambiguous and open to interpretation.Instead of uniting us, they can create friction.Michel Feaster, C.E.O.of Usermind Read the original interview People often try to crack the code for the best path to becoming a chief executive.Do finance people have an edge over marketers?How many international postings should you have?A variety of experiences is good, but at what point does breadth suggest a lack of focus?Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its a natural impulse.In this age of Moneyball and big data, why not look for patterns?The problem is that the world doesnt really work that way.There are too many variables, many of them beyond your control, including luck, timing and personal chemistry.The career trajectories of the C.E.O.s Ive interviewed are so varied that spotting trends is difficult, and a surprising number of the executives do not fit the stereotype of the straight-A student and class president who seemed destined to run a big company someday.Ive met C.E.O.s who started out in theater, music and teaching.Others had surprisingly low grades in school.So what explains it?Are there some qualities beyond the obvious, like hard work and perseverance that explain why these people ultimately got the top jobs?Ive noticed three recurring themes.First, they share a habit of mind that is best described as applied curiosity.They tend to question everything.They want to know how things work, and wonder how they can be made to work better.Theyre curious about people and their back stories.And rather than wondering if they are on the right career path, they make the most of whatever path theyre on, wringing lessons from all their experiences.I can find interest in a lot of different things and try to put that to work in a positive way, connecting the dots and considering how the pieces fit together, said Gregory Maffei, whose background includes a college degree in religious studies, and is now the chief executive of Liberty Media, the giant company with interests in everything from SiriusXM to Formula One racing.Second, C.E.O.s seem to love a challenge.Discomfort is their comfort zone.Usually, I really like whatever the problem is.I like to get close to the fire, said Arkadi Kuhlmann, a veteran banking chief.Some people have a desire for that, Ive noticed, and some people dont.I just naturally gravitate to the fire.So I think thats a characteristic that you have, thats in your DNA.The third theme is how they managed their own careers on their way to the top.They focus on doing their current job well, and that earns them promotions.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That may sound obvious.But many people can seem more concerned about the job they want than the job theyre doing.That doesnt mean keeping ambition in check.By all means, have career goals, share them with your bosses, and learn everything you can about how the broader business works.And yes, be savvy about company politics (watch out in particular for the show ponies who try to take credit for everything).But focus on building a track record of success, and people will keep betting on you.You shouldnt be looking just to climb the ladder, but be open to opportunities that let you climb that ladder, said Kim Lubel, the former chief executive of CST Brands, a big operator of convenience stores.Ms. Lubels career twists embody that mind-set in an unusual way.She told me a remarkable story of applying for a job with the Central Intelligence Agency, and then thinking she didnt get the job going to grad school instead.Only later did Ms. Lubel (whose maiden name was Smith) learn that the C.I.A.did try to hire her, but that they had offered the job to a different Kim Smith.The Most Important Thing About Leadership, Part I Earl Wilson/The New York Times You shouldnt be looking just to climb the ladder, but be open to opportunities that let you climb that ladder.Kim Lubel, former C.E.O.of CST Brands Read the original interview Because leadership is so hard, there is a boundless appetite for somebody to come along and say, Heres the one thing you need to know.Such headlines are the clickbait of business websites.If only it were that simple.But one thing isnt necessarily more important than another.And people are, well, complicated.Better to understand leadership as a series of paradoxes.Leaders, for example, need humility to know what they dont know, but have the confidence to make a decision amid the ambiguity.A bit of chaos can help foster creativity and innovation, but too much can feel like anarchy.You need to be empathetic and care about people, but also be willing to let them go if theyre dragging down the team.You have to create a sense of urgency, but also have the patience to bring everybody on the team along.We think about our values in pairs, and there is a tension or a balance between them, said Jacqueline Novogratz, chief executive of Acumen Fund, a venture philanthropy organization that focuses on the worlds poor.We talk about listening and leadership; accountability and generosity; humility and audacity.Youve got to have the humility to see the world as it is and in our world, working with poor communities, thats not easy to do but have the audacity to know why you are trying to make it be different, to imagine the way it could be.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Most Important Thing About Leadership, Part II Go ahead.Twist my arm.Despite what I just wrote, if you were to force me to rank the most important qualities of effective leadership, I would put trustworthiness at the top.We all have a gut sense of our bosses, based on our observations and experiences: Do we trust them to do the right thing?Will they be straight with us and not shave corners of truth?Do they own their mistakes; give credit where credit is due; care about their employees as people as opposed to assets?Do they manage down as well as up?If you want to lead others, youve got to have their trust, and you cant have their trust without integrity, said James Hackett, the chief executive of Ford Motor Company, who ran Steelcase when I spoke with him.A close cousin of trustworthiness is how much you respect the people who work for you.Its hard to argue with this logic from Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood executive: By definition if theres leadership, it means there are followers, and youre only as good as the followers, he said.I believe the quality of the followers is in direct correlation to the respect you hold them in.Its not how much they respect you that is most important.Its actually how much you respect them.Its everything.Discussions about different aspects of leadership sometimes remind me of Russian nesting dolls, because many of the qualities can feel like subsets of one another.But I keep going back to first principles of how were wired as human beings we can sense at a kind of lizard-brain level whether we trust someone.Human beings are incredibly perceptive, Pedro J. Pizarro, chief executive of Edison International, a public utility holding company.And they seem to be more perceptive when they look at people above them than when they look down.Culture Is Almost Like a Religion Earl Wilson/The New York Times People seeing who succeeds and fails in the company defines culture.The people who succeed become role models for whats valued in the organization, and that defines culture.Tae Hea Nahm, managing director of Storm Ventures Read the original interview Its a predictable rite of passage as many companies evolve.At some point, the leadership team will go through the exercise of defining a set of values to shape the culture of their company.These lists can be all over the place lengthy or brief, predictable or quirky.But the exercise raises an obvious question: Are there some best practices?I have noticed some patterns.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Shorter is generally better than longer.In fact, when I ask chief executives about their companies values, its not unusual for them to struggle to remember them all if there are more than five bullet points.And if the boss cant remember them, will anyone else?Granted, others might disagree with me on this point, including Ray Dalio, founder of the massive Bridgewater Associates hedge fund, who has hundreds of principles for working at his firm.But heres a thought experiment: What if every company that has codified its values conducted a pop quiz with employees to see if they know them all?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Values need reinforcement beyond repetition.Many companies, for example, make their values part of the hiring and firing process, and hand out awards to people who bring the values to life.The culture is almost like a religion, said Robert L. Johnson, chairman of the RLJ Companies, an investment firm.People buy into it and they believe in it.And you can tolerate a little bit of heresy, but not a lot.Michel Feaster, the chief of Usermind, a customer-engagement software firm, shared an insight about the importance of specificity in the values exercise.The best cultural lists are the behaviors you want to cultivate, she said.The problem with values like respect and courage is that everybody interprets them differently.Theyre too ambiguous and open to interpretation.Instead of uniting us, they can create friction.At the end of the day, does the values exercise even matter?Many chief executives dont believe in them.And Tae Hea Nahm, managing director of Storm Ventures, a venture capital firm, thinks other signals are more powerful.No matter what people say about culture, its all tied to who gets promoted, who gets raises and who gets fired, he said.You can have your stated culture, but the real culture is defined by compensation, promotions and terminations.Basically, people seeing who succeeds and fails in the company defines culture.The people who succeed become role models for whats valued in the organization, and that defines culture.Men vs. Women (Sigh) Librado Romero/The New York Times You have to be open and alert at every turn to the possibility that youre about to learn the most important lesson of your life.Ruth Simmons, president of Prairie View A&M University Read the original interview Are there differences in the way men and women lead?Ive been asked this question countless times.Early on, I looked hard to spot differences.But any generalizations never held up.Sure, there are differences in the way people lead.But in my experience interviewing executives for the past decade, they are more likely to be driven by other factors, like whether they are introverts or extroverts, more analytical or creative, and even whether they grew up in a large or small family.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That said, there is no doubt that women face much stronger headwinds than men to get the top jobs.And many of those headwinds remain once they become C.E.O.s.But the actual work of leadership?Its the same, regardless of whether a man or a woman is in charge.You have to set a vision, build cultural guardrails, foster a sense of teamwork, and make tough calls.All of that requires balancing the endless paradoxes of leadership, and doing it in a way that inspires trust.A suggestion: I believe its time to give the narrative about whether men and women lead differently a rest.Yes, we need to keep talking and writing about why there are so few women in the top ranks.But this trope about different styles of leadership among men and women seems past its expiration date.And while were at it, could everyone agree to drop the predictable questions about how female chief executives juggle family and work?Or start asking men the same questions, too?I Have Just One Question for You Ruby Washington/The New York Times By definition if theres leadership, it means there are followers, and youre only as good as the followers.I believe the quality of the followers is in direct correlation to the respect you hold them in.Its not how much they respect you that is most important.Its actually how much you respect them.Its everything.Jeffrey Katzenberg, Hollywood executive Read the original interview A big surprise has been all the different answers Ive heard to the simple question Ive posed to each leader: How do you hire?Even in recent weeks, I was still hearing job-interview questions I had never heard before.Just last month, for instance, Daniel Schwartz, the chief executive of the parent company of Burger King, told me that he likes to ask candidates, Are you smart or do you work hard?(Yes, there is a right answer, he said: You want hard workers.Youd be surprised how many people tell me, I dont need to work hard, Im smart.Really?Humility is important.)Their creativity is no doubt born of necessity.Candidates are so trained to anticipate the usual questions What are your biggest strengths and weaknesses?that C.E.O.s have to come up with bank-shot questions to get around the polished facades.This has inspired a kind of running game Ive played with many chief executives: If you could ask somebody only one question, and you had to decide on the spot whether to hire them based on their answer, what would it be?Advertisement Continue reading the main story Id nominate a question that surfaced during my interview with Bob Brennan, an executive director at CA Technologies, a software firm, who was the chief of Iron Mountain, the records-management company, when I spoke with him.I want to know how willing people are to really talk about themselves, Mr. Brennan said.So if I ask you, What are the qualities you like least and most in your parents?you might bristle at that, or you might be very curious about it, or youll just literally open up to me.And obviously if you bristle at that, its too vulnerable an environment for you.Ill let the human resources professionals debate whether such a question is out of bounds.But Im hard pressed to think of a better crystal ball for predicting how somebody is likely to behave in the weeks, months and years after you hire them.After all, people often adopt the qualities of their parents that they like, and work hard to do the opposite of what they dont like.The point is reinforced time and again in my interviews.When I ask executives how their parents have influenced their leadership style, I often hear powerful themes that carry through their lives and careers.I grew up in a big Italian family, said Sharon Napier, the chief executive of Partners + Napier, an ad agency.Fighting and being loud at the kitchen table was normal.I didnt realize when you went to somebody elses house they didnt argue about something.So I love what I always call creative tension in the agency.She added: I like having a good debate.At first, people think thats combative.I really want to hear if you have a different opinion.There has to be enough trust to do that.My Favorite Story Earl Wilson/The New York Times I just naturally gravitate to the fire.So I think thats a characteristic that you have, thats in your DNA.Arkadi Kuhlmann, a veteran banking C.E.O.Read the original interview I heard it from Bill Green, who was the chief executive of Accenture, the consulting firm, at the time of our interview.I asked him about his approach to hiring, and near the end of our conversation, he shared this anecdote: I was recruiting at Babson College.This was in 1991.The last recruit of the day I get this rsum.I get the blue sheet attached to it, which is the form Im supposed to fill out with all this stuff and his rsum attached to the top.His rsum is very light no clubs, no sports, no nothing.Babson, 3.2.Studied finance.Work experience: Sams Diner, references on request.Its the last one of the day, and Ive seen all these people come through strutting their stuff and theyve got their portfolios and semester studying abroad.Here comes this guy.He sits.His name is Sam, and I say: Sam, let me just ask you.What else were you doing while you were here?He says: Well, Sams Diner.Thats our family business, and I leave on Friday after classes, and I go and work till closing.I work all day Saturday till closing, and then I work Sunday until I close, and then I drive back to Babson.I wrote, Hire him, on the blue sheet.He had character.He faced a set of challenges.He figured out how to do both.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Green elaborated on the quality he had just described.Its work ethic, he said.You could see the guy had charted a path for himself to make it work with the situation he had.He didnt ask for any help.He wasnt victimized by the thing.He just said, Thats my dads business, and I work there.Confident.Proud.Mr. Green added: You sacrifice and youre a victim, or you sacrifice because its the right thing to do and you have pride in it.Huge difference.Simple thing.Huge difference.The story captures a quality Ive always admired in some people.They own their job, whatever it is.Best Career and Life Advice My vote for career advice goes to something I heard from Joseph Plumeri, the vice chairman of First Data, a payments-processing company, and former chief executive of Willis Group Holdings.His biggest career inflection points, he told me, came from chance meetings, giving rise to his advice: Play in traffic.It means that if you go push yourself out there and you see people and do things and participate and get involved, something happens, he said.Both of my great occasions in life happened by accident simply because I showed up.Mr. Plumeri learned this lesson firsthand when he was looking for a job while in law school.He was knocking on doors of various firms, including one called Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt.He managed to get an audience with one of the partners, Sandy Weill, who informed the young Mr. Plumeri that this was a brokerage firm, not a law firm.Despite the awkward moment, something clicked, and Mr. Weill gave him a part-time job.And Mr. Plumeri moved up as the firm evolved into Citigroup, and he spent 32 years there, many of them in top jobs.I tell people, just show up, get in the game, go play in traffic, Mr. Plumeri said.Something good will come of it, but youve got to show up.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As for life advice, my favorite insight came from Ruth Simmons, president of Prairie View A&M University.Her suggestion to students: They should never assume that they can predict what experiences will teach them the most about what they value, or about what their life should be, she said.You have to be open and alert at every turn to the possibility that youre about to learn the most important lesson of your life.Thanks to everyone who followed Corner Office over the years.I hope you found useful lessons in the interviews I sure did.And thanks to all the executives who were so candid with me about the challenges theyve faced and the mistakes theyve made along the way.Perhaps their stories will inspire others to learn how to be better leaders.Its not easy, but the ripple effects of thoughtful leadership are worth the effort.
In a Mortgage-Crisis Settlement, Did a Bank Get Off Easy?:::::An answer to that question emerges in a new report compiled by the independent monitor hired to scrutinize how Credit Suisse was living up to the terms of the deal.Put simply, some of the settlements terms those involving consumer assistance were easier on Credit Suisse than aggrieved investors and borrowers may have wanted.The settlement terms relating to consumer relief are complex.They allow the bank to earn credit toward the $2.8 billion in consumer help by modifying troubled borrowers loans.How much credit is earned by the bank depends upon the types of modifications it gives to borrowers.One of the monitors tasks is to ensure that Credit Suisse receives only the credit that it has truly earned under the deal.This is no small task.Under previous settlements, for example, some banks received credit for forgiving loans that had already been discharged in bankruptcy.Neil M. Barofsky, a partner at Jenner & Block, is the Credit Suisse monitor.You might recall Mr. Barofsky from his stint as the first special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which administered assistance to beleaguered banks, homeowners and other entities after the 2008 crisis.Mr. Barofsky declined to comment on the report, which looks at the first six months of the banks loan modification and forgiveness efforts.(A later report will focus on the banks financing of affordable housing.)Nicole Sharp, a Credit Suisse spokeswoman, said in a statement, As the report highlights, Credit Suisse has taken a number of positive steps since our settlement with the Department of Justice.She said the bank was moving to put this legacy matter behind it, while also protecting the interests of its clients, employees and other stakeholders.Photo So far, Credit Suisse is working diligently on the consumer relief aspect of the settlement, the report said.It is meeting the deals requirements through its loan servicing unit, Select Portfolio Servicing, or SPS.There is no doubt that the banks efforts are helping distressed borrowers and will continue to.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Nevertheless, a close reading of the 118-page analysis does raise questions about just how tough this settlement really was.Indeed, the report highlights the significant benefits Credit Suisse received under provisions in a deal that prosecutors said would hold the bank accountable.For example, Credit Suisse can earn consumer relief credit for actions it would likely have taken anyway, the report noted.More troubling, most of the loans Select Portfolio Servicing will modify and Credit Suisse will receive credit for are owned by others.They are investors in mortgage-backed securities or rival financial institutions.Nearly all of the loan modifications SPS will complete for credit will be performed on loans owned by third parties, and to the extent those modifications result in any loss, it will be borne by the owner of the loan, and not Credit Suisse, the report noted.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Allowing the bank to forgive loans it does not own, which the Credit Suisse settlement specifically does, puts the bank in a position to benefit from others losses.Here are the details.According to the analysis, Credit Suisses current focus is to modify troubled loans, allowing borrowers to pay less than is currently owed on their mortgages or to defer payments on a portion of the principal outstanding.Both arrangements help borrowers stay in their homes and avoid foreclosure.That was a primary goal of the settlement, and it was a good one.The bank has agreed to try to satisfy its consumer relief obligation by Dec. 31, 2020.When Credit Suisse forgives principal on a borrowers mortgage, modifying the loan by reducing the amount owed, the bank receives a dollar-for-dollar credit, the report noted.In other words, for every dollar of principal forgiven in a modification, Credit Suisse receives at least $1 of credit toward the $2.8 billion in consumer relief.But Credit Suisse can also earn more than $1 in credit when a loan modification satisfies certain other criteria.Many troubled borrowers, especially those who bought their homes at the height of the real estate bubble, owe more on their mortgages than their properties are currently worth.Such borrowers are upside down on their mortgages; they have negative equity in their homes.To help borrowers like these, the settlement assigns extra credit to Credit Suisse when it forgives enough principal on a loan to put the borrower in a positive equity position.The bank can earn additional credit up to $1.25 per dollar of forgiveness granted in certain cases.The report is meaningful because it goes into scrupulous detail about how the Credit Suisse deal is working.This lets readers draw their own conclusions about how assiduously the settlement actually held the bank to account.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After the 2008 debacle, prosecutors have been criticized for failing to pursue criminal prosecutions of large and powerful financial institutions.In response, they have pointed to billion-dollar settlements with banks, like the one with Credit Suisse, as evidence that they are aggressive in their demands for accountability.But letting a bank receive credit for principal forgiveness that others are actually providing is a flaw in this settlement.Allowing it to meet its obligations with actions it would have taken anyway is another lapse.Credit Suisse is living up to the terms of the $5.28 billion settlement agreement.Thats to the good.But the nature of the agreement could have been stronger.And thats too bad.
A Student Loan Nightmare: The Teacher in the Wrong Payment Plan:::::Hes unlikely to be the only one.About a quarter of the people who borrow money for higher education end up in jobs that could qualify for public service loan forgiveness.There is going to be an enormous crush of borrowers who think they are eligible only to find that they are not, said Seth Frotman, the student loan ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which published a report on the subject in June.We need to get ready for it.All Mr. Shafer has been trying to do for more than 25 years is get ready for a career where he could make a difference while also earning enough to buy a home and help raise a family.The son of a fisherman and a mother who eventually became a teacher herself, Mr. Shafer, 46, does indeed own a cozy house on a street with gorgeous foliage.He and his wife live with their two sons, ages 10 and 4.Photo At work, Mr. Shafer offers job interview advice to one student while plotting financial aid application strategies with another.The classroom where he and his colleagues work has notices on the walls about housing and a free Thanksgiving dinner.But at home over the last two years, he has spent many hours communicating with his current loan servicer, FedLoan, which is part of the nonprofit Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency.Eventually, he contacted elected officials and the Department of Educations ombudsman department.The fact that he has had more than one servicer is a big part of what seems to have gone wrong.As Mr. Shafer tells it, teacher circles were abuzz back in 2007 when the federal public service loan forgiveness program came into existence.Five years earlier, he had consolidated all of his student loans into a single one.At the time, his servicer verified his income and put him into a repayment plan where his payments would grow slowly over time, presumably as his income grew.In 2007, Mr. Shafer said, he called his servicer at the time, ACS Education Services, and told the company that he wanted to enroll in the public service loan forgiveness program.No problem, he said he had been told, as long as he made his payments on time for 120 months.When ACS exited the federal loan servicing business, his loan moved to Mohela, short for the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, in 2012.Nothing, he said, that he heard or saw from Mohela gave him pause.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In 2013, he heard this from a fellow teacher: Once borrowers in the public service loan forgiveness program reached 120 payments, only one servicer, FedLoan, could forgive the remaining balance.So Mr. Shafer did what he needed to do to move his loans there.It was at that point that things began to go off the rails.Remember that repayment program that Mr. Shafer ended up in back in 2002?It is whats known as a graduated repayment plan, and if youre in one, youre not eligible for public service loan forgiveness.He was supposed to be in one of the income-based plans.All along, Mr. Shafer said, people at the three servicers told him that his loan was in good status when he asked whether he was on track for forgiveness in 2017.The phone representatives at these servicers, however, may have been defining that term more narrowly namely, that he was merely making on-time payments.Its also possible that they simply didnt understand the highly specific requirements of the loan forgiveness program.In 2015, Mr. Shafer received an email from FedLoan that definitively alerted him to the fact that none of his eight years of payments had counted toward forgiveness.He panicked and spent the next year fighting back, flabbergasted that so much time had gone by without any of the three servicers telling him that anything was wrong when he had quite specifically and repeatedly inquired.Photo So why didnt they?A spokesman for ACSs current owner said it could not comment on the concerns of a past borrower, even though Mr. Shafer granted the company permission to do so.A Mohela spokesman said that while it didnt have specific records of having told Mr. Shafer that his payments were not qualifying, its phone representatives contact with him in January 2013 was probably what spurred him to move his loans to FedLoan to become eligible for the forgiveness program.Mr. Shafer said that was not so.At FedLoan, a spokesman said it had told Mr. Shafer that he had a problem, more than once, by phone and through other communications.Indeed, in Mr. Shafers pile of documents, I did find a 2014 statement that said, on the back, that he had not made any qualifying payments.Mr. Shafer had missed that, and many others probably did, too, given that FedLoan didnt bother to put this crucial piece of information on the front of the bill, let alone in 100-point neon You are doing this wrong type.As for FedLoans specific assertion that it disclosed the problem to him by phone in 2013, Mr. Shafer responds with the following: Why on earth would he have not jumped on the problem instantly and aggressively if he had heard that in 2013?There does not appear to be any happy ending in the offing for Mr. Shafer, and after a year of appeals, he did move himself into an eligible repayment plan.If nothing else happens to mess this all up again, he should finish paying off his loans when he is 55, about the time that his first child starts college.That will be 37 years after he took out his first loan as a teenager.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Worried that your story will end with similar bad news?There are four crucial requirements in the public service loan forgiveness program.You have to be in an eligible job, with an eligible loan, making the right kind of payments (which was what tripped Mr. Shafer up) and doing so in the right way.A column I wrote in April outlines the process, even if conquering it proves to be another matter.Mr. Shafer remains baffled by it all.Perspiring at his dining room table this week after a meal of halibut that he had caught himself, he sipped a second adult beverage and tried to understand what had happened.In what other area of life, he wondered aloud, would you pay your bills on time only to be told that the payments hadnt counted?Later on in the week, he put it like so: They have the power, regardless of my service and full payments, to make me look inept.Though I have been working hard for 18 years to help young people graduate from high school and build a viable future and have been sending a large chunk of my paycheck back to the very government I work for they will surely win based on their documentation.So this is who we are now.For all sorts of reasons that made perfect sense at the time, we built additional repayment programs onto existing complexity onto well-meaning forgiveness overseen by multiple layers of responsible parties.And once that was done, Mr. Shafer, teacher of shelter dwellers and street kids and others whom fellow educators failed to reach, wasted a small fortune and will now shovel another one into the federal coffers.Which leaves just one more question: If this is who we are, is it who we actually want to be?
How Floyd Mayweather Helped Two Young Guys From Miami Get Rich:::::Thanks in part to the endorsements, in just a few weeks Centras founders raised over $30 million from investors around the world.They finished their fund-raising this month, just before a grand jury indicted two of the three co-founders on perjury charges stemming from a drunken-driving case.Centra was one of the 270 or so I.C.O.s that have raised more than $3.2 billion this year, a 3,000 percent jump from last years total, according to data from Tokendata.io, which tracks coin offerings.Investors have been willing to pay real money for these virtual tokens because they hope their value will go up as fast as the price of Bitcoin, the best-known digital currency, has in recent months.Celebrities have helped stoke the I.C.O.boom.The actor Jamie Foxx, the socialite Paris Hilton and the soccer player Luis Suarez, for example, have all promoted new virtual currencies to their sizable followings on social media in recent months, offering legitimacy and attention to coin offerings that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.Mr. Mayweather, who has promoted three different tokens Centra, Stox and Hubiits has even taken to calling himself Crypto Mayweather in social media posts, a play on his better-known nickname, Money Mayweather.But the story of Centra illustrates that beneath the signs of mainstream acceptance, coin offerings still exist in a legal gray zone with few checks on the ambitions of young entrepreneurs.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its undeniable that a celebrity endorsement brings a new audience into the world of crypto currencies, said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center, a nonprofit that advocates for Bitcoin and related technology.But Im not certain that celebrity endorsements are doing a good job of bringing attention to the legitimate projects.Coins of the Digital Wild West The original virtual currency, Bitcoin, is a digital token with no physical backing that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world.The network on which Bitcoin is stored and transferred was designed to operate without any company or government in charge, governed by a far-flung collaboration of volunteer programmers and computers that maintain all the records.Initial coin offerings have taken advantage of the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and another popular virtual currency network, Ethereum.People can pay for tokens like Centra using Bitcoin and Ether (the currency inside Ethereum), and no financial authority needs to approve the payments or even know they happened.Coin offerings have also copied the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and are riding on the coattails of tech industry enthusiasm for those currency systems.The Centra founders said their token would fuel a new virtual currency debit card and online market.Some venture capitalists have said these new tokens could provide a way to fund and support new global networks like the next generation of the internet.But while Bitcoin and Ethereum have gone through years of public vetting (and still have plenty of critics), the new tokens being sold in recent months are unproven, and marketed on the promises of their creators.The creators of Centra are 26-year-old friends from southern Florida, Sam Sharma and Raymond Trapani.The companys chief marketing officer, Robert Farkas, was recently given the title of co-founder as well.Before Centra, neither Mr. Sharma nor Mr. Trapani had any professional experience with the technologies associated with virtual currencies, or with the debit cards they were hoping to build.The primary business experience of Mr. Sharma and Mr. Farkas was at Miami Exotics, a luxury car rental business that the two built.Mr. Trapanis old Instagram account shows that he was also a credit repair specialist with a penchant for pictures of luxury cars and stacks of $20 bills.You can sit and watch my life, or you can join my team and live a life like mine!he wrote in one post.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The lack of experience in the virtual currency industry did nothing to limit the ambitions of Centras founders.In July, they put out a website and an announcement that described Centra as an answer to the proliferation of virtual currencies.Centra Tech has a brilliant solution, the worlds first Debit Card that is designed for use with compatibility on 8+ major cryptocurrencies blockchain assets, the announcement said.Photo Making up for the inexperience of the young men was an older chief executive named Michael Edwards, at least according to the Centra website at the time.The first cracks in the project appeared in early August when a programmer, Harry Denly, wrote on his blog that Mr. Edwards appeared to be made up.The photo on Centras website was a photo of a Canadian physiology professor who had no relation to Centra and none of the details on Mr. Edwardss LinkedIn profile, like his work experience at Bank of America and Wells Fargo, checked out.Centra initially threatened to sue Mr. Denly but then said the bad profiles were the result of freelancers who had hastily put together the companys marketing material.The LinkedIn profile was deleted.The company has since removed any mention of Michael Edwards from the Centra site and elevated Mr. Sharma to be president.The company also deleted several other employees whose identity and existence were challenged on social media forums.When I got involved, the website got cleaned up from A to Z, Mr. Sharma said in an interview.Centra charged past these hiccups and began its token sale, got its endorsement from Mr. Mayweather (more on that later) and moved ahead with its plans for a virtual currency debit card.The debit card was described as a new product that would make it possible to spend virtual currencies anywhere Visa cards were taken.The companys site showed Centra cards emblazoned with the Visa logo.There was one problem with this plan.The company had not been approved, or had even applied, to run a Centra card on the Visa network, a spokeswoman for Visa said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After The New York Times reached out to Visa this month, Centra took all the mentions of Visa off its website.Mr. Sharma then said in an interview that the company had shifted its strategy and was now planning to run its cards on the Mastercard network in partnership with a Canadian financial institution.He said this would not require approval from Mastercard because the Canadian institution would issue the cards.But a Mastercard spokesman, Brian Gendron, disagreed.Centra would need approval from Mastercard for something like that, and we are not aware of any approval that has been sought or achieved, Mr. Gendron said.Because Centra began raising money without going through any standard background checks, no one verified the companys credentials with the credit card networks or other relevant authorities.A basic background check would have turned up the numerous run-ins with the law that Mr. Sharma, the company president, has had.Photo Mr. Sharma has been sued in Florida and New York several times on allegations of unpaid bills and business deals gone sour.Twice, people have accused him in court of trying to fraudulently sell or lend them cars that he didnt own, and twice he has been evicted for claims that he failed to pay rent.The landlord in Boca Raton, Fla., who evicted him, Steven Fern, said that after Mr. Sharma stopped paying the rent on his condominium, Mr. Sharma promised repeatedly that he would make it up the next month.He stayed the entire time, literally until the day the police came, Mr. Fern said.It was a strange scenario, and we lost a lot of money.Mr. Sharma said that these problems, a few years ago, had happened when he was a kid.He said the landlords statements were not accurate.Sprite, Pinot Grigio and a White Maserati Photo For now, the bigger problem facing Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani is the perjury indictment by a Manhattan grand jury on Oct. 5, just a few days after Centra finished fund-raising.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The charges stem from an incident last year in Manhattan, when Mr. Sharma was arrested early on a Friday in a white Maserati.According to a local news report, Mr. Sharma ran a stop sign and had a flushed face, a strong odor of alcohol on his breath and watery and bloodshot eyes, and was unsteady on his feet.Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani both said during Mr. Sharmas trial that on the night in question, Mr. Sharma had only had Sprite and one glass of pinot grigio, according to the indictment.As defendant Sharma and defendant Trapani knew, the testimony that defendant Trapani gave was false, and the truth was that on March 24, 2016, there were alcoholic beverages other than pinot grigio on the table and the defendant did not order Sprite, the indictment said.Mr. Sharma said that he couldnt speak to the case because it was still going on, but that it should not have any effect on Centra.Im obviously not comfortable with that situation, he said.But its not that I did something so intensely crazy that investors need to worry.He and Mr. Trapani both said they were moving ahead with their big plans for Centra, including more projects with Mr. Mayweather.Mr. Trapani said the company was connected with Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled through social contacts in Miami.Mr. Trapani said Mr. Mayweather was so intrigued by Centras technology that he wanted to be paid in Centra tokens, and wanted to be a partner for future business ventures.Hell do anything we ask, Mr. Trapani said.Hell go shopping around Beverly Hills if we ask him to do it with this card.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The boxing champ understood their deal differently.A spokeswoman for Mr. Mayweather, Kelly Swanson, said he had been paid in cash for the posts and was not involved in any continuing relationship with Centra.She did not say how much he had been paid.After being contacted by The Times, Mr. Mayweather deleted his Instagram and Facebook posts endorsing Centra, though he left up a Twitter post.Mr. Sharma disputed the account of Mr. Mayweathers spokeswoman and said the boxer had received Centra tokens.We dealt with Floyd directly through my guy, Mr. Sharma said.It was a very direct, individual deal.Representatives for DJ Khaled did not respond to requests for comment.Other celebrities have already learned the risks of associating with initial coin offerings.Photo In September, Ms. Hilton endorsed a token known as Lydian Coin on Twitter, where she wrote: Looking forward to participating in the new @LydianCoinLtd Token!Ms. Hilton deleted the post after Forbes reporters uncovered the checkered legal past of the founder of Lydian Coin, who had aimed to raise $100 million.Regulators have been relatively slow to crack down on problematic coin offerings.But the Securities and Exchange Commission did recently bring its first case against what it claimed was a fraudulent project a relatively small one that collected a few hundred thousand dollars.For now, Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani are sitting on the $30 million that investors gave them.Mr. Sharma shared and proved his ownership of the Ethereum wallet where they are currently keeping the money.Assuming regulators dont step in, Mr. Trapani and Mr. Sharma can keep the money, even if they dont build anything.But they say that wont happen.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Sharma said Centra was planning to issue its first batch of debit cards this year, regardless of the denials of Visa and Mastercard, and would unveil its broader technology in November.They have already rented lavish offices in Miami Beach and hired several people.I see us taking over as being the No.1 company that people will use to use their crypto assets, Mr. Sharma said, using an industry term for virtual currencies.Once our proof of concept goes from beta to live, I think that we are going to take market dominance in the full aspect.Some potential investors did not share Mr. Sharmas enthusiasm and discussed their concerns on Reddit and other social media platforms.But those criticisms ended up having less of an impact than the social media nods from Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled.Whats important is Centra is being endorsed and they have a product, a Reddit user named islandsurf wrote back to the critics, explaining his own investment.Thats what matters to investors!
An Explanation of Initial Coin Offerings:::::What does this have to do with existing virtual currencies?These coins are generally inspired by older virtual currency systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum, with a cap on the number of coins that will exist to provide a sense of goldlike scarcity and a structure that allows them to operate entirely outside the existing financial and regulatory ecosystem.Investors generally buy the new coins by sending the programmers Bitcoin or Ether (the virtual currency inside the Ethereum network).Whats more, many of the coins are stored, moved around and enabled by other Ethereum technology.But the coins sold in coin offerings are meant to exist independent of Bitcoin and Ethereum, with their own free-floating value.(For a more complete explanation of Bitcoin, click here, and for an Ethereum explainer, click here.)Is there a relation to initial public offerings of shares in a company?The name for coin offerings was clearly inspired by the initial public offerings that companies do to sell stock to investors.But unlike stock offerings, coin offerings are generally designed so that investors dont get an ownership stake in the start-ups.If the coin does provide an ownership stake, the Securities and Exchange Commission has said, the companies must comply with all securities law.A few coins have done this, but most have tried to avoid it.Investors can contribute as much or as little money as they want in these offerings, which are generally more like crowdfunding campaigns that new projects do on Kickstarter or Indiegogo.Why would anyone pay for these coins?In principle, people buy these coins because they want to use the services on which the coin will be used.So far, though, almost none of the services have been completed.In the meantime, people are buying coins because they are hoping the value will go up.When the Stratis token was released in July 2016, it was worth seven-tenths of a penny.In the fall of 2017, each of those tokens was trading for around $2.95, a 42,000 percent increase.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After the initial coin offering, when the programmers sell their tokens for a set price, coins are traded on third-party exchanges through open-market bidding similar to the way stocks are traded and priced after an I.P.O.The programmers who created the coins generally keep a large stash of coins so that they also benefit if the price goes up.The people betting on the price of these tokens are generally betting that the services promised by the programmers will be completed, creating demand for the coins in the future.Why arent these start-ups raising money through venture capitalists?The most obvious reason to do a coin offering is that you can raise more money than you ever could from venture capitalists.The most valuable virtual-currency company that was funded with venture capital, Coinbase, raised $100 million this year, five years after it was founded.The same day that was announced, Filecoin, which doesnt even have a working product, announced that it had raised over $200 million.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Another plus: Start-ups that raise money through coin offerings dont have to give away ownership of their technology to outside investors.Some programmers look to coin offerings because they can raise money for projects that venture capital wont fund.Specifically, coin offerings can provide funding to build open-source projects that in the end no one will own, the way that no one owns Bitcoin or Ethereum.Filecoins cloud storage network, for instance, would be operated by its users rather than any central company.How do you create your own virtual currency?It is easier than it seems.The software behind Bitcoin and Ethereum is open source, which means that anyone can take the computer code and tweak it to create a virtual currency with slightly different characteristics.There are companies that will do this for you if you are not technologically adept.Convincing people that your new coin will have value is the harder part, and many coins that are released never grow to be worth anything.Some companies have gone the more complicated route of creating their own new software for their coins, with qualities that are very different from Bitcoin and Ethereum.Who can invest in coin offerings?Anyone who has Bitcoin or Ether and is willing to send their money to the creators of a coin offering.Is this illegal?China and South Korea have said it is illegal.In the United States and many other countries, regulators have said some coins should be categorized as securities, like stocks and bonds.If a coin is categorized as a security, it has to follow all relevant securities law, such as registering with the authorities and ensuring that people buying the coins are properly accredited and vetted.Suffice to say, essentially no coin offerings have followed these rules.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Many people are waiting for regulators to crack down.Some are expecting that the first targets will be the exchanges where the coins are traded.What happens if the programmers never build what they promise?Investors dont have much recourse.The most likely outcome will be that the investors will lose the money they put into the project, though people may try to sue.What do real investors think of this?A number of prominent Silicon Valley investors have argued that coin offerings could provide a way to build open-source projects that would not have otherwise received support.Some big names think this will lead to a new generation of open-source internet protocols and loosen the control of big companies like Google and Facebook.Chris Dixon, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, has argued that by enabling the development of new open networks, tokens could help reverse the centralization of the internet, thereby keeping it accessible, vibrant and fair, and resulting in greater innovation.But even sophisticated enthusiasts believe that almost all of the companies currently raising money through coin offerings will fail and lose money for their investors and probably should not happen in the first place.Right now, with all of the enthusiasm for crypto assets out there, I am very concerned that nobody is being careful about anything, Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures, wrote on his blog.
The Post-Equifax Marketing Push: Identity Protection Services:::::In the aftermath of the breach, many Americans half of whom may have had sensitive details exposed in the attack are trying to make sense of the offers flowing in from identity theft services.But these services vary greatly, both in reputation and in offerings, according to fraud and privacy experts.Signing up also requires consumers to entrust yet another corporate entity with their most sensitive data many of the same details stolen in the Equifax breach while entering into legal agreements filled with fine print that leads consumers to give up many rights.Some of the more prominent services also have questionable histories.The Government Accountability Office counts at least 16 federal enforcement actions taken against providers of identity theft protection financial institutions among them for various infractions, according to a March report.LifeLock, for instance, paid $100 million in 2015 to settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission that it failed to secure its users most sensitive data and used deceptive advertising (for the second time).This year, Equifax and TransUnion agreed to pay a combined $23 million to settle a regulators allegations that they tricked consumers into paying for credit scores of questionable value.I personally think its a waste of money, said Avivah Litan, a security analyst at the technology research firm Gartner.She was referring to services that say they scan the dark web, the hard-to-find regions of the internet where, among other things, criminals trade stolen information.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I just assume my data is being sold on the dark web, Ms. Litan said.You should just assume it is stolen, she added, and act accordingly.An estimated 17.6 million people, or about 7 percent of United States residents 16 or older, were victims of identity theft in 2014, according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics report, the latest available.In the vast majority of cases, an unauthorized person tried to gain access to an existing account, such as a bank or credit card account.There are several ways for consumers to protect themselves without buying anything at all, though some experts believe that some independent services can be helpful in certain circumstances.So what exactly do they do?Most identity protection services include some sort of credit monitoring, generally hiring one or more of the big bureaus to track your files for any recent changes.So if there is suspicious activity new credit accounts, a big increase in what you owe, a delinquency youll learn about it after the fact.But identity protection companies promise to go well beyond credit monitoring, with scans of the dark web, public databases, court records, social media and other obscure places.Theyre looking for a variety of items, which might include Social Security numbers, addresses, emails, phone numbers (former ones, too), dates of birth, medical identification numbers and other personal identifying information.They might find it for sale by criminals or already in use.Despite all the scanning and monitoring that these services claim to do, they arent necessarily going to prevent a crime.In some ways, learning that your stolen data is on the dark web is like finding your empty wallet after thieves made off with your cash.You cant get your Social Security number back.But a red flag may be raised after something suspicious happens.The answer is not a silver bullet, said Johan Roets, chief executive of Intersections, the parent company of Identity Guard, an identity protection service.My product is trying to coach people along the way.It has three alerts low, medium and critical that tell consumers why something matters and what to do about it.10 Steps to Help Protect Your Identity Here are some things you can do to safeguard your identity.Some providers monitor the United States Postal Services change-of-address database, according to the Government Accountability Office report, so consumers can correct changes made by someone trying to improperly redirect their mail.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But consumers need to be able to trust that the companies will protect the information they are scanning for.Identity Guard asks consumers to provide 26 pieces of personal data, though Mr. Roets says that data remains on its operational servers and never touches the internet.Identity protection services can be particularly helpful after a theft, experts said.They will take serious ongoing cases of ID theft, especially cross-state, and will help clear it up and shut it down, said Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit research group.IDShield works in this area, in addition to providing identity monitoring.If something bad happens, we do all the work to restore the identity, said Jeff Bell, the chief executive officer of LegalShield, IDShields parent company.We dont catch them in the act, but now we are immediately talking to whoever is making the loan or selling the product and telling them there is a problem here.IDShield works with Kroll, which has licensed private investigators covering every state.The investigators get a limited power of attorney so they can work on the customers behalf with banks, government agencies and other institutions, Mr. Bell explained.The investigators tasks will vary depending on the complexity of the case, but they might also search for additional instances of identity theft and dispute the errors with companies and agencies, including the credit bureaus.If a person with an existing problem wants to hire IDShield, he or she pays a one-time fee of $899, and then a monthly rate of either $9.95 or $19.95.Existing customers are covered by the monthly fee if a problem arises.But again, the risk never goes away entirely, so those monthly fees can add up.A credit freeze, a topic that my colleague Ron Lieber has covered in depth, will prevent some fraud without the monthly fees: It allows consumers to turn off access to their credit files at each of the three bureaus, which blocks thieves from taking out a loan or opening other accounts in their name.Even putting your files on ice, however, wont protect against several other types of fraud that experts like Ms. Litan, from Gartner, worry about even more.That includes the takeover of financial accounts and cellphones (which are used to gain access to bank and other accounts), and fraud related to tax refunds, Social Security payments and other government benefits.When I took Experians pitch and entered my work email address into its dark web scanner, lo and behold, it said my email had shown up in this mysterious netherworld three times last year.Its recommendation?Strengthen my passwords and sign up for its dark web surveillance and identity theft protection services.
Tesla’s Tiered Pricing Is a Hurdle, but a Fair One:::::Those features were costly to develop.This years Model S starts at $68,000, but fully optioned models sell for almost $160,000.If Tesla priced every vehicle at $160,000, its sales would be far too small to cover its formidable development costs.To succeed, it must achieve greater scale, a goal that its new Model 3 sedan promises to promote.But that same goal is also served by its current pricing practices.Tesla was transparent in its portrayal of its offerings.It told buyers that the premium prices for the unrestricted models were for software upgrades that unlocked the potential of the discount models batteries.Buyers who chose premium models might reasonably be viewed as having made voluntary contributions to the companys development costs.If Tesla had charged the same price to every buyer, smaller sales volumes would have required that price to have been even higher than for the premium models.Uniform pricing would have resulted in a worse outcome not only for the company but also for its customers.Thats why its a disservice to call Teslas practice price discrimination.That label makes it almost impossible for neutral observers to approve.As psychologists have long known, sounds that reach our ears provoke at least a weak valence an emotional reaction to their intrinsic attractiveness or unpleasantness.Puppy evokes a positive valence, for example, while snake evokes a negative one.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Psychologists also explain that once weve experienced an initial valence, we activate a cognitive filter that tends to reinforce that assessment.If we react negatively upon first meeting someone, for instance, we tend to interpret ambiguous signals received during further interactions with that person as confirming our initial appraisal.Is discrimination good or bad?For most people, the term evokes a strong negative valence.Any action bearing the label discrimination is destined to be viewed with initial skepticism and with increasing disdain as time passes.Thats unfortunate in this case, because the consequences of Teslas pricing practices are completely benign.In fact, companies like Tesla are practicing what might better be called the hurdle method of differential pricing.Under this method, sellers offer buyers a choice: They can buy the product at list price without further ado, or they can jump over some hurdle to be eligible for a significant discount.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Want a new stove?You can wait for the scratch-and-dent sales that occur periodically, or you can buy one right away at list price.A new blender?You can pay sticker price, or get a nice discount by mailing in a rebate coupon.In Teslas case, you could pay list price for an unrestricted car, or pay substantially less by tolerating the shorter range of a restricted model.From the sellers perspective, the ideal hurdle is one that only price-sensitive buyers are willing to jump.Such hurdles enable sellers to expand their sales by offering significant discounts without having to cut prices for everyone.Once youve spotted a few examples of the hurdle method in action, you will see it everywhere.You may even have trouble finding sellers who do not engage in some variant of the practice.Because production is increasingly accompanied by large fixed research and development costs, differential pricing is becoming increasingly important.As the Duke University economist Philip Cook and I wrote in our 1995 book, The Winner-Take-All Society, roughly 80 percent of the cost of a computer in 1984 was in its hardware, and 20 percent in its software.Only six years later, that proportion was reversed, and this trend has intensified sharply since then.Sellers with high fixed costs cannot remain solvent if they charge each buyer only a small markup over the cost of producing additional units.To cover fixed development costs, some buyers must pay substantially more than marginal cost.Who better to shoulder that burden?The hurdle method allows buyers who care most about a products special features to identify themselves by their refusal to jump the sellers hurdle.That those buyers end up paying a larger share of the products development costs is both fair and economically efficient.Why discourage this practice by giving it a label certain to make people dislike it?Without effective ways to engage in differential pricing, many of the product design features that buyers care most about would quickly disappear.
Farhad and Mike’s Week in Tech: Twitter and Reddit Take a Stand:::::Farhad: Im not going to dignify that with an answer.Anyway, in the run-up to that testimony, Twitter which has been criticized by lawmakers for its response so far announced that it would ban two Russian news organizations from buying Twitter ads.The two news sites are Russia Today and Sputnik, both of which are backed by the Kremlin and are accused of furthering Russian propaganda worldwide.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Mike: I was a bit stumped by this.You could praise Twitter for taking some action against groups that have clearly acted against the interests of the American people.That said, I find it difficult for a tech company to position itself as a stateless platform while also largely adhering to Western value structures.Does Twitter block CNN from Russia if Russia lodges a similar election interference complaint?Farhad: Im not sure how effective this change will be in limiting Russian propaganda, since these outlets will still be allowed to have a presence on Twitter they just cant buy ads.This also puts Twitter in a spot I thought it didnt want to be in; its unclear what policies and guidelines it will use to determine whether a news service is actually a propaganda outfit.Is it government funding?Well, then what about the BBC?Is it aggressively pushing a nationalistic point of view?What about Fox News?This is opening a can of worms.Mike: Yep, fully agree.Twitter is trying to push back a bit on that through the lens of transparency.That is, the company promised to give details to individual users on where the ads are coming from and whos spending money to target them specifically.The company hasnt really dug into the details on that yet, but well see if it actually makes a difference.Reddit Bans Nazis, and Honolulu Bans Distracted Walking Farhad: Russia Today wasnt the only thing that was banned this week.It was a big week in bans!Reddit shut several sections of its site that catered to Nazis and white supremacists.This comes after a policy change that now prohibits content that calls for violence.Its a big change for Reddit, which has long had an anything-goes policy.Mike: We cant really emphasize enough how big of a shift this is for Reddit.As youve said, the site has essentially taken a stance similar to Twitter since its inception: Free speech, no matter how odious you may find it, above all else.That has led Reddit down some dark paths, like refusing to ban outright racist groups and topic pages, not to mention dealing with an entire community devoted to creepshots of underage women.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I dont know what changed in their thinking.Perhaps Reddit, which has raised significant venture financing over the past two years, is trying to present a more polished view of itself in hopes of one day being acquired or going public.Photo Farhad: Meanwhile the city of Honolulu banned looking at your phone while walking.If you look at your phone while crossing the street, police officers can fine you $35 for the infraction.Mike, if they had this ban in San Francisco or New York, Id be very very poor.Mike: I do this thing where if a stranger is looking down at their phone and coming at me on the sidewalk, I refuse to move out of the way.Either they look up at the last minute and apologize, or they run right into me.I dont take a stand on many things, but this is one of them.Anyway, go Honolulu!Snaps Spectacles Flopped Farhad: Finally, there was news about Snap.Remember them?They make a popular messaging app that teenagers love.But apparently they dont love it enough to make them O.K.with goofy glasses.According to The Information, Snap badly overestimated demand for Spectacles, the camera-enabled glasses it released last year.I loved these glasses!I thought they were one of the most innovative gadgets Ive used in a while.Apparently kids dont think like dads.Snap sold only 150,000 pairs of specs, and the company has hundreds of thousands of unsold units in its warehouse.And even those it did sell werent used very much; according to Business Insider, most of the people who bought Specs stopped using them after a few weeks.Mike, are you still wearing your specs?Mike: Sadly, no.But not really for any philosophical or fashion reasons.Basically, its because theyre not prescription and I dont want to start running into walls without my regular glasses on.Does the company insurance plan cover Snap prescriptions?Farhad: Um, somehow I doubt that.O.K., see you next week!
Why Bonds Aren’t Boring Right Now:::::As Laszlo Birinyi, the independent stock strategist who has been correctly bullish since early 2009, wrote in a note to clients this past week: Our strategy remains unchanged.Stay invested, expect higher prices and ignore the noise from both the bulls and the bears.Mr. Birinyi monitors fund flows in and out of stocks closely, and he says they provide a neutral signal.The market continues to forecast a grinding trend, he said.Upward momentum is in the stock markets favor.Bull markets dont simply die of old age, Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, said.We dont see anything on the horizon that would cause the bull market to end.But stocks over all are no longer cheap.While the economy is still growing, despite evident political turmoil in Washington and elsewhere around the globe, it is easy to make a case for extreme caution in the stock market, given its elevated levels.As I wrote in a column this summer, standard practice after a big run-up in stocks is to rebalance meaning, to take profits out of stocks and put them into bonds.The goal is to create a well-diversified portfolio.That is age-old advice.There is a problem with it right now, though: This is not an ideal moment to be putting money into bonds.The immediate outlook for fixed-income investments isnt wonderful, many strategists say.After all, bond prices rallied for many years, too, and are already at high levels.Yields, which move in the opposite direction, are extremely low on a historical basis, though they have been rising lately.A Shaky Month The bond market has been weak in the last month.iShares Core U.S.Aggregate Bond ETF $110.00 109.80 109.60 109.40 109.20 109.00 $109.19 Oct. 08 15 22 The last month, in fact, has been a poor one for bonds.The benchmark Bloomberg Barclays U.S.Aggregate Bond Index declined by half a percentage point.That would be negligible for the broad stock market but its a lot for bonds and it could presage further difficulties ahead.Advertisement Continue reading the main story While its difficult to pinpoint cause and effect, there are several logical explanations for the recent run-up in bond yields and the decline in prices.They appear to be a consequence of expectations for change in both monetary policy orchestrated by the Federal Reserve and other central banks and in fiscal policy, which is the product of politicians in Washington and other capitals.Briefly, the Fed has begun raising short-term interest rates and reversing the expansion of its balance sheet.It says it is likely to keep doing so, assuming that economic growth continues and inflation rises.Those changes in themselves could disrupt the bond market.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Furthermore, speculation about President Trumps choice for Federal Reserve chairman is a factor.Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, has favored relatively low interest rates, but her four-year term ends on Feb. 3.Our view is that some of the alternatives to Janet Yellen are likely to be more hawkish on interest rates, Mr. Ripley said.Ms. Yellen could be reappointed.But other leading candidates include a current Fed governor, Jerome H. Powell, and a Stanford University economics professor, John B. Taylor.Mr. Powell is generally perceived to be close to Ms. Yellen in his views.Mr. Taylor has been a critic of the current Fed and has favored adoption of an algorithm to set monetary policy that could translate into a sharp increase in interest rates.The prospect of Mr. Taylor as Fed chairman has produced a spate of comments like this one, issued by Capital Economics on Wednesday: There is clearly a risk of a more hawkish Fed under Taylors leadership.Then, there are the bond market ripples caused by potential shifts in fiscal policy, including changes in the tax code.The details of an eventual tax overhaul if there is one are impossible to know now.But that hasnt stopped investors from calculating the odds of various outcomes.A combination of rising government deficits and declining Federal Reserve bond holdings could produce the equivalent of an earthquake for fixed-income investors.Yields could rise sharply and prices could plummet.Its only the last few weeks that these possibilities have begun to be priced into bond prices, Mr. Ripley said.The bond market turmoil leaves investors in a bit of a muddle.The central reasons for holding bonds remain intact: Bonds will still buffer a portfolio and generate income.But in the near future, they arent likely to do so as effectively as in the past.Prudent people should temper their expectations.Thats the advice of a man with a formidable track record, John Bogle, who founded Vanguard.Current bond yields are an excellent predictor of returns for the next 10 years, he reminded me in a phone conversation.Based on current yields, he estimated, a portfolio containing a mix of government and corporate bonds is likely to generate an annualized return of only about 3 percent.Thats not much.But its not far behind his expectation for stocks.After the titanic rally, which has produced tremendous profits, he said, stocks have outrun fundamental values through speculation and are, therefore, likely to produce annualized stock returns of only 4 percent over the next decade, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Compared with stocks, he said, bonds are a good value, better than they have been in years.It still makes sense to hold stocks and bonds in a diversified portfolio, he said, and his estimates are only that, estimates.Think it through for yourself, he said, and draw your own conclusions.Just be realistic about them.Invest for the long run but dont expect too much, Mr. Bogle said.If you do that, you wont be disappointed.
What Virtual Reality Can Teach a Driverless Car:::::This is why we think we can move fast, said Luc Vincent, who recently started an autonomous vehicle project at Lyft, Ubers main rival.This stuff didnt exist 10 years ago when Google started.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There are still questions hanging over this research.Most notably, because these algorithms learn by analyzing more information than any human ever could, it is sometimes difficult to audit their behavior and understand why they make particular decisions.But in the years to come, machine learning will be essential to the continued progress of autonomous vehicles.Todays vehicles are not nearly as autonomous as they may seem.After 10 years of research, development and testing, Googles cars are poised to offer public rides on the streets of Arizona.Waymo, which operates under Googles parent company, is preparing to start a taxi service near Phoenix, according to a recent report, and unlike other services, it will not put a human behind the wheel as a backup.But its cars will still be on a tight leash.For now, if it doesnt carry a backup driver, any autonomous vehicle will probably be limited to a small area with large streets, little precipitation, and relatively few pedestrians.And it will drive at low speeds, often waiting for extended periods before making a left-hand turn or merging into traffic without the help of a stoplight or street sign if it doesnt avoid these situations altogether.At the leading companies, the belief is that these cars can eventually handle more difficult situations with help from continued development and testing, new sensors that can provide a more detailed view of the surrounding world and machine learning.Waymo and many of its rivals have already embraced deep neural networks, complex algorithms that can learn tasks by analyzing data.By analyzing photos of pedestrians, for example, a neural network can learn to identify a pedestrian.These kinds of algorithms are also helping to identify street signs and lane markers, predict what will happen next on the road, and plan routes forward.The trouble is that this requires enormous amounts of data collected by cameras, radar and other sensors that document real-world objects and situations.And humans must label this data, identifying pedestrians, street signs and the like.Gathering and labeling data describing every conceivable situation is an impossibility.Data on accidents, for instance, is hard to come by.This is where simulations can help.Recently, Waymo unveiled a roadway simulator it calls Carcraft.Today, the company said, this simulator provides a way of testing its cars at a scale that is not possible in the real world.Its cars can spend far more time on virtual roads than the real thing.Presumably, like other companies, Waymo is also exploring ways that its algorithms can actually learn new behavior from this kind of simulator.Photo Mr. Pratt said Toyota is already using images of simulated roadways to train neural networks, and this approach has yielded promising results.In other words, the simulations are similar enough to the physical world to reliably train the systems that operate the cars.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Part of the advantage with a simulator is that researchers have complete control over it.They need not spend time and money labeling images and potentially making mistakes with these labels.You have ground truth, Mr. Pratt explained.You know where every car is.You know where every pedestrian is.You know where every bicycler is.You know the weather.Others are exploring a more complex method called reinforcement learning.This a major area of research inside many of the worlds top artificial intelligence labs, including DeepMind (the London-based lab owned by Google), the Berkeley AI Research Lab, and OpenAI (the San Francisco-based lab founded by Teslas chief executive Elon Musk and others).These labs are building algorithms that allow machines to learn tasks inside virtual worlds through intensive trial and error.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.DeepMind used this method to build a machine that could play the ancient game Go better than any human.In essence, the machine played thousands upon thousands of Go games against itself, carefully recording which moves proved successful and which didnt.And now, DeepMind and other leading labs are using similar techniques in building machines that can play complex video games like StarCraft.That may seem frivolous.But if machines can navigate these virtual worlds, they can make their way through the physical world.Inside Ubers autonomous car operation, for example, researchers have trained systems to play the popular racing game Grand Theft Auto, with an eye toward applying these methods, eventually, to real world cars.Training systems in simulations of physical locations is the next step.Bridging the gap between the virtual and the physical is no easy task, Mr. Pratt said.And companies must also ensure that algorithms dont learn unexpected or harmful behavior while learning on their own.That is a big worry among artificial intelligence researchers.For this and other reasons, companies like Toyota and Waymo are not building these cars solely around machine learning.They also hand-coded software in more traditional ways in an effort to guarantee certain behavior.Waymo cars dont learn to stop at stop lights, for example.There is a hard and fast rule that they stop.But the industry is headed toward more machine learning, not less.It provides a better way to train the car to do tasks like identifying lane makers, said Waymos vice president of engineering Dmitri Dolgov.But it becomes even more important, he explained, when a car needs a much deeper understanding of the world around it.Robotics and machine learning go hand in hand, he said.

‘Jigsaw’ Carves Up Clooney’s ‘Suburbicon’ at the Box Office:::::Photo LOS ANGELES George Clooney served up a comedic drama that gave Paramount Pictures the worst wide-release opening total in its history.Steven Spielbergs production company delivered a military drama that went widely ignored.The Weinstein Company offloaded a horror movie in very limited release and took in a grand total of $742.Put simply: Hollywood had another horrific weekend at the box office.The No.1 movie was Jigsaw, the eighth installment in the Saw horror series.It took in about $16.3 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data, tying Saw VI for the lowest opening in the franchise, after adjusting for inflation.Analysts had anticipated ticket sales of roughly $20 million for Jigsaw, which received poor reviews.Lionsgate, which spent a modest $10 million to make Jigsaw, also had the No.2 movie.Tyler Perrys Boo 2!A Madea Halloween collected an estimated $10 million, for a two-week total of $35.5 million.According to comScore, domestic ticket sales for October totaled $539 million, a 13 percent decline from the same month last year, when dramas like The Accountant and The Girl on the Train got turnstiles clicking.Explanations for the downturn include the escalating popularity of streaming services Stranger Things 2 arrived on Netflix on Friday and subpar offerings from Hollywood; Mr. Clooneys film, Suburbicon, received a D-minus grade from ticket buyers in CinemaScore exit polls.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After years of focusing on big-budget fantasy movies, Hollywood may also have inadvertently trained people to think of moviegoing as less of a pastime and more as a special event.(Next weekend, Disney will release Thor: Ragnarok in theaters, and ticket sales are expected to be massive.In partial release overseas over the weekend, Thor: Ragnarok collected $107.6 million, beating Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 in some countries.)
Puerto Rico Cancels Whitefish Energy Contract to Rebuild Power Lines:::::Mr. Rossell said he had asked for a federal investigation of the contract award process, and for the power authority to appoint a trustee to review contract bidding.He stressed that no wrongdoing had been discovered, but he said that the contract had become a distraction and that attention had to be refocused on restoring service.I am making this determination because it is in the best interest of the people of Puerto Rico, Mr. Rossell said at a news conference.The contract had been attracting intense scrutiny in Washington.The House Committee on Natural Resources, which oversees Puerto Rican affairs, sent a letter on Thursday to the power authority demanding all records connected to the contract.That same day, the inspector generals office at the Department of Homeland Security said it was investigating.Mr. Rossell also ordered an audit of the contract, and the board that Congress created to oversee Puerto Ricos financial affairs asked a federal court to appoint a new manager to supervise the utility.The chief executive of the power authority, Ricardo Ramos, defended the contract, which he awarded.But he said on Sunday that he understood the governors decision to cancel it because negative publicity and politics on the mainland had made the situation untenable.Mr. Ramos said Whitefish had recently requested security protection because people had started throwing rocks and bottles at the companys crews on the island, in the belief that the contract had been awarded corruptly.If you are in your house without power, and theres a sense that the energy authority gave away $300 million to a company that either had or did not have experience, the reaction is not positive, and were seeing that, Mr. Ramos said.Democrats on the mainland and opposition politicians in Puerto Rico questioned the deal and were alarmed to see that the companys chief executive, Andy Techmanski, came from the same small town in Montana as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.In an interview shortly after securing the contract, Mr. Techmanski told a local news station that he had been in touch with Mr. Zinke, whose son worked for Whitefish last summer, for more resources.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Both the Department of the Interior and Mr. Techmanski denied any impropriety in connection with the contract.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.When the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yuln Cruz, raised questions about the contract, the company fired back on Twitter, suggesting that it could withdraw its crews from her city.The company later apologized.In a statement on Friday, FEMA said it had not confirmed whether prices listed in the contract between Whitefish and the power authority were reasonable.Mr. Ramos said the prices were in line with what other companies had requested.In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Ramos said he had not heard of Whitefish before September.We checked them out on the internet, he said.There was a list of projects that they had done in the past, including with the Department of Energy.They showed a lot of experience in using helicopters to build transmission lines.On paper, they did have the experience necessary.Mr. Ramos had earlier said that Whitefish got the deal over competitors like PowerSecure because it did not ask for a large payment up front.Other companies, wary of Prepas bankruptcy, had demanded hefty sums, he said.Mr. Ramos said on Sunday that the contract was being canceled because attention had shifted from managing a humanitarian crisis to managing reputations.Thats risky, he said.I want to clarify that the cancellation of this contract does not mean there was anything outside the law, or out of the ordinary.He said the power authority had already paid Whitefish or been billed about $20.8 million for work done so far, and would have to reimburse the company for the cost of returning helicopters, trucks and other equipment from Puerto Rico to the United States.He said that work that was already in progress would be completed by Whitefish.Mr. Ramos said he would send a letter to the electric company board asking for a resolution formally ending the contract, and that the board would meet Monday or Tuesday to address the matter.The cancellation would take effect 30 days after a resolution is adopted.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Whitefish said in a statement on Sunday that it was very disappointed at the cancellation.The decision will only delay what the people of Puerto Rico want and deserve to have the power restored quickly in the same manner their fellow citizens on the mainland experience after a natural disaster, the statement said.We will certainly finish any work that Prepa wants us to complete, and stand by our commitments, knowing that we made an important contribution to the restoration of the power grid since our arrival on the island on Oct. 2.The company said it had already finished work on two major transmission lines, significantly speeding up the restoration of power to the city of Manat and to parts of San Juan.In interviews this month, Mr. Techmanski said he had flown to Puerto Rico before the contract was signed with Prepa on a leap of faith, and that his companys ability to mobilize quickly was vital to winning the contract.Asked this month how such a small company could manage such a big job, Mr. Ramos of Prepa said, Every company is small at some point in time.Criticism was also targeted at the Army Corps of Engineers, which was given responsibility by the Trump administration for restoring power in Puerto Rico and had no involvement in the Whitefish deal.Governor Rossell said he was led to believe that the Corps would restore power throughout the island within 40 days, but that it has just seven engineering crews on the island.Everyone has their role here, and the Corps of Engineers, honestly, has not played its role, Mr. Rossell said.The Corps contracted two companies, and those companies are in the process of subcontracting.This does not have the sense of urgency that it should have.Mr. Rossell said the governors of New York and Florida had now agreed to send utility crews to Puerto Rico.Such mutual aid arrangements are common after emergencies, and are usually invoked immediately.But the power authority has said it did not seek that kind of aid after the hurricane because having the Army Corps of Engineers do the restoration work would have spared it from paying anything.Jos E. Snchez, the head of the Corpss energy restoration task force, defended its work in a statement.We understand the frustration by the governor of Puerto Rico, and realize the importance of restoring power as quickly as possible, Mr. Snchez said.We continue to expedite the delivery of crews, material and equipment to the island in support of this urgent effort.We will not be satisfied until the people of Puerto Rico have safe and reliable power.
Refusing Weinstein’s Hush Money, Rose McGowan Calls Out Hollywood:::::She said she told her lawyer to pull the offer within a day of The New York Times publishing an article that detailed decades of Mr. Weinsteins alleged sexual harassment, aggression and misconduct toward women, as well as at least seven other settlements he had reached with accusers.After that, the dam burst, with The New Yorker, The Times and other news outlets reporting on dozens of other womens experiences with Mr. Weinstein.Photo Mr. Weinstein, his accusers say, built his long history of abusing women on a risky gamble that worked for him over and over the assumption that money or threats could buy womens silence on a subject so intimate and painful that most would prefer not to go public anyway.While Ms. McGowan was the rare voice suggesting that the cover-up was not fail-safe, even she considered not naming him, having already, she believes, paid a career price for that long-ago episode and its aftermath.A Weinstein spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said that Mr. Weinstein unequivocally denies any allegations of nonconsensual sex.Ms. McGowans lawyer, Paul Coggins, confirmed that Ms. McGowan received the offer.By 2015, Ms. McGowan, who felt alienated by the industry, started using her sizable platform on Twitter to maximize her status as both insider and outsider someone with enough Hollywood experience to speak with authority about sexism within it, and someone liberated enough from its compromises to unleash the fury in her that had been building for years.Only now does the scope of the news about Mr. Weinstein and the public conversation about whats wrong with Hollywood seem to match the scale of her outrage, giving her the clout of a contrarian at last proven right.On Friday, at the inaugural Womens Convention in Detroit, she was a featured speaker a new, combative face of feminism, endowed with Hollywood charisma yet anything but slick.I have been silenced for 20 years, she told the gathering.I have been slut-shamed.I have been harassed.I have been maligned.And you know what?Im just like you.A Crusade Gathers Strength As other women told their stories in recent weeks, Ms. McGowan not only addressed what happened to her but also attacked those she considered complicit.Photo When the actor Ben Affleck claimed he never knew of Mr. Weinsteins history, she wrote in a tweet: GODDAMNIT!I TOLD HIM TO STOP DOING THAT you said that to my face, adding, The press conf I was made to go to after assault.You lie.(Mr. Affleck declined to comment.)She called out the larger apparatus of Hollywood, criticizing talent agencies you are guilty of human trafficking, she wrote and a film studio that she believed knew of Mr. Weinsteins alleged misconduct.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When Twitter suspended her account the company said that it was because she had published a private phone number users retaliated with a boycott that drew support from celebrities such as the actress Alyssa Milano and the writer Cheryl Strayed.The actor and filmmaker Jordan Peele tweeted, in response to Ms. McGowans blistering attacks, a moody still of her from Grindhouse in which she surveys burning wreckage her character has wrought.Get em, Rose, he wrote.On Oct. 13, the day of the boycott, Ms. McGowan retreated from Los Angeles, where she had been working on her memoir, to a beach cottage in Hawaii, safely ensconced behind two gates, near a park locals call the City of Refuge.I wanted to come to a place that had so much power to it, that it could hold a lot at bay a lot of monster energy, said Ms. McGowan, sitting at a picnic table near the ocean.I came to a place that almost has a protective zone around it.Her hair was short, but not shaven, as it had been in the past.Once featured on the covers of Maxim and Rolling Stone as a longhaired, barely dressed object of desire, Ms. McGowan seems to have settled on an aesthetic of chic simplicity.If not a time of celebration, this moment could be perceived as a moment of vindication for Ms. McGowan.Yes, she said, she sometimes feels like laughing kind of like a witchs cackle, she clarified.But at other times she feels emotionally raw, just knowing that a click on her phone would bring her to conversations others were having about her assault allegation.The phone had come to feel too powerful: Its like a live wire that youre holding in your mouth, and it goes directly to your brain, she said.The Meeting and the Aftermath Her story of assault, although uniquely her own, shares some of the now familiar hallmarks of a Weinstein encounter.Ms. McGowan, then 23, was in Park City, Utah, in early 1997 to attend the Sundance Film Festival and the screening of a film in which she appeared, Going All the Way.She had also recently appeared as a smart-mouthed beauty who dies a gruesome death in the blockbuster film Scream, on which Mr. Weinstein was an executive producer.Got a confidential news tip?The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.Ms. McGowans manager then, Jill Messick, told her to meet Mr. Weinstein at the restaurant in the Stein Eriksen Lodge for a 10 a.m. appointment.On her arrival, the matre d directed the actress upstairs to Mr. Weinsteins suite, she said.Ms. McGowan remembers passing two male assistants on the way in.They wouldnt look me in the eye, she recalled.She sat at the far end of a couch as Mr. Weinstein sat in a club chair, and they had a brief business meeting.But on their way out, she said, he interrupted himself to point out that the hotel room had a hot tub.And then what happened, happened, said Ms. McGowan, who has described her experience, on Twitter, as rape.Suffice it to say a door opened and my life changed.She declined to share the details of the encounter.Thats my story to tell, she said emphatically.But she said that she walked out of the hotel suite and directly into a press event.She remembers fighting back tears, and the conversation with Mr. Affleck.She said she told Ms. Messick, then of Addis-Wechsler & Associates, what had occurred.She held me, Ms. McGowan said.She put her arms around me.But in the months to come, Ms. McGowan did not feel supported by her management team.She was referred to a lawyer specializing in sexual harassment and assault cases who, Ms. McGowan said, gave her the impression that filing a criminal charge was hopeless.She was like, Youre an actress, youve done a sex scene, youre done, she recalled.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Anne Woodward, now a manager herself, was a young assistant in Ms. Messicks office at the time, and was in on many of Ms. Messicks calls.I remember that Rose was extremely upset and did not want to settle, Ms. Woodward said.She wanted to fight.No one around her, as Ms. Woodward recalls, supported that instinct.It was an emotionally shocking way to see a woman being treated, Ms. Woodward said.Thats what stuck with me.Photo Nick Wechsler, then a principal at Addis-Wechsler & Associates, said that he and his partner, Keith Addis, met with Mr. Weinstein at Ms. Messicks request and confronted him with Ms. McGowans claim.I remember Harvey saying he was going to get psychiatric treatment or some kind of therapy for his sexual behavior, Mr. Wechsler said.Ms. McGowan initially asked for about $25,000, enough money to cover her therapy; by the time she signed the settlement, the amount had been raised to $100,000.Both Ms. Woodward and Ms. McGowan were shocked when, only a few months afterward, Ms. Messick accepted a job working as vice president for development at Miramax, then run by Mr. Weinstein.Ms. Messick did not respond to a request for comment.At the time of the alleged assault, Ms. McGowan had finally been emerging from the trials of an insecure childhood, with loving but unconventional parents: Her father, said his sister, Rory McGowan, Roses aunt, almost certainly had undiagnosed manic-depressive disorder.He was the leader of a religious cult in Italy, from which Roses grandmother extracted her before she reached middle school.Both parents were hippie intellectuals, members of the counterculture who taught their children to prize independent thinking and buck the system.Maddie Corman, an actress who befriended Ms. McGowan in the mid-90s, perceived a change in Ms. McGowan after the 1997 episode (she says she was aware of the settlement, but could not recall if she learned it directly from Ms. McGowan or from others).Rose was never this sweet, simple soul there was always something ferocious about her, Ms. Corman said.After that assault, a light dimmed.I remember her souring on the powers that be.And she became very protective of us.It was sometimes cryptic: Keep your guard up.Ms. McGowans friends watched as she made choices that surprised them, including beginning a relationship with Marilyn Manson, a controversial rock star and ordained Satanist who has called himself the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles.(I ran away for three years and joined the circus, Ms. McGowan said of that romantic involvement.)She showed up for the red carpet at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1998 in a dress made of tiny beads that left her nearly nude.That was my first big public appearance after being assaulted, she said.And I thought you want to see a body?I did it with a giant middle finger.Photo Camilla Rantsen was also a young actress in Los Angeles who was close to Ms. McGowan, and was aware, only through friends, of what had transpired.I think some of the people she started surrounding herself with werent as great as the people she had before, said Ms. Rantsen, who is now a writer.Plenty of young actresses with promising starts see their careers founder for one reason or another.But Ms. McGowan believes that after she finished up work on Phantoms, a 1998 film produced by Miramax, her career suffered because collaborations with Weinstein productions were for many years off the table.And they were doing the kinds of movies that I would be doing, she said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She continued to work, on Charmed until 2006, but also in independent films.Eventually, she appeared in both of the two films packaged as Grindhouse, directed by Robert Rodriguez, with whom she was romantically involved, and by Quentin Tarantino.It was distributed by Dimension, run by Bob Weinstein, Harveys brother.As the film critic David Edelstein put it in New York, Ms. McGowan played the ultimate abused-and-fetishized action-movie femme.The experience, Ms. McGowan said, left her shattered.I was really lost at that point, she said.I was damaged.Shunning Celebrity It is impossible to predict how Ms. McGowans career path in film would have proceeded had the episode with Mr. Weinstein never occurred.She is an unconventional figure, occasionally provocative and profane, but also sometimes old-fashioned and even formal in spirit.I never considered myself a celebrity, she said at one point.I hate that word.Its tawdry.Ms. McGowan became an increasingly outspoken voice for women mistreated by Hollywood.In 2015, she was dropped from her agency after mocking a casting call that encouraged women to wear push-up bras in auditions.(Her agent had been fired a few days earlier, but the agency did not fight to retain her, as agencies typically do of valued clients.)Photo In The Hollywood Reporter, she passionately defended Rene Zellweger last year from what she perceived as sexist comments in Variety about the actresss plastic surgery.How dare you bully a woman who has done nothing but try to entertain people like you?she wrote, in a direct accusation of the pieces writer, Owen Glieberman.It was startling and inspiring to see someone who was willing to put herself out there in support of other women/actresses, said the actress Molly Ringwald in an email to The Times.Her tenacity is something that you would hope for in an union leader but of course never really get.And Ms. McGowan spoke, in veiled terms, to the Buzzfeed reporter Kate Aurthur in 2015 about her experience as an assault victim.You are taking part of someones soul, she said.Its happened to me.Last year, during a Twitter campaign called #WhyWomenDontReport, she all but named Mr. Weinstein as the perpetrator of the violence against her that she had mentioned in the past.During her recent visit to Hawaii, Ms. McGowan, over a day and a half in Kona, revealed a person much more playful than her fierce Twitter persona.She would interrupt a thought to smile and smell a flower that caught her eye; she could not resist a swing hanging from a large tree, and enjoyed twirling an umbrella the same blue as her sundress while walking on the beach.She seemed free, in some ways, from both a long-kept secret and a labor of love that had occupied her for the last year and a half her book, Brave, which will be released by Harper One early next year.To some degree, she had shielded herself from the news.But when she learned how many women had stepped forward to complain of assault or harassment by Mr. Weinstein, she said: I knew we are legion.We are legion.She had been corresponding lately with Asia Argento, an Italian actress who also accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual assault (and was subsequently shamed by the Italian press).It feels, Ms. McGowan wrote to Ms. Argento, reading from her text, like toxic slime going out of a spiked birth canal.Thats what the whole experience feels like to me.Its an intense process.Sometimes she feels fresh rage.But Ill tell you what I dont feel anymore, she said.Despair.
Virtual Reality Gets Naughty:::::You can pretend like you are in the bedroom with me, and it is someone you have a crush on, she said.You are in the experience.Photo While virtual-reality pornography may feel like something out of a science fiction movie, it already has a formidable, if underground, presence.According to website Pornhub, views of VR porn are up 275 percent since it debuted in the summer of 2016.Now the site is averaging about 500,000 views (on Christmas Day in 2016, this number shot up to 900,000.)By 2025 pornography will be the third-largest VR sector, according to estimates prepared by Piper Jaffray, an investment and management firm.Only video games and N.F.L.-related content will be larger, it predicted, and the market will be worth $1 billion.Were getting more and more of it every day, said Mark Kernes, a senior editor at AVN Media Network, which covers the industry.We are leading the technology in this area.Sex sells, and where there is money to be made, there will be entrepreneurs who want to adopt it and make money from it, some by offering it for free to increase clicks.Pornography is what rushed along the first printing press, and spurred developments in the internet, online payment systems and other technology.Now its time for virtual reality, Mr. Kernes said: Im pretty sure there is more porn VR out there than regular VR.Headsets Are Just the Beginning Ms.Darling first experienced regular old VR at E3, a conference for the video-game industry.Excited by the pornography possibilities, she found a college student on Reddit who knew the technology but lacked a star.Before long, Ms.Darling started streaming weekly VR segments live from her bedroom in Los Angeles.Photo She was one of the first VR webcam women, according to Mr. Kernes.She then started a company named VRTube.xxx, which now employs over 40 performers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Though the pornography industry as a whole is challenging to regulate, considering the potential for abuse, disease and exploitation, the virtual kind comes with extra moral and maybe legal issues.For example, can you use someones likeness to have sex with them in virtual reality?Virtual reality is like the Wild Wild West, said Bryony Cole, the host of Future of Sex, a podcast that explores technology and sexuality.At this years AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, a convention and trade show held each January in Las Vegas, the latest advancements in virtual reality pornography were on display.CamSoda, a website that specializes in live sex videos, had an exhibit featuring pornography stars dressed in plunging bathing suits and waving visitors into the booth.They were showing off OhRama, a small canister that attaches to virtual reality headsets and releases scent during the action.Believe it or not, the scents were created by the girls, said Mr. Kernes, who was there.Its sweet and musty.They know what they like.Photo There are also companies that are adding taste and touch to the experience.Another big player is CamasutraVR, a start-up using 142 cameras that all look at one person, or one body part.They are creating images from that, which they are hoping will be indistinguishable from an actual person, Mr. Kernes said.Im sure those people wished they had been using that VR system at home.Still other virtual reality companies were showing off their partnerships with sex toy companies to create vibrators or penis pumps that link to VR material.As the action ramps up so does the vibrations of the vibrator, he said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.One of the most buzzed-about inventions has been the sex robot.The first one, Harmony, was introduced in May by a company named Realbotix.In seductive videos posted on YouTube, Harmony shows off her long legs, her firm breasts, her full lips, her lifelike hand gestures, even her intellect.How do you feel about sex?an unknown presenter asks her in one video.Sex is one of the most fascinating things in the world, she responds in a raspy voice.I dont see anything wrong with it.Harmony can connect with virtual reality so the user can interact with her in that space; she can perform all the acts the viewer is watching.Its a little bit of a video game combined with sci-fi, said Matt McMullen, the C.E.O.and creative director of Realbotix.The company has been making dolls for 20 years that were linked to artificial intelligence but not virtual reality.Based on our experiences with thousands of clients, Mr. McMullen said, people do use them for sex, but there is something more that exists.We focus on companionship.Photo Virtual reality has been nicknamed the empathy machine because it allows people to feel like they are truly connected to the action.Its neurological, said Holly Richmond, a somatic psychologist based in Los Angeles and Portland, Ore. You arent just watching and thinking about it.You are feeling it, and its not just your genitals.There is literally a mind-body connection.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When Ms.Darling does live X-rated performances, users can leave comments and chat to one another on the side of the screen.The people who are in virtual reality tell the other people watching me in 2-D to stop being jerks and knock it off, she said.They feel like they know me and are in the bedroom with me.Many sex therapists and educators are interested in the new technology, just as a dentist might be with the latest plaque-detection gizmos.Ms. Richmond worked with BaDoinkVR, a virtual-reality company in Rochester, N.Y., to create Virtual Sexology, a series of free videos that help men and women overcome common sex problems.A recent video, updated in June, takes women into the bedroom where they see how one blond, busty woman arouses herself before sex.She sits in front of her partner massaging her arms, her legs, her breasts.As her breathing heats up, a voice-over says that some women need to be physically touched before feeling any desire for sex.The first video, aimed at men, was the most downloaded video on BaDointVR.com in 2016 an impressive feat considering it was competing with noneducational pornography.Ms. Cole, the podcast host, is most excited about how virtual reality can be used in sex education.What if we had young people watch videos where they practice consent or practice identifying at-risk behaviors?she said.Or they can be in a room with someone who said, I contacted herpes and this is my experience.That is way more informative than a gonorrhea slide.Photo Indeed.Barbara Rothbaum, a professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine and the director of Emorys Veterans Program, is studying how virtual reality can help treat people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder caused by military sexual trauma.The program is building scenes that take victims to barracks, tents, private living quarters, latrines, offices or remote buildings and vehicles, where the trauma may have taken place.The idea is that going back to these places virtually will help victims confront their memories so they can move forward with more internal peace.But for virtual reality to work, the scenes have to be so lifelike that users get lost in them and take them for reality.They have to feel like they are participants, not just observers.We can create 3-D bodies in virtual reality and do whatever we want with them, Ms. Cole said.As the technology becomes good enough to make that happen, issues are bound to arise.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. McCullen said an issue his company has is clients commissioning dolls that look exactly like people they know in real life, maybe an ex-girlfriend they never got over or someone about whom they fantasize.His company requires written consent from the model for his or her likeness to be used.Ms. Cole said VR companies are going to have to address this same problem as they get better at customizing avatars to look exactly like what their customers desire.What are the lines between reality and fantasy and what can we do in this space?she said.What does consent mean in virtual reality?Can you do something to your girlfriend in virtual reality that you wouldnt do in real life?If you are using someones likeness in virtual reality, do you require their permission?And what about revenge porn?That will be even harsher in virtual reality.She is worried about the technology assimilating into the culture as easily as dating apps, drawing people away from flesh-and-blood encounters.Certainly partners will also have to negotiate whether virtual-reality sex constitutes cheating.It is, after all, much more lifelike than traditional pornography.But Mr. McCullen said a lot of people accuse his sex robot of doing that, but he believes he is helping alleviate a bad situation, not causing it.There are people who are already lonely, and people who live their lives being alone.They work all day and come home to an empty house, he said.This is just offering an alternative to those types of people.They dont have anyone else.
Amazon Key Is a Lot Less Scary Than My Post-1-Click Remorse:::::So, too, may more information about our choices, according to a 2008 study, The Blissful Ignorance Effect: Pre versus PostAction Effects on Outcome Expectancies Arising From Precise and Vague Information, published in The Journal of Consumer Research.Researchers found that the less knowledge consumers had about something before a purchase, the better they expected it to be and the more they convinced themselves that they liked it afterward.This reduction of cognitive dissonance is easier inside and after leaving a store, which never reveals anything negative about its products and doesnt typically burden the consumer with an onslaught of information that might impede an impulse purchase.But the sprawling internet bazaar is filled with scathing critiques, and every pertinent spec exists somewhere online for the diligent buyer to seek out.That one-star rating is hard to forget when your product is failing in the exact way the unhappy reviewer described.The most obvious difference between brick-and-mortar and online shopping is physicality, both of the item itself and the consumers presence in the store.Beyond the potential pitfall of not getting exactly what you thought you were buying online, a problem that is minimized when you can assess the product in person, the lack of tactile interaction may reduce our connection to the object.Martin Lindstrom, the author of several books on branding, has conducted studies on what makes consumers buy a product and how they feel about it after.In one, 34 percent of people who asked an employee for a product in a supermarket and were made to touch it ended up buying it; just 21 percent did if the employee merely pointed it out to them.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of 20 subjects, when the senses of smell and touch were paired with pictures of a product, the right medial orbitofrontal cortex, a region of the brain involved in the perception of pleasantness, was activated more strongly than when those senses were independently engaged.(On its own, smell was the most important sense.)The tactile experience doesnt end in the checkout line.After purchasing an item, the consumer typically takes it home.This act of carrying it into ones domestic space can bolster ones proprietary pride: You are now responsible for its existence in your world.That act, plus roaming through aisles beforehand and going from shop to shop, can also be physically and mentally tiring.But ordering online for an anonymous deliveryman to leave the item at ones doorstep or, with the help of Amazon Key, just inside is impersonal and not enervating.Its the difference between the estrangement of ordering takeout and the intimacy of cooking for oneself.And a pavement-pounding, shop-till-you-drop marathon may recall an even more primal method for acquiring nutrients.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Youre coming back to hunters and gatherers, Mr. Lindstrom said of in-store purchases.Dopamine kicks in when were buying stuff theres a reptile brain that tells us we need to gather things before winter happens.The more we have to fight for things, the less likely we are to return it after.When its delivered on Amazon Prime, you forget it was so hard to get this product.The tactility of how one finalizes the transaction itself can have an effect on remorse, too.Mr. Lindstrom found that 93 percent of consumers feel a stronger connection to cash than to credit cards and are more careful when spending with it.Likewise, for the least tactile connection he studied, Amazons 1-Click Ordering, 70 percent of respondents said it made them spend more money than even with a credit card.But whereas cash-based transactions lead to more immediate remorse, 89 percent of shoppers said they feel guiltier when they receive their credit card statements after 1-Click orders than when they pay in cash.The remorse still exists with online shopping; its just deferred, with extra pain later.Shopping on a website featuring attractive models or beautiful homes may engender the same sense of inadequacy that leafing through catalogs can, unlike picking them up in person, and that visual memory may linger when the object has been delivered, leading to remorse.Buying something online can also lead quickly to a social-media search after the fact for friends and strangers superior products (or better use of the same product).The sneakers I bought in this troublesomely bottomless marketplace were for casual wear, but I also needed a new pair of running shoes, a purchase that I undertook with more serious online research: reading reviews from specialized publications and individual users, comparing models from different years, taking quizzes to determine what was best for my particular stride.But even the highest-rated sneakers had their detractors, and those damning, all-caps review headlines (SHODDILY MADE, THEY RUINED IT) made me hesitate whenever I was on the verge of adding them to my virtual shopping cart.A week after searching in vain and the ensuing deluge of targeted ads, I visited a nearby running store.I tried on a few pairs and solicited opinions from one employee, then picked the sneakers that felt best.Within 20 minutes I was walking out with them, glad to have given my money to a local business over a soulless national chain.There is undoubtedly a better running shoe out there for me, and I could probably find it if I spent enough time scouring the internet.But je ne regrette rien.
Hearing Amazon’s Footsteps, the Health Care Industry Shudders:::::An Amazon spokeswoman, Lori Torgerson, refused to comment on rumors or speculation about Amazon entering the pharmacy business, but she shared a statement that suggested other motivations for the paperwork.Wholesale licenses are required for Amazon Business to sell professional-use only medical devices in certain states, she said.There is little doubt, though, that Amazon is interested in at least some aspects of the pharmacy business.Brittain Ladd, a supply chain consultant who worked at Amazon until earlier this year on groceries and other initiatives, said he participated in discussions about how Amazon could enter the category, including through acquisitions.The pharmacy business was always a topic of interest when I was with Amazon, and there was a sincere desire on the part of Amazon to create a better customer experience across pharmacy and health care as a whole, he said.While Mr. Ladd said he isnt privy to the companys current strategy, he believes existing pharmacy companies are right to be worried.My advice is that executives at pharmaceutical companies should crush all assumptions when it comes to Amazon and their ability to enter, innovate and reimagine the pharmacy business and health care, he said.If Amazon decides to enter the market, it could take a variety of avenues, analysts said.The easiest way in would be to set up a mail-order pharmacy that focused on price-sensitive customers without health insurance or who have high-deductible plans that require them to pay for some drug costs upfront.To do this, Amazon would need retail pharmacy licenses in every state a hurdle, certainly, but not an insurmountable one, the analysts said.They can at least dip their toe in the water with the cash-pay customers, and learn the business, said Ana Gupte, an analyst for Leerink Partners.She said cash-paying customers account for 5 percent to 10 percent of the $560 billion prescription drug business.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The idea could prove attractive to customers who already go to Amazon for a wide range of shopping items, from shoes to electronics to diapers.Retailers like Target and Walmart have added pharmacies to bring in extra business for a similar reason.Amazons recent acquisition of Whole Foods could also provide a physical location for pharmacies.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.A large part of the infrastructure is already there, said David Maris, an analyst for Wells Fargo.In a call with analysts this week, Timothy C. Wentworth, the chief executive of the pharmacy-benefit manager Express Scripts, indicated a willingness to work with Amazon to reach these cash-paying customers.We certainly see that as something where if they wanted to move into a space, we could be a very natural collaborator, he said.If Amazon wanted to go bigger, Ms. Gupte and others said, it could sell to insured customers and even serve as a pharmacy-benefit manager, overseeing drug coverage for people on behalf of insurers and large employers.This would be far more complex.It would likely require Amazon to either acquire a pharmacy-benefit manager or enter into a partnership with an existing one.Expanding the pharmacy business without the aid of a major pharmacy-benefit manager would be tough, because the benefit managers serve as gatekeepers to insured patients, deciding which pharmacies they can and cannot use.The benefit managers also operate their own mail-order pharmacies, which might make them less willing to accommodate Amazon.Some said they expect that if Amazon chooses to enter the health care business, it would do so in a big way.The company could attempt to provide comprehensive services to patients, doctors and others, far beyond selling drugs.Nadina J. Rosier, the health and group benefits pharmacy practice leader at Willis Towers Watson, said other areas the company could explore include offering virtual doctor consults, or using the Amazon Echo, its voice-controlled smart device, for health care applications.No matter the short-term steps Amazon is taking, Ms. Rosier said, her research has demonstrated that it is clearly looking to revolutionize how health care is delivered in some way.But while Amazon has a track record for upending major industries, from books to groceries, she said health care is complicated and there would be intense pressure to get it right.It is just a sensitive topic, she said.We dont have as much scrutiny of how much you paid for your jeans, or your shoes.
Mark Halperin Apologizes to Women He ‘Mistreated’:::::Photo One day after losing a TV gig, a book deal and an HBO project in the wake of several sexual harassment claims, the political journalist Mark Halperin has released a long statement apologizing to the women he said he mistreated.In his statement, posted to his Twitter feed on Friday evening, Mr. Halperin owned up to what he described as several years of inappropriate behavior.Toward the end of my time at ABC News, I recognized that I had a problem, he said.No one had sued me, no one had filed a human resources complaint against me, no colleague had confronted me.But I didnt need a call from HR to know that I was a selfish, immature person, who was behaving in a manner that had to stop.Mr. Halperin said that he took weekly counseling sessions after he left ABC News in 2007, while adding that some of the allegations that have been made against me are not true.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the statement, he also said that his workplace misconduct stopped after he left ABC.Those who have worked with me in the past decade know that my conduct in subsequent jobs at Time, Bloomberg, NBC News and Showtime has not been what it was at ABC, he wrote.I did not engage in improper behavior with colleagues or subordinates.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.CNN reported late Wednesday that five women had accused Mr. Halperin of sexual harassment in his time at ABC.Since then, additional women have accused him of unwanted sexual advances, including claims made in a new CNN article that published around the same time that Mr. Halperin posted his statement.The Daily Beast also published an article Friday evening naming a woman who accused Mr. Halperin of inappropriate behavior as recently as 2011.By the end of Thursday, Mr. Halperins media empire had begun to collapse.MSNBC, where Mr. Halperin was a regular on Morning Joe, said it was parting ways with Mr. Halperin until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood.HBO said it was dropping a planned television adaptation of his coming Game Change book because it has no tolerance for sexual harassment within the company or its productions.Penguin Press then said it would not publish the book, which is about the 2016 presidential election.As with titles about previous elections, Mr. Halperin was writing the book with John Heilemann.
Brazil Draws Broad Interest in Offshore Oil Drilling Rights:::::Winning bids were determined by one criterion: what share of the oil produced would go to the state.Each of the eight blocks potentially has at least one billion barrels of recoverable reserves, according to Ricardo Bedregal, the director of upstream Latin America for the global energy consultancy IHS Markit.Photo Brazil currently has 14 billion barrels of proven reserves, according to the National Agency of Petroleum, known as the A.N.P.in Portuguese.The auction Friday was the first devoted exclusively to the deepest Brazilian offshore oil fields, which sit beneath a thick layer of salt, since 2013.It also followed Brazils easing of restrictions on foreign companies.Early in the century Brazil was among the hottest oil regions in the world.But the global energy landscape has changed significantly in recent years, with oil prices stabilizing at levels well below those of a decade ago.Mexico and other countries are also opening up their oil fields and the United States has produced a glut with a shale-oil boom.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Many experts wondered if international companies would still show interest in Brazil.Sixteen companies signed up to take part in the auction, including most of the major American and European companies.Oil experts say a key reason for the interest was that exploration in the deepwater oil fields known as pre-salt, for their blanket of salt has become less risky and cheaper over the years.The costs have fallen because of technology, said David Zylbersztajn, a former head of A.N.P.Pre-salt today is much more competitive and much more productive than was ever imagined, he said.Mr. Bedregal concurred, giving credit to Petrobras.Through technology and better knowledge of geology, Petrobras and their partners have managed to reduce costs, he said.He said that in the early days, an exploration well for pre-salt fields would cost up to $250 million, but that the expense had now fallen to $90 million.On average, he estimated, the break-even price of oil for pre-salt construction projects is $35 a barrel.
Saudi Arabia Is Open for Business, but Not Everybody’s Buying:::::RIYADH, Saudi Arabia On a recent trip to Saudi Arabia, Richard Branson, the British entrepreneur who created the Virgin Group, was so inspired by the blue waters along the Red Sea coast that he stripped down to his swimsuit before his helicopter even landed.Since then, he has become one of the Saudi governments biggest international business allies as it seeks to start three new megaprojects aimed at diversifying its oil-dependent economy.The projects are staggering in their ambition, if short on details.One is a business hub run on sustainable energy and staffed by robots.Another is an entertainment city near the capital, Riyadh.Mr. Branson is considering building inside one of those and is consulting on the third, an eco-tourism complex on islands in the Red Sea.Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy historically known for its oil and its hyperconservative version of Islam, which requires women to wear full-length robes in public and gives them fewer legal rights than men.That the kingdom is betting its future on solar power, high tech and entertainment realms in which it has virtually no background is a sign of how determined the leadership is to modernize.
Trump Plans to Shrink Two National Monuments in Utah:::::Earlier on Friday, Mr. Zinke met with Mr. Trump to discuss the recommendations.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, said a final report would be released shortly.She did not confirm whether the president has signed off on it in part or in whole.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Im not going to get ahead of the presidents announcement on the specifics of that, but I can tell you he will be going to Utah in the first part of early December and we will release more details at that point, if not before, Ms. Sanders said.A spokeswoman from the Interior Department did not respond to requests for comment.Environmental groups denounced the decision.Video It is a disgrace that the President wants to undo the nations first national monument created to honor Native American cultural heritage.And a travesty that hes trying to unravel a centurys worth of conservation history, all behind closed doors, Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council said, referring to Bears Ears.National monuments have long been a source of controversy among ranchers, miners and environmentalists.Conservative groups argue that such designations, similar to national parks, create regulatory burdens that hurt local economies.Bears Ears, which Mr. Obama created at the end of his term, has been a particular source of friction, as is Grand Staircase-Escalanate.Republicans in Western states have accused both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama of federal overreach in demanding strict protections for those sites.We believe in the importance of protecting these sacred antiquities, but Secretary Zinke and the Trump administration rolled up their sleeves to dig in, talk to locals, talk to local tribes, and find a better way to do it, Senator Hatch said.The decision was expected to be challenged in court.
Gothamist and DNAinfo Newsrooms Now Have a Union:::::Reporters and editors at the commonly owned New York news sites DNAinfo and Gothamist are now represented by a union.The newsroom workers initially agreed to join the union, the Writers Guild of America East, in April, shortly after DNAinfo bought Gothamist.But DNAinfos owner, Joe Ricketts, refused to recognize the union, so the National Labor Relations Board conducted a formal vote on Thursday.The result 25 out of 27 workers voted to join the Writers Guild means that management is required to bargain with the union.DNAinfo, which specializes in covering the city neighborhood by neighborhood, has broken big stories and earned respect since its founding in 2009, but it has never turned a profit.Gothamist, with a smaller staff but wider readership, is a blog with attitude that combines original reporting, cultural coverage and aggregation.After the workers tried to organize in the spring, Mr. Ricketts, who founded TD Ameritrade and whose family owns the Chicago Cubs, wrote to them, As long as its my money thats paying for everything, I intend to be the one making the decisions about the direction of the business.Advertisement Continue reading the main story DNAinfos chief operating officer, Dan Swartz, wrote an email to the staff around the same time, wondering: Would a union be the final straw that caused the business to close?I dont know.DNAinfo had laid off several employees before buying Gothamist, and laid off several more after.
While Tax Cuts Remain Theoretical, the Economy Blooms:::::Photo It turns out that the United States economy is doing just fine without tax cuts.Initial estimates show the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 percent in the third quarter, despite the effect of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.An increase in goods made but not sold helped, but so did global growth and healthy corporate earnings.Protectionist policies could put the trend at risk.Third-quarter growth was a pleasant surprise after economists projected expansion of 2.5 percent.Growth in consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of economic output, slowed to 2.4 percent but is expected to rebound as the effects of the hurricanes fade.And rising inventories contributed just over 0.7 percentage point to growth, in what could be a sign that companies think consumer demand will warm up.There are other positive signs.Business investment, which had been lagging but improved in recent months, came in at a healthy 3.9 percent.Exports increased 2.3 percent in the third quarter, which added more than 0.4 percentage point to economic growth.It was aided by global expansion, with world economic growth in sync for the first time in years and Europe catching up with the United States.The International Monetary Fund projected that the global economy would increase 3.6 percent in 2017 and grow 3.7 percent the next year.President Trump has promised to cut the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent but whether or not he succeeds, companies are performing well.The Nasdaq reached a record high (not adjusted for inflation) on Friday morning after tech groups like Amazon and Microsoft reported robust third-quarter earnings.On top of that, the United States is nearly at full employment with a jobless rate of 4.2 percent.Past form suggests Mr. Trump will take credit.True, the nearly 20 percent rise in the Standard & Poors 500-share index since his election happened partly because of the hope of tax cuts.But most of the positive economic trends are occurring without major legislative accomplishments.The biggest risk to this outlook is harmful trade policies, including a disintegration of the North American Free Trade Agreement, for which negotiations arent going well.The best that can be said is that Mr. Trump has not yet done the economy harm.
Britain Says North Korea Was Behind Cyberattack on Health Service:::::They encrypted the information on them and then demanded payment of $300 or more in Bitcoin to unlock the devices.In Britain, the attack resulted in the abrupt cancellation of patients operations and delays in medical appointments at dozens of hospitals that struggled to retrieve essential medical information and patient histories.Britains National Audit Office said on Friday that at least 6,900 appointments had been canceled during the attack, which affected more than one-third of Englands 236 N.H.S.trusts.Up to 19,000 appointments may have been affected, it said.Hospital authorities have said that no patient data was compromised or stolen during the attack.But it had particular resonance in Britain where the N.H.S., though chronically underfunded, is a vaunted part of the nations identity.Mr. Wallace warned that it was difficult to respond to a cyberattack committed by a hostile state.North Korea, which has ambitions to develop a nuclear weapon and has been repeatedly testing missiles despite international sanctions, has also proved adept at sowing havoc through cyberattacks.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.North Korea has been potentially linked to other attacks about raising foreign currency, he said, in an apparent reference to an attack last year in which North Korean hackers tried to steal $1 billion from the New York Federal Reserve, and almost succeeded before being stopped by a spelling error.The North has an army of 6,000 hackers, and experts in Britain and the United States say their ability to wage effective cyberattacks has improved.In 2014, the country unleashed a cyberattack against Sony Pictures aimed at blocking the release of a satirical film deemed disrespectful of its leader, Kim Jong-un.Mr. Wallace said it was imperative for Britain to reinforce its efforts to defend against future attacks.Its a salient lesson for us all that all of us, from individuals to governments to large organizations, have a role to play in maintaining the security of our networks, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The National Audit Office said on Friday that the WannaCry attack had been relatively unsophisticated and could have been prevented had the N.H.S.followed rudimentary procedures to protect its systems.It said that N.H.S.management had recklessly ignored security recommendations.Amyas Morse, the head of the National Audit Office, on Friday criticized the preparedness of the N.H.S.The WannaCry cyberattack had potentially serious implications for the N.H.S.and its ability to provide care to patients, he said in a statement.He added that the N.H.S.needed to get its act together.In the immediate aftermath, Amber Rudd, the British home secretary, acknowledged that, despite several warnings of a possible attack, the N.H.S.had been ill prepared to defend itself and was vulnerable because its computers had outmoded software.While the ransom demanded in the attack in Britain was modest, the National Audit Office said evidence indicated that no N.H.S.organization had paid, which experts say could have encouraged further attacks.
‘Transformation Is Happening’: Saudi Aramco’s Chief on Future of Oil:::::A. I think that privatization will definitely elevate, first, our international visibility as a company, our decision-making strategies, and also our achievements to date, and our governance.We know that we have excellent governance.A lot is not known about Saudi Aramco in terms of performance and all of that.So a lot of numbers can be shared later on, when we are listed.You will see, first of all, a lot invested in technology to add more value.While everyone else cut technology spending, we are increasing our technology spending.We have eight technology hubs outside Saudi Arabia, and three inside Saudi Arabia, for a total of 11.Two of our technology hubs focus on better fuel formulation, less carbon footprint, more efficiency in car engines.That all will hopefully, at a certain point, be shared with investors when we are listed.Do you have any doubt that the listing will happen?Whats the Current Price of Oil?Brent crude, the main international benchmark, has been trading around $ a barrel.The American benchmark was at around $ a barrel.Why oil prices have fluctuated so much in recent years No, the listing is happening.You have confirmation from the Crown Prince this week, and our minister of energy and the minister of finance, all the stakeholders in the kingdom.It is happening in 2018.Is Aramco working on renewables, like wind and solar power?It is an important element of our strategy, to get into renewables.The kingdom, as I said, is looking at producing 9.5 to 10 gigawatts by 2023.So yes, we are interested and we are going to be a major player in renewables.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Are your customers unhappy about your holding back production to honor your agreements with OPEC and Russia?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.We have a long-term relationship with our customers.They appreciate our reliability, the quality of our products.We value all of these relationships.We are always there when the market goes down and there are not enough resources, because we do have the spare capacity and we always meet our obligations.There is a requirement placed on the company, based on the cuts by OPEC members and non-OPEC members, and we are abiding by that guideline.Our customers and partners understand that issue and because of the long-term relationship, it is not impacting our business transactions with them.They value the partnership that we have together.Are you losing market share?Everything is temporary.We are in a market that is very dynamic, and so far things are going well.We are meeting our obligations in certain markets.And there has been no issue so far.Are you happy with how the production cuts are working?We are seeing inventories go down, which is great.Dont forget, it was just an additional supply of 2 million barrels that brought the price from $100 to $40.Now, you dont want the opposite to happen.You need to make sure there is ample supply.You need to make sure inventories are balanced in a way where it meets the objectives of both the consumers and producers.So inventories are going down, prices are moving upward as a result of that balance between supply and demand.Is there concern in Saudi Arabia that as renewables rise in importance, oil could become a stranded asset and lose its value?We dont subscribe to that thought about stranded assets.We think that oil will have more value in the future, and that rational development of our oil assets should be done reasonably over a long time.If you look today, the requirement is 98 million barrels per day.Over the last three years, demand has grown by 5 million barrels per day.Add to that, a natural decline of 5 percent in existing fields.So you need to bring additional crude reserves to the market to meet the natural decline, and to meet the additional demand that we are going to see.So I think oil will remain for decades to come.Transformation is happening, but it is going to take a long time.
The Women Behind ‘Good Girls Revolt’ Think the Time Is Right to Revive the Feminist Show:::::Now, fans of the series are wondering whether it might have survived under different leadership.Dana Calvo, the shows creator and executive producer, said in a phone interview that when she went to pitch a second season of Good Girls Revolt to Mr. Price on Nov. 30, 2016, she learned that he had never watched the first.He confirmed that by having us refer to the characters by the actresses names, she said.He was unfamiliar.Still, she was surprised to learn the very next day that it would not be picked up for a second season.It didnt line up.It was confusing.It just didnt make sense, she said.The series was inspired by a nonfiction book, The Good Girls Revolt, by Lynn Povich, a journalist who worked at Newsweek during the 1960s.She was one of dozens of women who filed a sex discrimination lawsuit against the newsmagazine in 1970.The actor Joy Bryant played Eleanor Holmes Norton in the series, a character named for the real-life lawyer who represented the women suing Newsweek.All the actors who worked on the show understood the importance of what we were doing, and how we really needed to honor the story and honor these women, Ms. Bryant said in a phone interview.She spent time getting to know Ms. Norton, who became the first woman to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1977 and is now the District of Columbias delegate to the United States House of Representatives.Ms. Bryant said she was blindsided when the show was not picked up for a second season, and the drama was heightened by real-world events.Season 1 began streaming on Amazon in late October, just before Donald J. Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I know were talking about TV, but it was sort of a microcosm of what was going on, she said.We thought we had it in the bag.Theres no way hes going to win.Theres no way were getting canceled.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.That happened, and that happened, and it was like were really operating against some crazy forces right now, she said.Anna Camp, who played the strait-laced magazine researcher Jane Hollander, said she was shocked when the series was not renewed.Then she heard about Mr. Prices resignation.It was just so meta, or twisted, when we found out Roy Price had been accused of sexual harassment, she added.So many frustrated fans were reaching out and saying, Now that hes gone, maybe the show could come back.Ms. Povich said the outcry reminded her that there is power in numbers, a lesson she learned at Newsweek during the 1960s and 1970s.It was a complicated time, Ms. Povich said, adding that the newsmagazine resisted hiring permanent female writers even after the 1970 complaint.A second lawsuit in 1972 laid out more concrete goals and seemed to achieve better results, including Ms. Povichs appointment to a senior editor position in 1975.Ms. Povich worked with Ms. Calvo to shape the show and said she was sorry to see it end.I cannot tell you how many young women I heard from who loved the series, and who also had no idea what my generation or their mothers generation or their grandmothers generation went through, she said.Ms. Calvo said the series got a warm reception from fans and good reviews on the website Rotten Tomatoes, where it has a 96 percent general audience approval rating.(The sites approved critics gave the show a rating of 71 percent.)In a review last October, The New York Times called the series well-timed, well-meaning, with a few smart takes, but added that it just misses the nuance and rounded characters that separate timeless fiction from the news of the week.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Amazon Studios, the companys original programming division, does not release viewership data.We had high hopes for Good Girls Revolt when it was green-lighted, but it had a low season completion rate, and did not perform well on the service, the company said in an emailed statement.A spokesman would not speculate on whether the company might consider signing on for a second season, and declined to confirm who made the decision not to renew in 2016.Ms. Povich said that in light of the harassment allegations against Mr. Price, Amazon should look at the series again with a much more objective point of view.Ms. Camp agreed.To have our voices taken away from us so abruptly, and to have it all unfold the way it has, has been incredibly frustrating, she said.I miss Jane, and I really want to play her again.
Alibaba Co-Founder Joseph Tsai Said to Buy Brooklyn Nets Stake:::::This year, Forbes valued the Nets at about $1.8 billion, making it the seventh-most valuable N.B.A.franchise.Topping the list was the Knicks, which are owned by the Dolan family and which the publication valued at about $3.3 billion.The Nets have had ups and downs under Mr. Prokhorovs ownership: They reached the Eastern Conference semifinals three years ago, but have fallen apart since then, crippled by a series of misguided player personnel moves.Under the terms of the agreement in principle, Mr. Tsai will not have any role in either the basketball or business sides of the Nets.Yet he will have the option but not the obligation to buy out Mr. Prokhorov at some point in the future.Mr. Tsai is buying the Nets stake with his own money, and he will carry on as Alibabas executive vice chairman, one of the people briefed on the matter said.A representative for Alibaba declined to comment.It is perhaps the most notable trophy acquisition yet for Mr. Tsai, a Taiwan-born lawyer who moved to the United States to attend high school, before attending Yale.He became a corporate lawyer and then a private equity executive.But it was a meeting in 1999 with Jack Ma, a former English teacher turned entrepreneur who had the idea for an e-commerce company, that set him on a path to wealth.Mr. Tsai helped build Alibaba into a titan of Chinas internet community, creating a company that earned $6.3 billion in profit and $23 billion in sales in its most recent fiscal year.Its $25 billion initial public offering in 2014 was the biggest stock market debut in history.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.That success has buoyed the wealth of Mr. Tsai: Forbes estimates that he is currently worth $9 billion.He has already spent some of his wealth in sports, an interest of his dating back to his time as a lacrosse player at Yale.In August, he bought the San Diego expansion team of the nascent National Lacrosse League for what Bloomberg News reported was a $5 million price tag.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The acquisition is the latest example of an executive from a Chinese conglomerate or a Chinese company itself spending heavily to acquire pieces of sports properties, including the Premier League team Manchester City and other top clubs on the European continent.They have also invested in FIFA sponsorships and in companies that handle international broadcast and media rights.With a population of 1.3 billion people and a rising middle class with an unquenchable thirst for sports, China is considered a lucrative and largely untapped market for both consuming and participating in sports.But deals such as Dalian Wandas $650 million purchase of the Ironman competition and its expansion into marathons and road races have been questioned by analysts for the high prices that have been agreed upon.Buyers from China and Chinese companies have also pumped money into everything from professional cricket to world snooker tournaments and cycling.In March, the Chinese government acknowledged that its companies had gone on a buying spree abroad, spending $225 billion in 2016, a record-breaking number.Commerce Minister Zhong Shan vowed to slow down what he called blind and irrational investment.Zhou Xiaochuan, the countrys top central banker, took particular aim at sports and entertainment acquisitions.Some are not in line with our requirements and policies for overseas investment, such as in sports, entertainment and clubs, he said.This didnt bring much benefit to China and caused some complaints overseas.Chinese investment in American teams has been met coolly by the major sports leagues and their owners.It is rare that professional sports teams go on the selling block, and leagues such as the N.F.L.and N.B.A.demand comprehensive information on who is buying into the club, and where their money came from, as well as assurances that it will continue to flow.
Cost of Volkswagen Scandal Could Hurt Company’s Electric Vehicle Push:::::Volkswagen has announced ambitious plans to offer a lineup of battery-powered vehicles beginning in late 2019 that would be affordable for middle-class buyers.Herbert Diess, the head of the division that makes Volkswagen brand cars, has said that he sees Tesla as a more important competitor than traditional rivals like Toyota.The German company aims to deploy its enormous manufacturing network to churn out battery-powered cars faster, and in greater volume, than Tesla, which has had trouble meeting demand.But those plans may be difficult to reconcile with cuts in the research and development budget.The diesel scandal remains a dead weight on the companys finances and reputation.Volkswagen said Friday that legal settlements and other costs related to the emissions cheating have drained 14.5 billion this year from company coffers.That is money that Volkswagen would certainly prefer to spend developing new products.Volkswagen might be able to find savings in other areas, for example, by diverting money that could have been used to develop new diesel engines, said Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive Management at the Fachhochschule der Wirtschaft, a technical university in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.Still, Mr. Bratzel said, it really hurts that this money is gone and is not available for the future.The damage from the scandal, Volkswagen said in a statement, was nowhere near an end and would continue to necessitate great efforts throughout the entire group.Andreas Hoffbauer, a Volkswagen spokesman, said the company was responding to investors who have long complained that the research and development budget was spent inefficiently and was too large compared with rivals budgets.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The good news for the carmaker was that sales in the third quarter rose 6 percent, to 55 billion, thanks in part to a new SUV model introduced in the United States and economic recovery in Latin America.But there were also signs of trouble.In Germany, where Volkswagen has long dominated the market for affordable cars, sales fell 2 percent even as most competitors recorded sales gains.The company acknowledged that it has suffered from a buyer backlash against diesel, long one of its strongest selling points.In a reflection of growing anger in Germany toward Volkswagen, despite its position as a pillar of the economy, the number of lawsuits by aggrieved diesel owners has almost tripled to 4,600, the company said.Unlike the United States, Germany does not allow class-action suits by owners, who take a considerable financial risk by suing Volkswagen as individuals.Volkswagen sales in Western Europe, its core market, rose 1 percent.But the overall market in the region rose faster and the companys share has slipped so far this year.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The company acknowledged in the earnings report that one reason for the mediocre performance in Europe was the fact that customer confidence has not yet been fully restored following the diesel issue and to customer uncertainty generated by the public discussion on driving bans for diesel vehicles.Londons city government this week began imposing a daily charge of 10 pounds, or $13.20, on older diesel cars to drive in the city center, on top of the existing congestion charge of 11.50 per day.Other cities like Stuttgart and Munich are also considering restrictions on diesels, which are blamed for high levels of harmful nitrogen oxides.In a positive development, Volkswagen made more money from its namesake brand than it did last year.Operating profit from cars with the VW logo doubled to 2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2017 compared with the same period a year earlier.But the company remains dependent on its luxury brands Audi and Porsche, which generated more than twice as much profit, even though they sell fewer cars.Audi sales have slipped this year, also an ominous sign.
‘Terry Richardson Is Just the Tip of the Iceberg’:::::Porter, the Net-a-Porter magazine, also said it was no longer working with Mr. Richardson.So did Hearst magazines, which owns Elle, Harpers Bazaar, Esquire and Marie Claire.Mr. Richardson had already been commissioned to shoot the January cover of Elle and had recently done so.It is now being redone by another photographer.Bulgari, Diesel and Valentino, all brands that recently worked with Mr. Richardson on their ad campaigns, issued statements stating that they had no plans to work with him in the future.It all sounds very responsible.But some industry insiders have begun to question whether fashions efforts to distance itself from Mr. Richardson is an attempt to Band-Aid over a deeper crisis, to make a public example of an offender already accused in order to appear to be taking action, when a much broader and more systemic approach needs to be adopted.Photo Edie Campbell, a model who has been featured in campaigns for Chanel and Dior, among others, said: The reality is that the floodgates are already open regarding Terry Richardson.Hes been blacklisted once before, and its not that much of an emotional, psychological or commercial leap to blacklist him again.The difficulty is addressing the other people the ones who are celebrated by the fashion industry, and who are still at the very heart of it.This will not be solved simply by banning the use of one photographer.While there are many creative and morally reputable professionals in the industry, it is also rife with reports of lines being crossed.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The problem is much larger than Terry, who has become the scapegoat, and the quickest means for this industry to absolve itself from any responsibility, said David Bonnouvrier, the co-founder of DNA Models.Katie Grand, the editor of Love magazine and a stylist who works with brands including Marc Jacobs and Miu Miu, and who earlier this week reposted a statement from Ms. Campbell on Instagram to the same effect, wrote in an email: I dont want to sound like Im defending him, but I thought it was important to put into perspective that every model has a story of a photographer, client, art director, stylist behaving inappropriately.Mr. Richardson was widely pilloried in 2014 when allegations of behavior that included cavorting naked on shoots and forcing his penis on models surfaced in the news media.Mr. Richardson has not denied his behavior but has always maintained that any sexual activity was consensual, and no criminal charges were ever filed.No major new allegations have appeared since 2014, and he had reportedly gone through therapy.He recently had twins and got married.Photo Numerous magazines cut ties with Mr. Richardson around 2014, though he had gradually returned to the industry, working with celebrities including Miley Cyrus and Beyonc as well as magazines and brands.When Roberta Myers was the editor of Elle (she recently stepped down), she had forbidden the magazine to work with Mr. Richardson, but after Nina Garcia was appointed as Elles new editor, he was commissioned to photograph the actress Zo Kravitz for the January 2018 cover.After The New York Times published its account detailing allegations of Harvey Weinsteins sexual harassment and abuse, Joanna Coles, the chief content officer of Hearst, and Ms. Garcia decided to cancel the Elle cover photographed by Mr. Richardson and to reshoot it, a Hearst spokeswoman confirmed.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.American Vogue stopped working with Mr. Richardson in 2010, when the first public statements about his behavior appeared, but in the last two years he had done shoots for Vogue China, Vogue France, Korean W, German GQ and Italian GQ, among others.Recently he shot a story for the November issue of W, a Cond Nast magazine, for the first time since 2011.(Mr. Richardsons photographs have also appeared in T: The New York Times Style Magazine, but not since 2012.)A Cond Nast spokeswoman said that Stefano Tonchi, the editor of W, was not available for comment.But according to a person familiar with the shoot who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media, the magazine had decided it was time to give Mr. Richardson another chance.Editors were on set during the shoot and also handled the model casting.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the wake of the current revelations about the behavior of men in power, including Bill OReilly and Leon Wieseltier, however, Mr. Richardsons past behavior once again made news.The Sunday Times of London revisited the story (the day before Cond Nast International sent its memo).A petition was started on Change.org asking magazines and other brands to stop using Mr. Richardson; it has over 42,000 signatures.The designer Prabal Gurung posted on Instagram: It is important that we hold everyone accountable who worked with Terry Richardson.Not to shame them, but to understand the intention & motive behind their decision to turn a blind eye to his horrific actions.Clearly they cannot say they didnt know, because we all knew.The question now becomes: What else does fashion know?Trish Goff, a former top model who has spoken about her experience with Mr. Weinstein, said that during her modeling years, there were other girls and agents who would warn you about a photographer.Theyd say, Be mindful of him, or Dont let him convince you to take off your clothes.Athena Currey, who modeled from 1993 to 2008, said that when she was a 19-year-old working in Paris, her agency sent her on a shoot with a photographer who called her later that night at her hostel to describe how much he wanted to make love to me.The next day, she told her agent, a woman, that the conversation made her very uncomfortable and that she did not want to work with him again.Everyone said, Of course, of course, Ms. Currey said now.Then a week later, my agent called me and said: I have a really important job, and I really think you should do it.Only its with that photographer.And then she put a huge amount of pressure on me to get over it and do the job.And I know they sent other girls to him afterward.The agency, which was a minor presence in the industry, appears to have closed.None of the models who discussed their experiences for this article said their agents ever talked to them about how to handle unwanted advances from photographers, even if they knew their clients were likely to encounter them.Carolyn Kramer, a former co-director of Marilyn Models and a former casting director at Self magazine who currently owns an art gallery in Provincetown, Mass., said: It all came back to the money.If an agency sees potential in a 15-year-old girl, then it doesnt matter to them what may be happening behind the scenes if the girl can get a campaign.I give myself a C- for what I was able to accomplish to protect my girls.We all sold our souls to the devil so the model could become famous.Photo Amber Valletta, a model, actress and activist, said she was asked to take her top off during her first modeling summer in Italy when she was 15 and, on another occasion, was asked by a model booker at a magazine to disrobe.When Ms. Valletta was 18 or 19, she said, a photographer came to her hotel room, asked to give her a massage and began rubbing her breasts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She said she thought the most important next step was putting structures in place throughout the industry to protect all involved, from garment workers to models.My experiences were so minor compared to stories I have heard, she said.You start taking one person down, and the skies are going to fall.Cond Nast is aware of the risk.On Thursday, in a email to internal management as well as outside contractors, Bob Sauerberg, the chief executive of Cond Nast, and Jonathan Newhouse, the chairman, wrote: All employees, freelancers and independent contractors must understand the companys expectations of appropriate behavior and treatment of others.Cond Nast also expects the agencies that represent hired talent to develop, circulate and reinforce with their clients what is and is not acceptable behavior in interacting with others, with particular emphasis on protecting people who are in vulnerable positions in their professional relationships.Ms. Kramer said, Terry Richardson is just the tip of the iceberg.If magazines distanced themselves from everybody that has been implicated in this kind of behavior, there would be a lot fewer contributing photographers in their pages.

Lord & Taylor, WeWork and the Death of Leisure:::::Leisure, Veblen wrote, does not connote indolence or quiescence.What it conveys is the nonproductive consumption of time, by which he was not anticipating the 10,000 hours people would fritter away playing Minecraft, but any time spent away from the activity of labor.In their infancy and well into the first 80 years or so of the 20th century, department stores were largely places to pass the hours.When Lord & Taylor opened on Fifth Avenue and 38th Street it featured three dining rooms, a manicure parlor for men and a mechanical horse that could walk, trot or canter.Harry Gordon Selfridge, founder of Selfridges in London, dictated that a store should be a social center.To that end he installed an ice rink and shooting range on the roof of his store and exhibited the first plane to fly over the English Channel.Photo During this period, shopping as the consummate theatrical experience was memorialized in art.Florine Stettheimers 1921 painting Spring Sale at Bendels, to cite one example, shows us no cashiers, no scrambling for discounted Jazz Age style.In rich reds, it delivers the sense of a decadent party.mile Zolas novel The Ladies Paradise chronicled the rise of the Parisian department store in the 19th century, with its reading rooms and varied enticements.Today, of course, shopping is something else entirely, not a diversion but just an extension of our working or productive lives.At our desks and laptops we buy our avocados, face creams, bathing suits, boxer shorts, coffee tables, routers, sport coats, ski clothes.We can spend $53 or $8,500.There is nothing to immortalize unless you are a writer or artist moved to render the image of an exhausted-looking middle-aged woman staring at a screen-full of Amazon reviews.With the rise of the internet, shopping came to look like work, and work, in many instances, came to look like leisure, which is why WeWorks purchase of the Lord & Taylor building has a resonance beyond the obvious.WeWork leases office space to small but growing companies, giving them shared access to communal rooms that look like lounges with bars, air-hockey tables, lemon-infused water and so on.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.WeWorks mission is to help people make a life, not just a living, as one of its executives recently explained in a news release.The tech sensibility, which has leaked into so many other industries, imagines distinctions between work and private life as benighted.You are always working posting to Instagram your vacation pictures in Bali, where you also happen to be sourcing materials for your new app-distributed small-furniture line and you are always living.You could, in fact, build an entire social life around the WeWork experience.There are events all the time.Next week, for instance, a branch of WeWork in Dallas will hold a fashion show to benefit an animal protection charity.The show is to be followed by drinks, manicures and the opportunity to adopt a dog.There are WeWork offices in Haifa, Israel; Tokyo; Buenos Aires and 53 other cities now.Although the mourners are unlikely to be comforted, Lord & Taylor will not disappear entirely from New Yorks streetscape; the famous Christmas windows should survive.Lord & Taylor will rent a quarter of the building, maintaining a smaller version of itself.WeWork will take over the rest for its headquarters and the leasing of shared office space and tutorials perhaps for what is supposed to count now as a good time.
Politicians Are Bad at Podcasting:::::There is plenty of like-minded confabbing Mr. Sanders interviewing Elizabeth Warren, Mr. Duffy interviewing fellow Republican members of Congress that makes everybody look right and good.And in Chicago Stories, with Mr. Emanuel, this combative mayor recasts himself as a kinder, gentler interlocutor of anodyne local figures, like brewery owners and spoken-word poets.Its working.The Chicago Tribune has praised the podcast for showing what can happen when a control-the-narrative mayor loosens the reins just a little.You know, on the podcast he controls completely.Excepting Mr. Duffy, this is largely a Democratic phenomenon, and not because people who listen to podcasts are more liberal.Podcast listeners are only a little more left-leaning than America at large: According to Edison Research, 27 percent of Americans identify as Republicans, compared with 24 percent of adult podcast listeners.And conservative figures like Sean Hannity, Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro all run successful podcasts with sizable audiences.But as President Trump (and before that Candidate Trump) has conquered the media landscape, commanding the agenda on issues big and very, very small, it makes sense that Democratic lawmakers would be most eager to seize alternate outlets to promote their political priorities.(Off the Sidelines from Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Off the Cuff from Representative Jared Huffman of California popped up last year; We the Podcast from Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, begun in 2015, was ahead of its time.)All of these Democrats have taken a page from Mr. Trump himself.The president doesnt have his own podcast (yet), but no other lawmaker has so successfully leveraged the internet to push out his own version of the news, whether through his Twitter account or through his weekly self-branded Facebook video news report, the Real News Update hosted by his daughter-in-law Lara Trump.Traditional news media might be politically polarized watch Fox News or MSNBC for different versions of the days events but the internet has allowed for platforms focused on even more granular political preferences.Now, you dont have to stop at supporting Mr. Sanders as a political candidate; you can get your news filtered through The Bernie Sanders Show, in your podcast feed or on Facebook Live.The lawmaker podcast boom is just another way that our political news is becoming less accountable to the public and more personality driven.But thats not the only thing wrong with it.The podcasts are also boring.Efforts to showcase the lighter side of politicians rarely reveal the most interesting things about them.Mr. Emanuels podcast would probably be more captivating if he werent so focused on seeming supremely relatable and chill.And Im sure Mr. Duffy has some interesting stories about what its like to be in Congress right now, under this president, but hes instead ceding his time to interviews with other lawmakers about their educational and work backgrounds and what kinds of cheese they like best.Advertisement Continue reading the main story None of these shows are the optimal conduit for understanding the political issues of the day, unless youre a big nerd for Congress or really hate conflict.Mr. Duffy has expressed interest in having the liberal California Representative Maxine Waters on as a guest in the future, telling the conservative website The Daily Caller: Maxine and I dont agree on much of anything, but I think Maxine is a nice person, I think Maxine is a good person.Hopefully, theyll get into those disagreements instead of just talking about how nice the other person is.Part of the problem is that for lawmakers, podcasting is obviously a side gig.In the first episode of Canarycast, Mr. Brown tells his guests a trio of Whirlpool workers that he has to end the interview to cast a vote.Ms. Gillibrands podcast unexpectedly went silent in January after only six episodes.I guess shes been busy.The political figures with podcasts actually worth listening to are the ones who have left office.These are people who have relevant inside information about how our government works but who are now in a position to pull back the curtain.They also have more incentive to produce something truly interesting, as opposed to simply politically advantageous.Hillary Clintons campaign podcast, With Her, became instantly more compelling after her loss; the two episodes she recorded in September reflecting on the election are riveting, even for those with Election 2016 fatigue.Freed from being vice president, Joe Biden is now lending his brand to an experimental audio news curation project, Bidens Briefing, which is billed as a skillcast for devices like Alexa and Google Home but is also available to download as a regular podcast.The highlight of the category is Stay Tuned With Preet, starring Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney fired by President Trump.Some speculated that Mr. Bharara might seek elected office, but instead hes teamed up with his brother, an internet entrepreneur, and created a podcast that takes the contours of a thrilling and urgent civics lesson.If politicians really want to excel at podcasting, maybe they should quit their day jobs.For lawmakers, the podcast is rarely undertaken in the legitimate pursuit of good content but is instead a dull, modern version of constituent outreach.These shows are an attempt to signal that they are listening to us.But that doesnt mean that we should listen to them.
Subaru Admits Inspection Failings, in Another Blow to Japan’s Carmakers:::::Im distressed that our company is responsible for something that could cast doubt on the quality of Japanese manufacturing, Yasuyuki Yoshinaga, chief executive of Subaru Corporation, said at a news conference on Friday.This will be reported around the world.The inspection problem involves final quality checks that automakers perform on vehicles before they leave factories for dealerships.After a car rolls off an assembly line, workers look it over and run it on rollers to ensure it is in working order.Points on their checklists include: Do the seats adjust properly?Do the headlights shine at the correct angle?Does the speedometer work accurately?Such checks are a standard part of automobile manufacturing.But in Japan, the law requires that carmakers produce a special certificate for every vehicle to show it has passed examination; only then can it be registered as road worthy.Government guidelines specify that workers who conduct these inspections must be qualified though the authorities leave the details up to manufacturers.The car companies have the responsibility of deciding what training is required and of authorizing employees to work as qualified inspectors.Nissan and Subaru stumbled on that step.They allowed some workers who had not completed training programs or who had not been formally authorized to be final inspectors to perform the checks.The corner-cutting appears to have been long-established.Subaru said company rules designating who was allowed to inspect cars had been inconsistent with government guidelines for 30 years.Nissan says it is still investigating the scope and duration of its failure, but several news reports have suggested that it too may have been using unqualified inspectors for decades.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Independent specialists say it is unlikely that the inspection practices resulted in unsafe cars.Automotive manufacturers and their suppliers perform multiple safety tests during development and production, and serious but hard-to-find faults say, unstable chemicals inside an airbag inflater, which are believed to have caused the Takata hazard are unlikely to be spotted by a limited, mostly external once-over.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Some commentators have suggested that part of the blame belongs with Japanese regulators, whose guidelines regarding inspectors appear simultaneously burdensome and vague.Cars made for export are not subject to the same rules, because governments outside Japan do not require final vehicle inspections to be carried out by workers with special training and qualifications.The checks are a formality, and it would not be an exaggeration to say they require no special know-how, Hisao Inoue, a veteran Japanese automotive journalist, wrote on the website of the magazine Gendai Business after the initial admission by Nissan.He said the inspection regulations should be reviewed, though he added that it was absolutely wrong for Nissan to have broken the rules.Yoshio Tsukuda, founder of the Tsukuda Mobility Research Institute, an auto industry study firm, said Nissan and Subaru had risked their reputations and shown a disregard for following the rules, but had probably not endangered their customers.It makes you question how well they are managing whats happening on the factory floor, Mr. Tsukuda said.Even if there is not a safety problem, users of their products will feel uneasy.Mr. Tsukuda said a shrinking car market in Japan may have increased the temptation to cheat.The countrys automakers are selling more and more vehicles abroad, as demand at home declines because of Japans falling population.Nissan, for instance a particularly foreign-focused producer sells 90 percent of its cars outside Japan.That increases the cost, relative to sales, of complying with domestic-only rules in this case by putting workers through special courses to become authorized inspectors, a process that can take them away from their normal duties over a period of weeks or even months.The Japan market is becoming an afterthought, Mr. Tsukuda said.The carmakers crisis management capabilities are now being tested.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In particular, critics have complained that Hiroto Saikawa, Nissans chief executive, failed to show sufficient contrition at a news conference about the companys lapse.In a country where apologies are highly ritualized, even his bow briefer and shallower than those of most executives seeking the publics forgiveness became a target of criticism.Subaru, which is one of Japans smaller carmakers, with production of about one million vehicles a year, said that 245 workers in Japan were authorized to conduct final vehicle inspections.It said a much smaller group of employees between four and 17 at any given time who were studying to be inspectors but had not yet qualified, would also certify vehicles, contrary to government guidelines.Those junior workers would mark inspection certificates using the name stamps of qualified supervisors, Subaru said.It was not our intention to deceive anyone, but what we did was not appropriate, Mr. Yoshinaga said.Rules are rules.
When ‘Morale-Building’ Gets Too Personal:::::ANONYMOUS As annoying as this practice sounds, the boss probably means well.Perhaps he believes hes creating useful connections among employees from disparate parts of a far-flung company.But whatever result hes after, it seems that his approach isnt working.A short-term (and essentially selfish) solution is for you and other employees in these meetings to simply offer relatively impersonal answers.To use the example you offer describing how a difficulty in your life has affected you is so broad and vague it could be answered with almost anything.No need to reveal a dark family secret; just talk about that time you squabbled with your neighbor about his leaf-blower habits.Even better, pick something analogous to an issue the company is facing.Photo But if youd like to see the practiced stopped or altered, somebody is going to have to get over the fear of speaking up.Perhaps theres a manager both trusted by the rank and file and taken seriously by the C.E.O.?Perhaps you could take it upon yourself to arrange a conversation with the boss that hardly needs to be a confrontation, and might ultimately be appreciated?Whomever the messenger is, the message should be: Your conversations with the boss are having negative side effects that we know you do not intend; they come across to some as too personal, and maybe even invasive.Of course, thats not your goal.So is there a way tweak the questions?As always, its better if you can offer a potential solution instead of just pointing out a problem maybe some version of a recent personal question revised in a way that makes it seem less of an invasion of privacy?Maybe he would even accept question suggestions.Yes, its possible that the boss will disregard all this.But speaking up is the only way the practice might change.Theres no reason he would alter it if he thinks its useful, and nobody tells him otherwise.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Gender Pay Fairness I dont agree with your answer in the October 15, 2017, column, Addressing a Gender Pay Disconnect.Why suggest to the woman who did not receive a raise on the same timetable as otherwise-identical male peers all this roundabout additional round of due diligence and researching of what the job is worth?I cant imagine this advice being given if a male wrote the question.Why not advise her to go, along with the other female employee whose raise was delayed, directly to the boss?The discussion shouldnt focus on broader pay-disparity issues, but on the specifics of the raises deserved by all, on the same time frame, upon achieving identical credentials.An even more creative answer would be for these two women to enlist the support of the two men who received the raises.Ask them to go to a meeting with the boss to fix this disconnect.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Virginia Collings, psychologist, Cleveland In general, I think extra research is always appropriate before confronting management with demands.You want to be confident that you havent missed some other explanation.But lets say that in the instance at hand, there turned out to be no relevant or convincing extenuating circumstances.Enlisting the support of the men who evidently benefited for no defensible reason strikes me as a great idea.It might not be easy; I can imagine those colleagues being reluctant to help.But this approach is worthwhile precisely because it reframes the overriding issue.Gender pay disparity is not just a problem for the women who are being left behind; its a problem for the entire work force.Everyone should share in addressing it.
U.S. Economy’s 3% Spurt Emboldens Tax Cut Supporters (and Critics):::::There hasnt been anything concrete in terms of spending or tax cuts that we can point to thats fueling the acceleration, said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.If anyone deserves credit for the good news, he said, it is the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.G.D.P.Change Annual rate of change in the gross domestic product, based on quarterly figures adjusted for inflation and seasonal fluctuations.3Q.17 + 6 % +3.0% + 4 + 2 0 2 4 6 8 05 10 15 17 The economy is experiencing its fastest growth spurt in two consecutive quarters since 2014, after hitting 3.1 percent in the spring, a level that prompted President Trump to suggest that were really on our way to sustaining that pace year-round.On a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit 3 percent, Mr. Trump said during a speech in Missouri in August.But economists say it is highly unlikely that growth for the year will reach 3 percent.The first quarter was tepid, and projections for the current quarter hover around 2.8 percent.With legislation embodying the partys tax proposals expected next week, the figures released on Friday also highlight the fine line Republicans are walking in selling their policy: They are celebrating faster growth while arguing that tax reform is needed to accelerate it further.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement on Friday that our economy produced solid growth last quarter and went on to say that tax reform was a way to continue this growth and reinvigorate Americas economy.On Friday, Mr. Hassett and the Council of Economic Advisers released projections of how one prospective provision of the tax plan a reduction in corporate tax rates to 20 percent from 35 percent would affect economic growth.They said it would expand output by 3 to 5 percent over the long run, a period left unspecified.The complication is that faster growth could undermine the partys case that tax cuts are needed to add fuel to an economy that is already running with low unemployment and it could lead the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates more quickly, which could dampen the effects of any tax bill.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Liberal economists said the report showed the success of Ms. Yellen at the Fed and undermined the case for the Republican tax bill.The underlying trend in G.D.P.growth is clearly telling us two things, Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to President Barack Obama who is now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said by email.Keep on rockin steady with Yellen at the Fed, and theres no need for a big, wasteful tax cut.The Fed, judging that the economy is growing about as fast as it can, is on course to raise its benchmark interest rate in December to a level Fed officials have described as likely neither to encourage nor to discourage growth.The Feds plans do not reflect the potential economic impact of a tax cut.Aside from the details of the legislation, the Feds reaction may also depend on its leadership.Mr. Trump is expected to announce next week whom he will nominate to lead the Fed after Ms. Yellens term ends in early February.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The growth figure released on Friday was the governments first estimate of economic output for the quarter, and it will be revised twice.Economists initially expected that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma would deal a blow to the countrys steady growth a prospect reinforced by a net job loss in September but became more optimistic in recent weeks.After the shock dissipates, the recovery from an extreme weather event can help the economy by creating new reasons for consumer spending, which represents roughly 70 percent of national output.After the damage is done, people must often rebuild their homes or replace their cars, an effect that began to show up in the third quarter and will most likely continue through the end of the year.If you dont go out to eat during a hurricane, maybe you bought plywood for your house, said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica Bank.If you have the insurance and support, that tends to be a stimulus to the economy.The destruction wrought by the storms was outweighed by the continued spending of consumers and businesses.The job market is lively, and the stock market has rallied to record highs.Chief executives and consumers are more confident than they have been in more than a decade, recent surveys show.There are no real headwinds to growth for the first time since the expansion began, said Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moodys Analytics.We are at full employment and we are in full swing; let the good times roll.Spending on equipment increased at a rate of 8.6 percent, as companies poured money into capital improvements.One reason companies may be investing more in their business is that the labor market has tightened and wages are rising.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Businesses are going to be looking for more ways to produce than just adding bodies, said Mr. Anderson of Bank of the West.Personal consumption, although down from the previous quarter, grew at a 2.4 percent rate, and nonresidential fixed investment, a measure of business spending, expanded at a robust 3.9 percent.Mr. Zandi said the numbers were a sign that consumers are hanging tough.At the same time, with a weak dollar making American goods more competitive abroad, international trade contributed positively to output for the third quarter in a row.Imports decreased.The weak dollar through much of this year has been a boon to exporters like David Ickert, vice president for finance at Air Tractor Inc.The company, which is based in Olney, Tex., a town of about 3,100 people west of Dallas, makes crop dusters and forestry firefighting planes for markets including European countries along the Mediterranean Sea, sub-Saharan Africa and South America.Half of its sales are international.Chasing Growth The United States has been a pace setter among developed economies, but Europe is no longer a laggard.Annual rate of change in G.D.P.+ 4 % U.S. + 2 Japan 0 European Union 2 4 6 05 10 15 16 Things are picking up I sense it in Europe, Mr. Ickert said.He emphasized that the positive impact of trade at a broad level filtered down to rural communities.Trade helps create and sustain jobs in small-town America with a small business, he said.The American economy has performed considerably better this year than in 2016, when it grew at a halting 1.5 percent.And things have been looking up, economically, for much of the world, which is enjoying a rare moment of widespread expansion.The International Monetary Fund upgraded its forecast for the pace of world growth twice this year.This is happening globally, Mr. Zandi, the Moodys economist, said.There isnt a single major economy that is in recession.

Right and Left React to the Republican Push to Cut Taxes:::::_____ From the Left Photo Morris Pearl in Democracy Journal: While the Trump tax plan is a long, complex series of changes to the tax code, the elimination of the federal estate tax ranks high among the most egregious ideas.Mr. Pearl is the chairman of the Patriotic Millionaires, an organization of wealthy individuals worried about economic inequality.He defends the estate tax, which the Trump administration is seeking to revoke in its plan.Were every child to be able to succeed in this country regardless of their family circumstances, perhaps concern over concentrating wealth would be unfounded, he writes.That is unfortunately not the case.Read more Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday._____ Justin Miller in American Prospect: Quietly, Republicans are also pushing a territorial taxation provision that would make it far easier for multinational corporations to avoid paying even a new 20 percent rate by providing further incentive to stash profits in offshore tax havens.Mr. Miller argues that a provision in the Republican tax plan will encourage corporations to shift their profits to overseas tax havens.Republicans want to move to a territorial system that mirrors how much of the world structures its corporate taxes a system that does not tax foreign profits at all.However, Mr. Miller says he is unconvinced that Republicans will install adequate protections against corporations storing their profits in offshore tax shelters.If they were serious about this, he writes, they would simply end the deferral of corporations foreign profits and tax them annually like domestic profit.Read more _____ Helaine Olen in The Washington Post: Its already hard enough to make the American system of saving for retirement more difficult, confusing or disadvantageous for lower- and middle-income savers.But Republicans just might be on the verge of accomplishing this all in an effort to game the budget process.Even though President Trump said on Twitter that there would be no changes to 401(k) plans, Ms. Olen explains, the issue is not as resolved as he would have you believe.On Wednesday, there were reports that the retirement savings plans were still up for negotiation.Ms. Olen argues that the problem is not just Mr. Trumps shifting positions on the retirement accounts, but, more broadly, how willing Republicans are to toy with retirement plans all in an effort to game the budget process.Read more _____ Finally, From the Center Veronique de Rugy in Reason: The good news is that theres a debate in Washington about how to make the tax code less destructive.The bad news is that lawmakers will be able to achieve much less than they otherwise could because of bad policy priorities.Ms. de Rugy, writing for the libertarian Reason, accuses Republicans of being fiscally irresponsible with their tax plan.She says she worries that failing to restrain spending today while cutting taxes means that taxes will have to go up in the future to pay for larger deficits.She adds that while it may be politically expedient, giving the middle class a large tax cut is counterproductive: Theres very little economic growth to be expected from reducing the marginal tax rates on middle-income earners.Read more _____ Justin Fox in Bloomberg: I figure this is as good a time as any to run through whats wrong with the 401(k), or at least whats wrong with having made it a centerpiece of our countrys retirement savings system.Mr. Fox explains why the 401(k) tax break should not be untouchable, even if it is politically popular.Millions of taxpayers benefit from the plan, he writes, but far more get nothing from it.If the idea is to actually reduce the tax deductions for retirement savings, not just shift them across time, he argues, its maybe not so crazy.Read more _____ Josh Barro in Business Insider: If youre going to give a tax break for business income, you have to clearly define whats a business and whats just work.Thats surprisingly hard.Mr. Barro applauds the Republican goal of simplifying the tax code.However, he notes, one provision in the plan will complicate a lot of peoples taxes.The preferential tax rates for so-called pass-through businesses, which allow owners to be taxed on the income from their business, can be abused, or worse, put business owners at a disadvantage.The solution?Dont enact the tax preference in the first place.Read more _____ Want the Partisan Writing Roundup in your inbox?Sign up for the Morning Briefing Newsletter or the What Were Reading Newsletter.Have thoughts about this collection?Email feedback to ourpicks@nytimes.com.
Nordic-Style Designs Sit at Heart of French Labor Plan:::::Yet in draping labor reforms under the banner of the Nordic way, Mr. Macrons administration confronts considerable skepticism.Economists doubt that the Nordic model can be transplanted from Scandinavia where dealings between unions and employers are convivial to France, where strikes that bring life to a halt are a cherished ritual.Photo Major unions see a plot to strip away labor protections with happy talk of government support that will never materialize.Many doubt that Mr. Macron can find the money to bolster the safety net.Flexicurity is just fancy packaging, said Amandine Crespy, a political scientist at the Institute for European Studies at the Free University of Brussels.So far, its all flexibility and no security.Mr. Macron is handing out tax cuts to the richest 10 percent, she continued.They will do the labor reforms, and then they will tell you that there is no money for anything else.That France needs change is a given.Its unemployment rate is 9.5 percent, and has risen even as the picture has improved in countries worst hit by the European crisis like Spain, Italy and Portugal.Nearly one in four young people is unemployed.But how to generate more jobs provokes fierce argument.Unions pin blame for high unemployment on weak demand for goods and services.Pay workers more, they say, and spending will be unleashed through the French economy, generating jobs.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The unions are often caricatured as intransigent obstacles to progress, and they have a way of amplifying that image.Ask the CGT a major union that has struck the most combative stance against the changes for its plan to fix France.Its leaders call for cutting the workweek from the current 35 hours to a mere 32.Then, they say, more people will be needed.To the government, this type of thinking prime material for French lampooning exemplifies how the country has failed to adapt.Renault, the French automaker, now manufactures cars in Romania, where wages are a fraction of those in France.Restricting work invites an exodus of jobs to lower-wage countries.Photo What France needs, Mr. Macron asserts, is flexibility that can free entrepreneurs from the strictures of an outmoded labor code.The changes are supposed to make it possible for start-up companies to pay lower wages in their early stages, rather than having to hew to national labor contracts that govern janitors, agricultural workers and people on assembly lines.In contrast to years past, when labor militancy killed stabs at an overhaul, the government has this time won the cautious assent of some unions.Strikes in recent weeks have failed to inflict much disruption, underscoring a sense that the changes are essentially a done deal.Still, the CGT vows to battle on, accusing the government of an appalling attack on the rights of laborers.Macron is suggesting a total societal change that goes against what has guided French society since the end of World War II, said Manu Blanco, a board member of the CGT.He is suggesting a model of extreme individualism, where workers earn hardly anything.Whatever the merits, Mr. Macrons move does pose a historic challenge to power dynamics between working people and their bosses.Under a law adopted in 1884, unions were enshrined as the sole official representatives of French employees.They have maintained broad authority over national wages and working conditions ever since.Over the last two decades, companies have extracted the right to hire temporary workers.The fresh changes allow smaller companies to negotiate directly with workers, while enabling larger companies to work out agreements with unions tailored to local conditions.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The fundamental inspiration of these reforms is the idea that protection of workers has gone too far, said Michel Pigenet, an expert in the history of labor movements at the Sorbonne in Paris.That, in a globalized system, these protections are a constraint on competitiveness and the economy.Photo The government and its advisers frequently cite Germany as an inspiration for their labor plan.After German employers gained greater latitude over wages in the 1990s, joblessness dropped significantly.German companies became more competitive.But much of that boost came via a drop in pay.Poverty has risen in Germany along with the numbers of people depending on government aid.This has corresponded with an increase in part-time work.Its not a model, said Eric Beynel, a spokesman for Solidaires, a French union that opposes the labor changes.Its been a catastrophe.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The new rules are directed at lowering the unemployment rate.But joblessness is at best an incomplete indicator of economic health.In many major economies strikingly, in the United States and Britain the unemployment rate has fallen sharply, yet average wages are lower than a decade ago, after accounting for inflation.Many new jobs are low-paying, part-time positions.French unions cite these realities as backing for their fight.In their vernacular, competitiveness and flexibility are just euphemisms for diminished livelihood and anxiety.But only 8 percent of the French work force belongs to a union.The unions opposing the new rules are vulnerable to charges that they accept joblessness for the masses as the price of protecting their narrow segment of French workers a group that trends white and male.Photo Their clients are insiders, so they defend insiders, said Agns Bnassy-Qur, an economist who chairs the Economic Analysis Council, which advises the French government on policy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On a recent morning at the unemployment office in the 19th Arrondissement of Paris an area home to many North African immigrants people lining up for assistance tended not to see unions as a force in their lives.Its hard to find jobs, said Sara Omari, 36, a Tunisian immigrant.Its easier for French people.Economists doubt the central premise of the labor plan that easing firing will inspire companies to hire.In the short term, it will actually make it easier to destroy jobs, said Eric Heyer, an economist at SciencesPo, a university in Paris.A lot of businesses have too many people.The Nordic-style support system is posited as a cushion against joblessness while allowing workers to make a transition to more fruitful careers.Given that France already has national health care, a minimum wage and generous social welfare programs, this is not fanciful.Mentioning the Nordic model to a labor economist tends to elicit the same reaction as references to Provenal cuisine for a gastronome.But the Nordic model is as much a cultural phenomenon as a set of codified rules, a spirit of collective prosperity spanning labor and management.The level of confidence between the social partners is at a very high level, said Oystein Dorum, chief economist at NHO, the main employers association representing Norwegian businesses in negotiations with unions.Theres a sense from the other side of the table that wage claims must be reasonable so we can protect enterprises, and profitable enterprises lead to more jobs.The unpleasantries of budget arithmetic may pose the biggest challenge of all.Mr. Macron has vowed to trim spending as he strives to comply with European limits on public debt.That imperative has special force as the French president woos German support for his proposals to further integrate the countries that share the euro currency.Winning Germanys blessing requires that France demonstrate a commitment to European budget rules, which are revered in Berlin (except when Germany is breaking them).Mr. Macron appears to have wrested the upper hand.Parliament will most likely ratify his changes before the end of the year.Then, the tougher challenge commences proving that greater risk translates into greater security in a nation that has long revered equality.
CVS Is Said to Be in Talks to Buy Aetna in Landmark Acquisition:::::The talks between CVS and Aetna appear to be in part an attempt to fend off a move by Amazon into the drug-selling business or at least to insulate the companies in case Amazon does invade.Signs are emerging that Amazon has designs on the pharmacy industry, with The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporting on Thursday that Amazon had gained licenses in 12 states to become a wholesale prescription drug distributor.A larger company CVS and Aetna have combined annual revenues of about $240 billion could enjoy greater leverage in negotiations with drug companies, helping it defend itself against newcomers like Amazon.The intensifying battle for negotiating power and market share will lead companies to do acquisitions across traditional industry boundary lines, said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan who studies the drug industry.Pharmacies, drug wholesalers and benefit managers are trembling at the prospect of competing with Amazon.Photo Representatives for CVS and Aetna declined to comment.News of the possible transaction, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, sent Aetna shares soaring nearly 12 percent Thursday, while CVSs stock dropped 3 percent.CVS, which reported revenue of $177.5 billion for 2016, is based in Rhode Island and opened its first store in 1963.It became a billion-dollar company in 1985.Although it is best known for its chain of storefront pharmacies, it is also one of the nations top three pharmacy benefit managers and operates one of the countrys biggest specialty pharmacies, which sells high-priced drugs that often require special handling.The company also runs walk-in MinuteClinics in its pharmacies and Target stores around the country.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.CVS has managed Aetnas pharmacy benefits since 2010, and it announced a deal last week with Anthem, a large insurer, to help it start the insurers own pharmacy benefit business.It is unclear how the Aetna deal would affect CVSs future relationship with Anthem, and an Anthem spokeswoman declined to comment.Mr. Fein said the acquisition of Aetna, if it went through, would mark an industry shift toward a more seamless approach to managing health care costs.Right now, insurers are typically responsible for managing a patients medical bills and outsource the coverage of prescription drugs to a pharmacy benefit manager like CVS.Mr. Fein said that because the fastest-growing part of the pharmacy industry was high-priced specialty drugs for people who have considerable medical needs, it makes sense to manage those within one coordinated organization.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its a strategic play, agreed Paul Keckley, a longtime industry consultant, who said CVSs goal was not necessarily to be in the insurance business but to offer the ability to manage both medical and pharmacy costs for large employers.In addition to its insurance business, Aetna has partnerships with numerous large health systems and a sophisticated technology operation.The resulting company could resemble UnitedHealth Group, which has a large insurance operation but also runs a leading pharmacy benefit manager, OptumRx, and related health service businesses.The deal would end Aetnas own ambitions to be a much bigger company.Its proposed $37 billion merger with Humana, another large insurer, was blocked by the Department of Justice and was called off this year.Aetnas come out of this Humana scenario with some urgency, Mr. Keckley said.
Head of Mexican Media Giant Televisa to Step Aside:::::Photo MEXICO CITY Emilio Azcrraga Jean, the chairman of Televisa, whose melodramatic telenovelas once hooked viewers around the world, will step down as the companys chief executive at the end of the year, the Mexican media conglomerate announced Thursday.Mr. Azcrragas decision to step back from Televisa the largest Spanish-language broadcaster in the world comes as it has begun to experiment with new styles of programming after a sharp decline in ratings at home and in the United States.It also may lay the groundwork for additional changes as Mexican audiences, like audiences everywhere, are fragmenting.The decision is an acknowledgment that radical change is needed, especially in the context of an industry that is changing very fast, said Carlos de Legarreta, a media analyst at GBM, a brokerage house in Mexico City.To refuse to reinvent the company is not an option.As its largest shareholder, Mr. Azcrraga, 49, will remain chairman of the company that his grandfather founded.Alfonso de Angoitia, who has long been responsible for much of the companys operation, and Bernardo Gmez, will become the co-chief executive officers of Televisa.The two men who have been by Mr. Azcrragas side since he took control of Televisa when his father died two decades ago.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Televisa has been at the center of Mexican entertainment for years.Under the leadership of Mr. Azcrragas father, Emilio Azcarrga Milmo, Televisa operated in lock step with the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, broadcasting news coverage that fawned over presidents and programming that glossed over the countrys problems.
What Worries? Big Tech Companies Post Glowing Quarterly Profits:::::I do not see, to be honest, anything between Amazon and a trillion-dollar market valuation except D.C. and Brussels, and at this point it looks more likely that its Brussels, Mr. Galloway said, referring to the headquarters of the European Union.Amazon showed on Thursday how it continues to play by rules that cause fits of despair among conventional retailers.For a company its size and age, it reports meager profits, choosing to plow the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.Amazon said its net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $256 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $252 million, also 52 cents a share, during the same period last year.But Amazon also gave investors the numbers they love to see, a 34 percent jump to $43.7 billion in revenue, as it continued to nibble away at the pocketbooks of customers.The companys cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, jumped 30 percent to $4.58 billion in revenue, which Wall Street loves because it accounts for most of what little profit the company reports.Amazons recent acquisition of Whole Foods Markets has sparked concerns from rivals that the company could become a terrifying new force in the huge category of grocery retailing.During the quarter, Amazon said, Whole Foods added $1.3 billion to its overall revenue.The most remarkable sign of Amazons growth may be its rise in head count, most of which occurs in its warehouses.At the end of September, Amazon had 541,900 employees, up 77 percent from a year earlier.The average earnings estimate compiled from analysts by Thomson Reuters was 3 cents a share, and the average revenue estimate was $42.14 billion.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Next week, Googles top lawyer, along with general counsels from Facebook and Twitter, will testify in front of lawmakers investigating how Russia

percent while squeezing more profit from every dollar it brings in.In July, when Alphabet previously reported quarterly results, investors shrugged off a $2.7 billion fine from the European Commission, the European Unions administrative arm.The fine temporarily hit the companys bottom line but did little to slow revenue growth or demand for its advertising.Alphabet accounts for about 32 percent of all global digital advertising spending, according to research firm eMarketer.When it is combined with Facebook, the pair account for roughly half of all internet ad spending in the world.With earnings showing no signs of slowing, Alphabet continues to amass a cash war chest.The companys stockpile of cash and marketable securities topped $100 billion or roughly the market value of Goldman Sachs.Microsoft is mentioned less frequently as a potential target for regulators, in part because it already went through an agonizing antitrust saga in the 1990s and 2000s, one that hobbled it when big shifts in technology were looming.But in the past several years, Microsofts chief executive, Satya Nadella, has revived the company, in part by redoubling its focus on cloud

Survey of Iraq, Afghanistan veterans finds half affected by suicide:::::Oct. 28 (UPI) -- A new study from the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America revealed more than half say know know a fellow post-9/11 service member who committed suicide.The nonpartisan veteran organization had more than 4,300 IAVA veteran members participate in the study, a collaboration with George Mason University and Threespot Media.The findings were presented Thursday to Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin during a meeting with other veteran service organizations on Capitol Hill.While the survey is not representative of all veterans, it provides a glimpse into the challenges facing veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, ranging from employment opportunities to reforming the Department of Veteran Affairs.Suicide was the most pressing issue in the survey.IAVA found that 37 percent of respondents have thought about killing themselves, with 58 percent of IAVA members saying they know at least one Iraq or Afghanistan veteran who has died by suicide.Sixty-five percent said they know at least one veteran who has attempted suicide -- a figure that is 18 percent higher than its equivalent in IAVA's 2014 survey."This in-depth survey is essential for understanding the issues that are most critical to the IAVA Post-9/11 veteran community.The member survey breaks the stereotypes of veterans and explains the diverse challenges of the modern veteran," IAVA CEO Paul Rieckhoff said in a statement."It is the deepest and most comprehensive survey done of this population," Rieckhoff said."Veterans issues continue to move further down the priority list of our country's leaders.Yet veterans continue to be used as political pawns.This survey clearly explains what IAVA members need to hear from our commander-in-chief and all stakeholders, and what we as Americans need to demand from our elected officials and government leaders."A 2010 United States Census report put the number of Americans serving in uniform at 2.3 million, comprising less than 1 percent of the country's total population.Less than 8 percent of the U.S. population has ever served in the armed forces.Seventy-six percent of respondents do not believe troops and veterans are getting the care they need for mental health injuries -- only 16 percent felt troops were receiving the adequate care they need.The top three reasons IAVA members listed for troops and veterans not seeking out mental healthcare were the stigma of seeking help, the quality of care they have access to and military veterans not seeking care at all.Fifty-seven percent of respondents in the survey had a service-connected mental health injury, with 73 percent of them receiving treatment for their mental health injury and 27 percent not receiving care.Additionally, 54 percent of IAVA members said they do not support full privatization of the Department of Veterans Affairs.Twenty-six percent support the change.Reviews of VA services were mixed, with more than half rating VA services as very good or good.Twenty-five percent rated them as poor, and 10 percent as very poor.Seventy percent of IAVA members said the American public supports veterans, with 39 percent agreeing that employers value hiring veterans seeking jobs.However, the survey also reveals a perceived disconnect between veterans and the society they served to protect.The American public does not understand the sacrifice made by Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and their families, with only 16 percent agreeing that the citizenry understands This statistic demonstrates many veterans' perceived barriers to reintegration into civilian life.In 2009, then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates said, "Whatever their fond sentiments for men and women in uniform, for most Americans the wars remain an abstraction, a distant and unpleasant series of news items that do not affect them personally."The recent survey of America's newest generation of combat veterans highlights not only the concrete challenges veterans face while transitioning to civilian life, such as unemployment and healthcare, but it also reveals a deepening cultural divide between the small slice of Americans who bear the brunt of war, and those for whom the wars are only, as Gates said, "an abstraction."Veterans struggling with mental health issues can contact the Veterans Crisis Line around the clock at 1-800-273-8255.Select option 1 for a VA staffer.Veterans, troops or their family members can also text 838255 or visit t for assistance.>VeteransCrisisLine.ne

Second Niger team was out to kill or capture Islamic State leader:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- A second special operations team was on a mission to kill or capture an Islamic State leader before the Oct. 4 attack on a Green Beret unit in Niger, U.S. intelligence officials told UPI.The ambush, in which four Americans and five Nigerian soldiers were killed, may have been orchestrated by the leader of IS in the Greater Sahara, Abu Walid al-Sahrawi.Sahrawi, code-named "Naylor Road," was the target of a second clandestine operation, launched the evening of Oct. 3 by a force made up of American, French and Nigerian soldiers headed to the rural southwest region of Niger.Joint Staff Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. confirmed to reporters at a briefing Thursday that a second team was in the area when the attack occurred on a 12-man team of U.S. Army Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha members and support soldiers -- what is known as a Green Beret ODA -- and their Nigerian Army counterparts, who were on a separate reconnaissance patrol.The mission to kill or capture Sahrawi was scrubbed as bad weather emerged and he crossed the border into Mali, officials told UPI.The Green Beret ODA remained in the region after being directed by commanders to gather intelligence on Sahrawi.U.S. intelligence officials told UPI they believe Sahrawi, also known as Adnan al-Sahrawi, was behind the unit's ambush.Sahrawi, a pseudonym that means, "Adnan of the Desert," is a jihadist and a former senior spokesman and self-proclaimed emir for al-Mourabitoun, an al-Qaida-linked terrorist organization that operates out of West Africa.Sahrawi took an oath of allegiance to the Islamic State in May 2015, according to the Counter Extremism Project, a not-for-profit, non-partisan, international policy organization that combats the growing threat from extremist ideologies.The Islamic State in the Greater Sahara formed after Sahrawi split from al-Mourabitoun.The group is believed to operate near Mali, according to a October 2016 post in Arabic on the encrypted app service, Telegram.The post was distributed by IS's Amaq news agency.At some point on the morning of Oct. 4, the Special Forces team from 2nd Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group from Fort Bragg, N.C., was attacked while returning to their forward operating base, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph F. Dunford told reporters Monday.The complex attack, near a village in Tongo Tongo, in the southwestern region of Niger near the Mali border, involved an array of small arms weapons and rocket-propelled grenades and a force of about 50 militants.Army officials told UPI that the special forces team was delayed as they left a meeting with local leaders, which may have been part of the plan to attack them.Officials suspect that some people in the Oct. 4 Tongo Tongo meeting may have been working with the Islamic State.Some of the residents from the village have reportedly have been arrested.McKenzie told reporters Thursday that contact with the enemy was unlikely before the attack, and that it is unknown if that assessment changed at some point during the operation.Before the attack, 26 previous operations had been completed during the previous six to seven months, he said.Once the firefight started, an overhead drone provided real-time full motion video images of the attack, Dunford said.Staff Sgts.Dustin M. Wright and Bryan C. Black were killed in the ambush, along with chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear specialist Staff Sgt.Jeremiah W. Johnson.Sgt.La David Johnson's body was recovered 48 hours later by Nigerien forces in a remote, northwestern region of Niger.Green Berets Michael Perezoni and Brent Bartels were wounded in the ambush and were medically evacuated to Landstuhl Regional U.S. Army Medical Center in Germany.French Mirage jets arrived on the scene about one hour later in a "show of force" in an attempt to drive out the militants.By the time French air support arrived, troops had been in contact with enemy forces for two hours.It remains unclear when Johnson was separated from the other members of his unit, but a search was mounted after a DUSTWUN was declared, a military abbreviation for duty status, whereabouts unknown.McKenzie said a joint effort made up of U.S., French and Nigerien forces were involved in trying to recover Johnson.A team of investigators led by a one-star general has been sent to West Africa on a fact-finding mission, with congressional committees launching their own inquiries into the circumstances of the attack.
Japan donating Beechcraft TC-90 aircraft to Philippines:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- Japan is donating five Beechcraft TC-90 training aircraft to the Philippines to help the country protect its coasts, the Nikkei Asian Review reported.Two of the aircraft are currently being leased by the Philippines while the remaining three aircraft were scheduled for lease.The newspaper quoted the Japanese ministry of defense as saying the donation will take effect in March of next year.A change in law made during the last ordinary session of parliament led to the deal.The amendment helps facilitate the Japanese government to donate equipment to developing allied nations.Nikkei reported that the Philippines previously had a leasing agreement set up with Japan, but that it recently asked to take the aircraft for free.The Philippines is in a dispute with China over small islands and shoals in the South China Sea.China has occupied several and built military facilities on them.
Upbeat producer sentiment offset GDP to push oil prices lower:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- Production expectations from energy companies during earnings season offset growth in the U.S. economy to pull the price of oil lower on Friday.Reporting that revenue for Chevron Corp. improved by more than 50 percent from last year to $2 billion, Chairman and CEO John Watson said in a statement his company was doing more with less in the current market climate."We continue to see improvement in the underlying pattern of earnings and cash flow," he said."Cash flow is at a positive inflection point, with oil and gas production increasing and capital spending falling."The statement is dramatic for a company that saw its ranking lowered 104 points to 121 among top financial performers by commodity pricing group S&P Global Platts.Fourth-quarter 2016 results showed the company posted its first annual loss in decades.Chevron reported a loss still from U.S. exploration and production of $26 million, though that's a big improvement over the $212 million loss a year earlier.Global net equivalent production of 2.72 million barrels of oil equivalent per day was better than a year ago by a half million barrels.Traders have been watching the balance between supply and demand closely as supply-side strains last year pushed the price of oil below $30 per barrel.With oil moving toward $60, the head of Italian energy company Eni said he expected life would be easy and production gains supported.Crude oil prices were bouncing around in negative territory overnight.After a banner day supported by rhetoric of extended production cuts by OPEC, the price for Brent crude oil was down 0.34 percent to $59.10 per barrel at 9:10 a.m. EDT.West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was down 0.28 percent to $52.49 per barrel.The price for crude oil may be reaching the point where shale oil producers ramp up activity, a possibility that could lead to higher production from the United States.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is trying to balance an over-supplied market with production cuts, though U.S. resilience has countered some of that impact.Traders will get a better look at exploration and production trends when Baker Hughes publishes its weekly report, given as rig counts, later in the day.Markets may react late in the session as analyst dig into the latest report on U.S. gross domestic product.The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reported third quarter GDP increased at an annual rate of 3 percent, lower than the second quarter rate of 3.1 percent, but still healthy given the impact from the string of hurricanes that hit the United States and its island territories in the quarter.The BEA reported disposable income increased, however, by 2.1 percent to $73.6 billion in the third quarter, lower than the 3.6 percent gain in the second quarter.Personal savings, meanwhile, of $494.8 billion were 9.3 percent lower than during the second quarter.
Exxon earning and spending more:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- Even though Hurricane Harvey had a $160 million impact on earnings, U.S. supermajor Exxon Mobil said third quarter performance was indicative of recovery."A 50 percent increase in earnings through solid business performance and higher commodity prices is a step forward in our plan to grow profitability," Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said in a statement."For the fourth-consecutive quarter, we generated cash flow from operations and asset sales that more than covered our dividends and net investments in the business."The company said its earnings from exploration and production rose to $1.6 billion because of a recovery in commodity prices.The price for Brent crude oil is up about 7 percent from the start of the year to around $59 per barrel, thought that point is a sharp rebound from yearly lows in the mid-$40 range.Hurricane Harvey, meanwhile, took $160 million off the quarterly figures.Upstream company Oil States International, which operates five manufacturing facilities in Houston, reported a net loss for the third quarter of $15 million, a loss it attributed in part to damage from Harvey and lower activity from U.S. deep water operations.Exxon said its exploration and production figures in the United States, meanwhile, resulted in a loss of $238 million, though that was an improvement over the $477 million loss during the same period last year.Exploration and production outside the United States led to earnings of $1.8 billion for Exxon, up from the $708 million during third quarter 2016.Exploration and production trends had moved lower for the better part of the year as historically low oil priced curbed spending.Exxon said its spending on exploration in the third quarter was 3 percent lower during the first nine months of the year.Reported as rig counts, recent upstream trend improvements have been supported by the rally in crude oil prices.Compared with third quarter 2016, Exxon spent 43 percent more on exploration and production.
Fitch: U.S. decision on Paris doesn't matter for renewable growth:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- The U.S. plan to withdraw from the multilateral Paris climate agreement doesn't matter for the pace of growth for renewables globally, Fitch Ratings said.Fitch Ratings said in a report published late Thursday that power generation from renewable resources has nearly quadrupled in the last decade and expanded more than six times to 770 gigawatts at the end of last year.Germany has one of the greener economies in the world and European Union members bloc-wide could spend as much as $225 billion on climate measures over a six-year period, which started in 2014.European officials said the effort to advance a low-carbon economy had considerable economic support.A framework through 2020 calls for about 20 percent of the EU budget to be used on climate-related issues.Eurostat, the record-keeping arm of the EU, reported a preliminary bloc-wide estimate for carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels declined 0.4 percent compared with last year.Fitch Ratings said gains in renewable energy had been supported by government subsidies and other incentives, though renewables are gaining parity in terms of price when weighed against traditional power sources."This suggests that renewables growth is becoming self-sustaining and that the U.S. plan to withdraw from the Paris climate accord will not affect sector growth," the report read.U.S. President Donald Trump has aligned his energy policies closer to oil and coal, after casting doubts about the causes of climate change while on the campaign trail last year.His administration is reviewing its role in the multilateral Paris climate deal, which if abandoned, would leave the United States and Syria as the only two countries in the world sitting outside the agreement.The non-partisan Government Accountability Office this week said the U.S. costs associated with damage attributed to climate change could run up to $35 billion per year by 2050.That assessment followed a report from the United Nations that said it may be less costly to invest in ways to keep climate change at bay than to spend on disaster recovery.Fitch said some of the gains in renewable energy may be lopsided, but cost improvement and efficiency should continue."The most disruptive changes are likely to come through advances in technology, and the speed at which changes occur may be much faster than anticipated," the report read."Game-changing events such as those caused by geopolitical factors or significant climate change events could also affect the industry."
Italy's Eni sees easy growth at $60 per barrel:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- Current market conditions, with Brent crude oil prices moving toward $60 per barrel, support production growth and investments, Italy's Eni said Friday."In 2017 we expect to achieve organic coverage of investments and dividends, entirely paid in cash, at a Brent price of $60 a barrel as planned," CEO Claudio Descalzi said in a statement.The price for Brent crude oil was closer to $59 per barrel early Friday, up about 7 percent from the start of the year.Brent crude oil prices, however, had dropped to around $45 early this year.Recovery in crude oil prices is supported by an effort led by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to balance an over-supplied market with coordinated production cuts.That effort, however, could be offset by gains from producers not party to the agreement, like the United States.Eni said its production during the third quarter averaged 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, up about 5.4 percent from the same period last year.Start ups and plans to ramp up production in the fourth quarter could bring that level to around 1.9 million boe on average, the highest level for Eni in seven years.The company said its production growth so far was "robust."Gains will be driven in large part to operations in Kazakhstan, Egypt and Norway, as well as the resumption of activity in Libya, which is exempt from the OPEC-led balancing effort so it can steer oil revenue toward national security.Eni said the impact of the OPEC cuts would be absorbed by the implementation of initiatives elsewhere in its portfolio.The company said it was anticipating a breakthrough at its Zohr gas field in Egypt.It made its initial gas discovery there two years ago and quickly described it as the largest ever made in regional waters and potentially the largest in the world.Production offshore Egypt starts at the end of the year.
Trans Mountain pipeline planners seek federal intervention:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- The planners of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline in Canada called for federal intervention in order to proceed with expansions in the face of city-level appeals.The City of Burnaby, British Columbia, in December filed an appeal in federal court against the approval of Kinder Morgan's plans to expand the Trans Mountain pipeline network, tripling its design capacity to 890,000 barrels per day.The city said it and its residents are "extremely concerned" about the risks from "dangerous" tar sands oil, the 13 new "high-risk" storage tanks in its community and the increase in oil tanker traffic along the western Canadian shore.Trans Mountain planners, in a notice published late Thursday, called for intervention from the National Energy Board and the federal government."After many months of working in good faith to obtain municipal permits from the City of Burnaby without success, we are asking the NEB to allow us to go ahead with work under the terms and conditions of the applicable certificate and NEB orders," planners said in their appeal.The NEB in early September said it was satisfied with the environmental plans outlined by Kinder Morgan to expand a port in British Columbia to handle the new volumes from Trans Mountain.Later that month, however, the regulator said it completed a pre-construction audit and found planners haven't yet laid out plans regarding safety and environmental protection during the build process.Trans Mountain planners last month withdrew a request for relief from measures that prohibit spawning deterrents along the pipeline's path.According to advocacy group WaterWealth, pipeline developer Kinder Morgan "was caught" putting fences into waterways that prevented trout and salmon from spawning, in violation of NEB conditions.The project is part of a national effort to tap into markets outside North America as nearly all of Canada's oil exports go to the United States.Nearly all of the oil that Canada exports heads to the U.S. market and existing pipeline infrastructure means Canada is relatively landlocked to North America.
Oil States International reports third quarter hit from Harvey:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- As warned earlier this month, the impact of Hurricane Harvey on the southern U.S. energy sector took a toll on third quarter results, Oil States International said.Oil States International has headquarters in Houston and operates five manufacturing facilities there.The company said Friday that one of those facilities was still out of service after heavy flooding.Work scheduled at that plant was transferred to another facility.A report from Goldman Sachs found that flooding from Hurricane Harvey was the greatest threat to energy infrastructure in the region.As much as five feet of rain were forecast for some of the areas in the storm's path last month.Oil States reported a net loss for the third quarter of $15 million, about 28 percent more than the same period last year."Our third quarter results were adversely affected by Hurricane Harvey which caused widespread damage and logistical challenges in Houston and the surrounding region where we operate five manufacturing facilities and employ about 500 individuals," President and CEO Cindy B. Taylor said in a statement.The company warned earlier this month that spending might be impacted by the storm.Oil States is not alone in reporting a financial impact from Harvey.Encana Corp. said last month the storm sidelined about 3,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the Eagle Ford and Permian basin.That's less than 1 percent of the combined oil production in the forecast from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, though that loss is from just one company.Elsewhere, Oil States said the investor push inland toward U.S. shale basins meant lower demand for products for deepwater drilling."Historically low levels of deepwater spending continued to impact our offshore/manufactured products segment with limited industry award activity during the third quarter," Taylor said.Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said more than 75 million acres of federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico would go on the auction block for drillers in March.The secretary said the low-price market environment meant the offshore industry needed as many opportunities as possible, adding the March auction was the largest in U.S. history.Cindy Giglio, a principal energy merger and acquisition analyst at IHS Markit, told UPI the Gulf of Mexico remains an attractive return on investment, in part because of existing infrastructure and an available workforce.The region, however, may be best suited for bigger firms because of the "long-investment timeframe, scale, and technological expertise required," she said.
Tullow Oil strikes dust near one of South America's biggest prizes:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- Explorer Tullow Oil said it was confident about the broader region, but had no luck in a frontier effort near one of the largest finds in South America.Tullow Oil said it found no significant reserves in its Araku-1 well in the deep waters off the coast of Suriname.Tullow was drilling a wildcat well, one tapping an area not previously known to contain hydrocarbons.Exploration Director Angus McCoss said the well was drilled efficiently and at a "very low" operational cost."While we have not made a commercial discovery, we are encouraged by recovering gas condensate from the well and remain fully committed to exploration in Suriname and Guyana," he said in a statement."Tullow continues to pursue the considerable prospectivity and potential of this large license and the wider region."Hess Corp. this week shed more than $2 billion from its portfolio to help develop its Liza prospect off the coast of Guyana.The companies put the reserve estimate for the broader area offshore Guyana as high as 2.75 billion barrels of oil equivalent, 10 percent higher than initially thought.Hess said earlier this year that Liza has "attractive" economics with oil prices as low as $40 per barrel, nearly $20 per barrel less than the current price.The broader GuyanaSuriname basin is estimated to hold around 12 billion barrels of oil.Tullow, which has its headquarters in London, posted a loss of around $519 million for the first half of the year, after taking a pre-tax profit of $24 million during the same period last year.First-half production of around 81,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day was in line with its expectations.
U.S. soldiers ambushed in Niger were chasing a target, officials say:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- The attack in Niger on U.S. and Nigerien troops at the beginning of the month followed an aborted effort to track a target, according to U.S. intelligence officials.Joint Staff Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. told reporters at a press briefing Thursday that the attacked 12-man Special Forces team was not the only one on the ground in Niger during the October 4 attack.U.S. intelligence officials told UPI a special mission unit was preparing to go after a high-value target in Niger, but the mission was canceled after the target crossed the border into Mali.McKenzie told reporters that contact with the enemy was unlikely before the attack, and that it is unknown if that assessment changed at some point during the operation.Before the attack, 26 previous operations had been completed during the previous six to seven months, he said.McKenzie confirmed that there were other American teams operating in the area, but gave no details as to their activities because of their possible connection to the Oct. 4 attack.U.S. intelligence officials told UPI they believe that Abu Walid al Sahrawi, also known as Adnan al-Sahrawi, was behind the Oct. 4 attack near the village of Tongo Tongo in the southwestern region of Niger near the Mali border.Sahrawi, a pseudonym that means, "Adnan of the Desert," is a jihadist and a former senior spokesman and self-proclaimed emir for al-Mourabitoun, an al-Qaeda linked terrorist organization that operates out of West Africa.Sahrawi took an oath of allegiance to the Islamic State in May 2015, according to the Counter Extremism Project, a not-for-profit, non-partisan, international policy organization that combats the growing threat from extremist ideologies.The Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, or ISIS-GS, would form after Sahrawi split from al-Mourabitoun.The group is believed to operate near Mali, according to a October 2016 post in Arabic on the encrypted app service, Telegram.The post was distributed by ISIS's Amaq news agency."ISIS-GS is a small offshoot," Malcolm Nance, a retired Navy senior chief petty officer and career counterterrorism specialist in the U.S. intelligence community, told UPI."That was an ISIS-style ambush, but they have a lot more than 45-50 fighters.I suspect they are peeling off AQIM [al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb] branches and rolling them into ISIS-GS."The Special Forces team from 2nd Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group were attacked in Niger, while returning to their forward operating base, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph F. Dunford told reporters on Monday.The complex attack involved an array of small arms weapons and rocket-propelled grenades and a force of about 50 militants.The Green Berets ambushed in Niger were delayed as they left a meeting with local leaders -- which may have been part of the plan to attack them, Army officials previously told UPI.Officials suspect that some people in the Oct. 4 Tongo Tongo meeting may have been working with the Islamic State, and some residents from the town have already been arrested.Once the firefight started, an unmanned aerial vehicle overhead provided real-time full motion video images of the attack, Dunford said.Staff Sgts.Dustin M. Wright and Bryan C. Black were killed in the ambush, along with chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear specialist Staff Sgt.Jeremiah W. Johnson.Sgt.La David Johnson's body was recovered 48 hours later by Nigerien forces in a remote, northwestern region of Niger.Two other soldiers were also wounded.French Mirage jets arrived on the scene approximately one hour later in a "show of force" in an attempt to drive out the militants.By the time, French air support arrived, troops had been in contact with enemy forces for two hours."It's important to note when they didn't ask for support for that first hour, my judgment would be that that unit thought they could handle the situation without additional support," Dunford said."We'll find out in the investigation exactly why it took an hour for them to call."Pentagon chief spokeswoman Dana White told reporters Thursday that the media is wrong regarding the notion that Army Sgt.LaDavid Johnson was abandoned, echoing a statement last week by Defense Secretary James Mattis that the "U.S. military doesn't not leave troops behind."It remains unclear when Johnson was separated from the other members of his unit, but a search was mounted after a DUSTWUN was declared, a military abbreviation for duty status, whereabouts unknown -- meaning, a service member cannot be located, but they have not been confirmed dead or captured by enemy forces.McKenzie told reporters that a joint effort made up of U.S., French and Nigerien forces were involved in what's called a tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel mission and the joint task force did not leave the area until Johnson was located.A team of investigators led by a one-star general has been sent to West Africa on a fact-finding mission, with Congressional committees launching their own inquiries into the circumstances of the attack in the last week as well.
C-5 Galaxy component ordered from Triumph Group:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- The Triumph Group is to produce aftermarket spare rotary actuators for the main landing gear on U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy aircraft.The actuators were ordered in a two-year $22.9 million contract issued by the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, located in Robins Air Force Base in Georgia."We are honored to be selected as a sole source supplier for these operation-critical parts on the C-5 Galaxy aircraft, the U.S. Air Force's largest and only strategic airlifter, and to support the service men and women who depend on the aircraft to transport them anywhere in the world on short notice," Tom Holzthum, executive vice president for Triumph Integrated Systems, said in a press release.The spare actuators -- the number ordered was not disclosed -- will be manufactured at Triumph Group's facility in Park City, Utah.
Despite strong Q3 earnings, Boeing hit with $349M loss over Pegasus:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Despite Boeing publishing strong third quarter earnings on Wednesday, the defense contractor will take a loss of $349 million due to cost overruns on the Boeing KC-46 Pegasus program as a result of its fixed-price contract with the U.S. Air Force.The KC-46 Pegasus is a wide-bodied aerial refueling tanker jet being developed for the U.S. Air Force.It is capable of refueling all U.S. and allied military aircraft capable of mid-air refueling.The aircraft has met performance and cost requirements since work on the KC-46 program first began in 2011, and more recent problems with development and the necessary fixes have led to delays in the KC-46's delivery to the Air Force.Under the terms of the deal between Boeing and the Air Force, the risk of cost overruns during production falls on Boeing.Historically, the burden of the fixed-price contract weighs heavy, especially for innovative projects involving military transports that are untested or have undeveloped technologies.The $329 million of overrun costs are split between Boeing's defense business unit and its commercial sector, the company said in its third quarter earnings report.The business unit will pay out $73 million, with commercial taking on the remainder.To date, Boeing has had to pay out roughly $2.9 billion in pre-tax fees, equating to about $1.9 billion after taxes.Wednesday's cost overrun disclosure is attributed to "incorporating changes into initial production aircraft as we progress through late-stage testing and the certification process," the company said in its third quarter 2017 conference call with reporters.While Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg gave little insight during a conference call into the cost overruns and penalties acquired by the company, he remained optimistic about Boeing's approach to developing the KC-46 and the company's ability to meet its delivery deadline."We remain very confident," Muilenburg said."The opportunity is measured in hundreds of aircraft.We expect this to be a long-term production and support franchise, one that will add tremendous value for our customers, and the need for the new tankers is very clear.So the fundamentals for the program are strong, the long-term value proposition is very strong."Boeing said that they have completed more than 2,000 hours of flight testing with six tankers, and about 80 percent of flight test requirements have been completed."While we've had some issues that have occurred during flight tests that are normal to tanker testing," he said."I can tell you the feedback we've heard from the customers flying the airplanes is that the airplanes are flying well and the controllability of the boom is excellent.""The challenges we're having right now are related to just implementing just final detailed changes on the aircraft to get them to a final certification standard."The first 18 planes are expected to be delivered by next February and their wingtip aerial refueling pods by October 2018, 14 months later than originally planned.
Lockheed, Navantia renew collaborative agreement:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Lockheed Martin and Spanish shipbuilder Navantia on Thursday renewed their 20-year agreement on surface ships and naval combat systems.The two companies signed a memorandum of understanding to recognize their history working alongside each other and to seal the renewed agreement, Maryland-based Lockheed Martin announced in a company news release."The fundamental openness, trust, and transparency between Lockheed Martin and Navantia laid a tremendous foundation 20 years ago to build a world-class capability for the Spanish Navy, the Royal Norwegian Navy, and the Royal Australian Navy," said Michele Evans, Lockheed Martin Vice President, Integrated Warfare Systems and Sensors."Today, the future remains bright as we look across the world and continue to expand Aegis alongside the tremendous shipbuilding capability that Navantia brings."Lockheed Martin and Navantia equipped Lockheed's Aegis Combat System for the Spanish Navy's F-100 frigates, the first ship weighing less than 9,000 tons to use the equipment.The Spanish Navy now operates state-of-the-art naval escorts that can provide full air defense coverage to expeditionary forces.Between 2000 and 2010, Lockheed Martin and Navantia delivered four F-100 frigates to the Spanish Navy and sent a fifth in 2015.The two companies are now developing the Spanish Navy's F-110 frigate and said they are collaborating with other countries."With the success of the F-100, Fridtjof Nansen, and Hobart programs in our sails and F-110 just in front of us, we are excited to see what the next 20 years of this great partnership between two world-class companies can offer," Navantia Vice President Sofia Honrubia said.
Lithuania buying air defense system, equipment from Kongsberg:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Lithuania's Ministry of National Defense has contracted Norway-based Kongsberg to produce and provide a medium-to-long-range air defense system to the country.The contract from Lithuania is worth about $128.4 million, Kongsberg said in a release.Lithuania announced last October that it had signed an agreement with the Norwegian Ministry of Defense to purchase components for the defense system, also known as NASAMS.The contract announced Thursday includes additional equipment, a training and integrated logistics support package and assured refurbishment and integration of government-supplied parts."We are pleased that the Lithuanian Armed Forces has chosen NASAMS," Eirik Lie, president of Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace AS, said in a statement."NASAMS, produced by Kongsberg and Raytheon, is the most sold air defense system in NATO in recent years, and will be the backbone air defense system for many nations in decades to come."The release did not disclose additional contract details.
Embraer, Sierra Nevada supplying more A-29 aircraft for Afghan air force:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- The U.S. Air Force's Afghanistan program has tapped Sierra Nevada Corporation and partner Embraer Defense & Security to supply six A-29 Super Tucano aircraft to Afghanistan.The Afghan air force uses the A-29 trainer and light attack aircraft for flight training, aerial reconnaissance and other missions, Embraer said in a company news release Wednesday.Afghanistan will have 26 A-29s after the delivery of the new planes through the U.S. Air Force program "We believe this decision demonstrates that the A-29 Super Tucano is the best aircraft for close air support operations, as well as the most proven, reliable and cost-effective solution for counterinsurgency and irregular warfare scenarios," Jackson Schneider, president and CEO of Embraer Defense & Security, said in a statement."We are honored to continue to support the U.S. Government in this critical mission."Sierra Nevada and Embraer will start manufacturing the six aircraft in Jacksonville, Fla. "We are proud to continue our support of the Air Force's A-29 Afghanistan Program as it is not only a testament to the capability of the A-29 aircraft, but also to its ease of operation and cost effectiveness," Taco Gilbert, senior vice president for SNC's ISR business area, said in a statement."There is no other aircraft like the A-29 in its ability to provide flight training, light attack, and combat pilot seasoning"
Oil prices stand still in market push-pull:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Mixed support from supply and demand metrics left crude oil prices in relatively static territory in the early rounds of Thursday trading.Preliminary data and early reads on supply and demand indicated a slight drain in U.S. crude oil inventories.The U.S. Energy Information Administration, however, posted a surprise 856,000 build, snapping a four-week streak of declines.Traders are watching supply and demand metrics closely in anticipation of a balancing market.Supply-side strains last year pushed the price of oil below $30 per barrel and movement above $50 per barrel this year is supported by an effort by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to drain the five-year surplus on global crude oil inventories with managed production declines.EIA reported U.S. crude oil production at 9.5 million barrels per day last week, 1.1 million barrels per day more than the previous week.Early October production levels were impacted by Gulf of Mexico operations shut down ahead of Hurricane Nate.U.S. oil exports, according to an emailed market report from S&P Global Platts, have "exploded" since late September and put more oil on the global market, offsetting some of the inventory build.Crude oil prices were stable to mixed early Thursday.The price for Brent crude oil was down 0.26 percent to trade at $58.29 per barrel at 9:15 a.m. EDT.West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was more or less unchanged at $52.21 per barrel.The spread, or difference, between Brent and WTI means U.S. oil is more competitive against other benchmarks in some markets.A forecast from the EIA, meanwhile, said expectations for WTI are what drive its forecast for crude oil production.Echoing sentiments about a so-called Goldilocks number, Tamas Varga with London oil broker PVM said in an emailed market report that U.S. crude oil production numbers may be the governor on market direction."If one accepts that U.S. shale oil production is primarily the function of the price of WTI then it is unreasonable to expect a prolonged price fall," the report read."Using the same logic, the upside is limited, too as strong-ish U.S. domestic crude oil price will serve as an incentive to ramp up production."
Insitu awarded $9.2M for parts, sustainment of RQ-21A:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- The Pentagon announced Insitu Inc., a subsidiary of Boeing Defense, Space and Security, has been awarded a new $9.2 million firm-fixed price contract for spare and sustainment parts for the RQ-21A Blackjack.The RQ-21 Blackjack is a small tactical unmanned intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance platform used by the Department of the Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps.The RQ-21A is used to supplement another unmanned aerial vehicle, the Boeing Scan Eagle, and can use the same launcher and recovery system as the Scan Eagle.The contract, announced Wednesday by the Department of Defense, calls for the procurement of spare and sustainment parts for the RQ-21A in support of U.S. Marine Corps operations.Work on the project will be performed in Bingen, Wash., where Insitu is headquartered, and is expected to be completed in April 2018.Navy officials said procurement funds will be allocated from the Marine Corps fiscal 2017 budget in the amount of $9,200,000.To date, Insitu, Inc., has worked on three hundred and sixty-five contracts worth $2.12 billion in obligations from the federal government since fiscal year 2007, according to InsideGov, a government visualization database.In addition to supplying the Defense Department, Insitu, Inc., also fulfills contracts for the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Department.In fiscal year 2016, the company received a total of $483 million in obligations from the U.S. government.
Iran says it's signed its first agreement tied to LNG:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- An Iranian energy company said it signed its first-ever deal for the sale of gas slated for foreign delivery as super-cooled liquefied natural gas.SHANA, the Iranian oil ministry's news website, said the National Iranian Oil Co. and a consortium controlled by Iranian and Norwegian companies signed the agreement for LNG."The gas will be delivered by the floating liquefaction unit Caribbean FLNG, owned by Belgium's Exmar, with 500,000 tons of LNG production capacity annually," the report read.LNG has more options for delivery than conventional natural gas, which is bound by transnational pipelines that are sometimes exposed to geopolitical risk.The announcement comes one week after Pars Oil and Gas Co., the National Iranian South Oil Co., and a handful of others said they signed a memorandum of understanding with Italian power company Ansaldo Energia to collect flared gas from Phase 12 of the operations at the South Pars gas field.The Iranian oil company said the LNG deal lasts for 20 years and kicks in within the next three months.The floating LNG will dock daily at a Pars gas refinery, SHANA's report read.The Pars Oil and Gas Co., which helps drive operations at Iran's offshore South Pars natural gas field, was one of a handful of Iranian companies with a pavilion set up at the annual Offshore Energy Exhibition & Conference in Amsterdam this month.Speaking to the Financial Times, Amir Hossein Zamaninia, the deputy oil minister for international affairs, said the country is in talks with everyone "except the Americans."By his estimate, there are talks under way for more than two dozen agreements with foreign companies, which could lead to more than $20 billion in contracts over the next year.President Hassan Rouhani set a goal of signing 10 new development deals by the end of the Iranian calendar year, March 20.
Hearings canceled over Minnesota oil pipeline:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- More than $20 million in state property taxes are on the line amid shows of civil disobedience over an Enbridge oil pipeline, a Minnesota trade group said.Public hearings of plans by Enbridge Energy to overhaul its Line 3 pipeline through Minnesota were canceled by authorities in St.Cloud because of "logistical and safety issues" at a convention center.The Minnesota Petroleum Council said it was unfortunate that those working to "actively obstruct civil discourse, stifle free speech, and disrespect those in attendance" were interfering with public vetting."It's estimated that the Line 3 replacement project would support thousands of Minnesota jobs and generate an estimated $20 million per year in state property taxes," Executive Director Erin Roth said in a statement."We hope that this cancellation is an isolated incident and look forward to our continued participation in these hearings throughout Minnesota."Enbridge said replacements and upgrades to the 50-year-old system are the most efficient way to ensure the infrastructure is reliable.In testimony submitted to the state Public Utilities Commission, the company stressed that operating a 50-year-old pipeline that has a regular maintenance program carries more potential risk of a release than a "newly constructed, modern pipeline."The proposal for Line 3 includes a $4.2 billion Canadian component and a $2.9 billion U.S. component.Enbridge said replacements and upgrades to the system are the most efficient way to ensure the infrastructure is reliable.The State Department last week said Enbridge could build a three-mile section of its Alberta Clipper oil pipeline across the national border.The company three years ago connected Alberta Clipper to its existing Line 3 pipeline through Minnesota while it waited for approval for the new cross-border section.The PUC said it was reviewing a time to reschedule the canceled hearings.Pipeline opponents said the cancellation was "a blatant sign of racism" because many of those protesting were from the indigenous community.The PUC is expected to make a decision on the project by early 2018
Energy-rich Norway leaves policy rate unchanged:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- The general outlook for the oil- and gas-rich economy of Norway hasn't changed so lending rates will stay the same, the head of the central bank said.Norge Bank, the country's central bank, said Thursday the economy was struggling to pick up the pace, with inflation expected to stay below 2.5 percent over the next few years.Though the labor market is gaining strength, the value of the currency, the krone, is weaker than expected and the bank said it was keeping its key policy rate at 0.5 percent."The outlook and the balance of risks for the Norwegian economy do not appear to have changed substantially since the September report," Governor ystein Olsen said in a statement."The executive board therefore decided to keep the key policy rate unchanged at this meeting."Olsen early this year said oil and gas production for Norway peaked more than a decade ago, though he added that the sector as a whole may have been underestimated.Nevertheless, he said Norway's economy should start adding in more non-oil capacity because it needs "more legs to stand on."Statistics Norway, the government's record-keeping agency, reported taxes on the extraction of petroleum for September were down 7.1 percent from last year.Christopher O. Hansen, a staff member at the agency, told UPI that the trend lower was a reflection of market conditions.Oil and gas prices were high, relatively speaking, through a three-year period ending in 2014, but then dropped considerably.Conditions have improved since early last year, though the market is still more or less suppressed.Norwegian energy company Statoil, which is partially owned by the government, reported adjusted earnings after tax for the third quarter at $2.3 billion, more than double the amount from the same period last year.President and CEO Eldar Stre said that, even as the price of oil during the quarter stayed near $50 per barrel, his company was still generating positive cash flow."This has further strengthened our financial position," he said in a statement.The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate reported lower sales and lower production, based on preliminary data for September.Preliminary data show oil production was 1.44 million barrels of oil per day, which was about 11 percent lower than expected.
French contractor TechnipFMC bruised, but confident:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- The energy market is set up for oilfield service contracts to outperform levels from the depths of the downturn, French company TechnipFMC said.French energy services company TechnipFMC reported third quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, a metric that serves as a measure of profitability, of $536.2 million, down 23.3 percent from last year.In December, the collective shareholders approved a merger between FMC, which specialized in subsea oil and gas operations, and Technip, a leader in submarine pipeline installation and broad-based oil and gas infrastructure development The company in July said an error in calculations meant it overstated its first quarter figures by $209.5 million.TechnipFMC reported an initial first quarter net income attributable to the company was $190.8 million.In a milestone for the first quarter, the company secured a contract from a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil working offshore Guyana awarded for the engineering, manufacturing and delivery of equipment slated for the Liza project in deep waters, one of the more promising prospects in the world.In September, the company said it would help Norwegian energy company Statoil with new pipeline and production infrastructure at the Peregrino project in the oil-rich Campos Basin off the coast of Brazil, where production passed 100 million barrels in 2015.CEO Doug Pferdehirt said the rest of 2017 and into 2018 shows potential for additional contracts across the sector."We believe that most major subsea projects can move forward at today's oil prices, with delays in project sanctioning more a function of near-term price uncertainty than project returns," he said in a statement.Historic lows for crude oil prices last year forced most major companies to tighten the purse string for exploration and production spending.The price for Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, is up about 6 percent since the start of the year to trade near $58 per barrel, but coming off lows in the mid-$40 range.The head of oilfield services company Schlumberger, Paal Kibsgaard, said last week that trends to the third quarter were pointing to market recovery."We see significant opportunities ahead, and these will be driven by internal initiatives as well as market fundamentals," TechnipFMC's chief executive said.
New York sets high bar for wind energy:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- The state of New York aims to become a new hub for the wind energy industry with its unique geographical position and ambitions goals, a state leader said.New York ranks 11th in the nation in terms of installed wind energy capacity and is the 15th windiest.As of 2014, the state had 20 wind energy projects in service, with a total capacity of 1.8 gigawatts of capacity.The state set of goal of 2.4 GW by 2030."New York intends to be the preeminent global hub for the next generation of the wind industry," Lt. Gov.Kathy Hochul said during the opening remarks of a wind energy conference."We're making unprecedented investments in infrastructure and laying the groundwork for the offshore wind industry, which is primed to benefit from New York's talented, ambitious workforce."A clean energy mandate in New York states that renewable energy should account for half of the installed capacity on the state grid by 2030.This week, managers at Norwegian energy company Statoil named their early-development project off the Long Island coast Empire Wind.Statoil secured the 79,000 acre plot during a federal auction in December and said the facility has a design capacity of 1 GW of offshore wind.The Board of Trustees of the Long Island Power Authority voted in favor of the 90-megawatt South Fork Wind Farm in January.Gov.Andrew Cuomo's broader state energy vision calls for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and includes a $5 billion investment in clean-energy technology.There are more than a dozen offshore wind energy projects in various stages of development in the United States, representing more than 9.1 GW of installed capacity.One GW is enough to power 100 million LED light bulbs."Unlocking America's vast offshore wind potential will reliably deliver large amounts of clean power, grow jobs, and cement American energy dominance," Tom Kiernan, the CEO of the American Wind Energy Association, said.The AWEA hosted the New York wind energy conference.
House GOP concedes on property tax deduction:::::The House hasn't even released its tax reform bill yet, and Republican lawmakers are already making a big concession over one of their most controversial proposals.Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has decided to only partially repeal the state and local tax deduction, bending to concerns of colleagues from high-tax states."At the urging of lawmakers we are restoring an itemized property tax deduction to help taxpayers with local tax burdens," Brady said in a statement this weekend.The news was first reported by Bloomberg.Today, anyone who itemizes their deductions on their federal tax return may deduct their state and local property taxes, as well as their state and local income taxes or general sales taxes.In their bid to pay for the trillions in tax cuts they want, as well as simplify the tax code, Republican leaders have proposed repealing most itemized deductions.The state and local tax deduction -- aka SALT -- is the biggest among them.Repealing it fully could bring in more than $1 trillion in revenue over a decade.Brady's concession on property taxes may help some of the moderate-income people who benefit from the deduction today.The majority of the SALT deductions claimed by those who make less than $50,000 come from property taxes, according to a report from the Government Finance Officers Association.By contrast more than 70% of the SALT deductions from those making more than $200,000 are due to income.Related: Millions in middle class will feel it if GOP kills this tax break But it's not clear from Brady's statement if there would be any limits on who may take the property tax deduction.For instance, if it's available only to people who itemize, then chances are many wouldn't take it.That's because his bill would nearly double the standard deduction.And that would drastically reduce the number of itemizers, since you only itemize if your deductions combined exceed your standard deduction.Impossible to satisfy all demands Brady's decision, just a few days before he's due to unveil the House tax reform bill, speaks volumes about the political and policy challenges ahead for lawmakers: how to meet the Republican goals, while garnering enough support to pass a bill.A group lobbying to keep all of the state and local deduction intact was quick to call foul at Brady's concession, noting that his home state of Texas has no income tax and is heavily dependent on property taxes for revenue."[His] partial elimination plan for the state and local tax (SALT) deduction would insert the heavy hand of Washington into state and local finance decisions, dictate winners and losers among states, and unfairly penalize taxpayers in states that rely significantly on income taxes," Americans Against Double Taxation said in a statement.Leonard Lance, a New Jersey Republican congressman who has been a lead negotiator in the SALT debate, called the announcement a "step in the right direction" but argued there's more work to be done."I will need to see legislative text to determine if this proposal is in the best interest of New Jersey," Lance said in a statement."We already send more than enough money to Washington."Related: Is now really the time for massive tax cuts?Separately this weekend, the National Association of Home Builders made clear it wouldn't support the GOP tax plan as is because it doesn't do enough to support homeownership."This plan is particularly disappointing, given that the nation's home builders warned that the proposal would severely diminish the effectiveness of the mortgage interest deduction and presented alternative policies that would retain an effective housing tax incentive in the tax code," the NAHB said in a statement.The group said it believed it had a deal with lawmakers to include a homeownership tax credit that could be taken by anyone -- even if they don't itemize.But "we were told by the House leadership that the credit will be removed from the bill."But the House bill -- which is supposed to be released Wednesday -- is just the first word, not the last, on any tax legislation.As the negotiations begin over tax reform, first in the House and then the Senate, there's no telling yet where things end up.Brady said in his statement he hopes members of Congress will further examine the NAHB proposed credit "before tax reform heads to the president's desk."CNN's Kevin Bohn, Lauren Fox and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.
GOP tax reveal to set off 'corporate hunger games':::::1.Tax bill revealed: President Trump's push to overhaul the U.S. tax system is about to face its biggest test yet.Up until this point, the GOP tax "plan" has been limited to a broad, mostly detail-free framework of ideas that many lawmakers and business groups could get behind.But come Wednesday, it will be all about the details when House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady promises to unveil his 1,000-page tax reform bill.And it's those critical details in the bill that could make or break the legislation.At issue: How will Brady propose to pay for the big business tax cuts Republicans have promised?Lawmakers, businesses and lobbyists will fight tooth and nail to preserve tax breaks they covet."Expect them to push back as if this was a life-or-death struggle because for many, it is," Chris Krueger, managing director of the Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in a recent report."Welcome to the corporate hunger game."The official path to modernize America's outdated tax system was created when the House narrowly (216-212) passed a budget this week that includes instructions to fast-track a tax reform bill that allows for $1.5 trillion worth of tax cuts over 10 years.But it won't be an easy path."The road ahead is bumpy and riddled with potholes," Isaac Boltansky, senior policy analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading, wrote in a recent report.Of course, Wall Street will be watching the tax battle very closely because hopes for massive tax cuts have helped send the stock market to new heights in recent months.Investors could get nervous if it looks like those tax cuts will be scuttled by GOP infighting.In any case, "expect some near-term volatility both in Washington and on Wall Street once the legislative text is released," Boltansky said.2.Jobs report: The Labor Department is scheduled to release October's job numbers on Friday.The U.S. lost 33,000 jobs in September -- the first monthly decline in employment in seven years -- thanks in large part to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.But overall, America's job market is in good shape.Unemployment is at a 16-year low, and weekly jobless claims are consistently down.The only problem is that wages aren't increasing by very much, making it difficult for consumers to keep pace with inflation.We'll see on Friday whether that continues to be the case.3.Fed meets as Trump mulls new chair: The Federal Reserve meets this week, with a decision on interest rates set to be announced on Wednesday.Don't expect too much: The Fed is not likely to raise rates this time.But Janet Yellen's term as Fed chair is coming to an end, and President Trump is expected to pick her successor -- or decide to stick with her -- next week.So even without a rate hike, there's a chance we could hear something interesting from Yellen.4.Apple's fourth quarter results: Apple (AAPL, Tech30) is set to announce its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.In August, Apple said it expects sales for the quarter to come in as high as $52 billion.Since then, the company has announced and launched three new phones.The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus have been on sale for weeks, and customers were able start ordering the iPhone X online this week.The X will hit stores on Friday.So far, sales of the 8 and 8 plus have reportedly been lackluster.According to the research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, the 8 and 8 plus accounted for just 16% of total U.S. iPhone sales in the quarter ending on October 1.The iPhone 7 and 7 plus, for comparison's sake, made up 43% of sales in the same time last year.5.Facebook earnings: Facebook (FB, Tech30) heads to the earnings stage on Wednesday.On Wall Street, at least, the social media giant has had a successful 2017.The company's stock has soared more than 50% this year.And though Facebook's growth has been slowing, the company is still expanding.But the company has also had some very public faux pas, from CEO Mark Zuckerberg's virtual visit to Puerto Rico to revelations that the social media platform hosted Russia-linked ads.Investors might ask Facebook to explain itself.6.Coming this week: Monday -- Mondelz (MDLZ) reports earnings Tuesday -- Aetna (AET), Kellogg (K), Pfizer (PFE), MasterCard (MA), Under Armour (UA) report earnings Wednesday -- Facebook, New York Times (NYT), Tesla (TSLA) report earnings; House releases tax reform bill Thursday -- Apple, Starbucks (SBUX), Yum!Brands (YUM), Ralph Lauren (RL), CBS (CBS) earnings Friday -- October jobs report; iPhone X hits stores
Is now really the time for massive tax cuts?:::::America's economy and jobs market look quite healthy right now.But President Trump is demanding very expensive surgery anyway.New numbers released Friday show that the U.S. has grown at 3% for back-to-back quarters for the first time in three years.Unemployment is sitting at just 4.2%, the lowest in 16 years.And consumer sentiment rose in October to levels unseen since early 2004.Despite the obvious strength in the economy, Trump recently promised on Twitter the "biggest TAX CUT" ever, adding "we need it!"Trump says he wants to push through both tax reform, which would modernize the outdated tax code, and to provide tax cuts to individuals and businesses.Given how healthy the economy is, some economists are mystified over Trump's urgent push for tax cuts that are likely to be paid for by adding to America's mountain of debt.Related: Economy posts impressive growth despite hurricanes "No other president in modern economic history has tried to do this," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank."It just seems completely unnecessary.With unemployment at 4.2%, why on earth would we try to stimulate the economy?"Normally, presidents ask Congress for deficit-financed tax cuts when the economy is weak.That's what President Obama did in 2009 during the Great Recession, and President George W. Bush did the same after the 2001 downturn."This is kind of an odd time to get fiscal stimulus.It's not like we're in a recession, or coming out of one," said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC.Here's the problem: There will be another recession, eventually.And spending heavily to slash the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% today could leave Congress with fewer options to tackle the next downturn.The current economic expansion is already the second-longest ever.Related: Will Trump's tax plan really give you a $4,000 pay raise?The Tax Policy Center estimates that Trump's tax overhaul would slash federal revenue by $2.4 trillion over 10 years, and by $3.2 trillion over the second decade.And the national debt is already 77% of GDP, and slated to keep growing."The risk is we don't have the money for a rainy day.It's borderline irresponsible," said Rupkey.It's true that the U.S. economy is not perfect.Businesses remain reluctant to spend, and Americans aren't getting the raises they deserve.Wage growth has been sluggish, although that improved in September.It's also true that tax reform is an admirable goal, no matter how fast the economy is growing.Tax reform, which is aimed at making the sprawling and outdated system more efficient, is different and much less costly than tax cuts."Tax reform that is paid for is much better for the economy than a plan that adds to the debt," Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, wrote recently.Some experts believe that efforts to reform the tax code will fail once details of the bill are finally unveiled on November 1, leaving the GOP to push simple tax cuts instead."We continue to expect deficit-increasing tax cuts, not...deficit-neutral tax reform," Barclays economist Michael Gapen wrote in a recent report.Given that the U.S. economy is "at full employment," Gapen believes that tax cuts will provide a "temporary boost" to GDP of just 0.5 percentage points.That would leave 2018 growth near 2.8%.The White House was asked on Friday by reporters about the need for tax cuts given solid GDP growth.Related: How Trump's tax plan could backfire on Wall Street Kevin Hassett, chair of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, argued that the U.S. economy has accelerated because businesses are excited about tax and regulatory reform.Hassett also predicted that lowering the corporate tax rate and allowing businesses to immediately write off investments could increase GDP by 3% to 5%, as well as boost wages.Without tax cuts and tax relief, the U.S. will be stuck with "depressed wage growth," the White House said in a statement on Friday.Rupkey concedes that tax reform could boost wages, but he's skeptical that wage growth will accelerate by a meaningful amount.Some economists fear that stimulus at this point in the economic cycle could be too much of a good thing."The worry is that by adding fuel to what's already, believe it or not, a pretty fiery economy in the U.S., you risk driving inflation and overheating growth," said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Capital.Such an outcome could spur the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates so rapidly that it derails the stock market and burdens businesses and consumers with higher borrowing costs."Deficit-financed tax cuts are the wrong way to go at this point," said Faucher.--CNNMoney's Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report
Mexico loses tuna trade battle to Trump administration:::::The Trump administration scored a victory against Mexico this week in a longstanding trade battle.The U.S. and Mexico have been locked in a dispute over how tuna is fished in Mexico.The U.S. claims that Mexican fishermen allow dolphins to be netted and killed when they fish for tuna.Therefore, U.S. officials say that Mexican tuna fish can't be labeled "dolphin safe."Mexican leaders deny that the country's fishing industry isn't in compliance with rules imposed by the World Trade Organization and they demand their tuna get the "dolphin-safe" labeling.If it doesn't get that label, several major U.S. supermarkets, like Walmart, won't sell it, even though it can still legally cross the border.In April, the WTO said Mexico had the right to impose tariffs on up to $163 million of U.S. exports, arguing that the U.S. labeling requirements for "dolphin safe" unfairly discriminated against Mexican tuna.The WTO said $163 million was an amount equal to what Mexico had lost as a result of not having the U.S. label.But in a separate proceeding this week, the WTO said that the U.S. labeling is now in compliance with its standards after a unit of the U.S. Commerce Department tweaked its tuna-labeling laws last year.In other words, the ruling from Thursday means the U.S. labeling doesn't discriminate against Mexican tuna.This week's ruling all but dismisses the retaliation decision in April, though it hasn't been officially thrown out.Mexico actually never decided to impose tariffs on U.S. exports.Related: NAFTA Round 4 ends on a gloomy note "I am pleased that WTO panels have finally agreed with the overwhelming evidence that U.S. dolphin-safe labeling requirements are accurate and fair," U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement.Mexico's economy ministry said it would appeal the WTO's ruling this week.The ruling comes at a critical time for trade relations between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.Leaders from all three countries are renegotiating NAFTA, the free trade pact.Negotiators ended the latest round of talks last week with a gloomy tone, with Mexico and Canada openly criticizing U.S. proposals.Lighthizer fired back at the same press conference, lambasting Canada and Mexico for what he called an unwillingness to compromise.President Trump routinely threatens to pull out of NAFTA, and he's blamed it for the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs lost to Mexico.NAFTA became law in 1994.As for tuna, Mexican tuna exports to the United States have averaged about $15 million a year over the last five years, according to USTR.That makes up almost 3% of all tuna imports to the United States.
JCPenney warns: Losses are growing:::::JCPenney says it will lose twice as much money as it had expected to this quarter.The retailer now forecasts a loss of between 40 cents to 45 cents a share, more than twice as bad as both Wall Street estimates as well as the $62 million, or 20 cents a share, that it lost in the second quarter.The warning sent JCPenney (JCP) shares 14% lower Friday morning.Driving the bigger loss, the company said, is its decision to speed up the liquidation of poorly-selling inventory, primarily women's clothing.CEO Marvin Ellison said the chain has already boosted sales but getting rid of less popular items.Related: 2017 just set the all-time record for store closings Penney has lost $242 million in the first six months of this fiscal year.And while it did manage to post a narrow $1 million profit last year, that came after a string of five straight losing years in which it lost a total of $3.5 billion.The chain also closed 127 stores during the second quarter, more than 10% of its locations.Of course JCPenney is hardly the only brick-and-mortar retailer that's struggling.Store closing announcements have more than tripled this year, according to Fung Global Retail & Technology, a retail research firm.The total of 6,700 tops the previous record set in 2008, the first year of the Great Recession.
Puerto Rico sees an opportunity to reimagine the island:::::Puerto Rico had archaic roads, bridges and electricity for years -- long before Hurricane Maria.Then the storm devastated the island's transportation and communication networks.President Trump says "broken infrastructure" was to blame for any delayed response by the federal government.Seven in 10 Puerto Ricans still have no power.Despite the suffering, one of Puerto Rico's leaders sees the hurricane's destruction as a chance for a clean slate.Related: Misery in Puerto Rico: No power, no job, 'enormous' lines "We have this historic opportunity: Instead of going with incremental changes, we can go and push the envelope to really transform the infrastructure," Economic Secretary Manuel Laboy told CNNMoney on Thursday in New York."That is the silver lining opportunity that we have."The first sign of that type of sweeping rebuild came Wednesday, when Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that a children's hospital in San Juan, the capital, is being powered by Tesla solar panels and power packs.Musk wrote in an Instagram post that the project is the "first of many solar + battery Tesla projects going live in Puerto Rico."Laboy, the economic secretary, said Tesla has "five to 10" projects in the works in Puerto Rico, including schools and community centers.Tesla (TSLA) declined to provide specifics.AT&T (T, Tech30) and a project owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet, teamed up to provide cell phone coverage to parts of the island cut off from communication.Project Loon won approval from the U.S. government to fly up to 30 giant balloons over Puerto Rico, beaming down LTE service.(AT&T is buyingTime Warner (TWX), the parent company of CNN.)Puerto Rico is even pitching itself as a site for Amazon's second headquarters.Laboy declined to provide specifics but said he sent Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) a lucrative package of incentives to consider.Related: Puerto Rico power deal now under review He sees the island's recovery as a selling point with Amazon, in addition to Puerto Rico's educated and bilingual workforce."The opportunity to transform the infrastructure ... for me, that is a very powerful message," Laboy said.Of course, Puerto Rico has to get the lights back on before it can carry out big plans.And that hasn't been easy, nor without controversy.The utility company, PREPA, found itself under fire after it gave a $300 million contract to an infrastructure repair company, Whitefish Energy.The company only has two official employees, though it's hired hundreds of subcontractors to help restore the power grid.Investigations are under way into the the contract's procurement.Critics say the contract is bloated and didn't go through proper bidding.Beyond the physical damage, Puerto Rico must overcome vast other challenges to rebuild an innovative infrastructure system.Unemployment is high, and some the island's young, educated class has been leaving for the mainland United States for years.Some fear the hurricane's destruction could expedite the exodus.The island's government also filed for bankruptcy last spring.But Laboy says those challenges shouldn't prevent Puerto Rico from thinking big."We need to be bold and we need to transform the system," he added."That is going to be the key for the recovery, and the sustainable economic growth that we are aspiring to have in Puerto Rico."
The chaos in Venezuela could get much worse:::::As it sinks deeper into chaos, Venezuela has huge bills coming up, and it still hasn't paid debts that were due weeks ago.The country's state-run oil company, PDVSA, on Friday paid roughly $900 million to bondholders, but it still owes $350 million more that was due earlier this month.Many experts who follow Venezuela's economy see a government default as inevitable.The consequences of that would be severe for a nation of 30 million people that's already running out of food and medicine.Related: Venezuela's children are dying Making matters worse: More bills come due next week.On November 2, Venezuela owes $1.1 billion.It will have only a three-day grace period before a default occurs.Venezuela's bonds are owned by an array of investors, from Wall Street strategists to ordinary Americans with 401(k)s. The government has slowly drained its savings to pay down debt.In 2011, its central bank had $30 billion.In 2015, $20 billion.This year: $10 billion.By comparison, Venezuela's neighbor Colombia has four times as much in reserves: $46 billion.Leaders from across the Western Hemisphere met in Toronto on Thursday to condemn Venezuela's authoritarian regime, which has allowed the country's vast resources -- it has more crude oil than any other nation -- to go to waste."The government of Venezuela is choosing the path of dictatorship," Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told her counterparts in Toronto.Its regime "must face consequences that go beyond harsh words and condemnations."Related: Venezuela is blaming Trump for missed debt payments Freeland didn't specify what consequences President Nicolas Maduro and his administration could face.She said she hopes Cuba, an ally of Venezuela's, will join the international condemnation of Maduro's power grab.The Western leaders haven't collectively slapped sanctions on Venezuela, but its leaders say that option is on the table.One of Maduro's biggest critics was also in Toronto: Former Attorney General Luisa Ortega, who fled the country after Maduro's newly installed legislature banished her from her post."In Venezuela it is impossible to raise our voices because people are persecuted and imprisoned," Ortega said Thursday at a separate event at the University of Toronto.The so-called Lima Group -- named after its first meeting in Lima, Peru, in August -- consists of foreign ministers from Canada and several Latin American nations, including Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina.That type of unity is rare in Latin America, a region averse to nations' meddling in each others' affairs after a string of coups and dictatorships in the 20th century, some backed by the CIA.The United States, which didn't send a representative to Thursday's meeting, has slapped several rounds of sanctions on Maduro's government and its leaders.Maduro's surrogates have blamed those sanctions for the country's widespread problems and its prolonged delays on debt payments.Related: Venezuela President tells people to eat rabbits amid food shortages Excuses aside, experts say Venezuela is likely to default on its debt.It's just anyone's guess when that exactly will happen.The government has come close to defaulting before, only to find cash at the last moment.What's different now is that its cash pile has dwindled significantly.The consequences of a default would be dire, though the full domino effect may not take place immediately.Foreign investors would have the right to seize Venezuela's only valuable asset -- oil -- outside the country.That would strangle the government's cash flow, severely restricting its ability to import food and other essentials.Maduro's grip on power would be loosened, experts say."A default -- that would trigger the fall of the government," says Edward Glossop, an economist who covers Latin America for Capital Economics, a research firm."If they were to default ... we're going to get a very painful political transition."

U.S. economy posts impressive growth despite hurricanes:::::Even hurricanes weren't enough to stop impressive growth in the economy.The U.S. economy grew at a 3% annual rate from July through September, the Commerce Department said Friday.Economists were expecting 2.5% at best, partly because of the damage from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.Growth in the third quarter "demonstrates that the hurricane ended up having little lasting impact on the economy," says Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, a research firm.In fact, the United States enjoyed back-to-back quarters of 3% growth for the first time in three years.Growth from April through June was 3.1%.President Trump has promised to get it to 3% for an entire year.Economic growth has hung around 2% for years, partly because of slow wage growth and weak spending by businesses.Related: The job market is strong.Here's the asterisk.The economy has grown for eight straight years, one of the longest stretches in history.Unemployment is down to 4.2%, its lowest since 2001.The United States has added jobs in 83 of the past 84 months."It's still the slowest recovery by a long way," says Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America, an insurance firm."But we don't see anything to suggest that we would get a recession in the next year."North and other economists expected a bigger toll from the hurricanes.Ports, schools and businesses were temporarily closed, and some employees couldn't get to work even if their businesses stayed open.Hurricane recovery efforts are expected to provide a boost to economic growth toward the end of the year.Nearly all corners of the U.S. economy contributed to growth in the third quarter.Exports, imports and business spending on long-term projects were all up.Consumer spending, which makes up the majority of economic activity, rose a healthy 3.3%.North expects the U.S. economy to stay on track unless an unexpected shock happens, "like an incident with North Korea."

Rural areas face Obamacare enrollment hitches:::::Ms. Stella's, a home-cooking restaurant in Milledgeville, Georgia, serves roast beef, grilled pork chops, chicken wings and oxtails with 24 sides from which to choose.Last spring, owners Jeri and Lucious Trawick opened a second restaurant in Eatonton, about 20 miles away, and Jeri decided to leave her full-time job to shepherd the expansion.But she needed to update the couple's health insurance and went shopping on the Affordable Care Act's online marketplace.Trawick, 43, who considers herself nearly as skilled with a computer as she is with a skillet, found the Obamacare website daunting."It was not exactly user-friendly," she said.Trawick needs specific medications to control her hypertension, and the section on drug coverage left her "confused."She turned to Insure Georgia, a program funded in large part by federal money to help consumers enroll in Obamacare.A trained navigator showed her how to compare policies on the website, look at drug formularies and examine differences in prices and provider networks.Related: Here's what you'll pay for Obamacare in 2018 "I could have done it without her, maybe, but it would have taken me forever," Trawick said.This fall, it will be different.Open enrollment for ACA plans, which begins Nov. 1, has been shortened to 45 days.At the same time, funding for navigator programs and other support for consumers has been cut dramatically in Georgia by 86% and across the country.The number of navigators for Insure Georgia, the nonprofit agency that has received the bulk of federal funding for enrollment efforts in past years, will drop to "about 20," from 42 last year, said Fred Ammons, chief executive officer.Ammons said he is concerned that with all the past year's rhetoric among Republicans in Washington about repealing and replacing Obamacare, some people may not even understand that the program is still available.That could be a problem in Georgia, which, after seeing increased enrollment in the first three years of the marketplaces, experienced a 16% drop in sign-ups for 2017 coverage.In some rural counties the decline was as much as 36%.Georgia ranks third in uninsured residents, behind only Texas and Florida.'Isn't Obamacare Dead?'ACA supporters are concerned that residents in the rural portions of Georgia which make up about 17% of the population could be most at risk.In recent decades, those rural areas have fallen behind other parts of the state in income, educational achievement and in access to health care.With enrollment assistance resources so strapped, it will be hard to reach out to rural consumers."We had a booth at the PRIDE festival in Atlanta last Sunday, and someone said, 'Why are y'all even here?Isn't Obamacare dead?'"Ammons said."And if they think that in Atlanta, you can only imagine what they think in south Georgia."Related: Trump's quest to kill Obamacare hurts the middle class Health economist William Custer, who teaches at Georgia State University in Atlanta, echoed those fears about increases in the number of uninsured in rural Georgia.The effects of less insurance will be felt hard in those areas, he explained.Nearly half of the state's counties, most of them in rural areas, do not have an OB-GYN.Seven hospitals in rural Georgia have closed within the past four years.Several have closed their labor and delivery units.If people in rural Georgia lose insurance rather than gain it, efforts made in recent years by state leaders to stanch financial bleeding at rural hospitals could be jeopardized, Custer said."This is really the big worry.The problem in Georgia is that we have very different geographics, very different demographics and very different health care.These changes this year really seem to be pushing us even more to two Georgias," Custer said.'Let Obamacare Fail' Much of the cutbacks and confusion, health care advocates said, follows President Trump's disparagement of the law.He campaigned on a promise to "repeal and replace the disaster that is Obamacare" and announced in July that he would "let Obamacare fail."Even though Congress could not pass a replacement bill, the Trump administration's changes in timing and funding for enrollment will have an effect, the advocates charge."The most damaging has been the rhetoric and confusion," said Laura Colbert, executive director of Georgians for a Healthy Future, an advocacy group."Overall, this could be a bellwether for future years."Related: Trump administration is making it even harder to sign up for Obamacare Ammons, who is from rural Georgia, said he lies awake at night wondering how to reach people who need health insurance."I don't know what I can do to help these uninsured people," he said, adding that "for a brief moment, I thought 'We can't even do this.'"That was the night he learned, in an email, that Insure Georgia's funding had been cut from $2.3 million to $328,000.Ammons said he realized that he would have to lay off full-time employees.He said he also figured out that he would have to cut back on navigators that Insure Georgia typically hired short-term for open enrollment.Next, he cut every non-personnel line item he could, which meant terminating leases and closing offices.The group found donated space in Vidalia, in central Georgia, and in Brunswick, a port city near Savannah.But that leaves the southwestern portion of the state, an especially poor area of Georgia, without a nearby office.Ammons said that other nonprofit groups have donated money that will allow Insure Georgia representatives to travel to 500 community enrollment events across the state.While Insure Georgia held more than 1,500 community events last year in all of Georgia's 159 counties, his goal is more modest this year."We want to at least be in every county with a Walmart," he said.Kaiser Health News is a national health policy news service that is part of the

$300 million Puerto Rico power deal now under government review:::::A $300 million contract awarded to Whitefish Energy, a small Montana utility company hired to restore power in parts of Puerto Rico, is now under several government reviews after being mired in controversy in recent days.The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general has launched an inquiry into the deal with Whitefish following calls by the press and lawmakers on Capitol Hill.The agency considers it one of their highest priority cases, a spokeswoman told CNN on Thursday.The inspector general plans to look into whether the appropriate process was followed by state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, when it awarded the contract.Thus far, the Whitefish deal is the largest contract awarded to any company for relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.There will be 'hell to pay' The contract has raised a few eyebrows given that the firm is based in the same hometown as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and it employed just two people at the time Hurricane Maria made landfall.Such concerns prompted a separate House committee on Thursday to also open a review of the multimillion dollar contract.Rep.Rob Bishop, chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, wrote a letter to Richard Ramos, the head of the PREPA, requesting further information on the contract.In addition, Sen. Maria Cantwell, a ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has asked the Government Accountability Office to review the matter.A GAO spokesman said the agency has received the letter and is reviewing the request."Related: Questions swirl after small Montana firm lands Puerto Rico power contract A White House spokesman told CNN the decision to give the contract to Whitefish was made exclusively by PREPA."The White House is not aware of any federal involvement in the selection," White House spokesman Raj Shah said.In a letter to the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello requested that the government oversight agency complete its review of the Whitefish contract by October 30.Rossello also noted that he recently asked Puerto Rico's Office of Management and Budget to audit the Whitefish contract in order to ensure it's in compliance with all of the appropriate laws.The results of that audit are due Friday, Rossello told CNN."If there is no wrongdoing, if it has been done correctly then we will push forward," Rossello told CNN."If there is wrongdoing in this process or any process there will be hell to pay."A Twitter battle ensues Since the company announced the deal last week it has been swept up in controversy.On Wednesday, a public feud erupted between Whitefish and San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz on Twitter.Whitefish later issued an apology to Yulin Cruz after criticizing her and threatening to pull workers from the city she represents.In an earlier interview with Yahoo News, the mayor had called the multimillion dollar contract awarded to Whitefish "alarming" and pressed for the contract to be canceled immediately."The contract should be voided right away and a proper process which is clear, transparent, legal, moral and ethical should take place," Yulin Cruz said of the two-year old electrical utility in the interview Tuesday.Related: San Juan's mayor takes on small Montana firm over Puerto Rico power contract In response, Whitefish spokesman Chris Chiames posted a statement on Twitter calling Yulin Cruz's comments "misplaced.""We find her comments to be very disappointing and demoralizing to the hundreds of people on our team that have left their homes and families and have come here to help the people of Puerto Rico," Whitefish tweeted Wednesday.By the afternoon, the situation grew heated.Yulin Cruz tweeted back: "If @WhitefishEnergy feels that asking for transparency is "misplaced", what are they afraid we will find.""We've got 44 linemen rebuilding power lines in your city & 40 more men just arrived.Do you want us to send them back or keep working?," the utility company replied.Related: Questions swirl after small Montana firm lands Puerto Rico contract "Threats received by @WhitefishEnergy.The implication is if I do not "play nice" they will not do their job.Nasty!," the mayor tweeted back.She said Whitefish's response implied it would not treat San Juan with the "diligence it deserves."Whitefish later said it is committed to restoring power in Puerto Rico and then apologized to the mayor."Mayor Cruz and everyone in Puerto Rico... we would like to apologize for our comments earlier today, which did not represent who we are and how important this work is to help Puerto Rico's recovery," the company posted on Twitter late Wednesday night.Yulin Cruz does not have authority over PREPA and the contracts it issues.She has long been a critic of Rossello, who backed the Whitefish contract, and has criticized President Trump's handling of relief efforts on the island.Hometown connections in question PREPA's Ramos told reporters during a press conference last week the cash-strapped island chose Whitefish because it didn't require a big deposit upfront.The other contender, Power Security, wanted a $25 million down payment for the work, Ramos said."In that moment, we were not in a position to offer that collateral," said Ramos."The other company did not ask for a guarantee of payment."In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Ramos said he had no regrets about picking Whitefish out of the seven companies he spoke with about working on the recovery efforts."If we went back in time, I would do it all over again," Ramos said, adding the company is "doing a great job."But some on Capitol Hill are concerned that Whitefish may have stood out for another reason.The tiny utility company is based in Whitefish, Montana, which also happens to be Zinke's hometown.Both Zinke and Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski acknowledge knowing one another.Zinke's office described Whitefish as a "small town" with a population of roughly 6,000 people.One of the secretary's sons "joined a friend who worked a summer job at one their [Whitefish's] construction sites."Related: FEMA just got another $6.7 billion to help with hurricane relief Whitefish spokesman Ken Luce confirmed an Oct. 1 report by NBC Montana, which quoted Techmanski as saying he reached out to Zinke after winning the contract to help get resources to the island more quickly, But Luce told CNN that the company did not make any requests to the administration before the contract was signed on Sept. 26."The secretary had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish getting the contract," he said.Techmanski, who has described the firm as specializing in "difficult and mountainous terrain projects," has downplayed any ties to the administration."All I can say is, we took the call and we're here," Techmanski told CNN Friday, referring to a call from director Ramos."We called each other."PREPA, which is $9 billion in debt, could have requested aid after Maria through the American Public Power Association, a network that provides help to other utilities during widespread power outages.That's what Texas and Florida did after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Ramos told CNN on Thursday that the closest states to Puerto Rico were already dealing with their own aftermath of earlier hurricanes and he believed they would not be able to respond quickly to the island's needs.The bankrupt utility also couldn't afford to cover the costs of utilizing the network either, he added.Related: Misery in Puerto Rico: No power, no job, 'enormous lines' Whitefish does have another tie to the administration.HBC Investments, which was founded by a big Republican donor named Joe Colonnetta, backs the firm.Colonnetta and his wife donated more than $20,000 to Donald Trump's presidential campaign and more than $30,000 to the Republican National Committee last year alone, according to a filing from the Federal Election Commission.A representative for Colonnetta was not immediately available to comment on the donations.Luce said the investment firm learned of Whitefish last summer through an unnamed mutual acquaintance in the energy industry."Techmanski is the type of entrepreneur HBC likes -- a family guy with a good business plan," Luce said, noting that the Whitefish CEO had previously managed contracts of up to $250 million.Additional reporting by Julia Jones, Martin Savidge and Paul Murphy.
Here's what you'll pay in Obamacare premiums in 2018:::::Consumers can now check out how much Obamacare will cost them in 2018.The window shopping tool for the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, went live on Wednesday, allowing folks to start comparing plans a week before open enrollment begins.What they find may shock them, especially if they aren't eligible for federal premium subsidies.Premiums for silver plans -- the most popular on the exchanges -- will rise an average of 34% in the more than three dozen states that use the federal exchange, according to a new analysis from Avalere, a consulting firm.The hikes vary by state, with Iowa seeing the largest average silver plan rate increase at 69%.Many insurers hiked the price of their silver policies for 2018 to offset President Trump's elimination of the funding for Obamacare's cost-sharing subsidies.These payments, made directly to insurers, reduce deductibles and co-pays for lower-income enrollees.Trump had threatened to eliminate the funding all year, finally doing so earlier this month.Those who earn too much to qualify for premium subsidies will be hit the hardest.Related: Trump's quest to kill Obamacare hurts the middle class But in a strange twist, those eligible for premium assistance could actually find themselves able to buy gold plans -- which have lower deductibles -- for less than or the same price as the silver policies.That's because they'll likely receive more generous subsidies, which will make the gold plans more affordable.Here's why: Most state regulators directed insurers to compensate for the loss of the cost-sharing subsidy funding by hiking only the prices of their silver plans, knowing the premium subsidy would shield eligible enrollees from the increase."People will see much better deals in those states," said David Anderson, research associate at Duke's Margolis Center for Health Policy.Gold plan premiums are rising by 16% on average, while the prices for bronze plans, which have lower rates but higher deductibles, are increasing by an average of 18%, according to Avalere.Related: Actually, Trump is raising health insurance premiums This makes it even more crucial for consumers to shop for 2018 coverage during open enrollment, which runs through Dec. 15.Those who don't may find themselves missing out on more affordable coverage or, even worse, stuck with much costlier plans or no coverage at all.Premium subsidies are based on the second lowest cost silver plan, but this benchmark policy can change year to year.The window shopping tool is one of several features the Trump administration is keeping for the open enrollment season.However, it is making many other changes that critics say will sabotage Obamacare.First, what's staying the same: Call centers will be staffed: Roughly the same number of call center representatives will be available to answer enrollment questions.Last year, staffing peaked at 11,000 people, according to the administration.New this year will be a call-back feature so consumers can opt to get a return call, rather than wait on hold.Waiting rooms could be deployed if needed: As in prior years, consumers may be put in virtual "waiting rooms" when healthcare.gov traffic is high.Users will see a message asking them to stay on the page, which will refresh when they can continue with enrollment.And here's what's new: A big change for auto re-enrollment: The Trump administration will once again automatically re-enroll consumers who don't actively select a plan by Dec. 15.However, unlike in prior years, participants won't be able to switch to another policy after that date.That's because open enrollment ends on Dec. 15, whereas it continued at least through the end of January in previous years.This is a big deal because some policies will be far costlier next year.Consumers may get stuck if they don't shop around.Enrolling outside of healthcare.gov: Consumers will now be able to enroll directly through certain third-party websites, rather than having to go to healthcare.gov to complete their applications.Also, the federal exchange will make it easier for consumers to connect with agents and brokers for assistance with applications through a new "Help on Demand" service.The Trump administration says this will provide Americans with more ways to enroll.Critics, however, worry that applicants may be steered to certain insurers' products and may not be told of less-expensive options.The open enrollment features released Wednesday follow many other changes Trump officials are instituting that experts say will likely dampen sign-ups.These include cutting the enrollment period in half, cutting funding to non-profit groups that help consumers pick plans and slashing the advertising budget by 90% -- not to mention, Trump's repeated declarations that Obamacare is dead.Related: Trump administration is making it even harder to sign up for Obamacare The administration said Wednesday that it will target the uninsured, as well as young and healthy enrollees who plan to sign up again, in its marketing campaigns.It will use YouTube videos, social media, mobile and search advertising, emails, texts and autodial messages to reach out to consumers.What the administration is not doing is television, radio and direct mail advertising.TV, in particular, is the most effective way to drive people to enroll, said Lori Lodes, a former Obama administration official who co-founded the Get America Covered campaign to try to boost enrollment.Trump officials seem to be interested in making sure consumers get help while enrolling, Lodes said.However, the Trump administration isn't looking to boost the number of Americans signing up for Obamacare."They are only focused on the consumer experience, which is great, but they also need to be focused on making sure people get enrolled," she said.The cuts to the advertising budget could reduce Obamacare enrollment by at least 1.1 million, estimates Joshua Peck, co-founder of the Get America Covered campaign and former chief marketing officer for healthcare.gov.
ECB: Europe's stimulus program is slimming down:::::Europe's massive stimulus program is slimming down.The European Central Bank announced Thursday that it will reduce the scale of its bond buying program in January 2018.As part of the program, which began in March 2015, the ECB has been purchasing 60 billion ($71 billion) worth of government bonds and other assets each month.At times, the purchases reached 80 billion ($94 billion) per month.Starting next year, the buys will be slashed to 30 billion ($35 billion) per month.However, the central bank also said the purchases would continue at that pace deep into 2018.The bank indicated the program would run at its reduced level until at least September -- but longer if needed.The program -- a form of quantitative easing -- has helped support the economy by keeping borrowing costs low for households and businesses.That, in turn, has increased spending and helped spur economic growth.Investors reacted to the bank's announcement by pushing the euro lower.Stock markets remained in positive territory."The announcement has been well signaled by the central bank ... with the aim of causing as little disturbance as possible for the markets," said Mihir Kapadia, CEO of financial services firm Sun Global Investments.A range of quantitative easing programs were put into action after the global financial crisis.The Federal Reserve purchased $4.5 trillion in investments over the years to support the U.S. economy.Central banks in the U.K. and Japan deployed similar measures of their own.European economies have stabilized since the stimulus program was launched.The average annual growth rate in the eurozone hit 2.3% in the latest quarter, and formerly troubled Spain and Portugal are now growing at around 3%.Related: Europeans really want to work at Google Draghi said in a news conference that he was pleased by "unabated growth momentum" in Europe, but noted that it was the result of the central bank's "ample" support.He said that continuing the bond-buying program -- without a definitive end date -- would help keep the economy on track.The ECB boss has other issues to worry about: inflation remains below the central bank's 2% target at 1.5%.Unemployment is also stubbornly high.The jobless rate in Greece is above 20% and Spanish unemployment sits just above 17%.
Trump's quest to kill Obamacare is going to hurt the middle class:::::Dave McDonald is no fan of Obamacare.The health reform law has prevented the 59-year-old from saving as much for his golden years as he would like.A retired mining engineer, McDonald and his wife, Lorraine, now run a bed-and-breakfast in Dutch John, Utah, and he also works as a fishing guide on the Green River.Both jobs help cover the extra $11,000 a year the couple has to pay in health insurance premiums."When the cost of health care more than doubles, you have to do something," said McDonald, whose premiums went from $350 a month in 2013 to $1,320 a month this year.He calculates he has to work 45 days on the river just to pay for their additional health care expenses.McDonald, who earns too much to qualify for the federal subsidies that would lower his premiums, could very well have to shell out even more for policies next year.Rates in Utah will soar an average of 39% for 2018, in part because carriers are looking to shield themselves from the uncertainty emanating from Washington D.C. Like their peers in many states around the nation, Utah's insurers are steeply hiking rates for next year in part because they anticipated President Trump would stop funding a key set of Obamacare subsidies that help lower-income enrollees afford health care.Trump lived up to his vow earlier this month when he announced that he would end the cost-sharing payments.Related: Actually, Trump is raising health insurance premiums Whom will this move hurt the most?The middle class, who aren't protected from the rate hikes like those of more modest means.Nearly seven million people who buy individual policies don't qualify for premium subsidies.These include the roughly 1.6 million Obamacare enrollees who earn more than $47,500 as an individual or $97,200 as a family of four this year, and the 5.1 million who buy individual coverage outside of the Obamacare exchange.These middle class folks will bear the full brunt of the premium increases, unlike the 8.7 million enrollees who receive federal assistance to keep their premiums to less than 10% of their annual income.They were the Americans that Trump and congressional Republicans promised to help by repealing and replacing Obamacare.Instead, they will be hit the hardest.Related: Trump kills key Obamacare subsidy payments: What it means After seeing her premiums rise 33% this year, Chicago resident Heather Tamburo is frustrated that her premiums will likely soar again.The stay-at-home mom and her husband, a self-employed photographer, are already paying $1,200 a month to cover themselves and their daughter.The couple makes too much to qualify for subsidies and expect their rates to rise again for 2018.The average premium for the lowest-cost silver plan in Illinois will rise 35%, while the cheapest bronze plan will go up 20% on average.The Tamburos have already been told that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois won't offer their same bronze plan next year."Next year, we'll have to switch to doctors we've never seen and to a plan we've never heard of and will have to pay more," said Tamburo, 53, who preferred the policy she had on the individual market prior to Obamacare because it had smaller annual rate increases.For Laurie Ryan, the answer may be to leave the country.Ryan and her husband, Randall, have bought insurance on the individual market since they started their music and voice over production studio in Austin, Texas, more than two decades ago.When the Obamacare exchanges first opened in 2014, their rates went down.But now they pay $816 a month, about $150 to $200 more than they did before Obamacare, for a plan with a $13,000 deductible.Her insurer, Sendero Health Plans, requested a premium hike of 26%, on average, for next year.The ever-climbing cost of health insurance has pushed the Ryans to consider moving to Panama or Mexico.They've already done the research on the former -- they could get coverage for $5,000 a year in premiums, with a $5,000 deductible.They are visiting Mexico in December to talk to other Americans who have moved there."Spending $10,000 a year for health insurance that isn't that great ... we just can't sustain that until we qualify for Medicare," said Ryan, 52, noting they are in very good health.
South Korea's economy and markets are flying high despite tensions:::::Tensions over North Korea may be causing alarm around the world, but they're not weighing heavily on its southern neighbor's economy and stock market.The South Korean economy grew at its fastest rate in seven years in the third quarter, according to government data released Thursday.Experts say momentum will hold despite saber-rattling between Kim Jong Un and President Trump."Provided conflict is avoided, South Korea should continue to grow strongly over the coming year," analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a research note.They predict South Korea will benefit from healthy global trade, rising government spending and a big hike in the country's minimum wage.Related: South Korea does a sudden U-turn on nuclear power Investors are showing optimism about South Korean companies, too.The benchmark Kospi index has soared to record highs recently and is up more than 22% since the start of the year.That beats the Nasdaq and the Dow over the same period.The South Korean index has been helped by heavyweight stock Samsung Electronics, which has shrugged off last year's Galaxy Note 7 debacle and the corruption conviction of its de facto leader to post a gain of more than 45% in 2017.Trump and Kim's bellicose threats have weighed on markets from time to time this year, only for them to bounce back.Analysts say that brinkmanship over North Korea is nothing new for investors, who have seen repeated flare-ups on the Korean peninsula.But the situation has had real consequences.The deployment of a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea angered China, the country's biggest trading partner, resulting in a sharp drop in Chinese tourists and difficulties for South Korean firms operating inside China.Related: China can squeeze its neighbors when it wants.Ask South Korea The boycott by Chinese tourists is hurting South Korea, but other industries like electronics are more than making up for it.The country's economy expanded 1.4% in the third quarter, compared with the previous three months of the year.That comfortably beat economists' forecasts and was propelled by a 6.1% jump in exports.The main problem looming over the economy is the high level of household debt, according to the Capital Economics analysts.But they expect a planned 16% increase in the minimum wage next year to prop up spending by consumers.
Trump likes Yellen but wants to make his mark on the Fed:::::President Trump really likes Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen."I think she's terrific.We had a great talk," Trump told Fox Business in an interview aired on Wednesday.Trump met with Yellen last week, and he's still considering whom to nominate as the next leader of the Fed.He said Monday that he was "very, very close" to a decision but no definitive date has been set for the announcement."It won't be a big shock," he told Fox Business on Wednesday.Trump neither fully endorsed Yellen nor dismissed her chances of getting renominated.He hinted that the stock market's rise to record highs -- one of his favorite talking points -- was partially due to the Fed's monetary policy under Yellen's watch.The Dow recently crossed 23,000 points for the first time in history.Trump also credited himself for the stock market's success.Related: Trump keeps teasing imminent Fed Chair decision "We're obviously doing very well together, you look at the markets," Trump told Fox Business, speaking of himself and Yellen.But Trump admitted he wants to put his own stamp on the Fed and its leadership.After all, Yellen was nominated by President Obama in 2013."In one way I have to say, you like to make your own mark ... which is maybe one of things that she's got a little bit against her," Trump added.Trump's comments on the nomination have changed day to day.In a separate interview with Fox, he hinted that Fed Governor Jerome Powell and Stanford economist John Taylor are frontrunners.Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh is also a candidate.At a meeting on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Trump did a "show of hands" poll for the next Fed chair in a closed-door meeting with Republicans.Some lawmakers told CNN that Taylor was apparently the most liked in the casual vote, but no official tally was made.Trump also asked Fox anchor Lou Dobbs in the interview on Wednesday who he would choose to be Fed Chair."I personally believe that Janet Yellen might be worth keeping," Dobbs replied.
The jobs market is strong. Here's the asterisk.:::::The jobless rate at a 16-year low.A record 6 million open jobs.Weekly jobless claims below 300,000 for the longest stretch since the 1970s.By nearly every headline measure, the American jobs market is roaring.But something is missing -- meaningful wage growth.Companies are hiring and layoffs are down, but paychecks aren't growing as they should.Before the Great Recession, wages grew around 3% each year.A healthy labor market should generate fatter paychecks to the tune of 3% to 3.5%.Those higher wages help workers keep up with inflation and keep the consumer-driven economy strong.Since the recession, wage growth has been stubbornly weak, an asterisk in the job market recovery.There was a glimmer of hope in September, when wages rose 2.9% from the year before, the strongest in eight years.It's too early to know whether that was temporary, a statistical blip because of the hurricanes, or the beginning of long-repressed wage inflation.Related: Romans' Numeral: Is it too late to buy stocks?Another asterisk: Geography.Unemployment is still high in some places, like Alaska, New Mexico, and Washington, D.C. And then there's this: A record 6 million jobs are open in the United States, and at the same time 6 million people are looking for work.So why can't those unemployed people fill those jobs?Employers say they can't find workers who have the right training.It's been a problem for years.Other factors that could be holding down wage growth are automation, which is eliminating some jobs, and competition from overseas.But until wage growth improves, it's holding the economy back from an even stronger recovery.
Saudi Arabia: 4 big takeaways from 'Davos in the Desert':::::More than 3,500 business leaders and government officials have flocked to Saudi Arabia for a conference dubbed "Davos in the Desert."Attendees were hungry for insights on where the major oil producer is headed.They were not disappointed.Here are four of the biggest takeaways from the summit in Riyadh: The crown prince Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the driving force behind sweeping economic changes in Saudi Arabia, made a rare appearance at the conference, addressing a huge audience of investors on Tuesday.The young crown prince had a message: We are open for business.He also delivered a warning to ultraconservatives, vowing to to destroy "extremist ideologies" and return to "a more moderate Islam.""We want to lead normal lives, lives where our religion and our traditions translate into tolerance, so that we coexist with the world and become part of the development of the world," he said.Related: Saudi Arabia is investing billions in fun It's a development that was welcomed by investors.Colony Capital chief executive Tom Barrack, who lived in the kingdom in the 1970s, said that these reforms may succeed where others failed."His approach is definitively the right one," Barrack said of the crown prince."What you've seen here in the last few days is a real commitment of tolerance," he added."We are going to create an environment for the West that will be transparent, secure, stable and understandable."A new mega-city The crown prince also unveiled NEOM, a $500 billion mega-city that will span three countries.The city will be powered entirely by regenerative energy, while also making use of automated driving technology and passenger drones.Wireless hi-speed internet will be free.Should it become reality, the development could become a major driver of tourism, an industry that is key to the crown prince's ambitious Vision 2030 program.The goal is to diversify the country's revenue and reduce what he once called an "addiction" to oil.It would also build stronger ties with neighbors Jordan and Egypt, whose territory would be included in the project.One major caveat: Saudi has previously announced several economic cities that have failed to attract the right investment, with many office spaces reduced to empty caverns in the desert.Massive investment Much of the change in Saudi Arabia is being funded by the country's Public Investment Fund (PIF).The sovereign fund has contributed $45 billion to Softbank's Vision Fund, which is the world's largest technology investor.PIF has also poured $20 billion into a Blackstone infrastructure fund.Some fund managers and business titans attending the conference have privately expressed worries over the kingdom's ability to deliver on all of the projects built into Vision 2030.But the pace of new initiatives has only accelerated.On Wednesday, PIF said it plans to increase its assets under management to $400 billion by 2020.It wants to create 20,000 direct jobs and 256,000 jobs in construction."I'm sure they need and should be looking at domestic investments as well," said Joshua Friedman, co-CEO of Canyon Partners, "As they interact with the most sophisticated investors globally ...I'm sure they'll bring that sophistication to bear on their own markets."Related: The man leading Saudi Arabia's overhaul just got more powerful The world's biggest IPO One of the biggest remaining questions surrounds a partial sell-off of the kingdom's crown jewel, Saudi Aramco.Officials have said they expect the IPO to value the giant sate oil company at around $2 trillion.If the market agrees, selling just 5% would raise $100 billion.The debut has been scheduled for 2018, but there are doubts over its realization.Aramco has disputed recent media reports suggesting uncertainty.CEO Amin Nasser told CNNMoney in an interview that an IPO is on track for 2018, but he refused to define whether it will have an international listing."We looked at the different venues, which are New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo," he said."We are taking time for the shareholders [the ruling family] to look at all the data ... and then the decision where to list ... will come in due course."Economic regulation, foreign ownership laws, and strict Islamic laws have often deterred investors in the past.This time, investors are listening.
San Juan's mayor takes on small Montana firm over Puerto Rico power contract:::::San Juan's mayor, Carmen Yulin Cruz, has called a multimillion dollar contract awarded to a small Montana firm to help restore power in Puerto Rico "alarming" and said it should be canceled immediately."The contract should be voided right away and a proper process which is clear, transparent, legal, moral and ethical should take place," Yulin Cruz said in an interview with Yahoo News Tuesday.Whitefish Energy, a two-year old electrical utility firm with ties to the Trump administration, announced last week it had secured a $300 million contract from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority -- more commonly known as PREPA -- to repair and reconstruct parts of the island's electrical infrastructure.This is the largest contract awarded to any company for relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.Related: Questions swirl after small Montana firm lands Puerto Rico contract Whitefish only had two employees the day the hurricane hit.Already, the company has scaled up to 300 employees in Puerto Rico -- and it says 700 more are on the way.Such quick growth is typical among utility firms when they are awarded large contracts, the firm told CNN."It seems like what the Puerto Rican people are going to be paying for, or the American people are going to be paying for, is an intermediary that doesn't know what is at stake here and that really has to subcontract everything," Yulin Cruz said of Whitefish in the interview."What we need is somebody that can get the job done and that has the expertise to get the job done."In a statement Wednesday, Whitefish spokesman Chris Chiames said Yulin Cruz's comments were "misplaced.""We are making progress and doing work when others are not even here," Whitefish's statement said."We find her comments to be very disappointing and demoralizing to the hundreds of people on our team that have left their homes and families and have come here to help the people of Puerto Rico."By Wednesday afternoon, the situation got heated on social media.After Whitefish posted its statement on Twitter, Yulin Cruz tweeted: "If @WhitefishEnergy feels that asking for transparency is "misplaced", what are they afraid we will find.""We've got 44 linemen rebuilding power lines in your city & 40 more men just arrived.Do you want us to send them back or keep working?," the utility company replied to the mayor on Twitter.We've got 44 linemen rebuilding power lines in your city & 40 more men just arrived.Do you want us to send them back or keep working?Whitefish Energy (@WhitefishEnergy) October 25, 2017 "Threats received by @WhitefishEnergy.The implication is if I do not "play nice" they will not do their job.Nasty!," the mayor tweeted back.She said Whitefish's response implied it would not treat San Juan with the "diligence it deserves."Whitefish then tweeted that it did not want to leave the island without helping and it was committed to restoring power in Puerto Rico.Related: Puerto Rico's cash crisis: 35% of banks still closed Yulin Cruz has long been a critic of Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello, who backed the Whitefish contract.She has also criticized President Trump's handling of relief efforts on the island, repeatedly noting that U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico are facing a "life and death situation" since the hurricane made landfall.She does not have authority over PREPA and the contracts it issues.The Whitefish contract has also been raising a few eyebrows among Democrats.On Tuesday, both a House and a Senate committee called for reviews of the Whitefish contract.PREPA's executive director, Ricardo Ramos, told reporters last week during a press conference the cash-strapped island chose Whitefish because it didn't require a big deposit upfront.The other unnamed contender wanted a $25 million down payment for the work, Ramos said."In that moment, we were not in a position to offer that collateral," said Ramos."The other company did not ask for a guarantee of payment."But some on Capitol Hill are concerned that Whitefish may have stood out for another reason.The tiny utility company is based in Whitefish, Montana, which also happens to be the hometown of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.Both Zinke and Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski acknowledge knowing one another.Zinke's office described Whitefish as a "small town" with a population of roughly 6,000 people.One of the secretary's sons "joined a friend who worked a summer job at one their [Whitefish's] construction sites."Related: Who owns Puerto Rico's mountain of debt?You do Whitefish spokesman Ken Luce confirmed an Oct. 1 report by NBC Montana, which quoted Techmanski as saying he reached out to Zinke after winning the contract to help get resources to the island more quickly, But Luce told CNN that the company did not make any requests to the administration except for one after the contract was signed on Sept. 26."The secretary had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish getting the contract," he said.Techmanski, who has described the firm as specializing in "difficult and mountainous terrain projects," has downplayed any ties to the administration.Related: Can Elon Musk fix Puerto Rico's broken power grid?"All I can say is, we took the call and we're here," Techmanski told CNN Friday, referring to a call from director Ramos."We called each other."Still, PREPA, a state-owned utility, chose to hire Whitefish rather than initiate agreements with other utilities to help recover from the natural disaster more quickly.The bankrupt utility, which is $9 billion in debt, could have requested aid after Maria through the American Public Power Association, a network that provides help to other utilities during widespread power outages.That's what Texas and Florida did after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.--CNNMoney's Patrick Gillespie contributed to this report.
GOP tax reveal to set off 'corporate hunger games':::::1.Tax bill revealed: President Trump's push to overhaul the U.S. tax system is about to face its biggest test yet.Up until this point, the GOP tax "plan" has been limited to a broad, mostly detail-free framework of ideas that many lawmakers and business groups could get behind.But come Wednesday, it will be all about the details when House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady promises to unveil his 1,000-page tax reform bill.And it's those critical details in the bill that could make or break the legislation.At issue: How will Brady propose to pay for the big business tax cuts Republicans have promised?Lawmakers, businesses and lobbyists will fight tooth and nail to preserve tax breaks they covet."Expect them to push back as if this was a life-or-death struggle because for many, it is," Chris Krueger, managing director of the Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in a recent report."Welcome to the corporate hunger game."The official path to modernize America's outdated tax system was created when the House narrowly (216-212) passed a budget this week that includes instructions to fast-track a tax reform bill that allows for $1.5 trillion worth of tax cuts over 10 years.But it won't be an easy path."The road ahead is bumpy and riddled with potholes," Isaac Boltansky, senior policy analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading, wrote in a recent report.Of course, Wall Street will be watching the tax battle very closely because hopes for massive tax cuts have helped send the stock market to new heights in recent months.Investors could get nervous if it looks like those tax cuts will be scuttled by GOP infighting.In any case, "expect some near-term volatility both in Washington and on Wall Street once the legislative text is released," Boltansky said.2.Jobs report: The Labor Department is scheduled to release October's job numbers on Friday.The U.S. lost 33,000 jobs in September -- the first monthly decline in employment in seven years -- thanks in large part to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.But overall, America's job market is in good shape.Unemployment is at a 16-year low, and weekly jobless claims are consistently down.The only problem is that wages aren't increasing by very much, making it difficult for consumers to keep pace with inflation.We'll see on Friday whether that continues to be the case.3.Fed meets as Trump mulls new chair: The Federal Reserve meets this week, with a decision on interest rates set to be announced on Wednesday.Don't expect too much: The Fed is not likely to raise rates this time.But Janet Yellen's term as Fed chair is coming to an end, and President Trump is expected to pick her successor -- or decide to stick with her -- next week.So even without a rate hike, there's a chance we could hear something interesting from Yellen.4.Apple's fourth quarter results: Apple (AAPL, Tech30) is set to announce its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.In August, Apple said it expects sales for the quarter to come in as high as $52 billion.Since then, the company has announced and launched three new phones.The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus have been on sale for weeks, and customers were able start ordering the iPhone X online this week.The X will hit stores on Friday.So far, sales of the 8 and 8 plus have reportedly been lackluster.According to the research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, the 8 and 8 plus accounted for just 16% of total U.S. iPhone sales in the quarter ending on October 1.The iPhone 7 and 7 plus, for comparison's sake, made up 43% of sales in the same time last year.5.Facebook earnings: Facebook (FB, Tech30) heads to the earnings stage on Wednesday.On Wall Street, at least, the social media giant has had a successful 2017.The company's stock has soared more than 50% this year.And though Facebook's growth has been slowing, the company is still expanding.But the company has also had some very public faux pas, from CEO Mark Zuckerberg's virtual visit to Puerto Rico to revelations that the social media platform hosted Russia-linked ads.Investors might ask Facebook to explain itself.6.Coming this week: Monday -- Mondelz (MDLZ) reports earnings Tuesday -- Aetna (AET), Kellogg (K), Pfizer (PFE), MasterCard (MA), Under Armour (UA) report earnings Wednesday -- Facebook, New York Times (NYT), Tesla (TSLA) report earnings; House releases tax reform bill Thursday -- Apple, Starbucks (SBUX), Yum!Brands (YUM), Ralph Lauren (RL), CBS (CBS) earnings Friday -- October jobs report; iPhone X hits stores
Is now really the time for massive tax cuts?:::::America's economy and jobs market look quite healthy right now.But President Trump is demanding very expensive surgery anyway.New numbers released Friday show that the U.S. has grown at 3% for back-to-back quarters for the first time in three years.Unemployment is sitting at just 4.2%, the lowest in 16 years.And consumer sentiment rose in October to levels unseen since early 2004.Despite the obvious strength in the economy, Trump recently promised on Twitter the "biggest TAX CUT" ever, adding "we need it!"Trump says he wants to push through both tax reform, which would modernize the outdated tax code, and to provide tax cuts to individuals and businesses.Given how healthy the economy is, some economists are mystified over Trump's urgent push for tax cuts that are likely to be paid for by adding to America's mountain of debt.Related: Economy posts impressive growth despite hurricanes "No other president in modern economic history has tried to do this," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank."It just seems completely unnecessary.With unemployment at 4.2%, why on earth would we try to stimulate the economy?"Normally, presidents ask Congress for deficit-financed tax cuts when the economy is weak.That's what President Obama did in 2009 during the Great Recession, and President George W. Bush did the same after the 2001 downturn."This is kind of an odd time to get fiscal stimulus.It's not like we're in a recession, or coming out of one," said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC.Here's the problem: There will be another recession, eventually.And spending heavily to slash the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% today could leave Congress with fewer options to tackle the next downturn.The current economic expansion is already the second-longest ever.Related: Will Trump's tax plan really give you a $4,000 pay raise?The Tax Policy Center estimates that Trump's tax overhaul would slash federal revenue by $2.4 trillion over 10 years, and by $3.2 trillion over the second decade.And the national debt is already 77% of GDP, and slated to keep growing."The risk is we don't have the money for a rainy day.It's borderline irresponsible," said Rupkey.It's true that the U.S. economy is not perfect.Businesses remain reluctant to spend, and Americans aren't getting the raises they deserve.Wage growth has been sluggish, although that improved in September.It's also true that tax reform is an admirable goal, no matter how fast the economy is growing.Tax reform, which is aimed at making the sprawling and outdated system more efficient, is different and much less costly than tax cuts."Tax reform that is paid for is much better for the economy than a plan that adds to the debt," Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, wrote recently.Some experts believe that efforts to reform the tax code will fail once details of the bill are finally unveiled on November 1, leaving the GOP to push simple tax cuts instead."We continue to expect deficit-increasing tax cuts, not...deficit-neutral tax reform," Barclays economist Michael Gapen wrote in a recent report.Given that the U.S. economy is "at full employment," Gapen believes that tax cuts will provide a "temporary boost" to GDP of just 0.5 percentage points.That would leave 2018 growth near 2.8%.The White House was asked on Friday by reporters about the need for tax cuts given solid GDP growth.Related: How Trump's tax plan could backfire on Wall Street Kevin Hassett, chair of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, argued that the U.S. economy has accelerated because businesses are excited about tax and regulatory reform.Hassett also predicted that lowering the corporate tax rate and allowing businesses to immediately write off investments could increase GDP by 3% to 5%, as well as boost wages.Without tax cuts and tax relief, the U.S. will be stuck with "depressed wage growth," the White House said in a statement on Friday.Rupkey concedes that tax reform could boost wages, but he's skeptical that wage growth will accelerate by a meaningful amount.Some economists fear that stimulus at this point in the economic cycle could be too much of a good thing."The worry is that by adding fuel to what's already, believe it or not, a pretty fiery economy in the U.S., you risk driving inflation and overheating growth," said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Capital.Such an outcome could spur the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates so rapidly that it derails the stock market and burdens businesses and consumers with higher borrowing costs."Deficit-financed tax cuts are the wrong way to go at this point," said Faucher.--CNNMoney's Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report
CVS and Aetna's mega health insurance merger could set a record:::::If CVS buys Aetna, it wouldn't only be the largest U.S. merger of the year -- it would be the largest American health insurance deal of all time.CVS (CVS) is considering buying Aetna (AET) for about $66 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.The companies are reportedly in active merger discussions.The hefty price tag would easily surpass Express Scripts' $29 billion acquisition of Medco in 2012, the current largest health provider merger.If the two companies agree to the deal, it would also be much larger than the two most expensive deals of the year, according to analytical firm Dealogic.Medical equipment supplier Becton Dickinson announced plans to acquire C R Bard for $24 billion and United Technologies has a $23 billion deal to acquire Rockwell Collins.Related: Amazon may be factor behind rumored CVS, Aetna merger Mergers and acquisitions have been on a downward trend from their 2015 peak, according to Datalogic.The total dollar value of corporate deals is down 29% this year -- and half of what it was in 2015.Tech sector mergers have also fallen this year their lowest point since 2003, Morgan Stanley says."The current M&A cycle appears to be ending in the US," the firm wrote in a research note Thursday.Still, there has been significant activity in the health care space -- even if two of the biggest deals never saw the light of day.In 2015, Anthem agreed to acquire Cigna for $54 billion and Aetna and Humana announced a $34 billion merger, but both deals fell apart.Federal judges blocked the pair of deals in February, citing antitrust law.Related: Aetna-Humana & Anthem-Cigna: Two mergers die in one day M&A might be dying down, but momentous deals are still happening.For example, United Tech's blockbuster partnership with Rockwell would become of the biggest aviation mergers in history.AT&T's (T, Tech30) $85 billion megadeal with Time Warner (TWX) -- which includes CNN -- is currently the largest agreement still pending, according to Datalogic.The Justice Department is expected to complete its review of the agreement by the end of the year.And the largest successful acquisition in U.S. history?Verizon's Communications $130 billion 2013 agreement to buy out Vodafone Group's 45% stake in its wireless business.
Puerto Rico sees an opportunity to reimagine the island:::::Puerto Rico had archaic roads, bridges and electricity for years -- long before Hurricane Maria.Then the storm devastated the island's transportation and communication networks.President Trump says "broken infrastructure" was to blame for any delayed response by the federal government.Seven in 10 Puerto Ricans still have no power.Despite the suffering, one of Puerto Rico's leaders sees the hurricane's destruction as a chance for a clean slate.Related: Misery in Puerto Rico: No power, no job, 'enormous' lines "We have this historic opportunity: Instead of going with incremental changes, we can go and push the envelope to really transform the infrastructure," Economic Secretary Manuel Laboy told CNNMoney on Thursday in New York."That is the silver lining opportunity that we have."The first sign of that type of sweeping rebuild came Wednesday, when Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that a children's hospital in San Juan, the capital, is being powered by Tesla solar panels and power packs.Musk wrote in an Instagram post that the project is the "first of many solar + battery Tesla projects going live in Puerto Rico."Laboy, the economic secretary, said Tesla has "five to 10" projects in the works in Puerto Rico, including schools and community centers.Tesla (TSLA) declined to provide specifics.AT&T (T, Tech30) and a project owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet, teamed up to provide cell phone coverage to parts of the island cut off from communication.Project Loon won approval from the U.S. government to fly up to 30 giant balloons over Puerto Rico, beaming down LTE service.(AT&T is buyingTime Warner (TWX), the parent company of CNN.)Puerto Rico is even pitching itself as a site for Amazon's second headquarters.Laboy declined to provide specifics but said he sent Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) a lucrative package of incentives to consider.Related: Puerto Rico power deal now under review He sees the island's recovery as a selling point with Amazon, in addition to Puerto Rico's educated and bilingual workforce."The opportunity to transform the infrastructure ... for me, that is a very powerful message," Laboy said.Of course, Puerto Rico has to get the lights back on before it can carry out big plans.And that hasn't been easy, nor without controversy.The utility company, PREPA, found itself under fire after it gave a $300 million contract to an infrastructure repair company, Whitefish Energy.The company only has two official employees, though it's hired hundreds of subcontractors to help restore the power grid.Investigations are under way into the the contract's procurement.Critics say the contract is bloated and didn't go through proper bidding.Beyond the physical damage, Puerto Rico must overcome vast other challenges to rebuild an innovative infrastructure system.Unemployment is high, and some the island's young, educated class has been leaving for the mainland United States for years.Some fear the hurricane's destruction could expedite the exodus.The island's government also filed for bankruptcy last spring.But Laboy says those challenges shouldn't prevent Puerto Rico from thinking big."We need to be bold and we need to transform the system," he added."That is going to be the key for the recovery, and the sustainable economic growth that we are aspiring to have in Puerto Rico."
Markets stumble as Catalonia declares independence from Spain:::::The dramatic escalation of a political crisis in Spain hit the country's benchmark stock index on Friday.Losses on the Ibex 35 reached nearly 2% after separatist leaders in the wealthy region of Catalonia voted to establish an independent state.The euro also weakened against the dollar, reflecting fears that the dispute could escalate into another major crisis in Europe.Lawmakers in the regional capital of Barcelona had been threatening to break with Spain after a contested independence referendum on October 1 was marred by violence.Related: Catalan lawmakers vote to split from Spain The declaration drew an immediate response in Madrid, where the national Senate voted to to seize control of the autonomous region.The Spanish government is now expected to remove Catalan President Carles Puigdemont from office, and impose direct rule from Madrid.Spanish stocks and the euro both recovered some lost ground following the response from the central government.Businesses have been caught in the middle of the dispute.Catalonia is Spain's most economically productive region, hosting 7,100 foreign companies including Volkswagen, Nissan and Cisco.Analysts say it's not clear how much economic damage the imposition of home rule might cause, but it would like disrupt many of the local government services and processes on which businesses rely.Related: These banks and businesses are leaving Catalonia Some executives aren't waiting to see what happens next, and have proactively moved their headquarters out of Catalonia.Companies that have relocated include major financial firms CaixaBank and Banco Sabadell, as well as real estate company Colonial and energy supplier Gas Natural Fenosa.Catalonia accounts for nearly a fifth of Spain's economy.
Jeff Bezos just passed Bill Gates for world's richest person:::::Jeff Bezos has leapfrogged Bill Gates again for the title of world's richest billionaire.But they're both having a pretty good day.Amazon stock jumped 13.5% on Friday after the company turned in another incredible earnings report -- more than a quarter-billion dollars in profit in three months.Bezos owned nearly 80 million shares in Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) as of August, according to the most recent available data from FactSet.He made more than $10 billion from the one-day stock surge and is now worth well over $90 billion.At the end of trading on Thursday, Gates occupied the top spot in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a net worth of $88 billion.Bezos had $83.5 billion, and his big day on Friday was more than enough to close the gap.But Gates also got a boost as Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) stock rose 7%.Gates owned 103 million shares as of September, according to FactSet.Microsoft stock climbed about $6 a share, so Gates added almost $600 million to his personal wealth.Bezos briefly dethroned Gates once before, on July 27, when his net worth topped $90 billion because of a temporary surge in Amazon stock.Related: The city Amazon picks for HQ2 will never be the same Amazon has been on a tear this year.It acquired Whole Foods and plans to establish a second headquarters somewhere in North America.More than 200 cities and regions have submitted bids to become the home for HQ2.--CNNMoney's Matt Egan contributed to this report.
Exxon got hammered by hurricanes, but profits still soared 50%:::::Hurricane Harvey dealt ExxonMobil a $160 million blow, but the oil giant's profits skyrocketed anyway.Exxon (XOM) said Friday that its profits for the July to September period soared by 50% thanks to higher oil prices.That growth was much faster than Wall Street had been banking on.The largest U.S. oil company would have earned even more had it not been for Hurricane Harvey, which forced the closure of several Exxon refineries in the Gulf Coast region.Severe flooding caused damage to Exxon's Beaumont and Baytown refineries, which are two of the largest in the U.S. All told, Exxon said Hurricane Harvey expenses and disruptions slashed its profits by about $160 million.Exxon and the industry as a whole are still trying to get back on their feet following the oil price crash of the past few years.Cheap oil forced Exxon and its rivals to lay off workers and scrap expensive drilling projects.Related: Oil giant Shell bets on electric cars Yet oil companies have benefited in recent months from steadier prices and lower expenses.It also helps that Exxon pumped 2% more oil and gas than last year.Another sign of improvement: For the fourth quarter in a row, Exxon generated enough money through its business and asset sales to cover the cost of its dividends and investments.Chevron, the No.2 U.S. oil company, is also on the upswing.Chevron (CVX) logged a 54% jump in third-quarter profits on Friday as oil and gas production increased."Cash flow is at a positive inflection point, with oil and gas production increasing and capital spending falling," John Watson's, who is stepping down as Chevron's CEO in February, said in a statement.On top of efforts to rebound from the oil crash, the industry has grappled with trouble on the climate change front.A Harvard study published in August concluded that Exxon "misled the public" on climate change for nearly four decades.Last month, San Francisco and Oakland filed lawsuits demanding that Exxon, Chevron and other oil companies pay billions to cover climate change costs.
The chaos in Venezuela could get much worse:::::As it sinks deeper into chaos, Venezuela has huge bills coming up, and it still hasn't paid debts that were due weeks ago.The country's state-run oil company, PDVSA, on Friday paid roughly $900 million to bondholders, but it still owes $350 million more that was due earlier this month.Many experts who follow Venezuela's economy see a government default as inevitable.The consequences of that would be severe for a nation of 30 million people that's already running out of food and medicine.Related: Venezuela's children are dying Making matters worse: More bills come due next week.On November 2, Venezuela owes $1.1 billion.It will have only a three-day grace period before a default occurs.Venezuela's bonds are owned by an array of investors, from Wall Street strategists to ordinary Americans with 401(k)s. The government has slowly drained its savings to pay down debt.In 2011, its central bank had $30 billion.In 2015, $20 billion.This year: $10 billion.By comparison, Venezuela's neighbor Colombia has four times as much in reserves: $46 billion.Leaders from across the Western Hemisphere met in Toronto on Thursday to condemn Venezuela's authoritarian regime, which has allowed the country's vast resources -- it has more crude oil than any other nation -- to go to waste."The government of Venezuela is choosing the path of dictatorship," Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told her counterparts in Toronto.Its regime "must face consequences that go beyond harsh words and condemnations."Related: Venezuela is blaming Trump for missed debt payments Freeland didn't specify what consequences President Nicolas Maduro and his administration could face.She said she hopes Cuba, an ally of Venezuela's, will join the international condemnation of Maduro's power grab.The Western leaders haven't collectively slapped sanctions on Venezuela, but its leaders say that option is on the table.One of Maduro's biggest critics was also in Toronto: Former Attorney General Luisa Ortega, who fled the country after Maduro's newly installed legislature banished her from her post."In Venezuela it is impossible to raise our voices because people are persecuted and imprisoned," Ortega said Thursday at a separate event at the University of Toronto.The so-called Lima Group -- named after its first meeting in Lima, Peru, in August -- consists of foreign ministers from Canada and several Latin American nations, including Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina.That type of unity is rare in Latin America, a region averse to nations' meddling in each others' affairs after a string of coups and dictatorships in the 20th century, some backed by the CIA.The United States, which didn't send a representative to Thursday's meeting, has slapped several rounds of sanctions on Maduro's government and its leaders.Maduro's surrogates have blamed those sanctions for the country's widespread problems and its prolonged delays on debt payments.Related: Venezuela President tells people to eat rabbits amid food shortages Excuses aside, experts say Venezuela is likely to default on its debt.It's just anyone's guess when that exactly will happen.The government has come close to defaulting before, only to find cash at the last moment.What's different now is that its cash pile has dwindled significantly.The consequences of a default would be dire, though the full domino effect may not take place immediately.Foreign investors would have the right to seize Venezuela's only valuable asset -- oil -- outside the country.That would strangle the government's cash flow, severely restricting its ability to import food and other essentials.Maduro's grip on power would be loosened, experts say."A default -- that would trigger the fall of the government," says Edward Glossop, an economist who covers Latin America for Capital Economics, a research firm."If they were to default ... we're going to get a very painful political transition."
U.S. economy posts impressive growth despite hurricanes:::::Even hurricanes weren't enough to stop impressive growth in the economy.The U.S. economy grew at a 3% annual rate from July through September, the Commerce Department said Friday.Economists were expecting 2.5% at best, partly because of the damage from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.Growth in the third quarter "demonstrates that the hurricane ended up having little lasting impact on the economy," says Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, a research firm.In fact, the United States enjoyed back-to-back quarters of 3% growth for the first time in three years.Growth from April through June was 3.1%.President Trump has promised to get it to 3% for an entire year.Economic growth has hung around 2% for years, partly because of slow wage growth and weak spending by businesses.Related: The job market is strong.Here's the asterisk.The economy has grown for eight straight years, one of the longest stretches in history.Unemployment is down to 4.2%, its lowest since 2001.The United States has added jobs in 83 of the past 84 months."It's still the slowest recovery by a long way," says Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America, an insurance firm."But we don't see anything to suggest that we would get a recession in the next year."North and other economists expected a bigger toll from the hurricanes.Ports, schools and businesses were temporarily closed, and some employees couldn't get to work even if their businesses stayed open.Hurricane recovery efforts are expected to provide a boost to economic growth toward the end of the year.Nearly all corners of the U.S. economy contributed to growth in the third quarter.Exports, imports and business spending on long-term projects were all up.Consumer spending, which makes up the majority of economic activity, rose a healthy 3.3%.North expects the U.S. economy to stay on track unless an unexpected shock happens, "like an incident with North Korea."
Steve Wynn: Tourists are still coming to Las Vegas:::::Casino mogul Steve Wynn says the gun massacre outside the Mandalay Bay casino isn't keeping tourists away from Las Vegas."If you're going to ask us what effect did the tragedy at Mandalay have on us?None that we can measure," Wynn said late Thursday on a conference call to discuss his company's earnings.Profit at Wynn Resorts (WYNN) topped Wall Street forecasts, thanks to solid sales at casinos in Las Vegas and Macau, a Chinese territory where gambling is legal.But the attack in Las Vegas earlier this month, which left 58 people dead and almost 500 injured, got much of the attention on the conference call.Wynn said his company has invested more in security since the shootings.He expects the rest of the industry is doing the same."We're sort of operating as a group.Some of us are talking to one another, like the Sands and MGM," he said.Wynn said people "in every executive suite up and down The Strip and in Reno and everywhere else and in hotels around the country" are searching for ways to prevent another massacre."We've had programs of training our employees for two years -- room service, housekeeping, audio visual people that go to fix a TV or touch screen," Wynn said."They've all been trained for two years.They inspect the rooms.They look at the people.We profile everybody," he added.Wynn said that the Las Vegas gunman, Stephen Paddock, had been a gambler at Wynn-owned casinos since 2006 but that there was nothing remarkable about him.He was a typical slots and video poker player who "didn't owe a dime in Las Vegas," Wynn said."He didn't meet the profile of a problem gambler or anything like that.He was a very controlled person," Wynn said.Related: Las Vegas is America's tourism capital Casino workers who knew Paddock "were stunned, mystified, that the person they knew could have been a person that tried to assassinate hundreds and thousands of people," Wynn said.Other Las Vegas companies have also said business is getting back to normal.Las Vegas Sands (LVS), which also operates in Macau, reported solid results and a healthy forecast.And Boyd Gaming (BYD), which owns several casinos in downtown Las Vegas, echoed Wynn's comments about strong tourism.Boyd CEO Keith Smith said his company does not "anticipate any material impact" on visitors to Vegas in the near future.Caesars Entertainment (CZR) and Mandalay owner MGM (MGM) wlll release their latest earnings in early November.
Subaru is latest big Japanese company to admit it screwed up:::::Another day, another crisis at Japan Inc. Automaker Subaru (FUJHF) said Friday that it's planning to recall roughly 255,000 cars after admitting it allowed uncertified workers to carry out inspections on its vehicles.The company found that workers at its biggest Japanese factory were still in training to be certified when they took part in inspections.CEO Yasuyuki Yoshinaga told reporters that the practice stretched back 30 years, but that the company didn't realize until recently that it was breaking government rules.The issues at Subaru came to light after Nissan (NSANF) reported similar problems last month, prompting the Japanese government to request that other automakers inspect their production lines.Subaru expects the planned recall to cost it more than 5 billion ($44 million).Related: What's wrong with Japan Inc?Yoshinaga didn't specify whether any countries outside Japan would be affected by the recall.Only about 15% of Subaru vehicles are sold in Japan.The U.S. is its biggest market.Subaru shares fell as much as 3.3% in Tokyo on Friday after reports about the scandal appeared in the Japanese media.The stock closed down 2.6%.The Subaru problems closely follow the crisis at Nissan.Last week, Nissan said it would halt production of cars for the Japanese market after discovering that inspections were not carried out properly at several factories.It had already announced a recall of 1.2 million vehicles over the issue.Related: Nissan halts production of cars sold in Japan Bloomberg reported Friday that the practice of letting uncertified workers carry out inspections at Nissan could stretch back as far as 1979.The company declined to comment on the report, saying it was awaiting the result of an external investigation.Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said last week that one of the reasons it was difficult to fix the inspections problem was because it had become engrained and part of the company culture.Subaru's admission adds to an ugly month for corporate Japan.Earlier in October, Kobe Steel (KBSTY), a century-old industrial giant, admitted to faking quality data on aluminum and copper products shipped to big customers including Toyota (TM) and Boeing (BA).Other recent scandals include Takata's deadly airbags, Mitsubishi Motors' fudged fuel-efficiency tests and Toshiba (TOSBF)'s damaging debacles over its accounting and its nuclear power business.
Premarket: 6 things to know before the bell:::::1.Economy check-up: The U.S. economy grew at a 3% annual rate from July through September, the Commerce Department said Friday.Economists were expecting 2.5% at best, partly because of the damage from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.2.Energy giants: Investors will get earnings from U.S. oil heavyweights ExxonMobil and Chevron before the opening bell.Big Oil, which has been under pressure from low crude prices, has largely missed out on this year's market rally.ExxonMobil (XOM) shares have fallen by about 8% in 2017, while Chevron (CVX) has inched up by less than 1%.A Harvard study published in August found that Exxon "misled the public" on climate change for nearly 40 years.The same month, a number of Exxon's refineries went offline because of Hurricane Harvey.In September, San Francisco and Oakland filed lawsuits demanding that Exxon, Chevron and other companies pay billions to protect the coastal cities from rising sea levels.The following week, Chevron announced that its CEO would step down next year.Other companies reporting results Friday morning include Goodyear Tire (GT) and Merck (MRK).Before the Bell newsletter: Key market news.In your inbox.Subscribe now!3.Stock market movers: Shares in Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) and Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) are shooting higher premarket after the firms reported better-than-expected profits.Mattel (MAT), Baidu (BIDU, Tech30) and Expedia (EXPE) shares are expected to slump.Mattel (MAT) announced it's suspending its quarterly dividend in order to free up cash.Its global sales have dropped 13%.Aetna (AET) shares spiked 12% late on Thursday after the Wall Street Journal reported that it's in talks to be purchased by CVS Health (CVS).Investors will be keeping an eye on any further developments.Both companies declined to comment.4.Things fall apart: Swiss chemicals giant Clariant (CLZNY) and its U.S. rival Hunstman (HUN) have decided to abandon their $20 billion merger following a shareholder revolt.The companies said in a joint statement that they would not join forces because of doubts that Clariant would get the backing of enough investors to push the deal through.The deal's termination marks a major win for top Clariant shareholder White Tale Holdings -- a partnership between hedge funds Corvex and 40 North -- that had opposed the merger.5.Global market overview: U.S. stock futures were mixed.European markets posted gains in early trading.Japan's Nikkei posted a 1.2% increase to lead most Asian markets higher.The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3% on Thursday, while S&P 500 gained 0.1% and the Nasdaq dipped 0.1%.Download CNN MoneyStream for up-to-the-minute market data and news 6.Coming this week: Friday -- ExxonMobil, Chevron and Merck earnings; GDP Q3 estimate released
$20 billion merger collapses after hedge fund attack:::::Swiss chemicals giant Clariant and its U.S. rival Hunstman have axed their $20 billion merger after it came under attack from an activist investor group.The two companies said Friday that they decided call the deal off because of doubts that Clariant (CLZNF) would be able to get the backing of enough shareholders to push the deal through.Clariant shares dropped about 5% following the announcement.The deal was undermined by White Tale Holdings, an activist investor who vocally opposed the merger and bought up Clariant shares in an effort to derail it.White Tale, a partnership between hedge funds Corvex and 40 North, now claims to be the Swiss chemical giant's biggest shareholder.Related: The battle for the future of Tide "The proposed transaction has no strategic merit," White Tale wrote in a letter published last month."It both significantly destroys existing Clariant shareholder value and prevents Clariant from pursuing multiple alternative and immediate opportunities to unlock value for its shareholders."Its opposition to the deal is now being supported by other shareholders as well, Clariant and Huntsman (HUN) said.Clariant announced on Friday that White Tale had increased its stake in the company to more than 20%.The investor's stake was at 15% last month when it launched its attack on the merger.
Mattel suspends dividend after earnings:::::Toy maker Mattel saw its sales pummeled by the bankruptcy of one of its biggest customers, Toys 'R' Us.The company said on Thursday that it suffered a 13% sales decline worldwide -- 22% in North America.Mattel (MAT) is also suspending quarterly dividends starting in the fourth quarter of 2017 in order to free up about $50 million per quarter.And the brand wildly missed Wall Street's expectations: Mattel reported earnings of $.09 per share -- well below analyst forecasts of $.57 per share.Related: Hasbro hurt by Toys 'R' Us bankruptcy Mattel offered a few reasons for its dismal report: Primarily, Toys 'R' Us' financial woes has made it hard for Mattel to perform.It's no surprise.The retailer was once responsible for nearly 10% of Mattel's sales.And Mattel's not the only one feeling the impact of the Toys 'R' Us bankruptcy.Hasbro (HAS) rattled investors when it warned this week that sales for the holiday fourth quarter could be lower than expected, citing Toys R Us as one reason.The news sent Hasbro stock tumbling by about 10%.Related: Toys 'R' Us files for bankruptcy But Hasbro has a lifeline in the form of its Star Wars, Marvel and Disney Princess toys, and it reported sales and profits for the third quarter that topped forecasts.Mattel toys, on the other hand, have been performing poorly for the past few quarters.This past quarter, its signature toys sold poorly again.American Girl sales were down 30% worldwide compared to this time last year.Fisher Price sales fell by 15%, and Barbie sales were down by 6%.The company said it wants to cut at least $650 million in costs over the next two years to help put it back on track.-- CNNMoney's Matt Egan contributed reporting to this story.
CVS reportedly in talks to buy Aetna:::::CVS and Aetna are said to be weighing a massive tie-up.The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that CVS Health (CVS) is in talks to acquire the health insurer for $66 billion.The story, which posted just before the market close, caused Aetna (AET) shares to skyrocket as much as 12%.Shares of CVS fell almost 3% after hours.Both companies declined to comment on market "rumors."If the merger is approved and goes through, it would reshape the health care industry.CVS Health controls a massive drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits management system, while Aetna is one of the nation's largest insurers.Related: Here's what you'll pay for Obamacare in 2018 But mergers involving health insurance companies have run into roadblocks in the recent past.In 2015, Aetna and Humana announced a $34 billion merger, while Anthem agreed to acquire Cigna for $54 billion.Both deals were called off in February after they were targeted by the Justice Department over antitrust concerns and blocked by federal judges.
Quest: Lessons for Spain and Catalonia:::::Quest's Profitable Moment I recently visited President Abraham Lincoln's cottage on the outskirts of Washington, D.C.It was here that Lincoln wrote the early drafts of the Emancipation Proclamation freeing the slaves in 1863, several years into the American Civil War.It was here where he plotted the Union's military and diplomatic moves.As I walked through the cottage, my inbox was flooding with emails about the deteriorating situation in Spain, where Catalonia is asserting its right to independence.Spain's prime minister is promising direct rule over Catalonia and has declared its government to be in "systematic rebellion and disobedience."Rebellion is the same word used by Lincoln in 1863 to describe the 11 southern states that seceded from the U.S. over slavery.The ensuing Civil War took the lives of hundreds of thousands of soldiers on both sides.It was a war Lincoln described as "one of the most terrible."I don't want to stretch the analogy too far.What struck me at Lincoln's cottage was the language being used in the 19th Century conflict in America and today's dispute in Europe.It is nave to believe bloodshed over secession can't happen in the modern European Union world.There already has been violence during the recent referendum.At each twist and turn of this dispute, the rhetoric has become more heated and the anger levels have risen.It is not beyond the realm of possibility for the Catalonia dispute to degenerate into fighting and loss of life.It may not be on the same scale of the American Civil War, but it could wind up destroying the bonds of the European Union.Sign up for the weekly Quest newsletter in your inbox Scandal-ridden Japan Inc. is in trouble The results are in: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe claimed victory in the latest snap election.Despite the success of some of Abe's economic programs, Japan is still grappling with an aging population and massive debt.And major Japanese companies are anything but winners on the global stage.The Kobe Steel false data scandal is just the latest hit to the country's once stellar corporate reputation.Takata.Mitsubishi.Toshiba.Even Nissan has suspended production of cars for the Japanese market due to vehicle inspection issues.-- Paul R.

A bond market freakout could derail the rally in stocks:::::Historically low interest rates are a critical ingredient in the remarkable stock market rally.All that easy money has fanned the flames by keeping borrowing costs low and forcing investors to take a gamble on risky stocks because bonds hardly make any money.But what if the recipe of steady economic growth and extremely low rates suddenly changed?A rapid spike in interest rates could disrupt or even derail the relentless run on Wall Street.Investors were dealt a fresh reminder of the market's addiction to ultra-low rates this week as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 2.44%, the highest since March.The closely watched Treasury rate, which moves opposite the price, is up dramatically from 2.27% on October 16.The selloff in bonds has been driven in part by expectations for faster growth and concerns that President Trump's choice to lead the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates more aggressively than Janet Yellen would.Some also worry that Trump's proposed tax overhaul could overheat the economy.The sudden move in rates led star bond investor Jeff Gundlach to warn on Twitter that "obituaries need to be written" for the 30-year bull market in bonds if the momentum doesn't reverse soon."The moment of truth has arrived," the billionaire said.Mike LaBella, portfolio manager at QS Investors, believes rates are still low enough to keep the party going in the stock market."But if rates climb at this accelerated pace, that could potentially hinder this recovery.Well above 3% or closer to 4% would definitely be alarming," LaBella said.Related: How Trump's tax plan could backfire on Wall Street Of course, it's way too early to say the great bull market in bonds is done.And steadily rising interest rates aren't a bad thing.If anything, investors alarmed by how long rates have remained extremely low would welcome a return to normalcy.As would those who own shares of banks, which have struggled to make money in the low-rate environment.That's why Wall Street has largely applauded the Federal Reserve's efforts to gradually raise interest rates."The economy can absorb slowly rising interest rates," said Art Hogan, chief equity strategist at Wunderlich Securities.But he conceded that the recent spike is "not gradual" and has forced investors to "sit up and take notice."It's no secret that ultra-low rates helped fuel the bull market in stocks.Bond returns are so low that investors are willing to accept more risk in stocks, even stocks that are very, very expensive by historical standards.After getting accustomed to low rates for nearly a decade, investors may be caught off guard by a sudden spike in rates.The Treasury Department's Office of Financial Research published a heat map this week identifying weaknesses in the U.S. financial system.Just one of the map's six categories flashed red, signaling high vulnerability: market risk.Within that category, the report indicated that the biggest risk is that the market is unprepared for higher rates.Related: Caution: U.S. stocks have rarely been this expensive Trump's effort to overhaul the tax system could push rates higher.If it gets through Congress, tax reform could spook the bond market by adding to the federal deficit or overstimulating a healthy economy.And the bond market could sell off if the European Central Bank and the Fed unwind their emergency bond-buying programs more aggressively than investors have been anticipating.Yet Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Capital, thinks it's "silly" to predict the end of the bond bull market because Treasury rates remain very low, hovering just above their five-year average.And bond bulls believe demand will stay high because the population of the world's major economies is getting older, and those people want safe, steady income."That's a trend that isn't ending anytime soon," LeBas said.If that's true, rising rates may pose a risk to the stock market, but perhaps not an imminent one.
Saildrones: The ocean drones trawling for climate change data:::::A fleet of unmanned boats is traveling from the Arctic to the equator, gathering vital data on climate change.The autonomous vessels -- called "Saildrones" -- resemble bright red surfboards.Each is fitted with a 20-foot-high carbon fiber sail, and 16 sensors that test variables including carbon dioxide, acidity, currents and water temperature.The drones, which cruise at a leisurely 3-5 miles per hour, are doing work typically reserved for manned research ships -- but for a small fraction of the cost.California-based Saildrone, which raised $14 million in funding from impact investors last September, says its drones can be operated for only 5% of the cost of a manned vessel."Beyond its significant commercial demand in industries ranging from fishing to government, [Saildrone] is helping directly measure and thus combat the effects of climate change," said Chamath Palihapitiya, founder and CEO of Social Capital, which has invested in Saildrone.It's not the only company producing ocean drones.Liquid Robotics, which is owned by Boeing (BA), makes surfboard-like "Wave Gliders" that are propelled by wave and solar power, rather than wind.The smaller vessels have logged over 1.4 million nautical miles.Saildrones, meanwhile, have logged a more modest 100,000 nautical miles since the company was founded in 2012.This year, the firm has deployed 20 vehicles for clients including the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).In July, NOAA sent two Saildrones on a six-month mission to the equator to study the weather phenomenon known as El Nino.Two more set sail for the Arctic Ocean to track melting ice and count fish, seals and whales.Saildrone also works with NASA to calibrate satellites that measure salinity from space, and the U.S. Navy to detect submarines that could be used to smuggle illegal drugs."The idea is that a fleet of Saildrones can stay at sea essentially permanently ... and extend a sort of border control," said Saildrone COO Sebastien de Halleux.The company's ambition is to scale quickly."Our goal is to deploy 1,000 Saildrones, and that would give us in real time -- in high resolution -- the pulse of the planet," said de Halleux.
Not America's beer? Budweiser sales down in U.S.:::::This Bud's not for you?Anheuser-Busch InBev, the owner of Budweiser, Bud Light and Stella Artois, said that beer sales in the U.S. fell 5.6% in the third quarter.Those are shockingly bad numbers when you consider that they came during the start of the football season and as the baseball pennant races were heating up with teams getting ready for the playoffs.Shares of BUD fell 2% on the news.It's also a sign that A-B InBev's push to brand Budweiser beer as "America" on bottles and cans during what the company called its "American Summer" may have failed to catch on with suds-loving consumers.A-B InBev said that market share for Budweiser and the lower calorie Bud Light fell in the U.S. during the quarter.Beer snobs in the U.S. are increasingly choosing fancier and pricier craft brews over established brands like Bud.AB-In Bev has recognized this and has been on a microbrew shopping spree over the past few years, scooping up popular brands like Goose Island, 10 Barrel Brewing and Blue Point.The company also has a significant minority stake in Craft Brew Alliance (BREW), the publicly traded firm that owns the Kona, Redhook and Widmer Brothers brands of beer.Related: Corona time!Beer owner's sales soar But AB-In Bev's growth in the craft segment isn't enough to offset the declines in its top brands just yet.Still, it wasn't all bad news for the company.A-B InBev said that other established brands, namely Michelob Ultra, Busch and Stella Artois, were growing in the U.S. and helping to pick up the slack for the weaker Bud and Bud Light sales.Overall revenues were up globally in the quarter thanks to growth in China, South Korea, Brazil, Argentina and Chile.AB-In Bev is also cutting costs thanks to its more than $100 billion merger with SABMiller last year.And even though BUD stock was down Thursday on the weak U.S. sales, the brewer's shares are still up 13% this year -- better than nearly all its rivals.Boston Beer (SAM), the owner of Sam Adams.is up just 5% while Molson Coors (TAP) is down 17%.But the American-listed shares of Heineken (HEINY) are up nearly 30% in 2017 while Constellation Brands (STZ), which sells Corona in the U.S., is up almost 40%.
Buffalo Wild Wings' stock takes off after going boneless:::::Whether you like it or not, Buffalo Wild Wings is winning with boneless chicken wings.The chain's popular Tuesday "buy one, get one free" deal on traditional bone-in wings has been a big draw for Buffalo Wild Wings' customers, but it was eating into the company's bottom line.Costs for traditional wings have spiked, rising more than 25% in the past year.So Wild Wings decided to switch the Tuesday deal to lower-cost boneless wings as a savings measure.Customers weren't necessarily digging the move: sales at restaurants that were open at the same time last year fell more than 2% after the change.But it made good business sense, since Buffalo Wild Wings was able to find some important savings.That's why the company says the boneless wings are here to stay, at least for now."The recent Tuesday promotion shift from traditional to boneless wings at company-owned restaurants will continue to improve cost of sales while traditional wing prices remain elevated," CEO Sally Smith said in a prepared statement on Tuesday.Overall, the company's profit continued its downward slide.Earnings fell 20% from the same quarter in 2016, mostly because customers still have a strong taste for chicken wings with bones in them.Investors were expecting that.Actually, Wall Street analysts' forecasts were far too pessimistic.The restaurant chain's profit smashed expectations.Investors also cheered Buffalo Wild Wings raising its financial outlook for the rest of the year.Shares of Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) surged 18% on Wednesday.Related: Chipotle's profit ravaged by hurricanes, hack and high avocado prices Still, it has been a rocky year for the company.Its stock is down 23% this year due to slumping sales and profit and an activist investor campaign from a group that wanted to reshape the chain.Smith announced over the summer that she would step down after 21 years as CEO.Like many other retailers and restaurants, Wild Wings weathered the impact from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma during the quarter.It was forced to close 71 restaurants because of the storms, costing the company nearly $3 million in sales.One particularly good sign: Declining NFL ratings aren't hitting Wild Wings so far.The company said on an conference call with investors that it doesn't expect the viewership drop to hurt sales.
Asia shares, crude oil buoyant; euro near 3-month lows:::::SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares climbed on Monday and crude oil rose to a 2-year top, while the euro loitered around a 3-month low as the European Central Banks decision to extend its stimulus further fattened the dollars yield advantage.A man looks at a stock quotation board outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan, April 18, 2016.REUTERS/Toru Hanai MSCIs broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS added 0.2 percent.The index is up 3.4 percent so far this month.Japan's Nikkei .N225 nudged 0.2 percent higher, while Seoul shares .KS11 climbed 0.7 percent.Global share markets have been on an uptrend since the start of the year, helped by solid corporate earnings and positive economic data across major countries.The world share index .MIWD00000PUS has surged 17.6 percent so far in 2017.The continuation of quantitative easing (QE) in Europe at a time when Japan remains locked on QE and the U.S. is only tightening gradually highlights that global monetary conditions will remain easy for a long while yet, said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital.This along with strong economic growth and earnings, largely explains why global share markets are so strong.On Friday, the Nasdaq .IXIC added 2.2 percent, the S&P 500 .SPX climbed 0.81 percent and the Dow .DJI rose 0.14 percent.Amazon (AMZN.O), up 13.2 percent, was responsible for the biggest boost to the S&P 500 after reporting a quarterly sales surge.Tech giant Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is due to report on Thursday.The dollar index .DXY was a touch softer, after two straight days of gains helped by upbeat third-quarter U.S. GDP data.The U.S. economy grew at a 3.0 percent annualized rate from July to September, showing resilience after recent storms.Investors are now focused on the impending appointment of the Federal Reserve chair, with speculation rife that Fed governor Jerome Powell is the favored suitor.Wagers that Powell, who markets see as a less hawkish candidate, will be the chosen one tempered the dollars advances and dragged 2-year Treasury yields off a nine-year top US2TY=RR.An announcement is expected this week.Markets are evidently still intent on having some fun, speculating on whether the next Fed chair will be trying to pull the Fed in a more hawkish direction or whether continuity will be the name of the game, said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank.In Europe, political uncertainty and the ECB together weighed on the common currency, marking its biggest weekly loss of the year.The euro EUR= steadied at $1.1602, not far from $1.1573 which was the lowest since July 20.Spain sacked Catalonias regional government on Friday, dissolved the Catalan parliament and called a snap election after Catalonia declared independence from Spain.The ECBs decision last week to extend its bond purchases into September 2018 also hurt the euro, driving yields on two-year German bunds lower DE2YT=RR.The premium that 2-year U.S. debt pays over 2-year German yields is now the widest since mid-1999, making it more attractive to borrow in euros to buy dollars.In commodities, Brent crude LCOc1 rose to $60.63 per barrel, the highest since July 2015, after Saudi Arabia agreed to support the extension of a global oil production cut agreement.[O/R] U.S. crude CLc1 ticked up 0.32 percent at $54.07 a barrel.Spot gold XAU= was trading 0.1 percent lower at $1271.20 per ounce.[GOL/]
As Trump tax comes to floor, failure could spell stocks selloff:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are increasingly pricing in the effect of a corporate tax cut into the shares of U.S. companies, leaving the market primed for a steep sell-off if the Republican-controlled Congress fails to pass one of President Donald Trumps top priorities.FILE PHOTO: A street sign is seen in front of the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street in New York, February 10, 2009.REUTERS/Eric Thayer (UNITED STATES) The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX is up nearly 6 percent from its August lows as the Trump administration has rolled out its tax reform proposal, which would cut corporate taxes to 20 percent from the current 35 percent and allow companies to bring back some of the $2.6 trillion in cash currently held offshore at reduced rates.Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that a positive boost from taxes had been priced out of stocks in July but has been making a solid comeback.Yet there are signs that the Trump administration has little room for error as it gets ready to introduce its tax legislation next week.The House of Representatives narrowly passed a budget measure on Thursday necessary for a vote on a tax bill, with Republicans from such high-tax states as New York and New Jersey among the opponents out of concerns that a bill would eliminate the deduction of state and local taxes.Trump must also stem potential revolts over a proposal to scale back the level of tax-deferred contributions to 401(k) retirement savings plans, which many middle-class Americans rely on for their retirement.The nature of the rally over the last two months has been tax-cut led.If we dont get a cut then the market is going down several percentage points, said Edward Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.Such a decline would be the first significant sell-off of the year, he said, but would not likely be near the 20 percent decline that signifies the start of a bear market.A collapse in the tax measure would likely send the S&P 500 down 5 percent or more, Goldman Sachs said in an Oct. 20 note.Tax reform will determine the direction of the S&P 500s next 100 points, the report said.Over the last 30 days, roughly 75 companies - ranging from delivery service United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) to hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) - have discussed how they would benefit from a corporate tax cut on conference calls with analysts, according to a Reuters analysis of earnings call transcripts, a sign that Wall Street is increasingly focused on the tax bill.The White Houses plan would boost 2018 S&P 500 adjusted earnings per share by 12 percent, to $156, Goldman Sachs estimates, while leading to an additional $75 billion in stock buybacks.Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, said that Trumps clashes over the last week with members of his own party could threaten the tax bills success because it could alienate other Republicans.Because Republicans hold only a slim 52-48 seat advantage in the Senate, Trump can afford to lose only two votes.When the possibility of a defection of some Republican senators increases, that kind of puts the whole tax reform thing in jeopardy.He needs them all, Tuz said.At the same time, the 14.4 percent year-to-date rally in the S&P 500 leaves the index primed for a decline of at least 5 percent, said Barry James, a co-portfolio manager of the $3.1 billion James Balanced Golden Rainbow fund (GLRBX.O).The S&P 500 trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 22.6, and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19.5, both well above their historical norms.Were at levels today that are historically very risky for stocks and were primed for a correction, James said.If theres not the tax cut that everyone is expecting, then the correction could be a whole lot more serious.
CVS bid for Aetna: A $66 billion bet on cutting drug costs:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - The proposed merger between U.S. pharmacy operator CVS Health Corp and No.3 health insurer Aetna Inc represents a $66 billion bet that insurers can drive down high U.S. drug prices by cutting out the middleman.FILE PHOTO: The CVS logo is seen at one of their stores in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016.REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo The move is the most expensive effort to date that would enable a national health insurer to take back full control of prescription medicines for their customers by negotiating prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and setting customer out-of-pocket costs for each drug.CVS, one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers, has offered to buy No.3 health insurer Aetna for more than $200 per share, sources said on Thursday.It could take at least several weeks for any deal to materialize.If the deal happens, it would likely pressure rival insurers, drugmakers, pharmaceutical benefits managers, and retail pharmacies to also consider mergers or switching partners to try to keep up with the potential healthcare cost savings or increase in profit margins.Its an alternate model at this point.Its not clear that its definitely a better one, BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch said.More consolidation could lead to pressure on some of the brand-name drug prices and a better counterweight to the big pharma companies.For years, insurers paid drug benefits managers like CVS and Express Scripts Holdings Co to negotiate down drug prices, with both parties taking a share of any discount by the time a medicine was paid for by consumers.But outrage over the high costs of drugs has grown as consumers have picked up a larger portion of the tab for drug costs and it is threatening profit margins all along the drug supply chain, from manufacturers to distributors, insurers and pharmacies.UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana Inc currently have in-house pharmacy benefits businesses, and say that it has helped them keep medical costs down.Anthem Inc recently decided to go down that same path.It cut ties with Express Scripts during a $3 billion legal fight, and said it would use CVS to build its own pharmacy benefits business in the next few years.That tie-up could now be at risk if CVS reaches a deal to buy Aetna, Leerink analyst Ana Gupta said.CVS also provides management services for Aetna rival Cigna Corp.If CVS buys Aetna, that could revive Cignas interest in buying Humana, analyst Christine Arnold of investment bank Cowen & Co said in a research note.Aetna earlier this year closed the door on a deal with rival insurer Humana Inc after antitrust regulators said that combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp were anti-competitive.The pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance could need to match its business model closer to CVS to attempt to stay competitive, Arnold said in a note, and may look at buying Express Scripts.Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said that Express Scripts could also be a target for Amazon Inc which is reported to be looking to get into the pharmacy business.SWINGING PENDULUM Over the past decade, health insurers have diverged on the value of the pharmacy benefits business.Anthem sold its pharmacy benefit manager to Express Scripts and outsourced almost all of the business in 2010.UnitedHealth took the opposite approach when it decided in 2011 to bring its pharmacy benefits management in house, then bought an even bigger standalone benefits manager, Catamaran, in 2015.Humana operates its own pharmacy benefit manager and Cigna and Aetna have hybrid approaches where they manage some parts in house and outsource others.Until recently, insurers sought to expand their profit margins by reducing their spending on hospital services, using their size to negotiate down what they pay to healthcare providers.But with those profits in hand, and with drug prices representing a bigger proportion of overall healthcare spending, they see new opportunity in targeting the pharmacy benefits, Leerinks Gupta said.Another potential lure of a deal for Aetna would be to capitalize on the growing number of simple health services offered in a CVS store, from flu shots to blood pressure checks.Reimbursing such patient care outside of a doctors office or hospital could cut healthcare costs, Gupta said.
Exxon, Chevron results linked to oil price, not cost cuts:::::HOUSTON (Reuters) - Rising oil and natural gas prices boosted third-quarter profits at Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp by about 50 percent, underscoring how reliant they remain on commodity markets for their financial futures than better technology or cost cuts.FILE PHOTO: An airplane comes in for a landing above an Exxon sign at a gas station in the Chicago suburb of Norridge, Illinois, U.S., October 27, 2016.REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo Despite deep capital spending cuts and a refocusing on projects that can generate faster paybacks in recent years, the results on Friday showed the pair, neither of whom hedge oil output, are still at the mercy of price gyrations.Exxon and Chevron have pointed to aggressive plans for boosting low-cost U.S. shale production.But in recent quarters total output at both has atrophied and shale is unlikely to deliver a marked lift until the next decade, based on corporate projections.Both are trying to be disciplined and show growth, said Brian Youngberg, an oil industry analyst with Edward Jones.But its a little bit of a transition, especially as theyre trying to increase shale (output).The pair reported the same day as French rival Total SA posted a 29 percent jump in its third-quarter net profit as project ramp-ups and new investments lifted production.Exxon, which reported a better-than-expected quarterly, said its Permian oil production will grow 45 percent each year through 2020, to more than 400,000 barrels per day.The company also has a large shale position in North Dakotas Bakken shale formation.Still, Exxon said higher prices contributed $860 million to its earnings while volume increases added only $20 million to the latest quarters exploration profit.Exxons total output in the quarter was the lowest this year.FILE PHOTO - The logo of Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market index listed company Chevron (CVX) is seen in Los Angeles, California, United States, April 12, 2016.REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo Also on Friday Exxon, part of a consortium with Norways Statoil and Portugals Petrogal, a unit of Galp Energia, won one of four blocks in Brazils coveted pre-salt oil region in an auction.Exxon stock edged up 0.1 percent to $83.53 on Friday afternoon.At Chevron, a writedown of its Bangladesh operations and a drop in U.S. production weighed on results, which missed Wall Street estimates by a wide margin.Chevrons stock slid 4.5 percent to $113.15, a drop that surprised Chief Executive Officer John Watson, he said during an investors conference call.The San Ramon, California, company, which has been one of the Permians largest acreage holders since the 1930s, has only recently begun to aggressively develop its oil reserves there.Watson told Reuters earlier this year the Permian is very important in the companys portfolio.While the company has yet to forecast 2018 production goals for the Permian, Watson said on Friday that Chevron will grow aggressively in the region.Chevrons overall average daily output was up 8 percent over a year ago, but that was largely due to the start of giant natural-gas projects.U.S. oil production at Chevron fell overall, as aging field output offset a jump in Permian production.The loss in U.S. oil production narrowed sharply as the price received for its crude rose 13.5 percent over a year earlier.
GE Board did not know about CEO's extra plane: WSJ:::::(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) executives did not tell the multinational conglomerates board until October about a spare business jet that routinely flew for its now-retired chief executive, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.FILE PHOTO - General Electric Co Chief Executive Jeff Immelt speaks at a news conference in Boston, Massachusetts, in this April 4, 2016, file photo.REUTERS/Brian Snyder/Files Executives also did not tell directors that the maker of aircraft engines, locomotives, power plants and other industrial equipment had received an internal complaint about the jet several years ago, the publication said, also citing people familiar with the matter.The Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 18 that former Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt had an extra aircraft follow his corporate jet on some overseas trips during much of his 16 years in the role.GE executives first informed the board about the practice after the report, the publication said.GE told its directors the company had scaled back the practice in mid-2014 and would continue to use the backup plane only in limited situations, such as going to risky locations, the Journal reported.Immelt told the Journal on Thursday that he did not know the spare plane was flying.Immelt, 61, stepped down as CEO on Aug. 1 and planned to continue as chairman through Dec. 31.But John Flannery was named chairman on Oct. 2.Flannery has grounded GEs corporate aircraft fleet to cut costs and initiated a new policy under which executives will fly on commercial or charter flights, the Journal said.

GM settles California county recall case for $13.9 million:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co agreed to a $13.9 million settlement with Orange County, California after prosecutors accused the Detroit automaker of intentionally concealing serious safety defects including those involving faulty ignition switches tied to nearly 400 deaths and injuries, the company said on Sunday.The GM logo is seen at the General Motors Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant in Lansing, Michigan October 26, 2015.Photo taken October 26.REUTERS/Rebecca Cook An Orange County superior court judge late Friday approved the settlement for alleged violations of unfair competition and false advertising laws for some vehicles recalled in 2014, including the ignition switch recall.Earlier this month, GM agreed to a separate $120 million settlement with 49 states and the District of Columbia over faulty ignition switches and its auto safety practices.Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said in a statement that GM failed to disclose defects in power steering, airbag and braking systems.The largest U.S. automaker had previously paid about $2.5 billion in penalties and settlements over faulty ignition switches that could cause engines to stall and prevent airbags from deploying in crashes.The defect has been linked to 124 deaths and 275 injuries, and prompted a recall that began in February 2014 of 2.6 million vehicles.GM spokesman David Caldwell said in a statement that since 2014, GM had taken important steps to help ensure vehicle safety, including a new organizational structure and a new program to encourage employees to report potential issues.GM still faces more than 100 lawsuits in connection with the ignition switch recall, including economic loss and personal injury claims.The only remaining governmental lawsuit is from the state of Arizona.In 2015, GM paid $900 million to settle a U.S. Justice Department criminal investigation and agreed to three years of oversight by an independent monitor after being charged with wire fraud.No individuals were charged, but Chief Executive Mary Barra fired 15 people, including eight executives, over the issue.The ignition switch probe prompted an industrywide jump in recalls in 2014 to an all-time high and cast a spotlight on GMs safety record as Barra testified before the U.S. Congress.
China's Baidu teams up with Shouqi on driverless cars: Xinhua:::::BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese search engine giant Baidu and Shouqi Limousine & Chauffeur, a car-hailing operator, are joining up to develop driverless vehicles, the official Xinhua media service reported on Saturday.FILE PHOTO - Baidu's company logo is seen at its headquarters in Beijing December 17, 2014.REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo Baidu (BIDU.O) will provide Shouqi with its Baidu Map service, while Shouqi will help Baidu develop high-precision maps for self-driving cars.Baidu will also offer software and hardware to help the new vehicles navigate using artificial intelligence technology.The Chinese internet company is trying to reshape its business around AI and autonomous driving, a strategy that has raised concerns among some investors.Shouqi Limousine & Chauffeur, a subsidiary of the state-owned Shouqi group, operates in more than 50 cities in China.Baidu recently signed an agreement with BAIC Group to mass produce level 4 autonomous vehicles by 2021.It is targeting mass production of autonomous buses with King Long by 2018.
Telekom CEO argues for strong No. 3 player in U.S. wireless market: newspaper:::::FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A strong No.3 player in the U.S. wireless market would enhance competition, the chief of Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) told a German newspaper, as T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) seeks to merge with Sprint Corp (S.N).Timotheus Hoettges, Chief Executive Officer of Germany's telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom AG poses for a picture at the Cyber Defense and Security Operation Center (SOC) of Telekom Security in Bonn October 26, 2017.REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay Chief executive officer Timotheus Hoettges also urged the new German government to think twice before selling down its large stake in Deutsche Telekom, according to an interview in Welt am Sonntag.T-Mobile US, majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom, is close to agreeing tentative terms on a deal to merge with Sprint Corp, people familiar with the matter have said, a breakthrough in efforts to merge the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers.Hoettges, in the interview published on Sunday, declined to comment directly on talks between the companies.In the U.S. there is a duopoly between two very big players, and then there are two smaller players well behind, he said.A third strong player would be good for competition.Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T Inc (T.N) are the two largest wireless carriers.Competition regulators have in the past quashed consolidation efforts by T-Mobile, but Hoettges said chances are now better under U.S. President Donald Trump.History has taught us that governments led by Republicans are more hands-off than Democratic administrations, he said.On the German states nearly 32 percent stake in Deutsche Telekom, Hoettges acknowledged it would be the new governments decision whether to sell or keep.But he said those who argued for a sale should perhaps ask themselves who will buy the stake.What interest would the owner have in infrastructure security?Would the owner want to invest in Germany, and if so, where and in particular, how much?The FDP and Green parties, which are in talks to form a coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkels conservatives, have both advocated a sale or partial sale of the stake.
U.S. wants to remove 'unnecessary' barriers to self-driving vehicles:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic-Safety Administration said Friday it is looking for input on how it can remove regulatory roadblocks to self-driving cars.FILE PHOTO -The rear of a Lexus SUV equipped with Google self-driving sensors is seen during a media preview of Google's prototype autonomous vehicles in Mountain View, California September 29, 2015.REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage/File Photo The auto safety agency said in a report that it wants to find any unnecessary regulatory barriers to self-driving cars particularly those that are not equipped with controls for a human driver.The agency also wants comments on what research it needs to conduct before deciding whether to eliminate or rewrite regulations.But it could take the agency years to complete the research and finalize rule changes, and advocates are pushing Congress to act.NHTSA said in a statement it plans to issue a formal notice in the near future requesting comment on the hurdles.The agency hopes to make the notice public by the end of November.Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle.The agency said last year that current regulations pose significant regulatory hurdles to vehicles without human controls.In early October, a U.S. Senate committee unanimously gave the green light to a bill aimed at speeding the use of self-driving cars without human controls and would allow the agency to waive requirements.General Motors Co (GM.N), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and others have lobbied for the landmark legislation, while auto safety groups urged more safeguards and have pledged to keep fighting for changes.The Senate Commerce Committee approved the bill, and the U.S. House passed a similar measure last month.Automakers would be able to win exemptions from NHTSA for safety rules for up to 80,000 vehicles annually within three years.Under the Senate measure, NHTSA would have to write permanent rules on self-driving cars within a decade.
Maryland investigating Kushner Companies over apartments:::::The Maryland attorney general is investigating one of the Kushner family's real estate businesses after media reports surfaced earlier this year about allegedly abusive debt collection practices and poor conditions at several of its properties.Kushner Companies said it is cooperating with Attorney General Brian Frosh, Maryland's top legal officer."We have been working with the Maryland Attorney General's Office to provide information in response to its request," Kushner Companies told CNN through a spokesperson."We are in compliance with all state and local laws."A Baltimore-based attorney is working with Kushner Companies on the matter, according to a person familiar with the attorney general's inquiry.A spokesperson for the AG's office declined to comment, citing a policy of not confirming or denying investigations.The inquiry does not mean charges will be filed.This spring and summer, media reports exposed allegedly coercive tactics and inadequate maintenance in multifamily housing developments run by Westminster Management or related entities.An affiliate of Kushner Companies, Westminster manages about 17 properties in Maryland, including developments in Baltimore, Middle River and Essex, according to its website.Kushner Companies has been under the microscope since President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, entered the political scene first as Trump's confidant during the 2016 campaign and now as a senior White House adviser.A Kushner financial disclosure form shows income of $1.6 million from Westminster.A White House spokesman declined to comment.Kushner, married to Trump's daughter Ivanka, stepped down as CEO of his family's namesake business in January and recused himself from certain policy issues since joining the White House.But those measures haven't fully shielded the company from allegations of conflicts of interest and criticism from political foes of the administration as well as more scrutiny from the press.In May, The New York Times and ProPublica detailed "poor upkeep" inside developments run by Westminster, including appliance failures, mold and mouse infestations.The report also documented unsavory debt collection tactics.In addition, The Baltimore Sun reported that Kushner-affiliated businesses were "the most aggressive in Maryland" in seeking civil arrests of tenants who owed the company money.Kushner Companies defended its methods.Responding to the Sun, the company's chief financial officer said the firm "follows guidelines consistent with industry standards" and state law when it files legal action.Westminster Management, "only takes legal action against a tenant when absolutely necessary," said Kushner Companies' CFO Jennifer McLean in a statement to the Sun.Related: Jared Kushner's White House role complicates family business In August, Democratic lawmakers cited the stories in a letter to Kushner Companies, requesting answers to questions on matters including alleged housing code violations and federal subsidies from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.They were seeking a response by September 8."If these reports are accurate, they raise very serious and troubling concerns about whether Kushner Companies and its subsidiaries are complying with HUD's housing quality standards to ensure the safety and health of their own tenants," wrote the lawmakers, who included Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee.In response, Kushner Companies issued a public statement reiterating that the company exercises its "legal rights under the relevant provisions of the Maryland law."But Kushner Companies did not provide specific answers or produce documents, according to Cummings, who wrote a letter last week asking oversight committee chairman, Republican Trey Gowdy, for help.In the letter to Gowdy, Cummings said his staff called Kushner Companies six times and were told "no information would be provided."In a separate matter, Frosh and the attorney general of the District of Columbia are suing Trump, alleging that his business interests violate the Constitution.The attorneys general are asking a court to block Trump from accepting foreign money.
White House economist and former Treasury Secretary spar over Trump tax plan:::::A high-profile economist and President Trump's chief economic adviser presented starkly different views on the president's tax reform proposal.Speaking on CNN's "GPS" with Fareed Zakaria on Sunday, Trump adviser Kevin Hassett defended his claims that lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% would lead to a $4,000 annual pay raise for the average American household.Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, also appearing on "GPS," called Hassett's claims "fake facts."He alleged Hassett cobbled together a "political brief" rather than an objective economic analysis.Hassett -- who floated the $4,000 figure in two reports put out earlier this month -- fired back.He accused Summers of lobbing personal attacks and insisted other reputable economists have backed up his analysis.Here's a breakdown of the issue.Hassett says lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate, which is among the highest in the world, will encourage U.S. companies to invest more of their money in their U.S. operations rather than investing it abroad.As companies buy more machines and other technology for use domestically, productivity will rise.That, in turn, can boost wages, Hassett argues.Reality check: Will Trump's tax plan really give you a $4,000 pay raise?Summers, like many economists on both sides of the aisle, agree corporate tax reform will have "some positive impacts."But Summers -- a Democrat who served as President Bill Clinton's Treasury Secretary and as an economic adviser for President Barack Obama -- says Trump's plan is poorly designed and could harm the middle class."The claims that this administration makes -- that the tax cut will pay for itself, that the tax cut will raise incomes [...] that the tax cut isn't skewed toward helping rich people -- those are fake facts, and I think they need to be called out," Summers said.For one thing, he said, if and when companies do bring earnings back from overseas, it's not clear how they'll use that extra money."Maybe the corporations will just keep the money and pay it out in the form of higher dividends or doing more repurchases of shares," Summers said.Related: Republican tax plan faces big hurdles ahead of 2018 Summers' own analysis suggests Trump's tax plan could boost income by around $1,300 per year -- not $4,000.He also said Hassett's analysis of the tax plan "was egregiously selective in the use of evidence."Hassett said it was Summers that used faulty math.He said a review of other countries around the globe found that when they cut corporate taxes, wages went up."They don't always do it, but they tend to go up," Hassett said.He also pointed to an analysis by Boston University economist Larry Kotlikoff, which estimated the Trump tax framework as a whole might raise household incomes by $3,500.--CNNMoney's Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report.
House GOP concedes on property tax deduction:::::The House hasn't even released its tax reform bill yet, and Republican lawmakers are already making a big concession over one of their most controversial proposals.Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has decided to only partially repeal the state and local tax deduction, bending to concerns of colleagues from high-tax states."At the urging of lawmakers we are restoring an itemized property tax deduction to help taxpayers with local tax burdens," Brady said in a statement this weekend.The news was first reported by Bloomberg.Today, anyone who itemizes their deductions on their federal tax return may deduct their state and local property taxes, as well as their state and local income taxes or general sales taxes.In their bid to pay for the trillions in tax cuts they want, as well as simplify the tax code, Republican leaders have proposed repealing most itemized deductions.The state and local tax deduction -- aka SALT -- is the biggest among them.Repealing it fully could bring in more than $1 trillion in revenue over a decade.Brady's concession on property taxes may help some of the moderate-income people who benefit from the deduction today.The majority of the SALT deductions claimed by those who make less than $50,000 come from property taxes, according to a report from the Government Finance Officers Association.By contrast more than 70% of the SALT deductions from those making more than $200,000 are due to income.Related: Millions in middle class will feel it if GOP kills this tax break But it's not clear from Brady's statement if there would be any limits on who may take the property tax deduction.For instance, if it's available only to people who itemize, then chances are many wouldn't take it.That's because his bill would nearly double the standard deduction.And that would drastically reduce the number of itemizers, since you only itemize if your deductions combined exceed your standard deduction.Impossible to satisfy all demands Brady's decision, just a few days before he's due to unveil the House tax reform bill, speaks volumes about the political and policy challenges ahead for lawmakers: how to meet the Republican goals, while garnering enough support to pass a bill.A group lobbying to keep all of the state and local deduction intact was quick to call foul at Brady's concession, noting that his home state of Texas has no income tax and is heavily dependent on property taxes for revenue."[His] partial elimination plan for the state and local tax (SALT) deduction would insert the heavy hand of Washington into state and local finance decisions, dictate winners and losers among states, and unfairly penalize taxpayers in states that rely significantly on income taxes," Americans Against Double Taxation said in a statement.Leonard Lance, a New Jersey Republican congressman who has been a lead negotiator in the SALT debate, called the announcement a "step in the right direction" but argued there's more work to be done."I will need to see legislative text to determine if this proposal is in the best interest of New Jersey," Lance said in a statement."We already send more than enough money to Washington."Related: Is now really the time for massive tax cuts?Separately this weekend, the National Association of Home Builders made clear it wouldn't support the GOP tax plan as is because it doesn't do enough to support homeownership."This plan is particularly disappointing, given that the nation's home builders warned that the proposal would severely diminish the effectiveness of the mortgage interest deduction and presented alternative policies that would retain an effective housing tax incentive in the tax code," the NAHB said in a statement.The group said it believed it had a deal with lawmakers to include a homeownership tax credit that could be taken by anyone -- even if they don't itemize.But "we were told by the House leadership that the credit will be removed from the bill."But the House bill -- which is supposed to be released Wednesday -- is just the first word, not the last, on any tax legislation.As the negotiations begin over tax reform, first in the House and then the Senate, there's no telling yet where things end up.Brady said in his statement he hopes members of Congress will further examine the NAHB proposed credit "before tax reform heads to the president's desk."CNN's Kevin Bohn, Lauren Fox and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.
Puerto Rico's power authority is working to cancel Whitefish contract:::::Puerto Rico's power authority is working to cancel a controversial contract it awarded to a small Montana-based utility company.Ricardo Ramos, the CEO of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, says he is "asking for a resolution" that would allow for the cancellation of the contract with Whitefish Energy.The $300 million deal with the two-year-old company has drawn widespread scrutiny.Whitefish, which was tasked with helping to restore power to parts of hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, had few employees before Hurricane Maria hit.Ramos said during a Sunday press conference that the contract is "not canceled as of yet," adding that it requires 30 days of prior notice.He said he will need to talk to the firm."The plan is not to demobilize them either, we will let them finish what they have started," Ramos said.Whitefish said in a separate statement that it's "disappointed" in the decision to terminate their agreement."The decision will only delay what the people of Puerto Rico want and deserve -- to have the power restored quickly in the same manner their fellow citizens on the mainland experience after a natural disaster," the statement reads."We only wish the best for the great people of Puerto Rico."The contract with PREPA marked the largest contract to be awarded since recovery efforts began more than a month ago.Whitefish is also based in the small hometown of U.S.Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, which has raised questions.Zinke has said he had nothing to do with the contract.A White House spokesman told CNN the decision to give the contract to Whitefish was made exclusively by PREPA.Related: How Whitefish landed Puerto Rico's $300 million power contract "The White House is not aware of any federal involvement in the selection," White House spokesman Raj Shah said.Whitefish did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday.The decision to cancel the deal Sunday came hours after Puerto Rico Gov.Ricardo Rossell publicly called on PREPA to do so.He said questions raised around the contract are "interfering with everything" and the distractions are not helping Puerto Rico rebuild.To help ensure transparency going forward, Rossell said that he will appoint a finance official to PREPA who will oversee the contracting process.He also asked Puerto Rico's Office of the Comptroller to conduct a review of how the emergency contract was awarded.In the meantime, Rossell said his team is working with the governors of Florida and New York to bring energy workers from those states to help Puerto Rico as quickly as possible.The controversy surrounding the Whitefish contract has spurred a probe by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general, who will also be looking at how the firm was selected.Related: Puerto Rico sees an opportunity to reimagine the island Last week, Rossell indicated he would be willing to move forward with the Whitefish contract if there was no evidence of misconduct.He also asked the inspector general to complete the review by Monday."If there is no wrongdoing, if it has been done correctly then we will push forward," Rossell told CNN at the time."If there is wrongdoing in this process or any process there will be hell to pay."Puerto Rico's already frail power infrastructure was all but destroyed after Maria tore through the island.As of Sunday, only about 30% of Puerto Rico's power generators were back online, according to PREPA data.Whitefish workers first arrived on the island on October 2.The company said Sunday that the contract "only sped up the repairs, and if it were not for that action, crews would just now be getting to the island to begin the process of rebuilding the system and restoring power."According to the firm, its efforts have restored power hospitals, businesses and residents of the north-central town of Manat, Puerto Rico.It's currently working to bring power to another 500,000 people in San Juan."We will certainly finish any work that PREPA wants us to complete and stand by our commitments," the company said.--CNN's Donna Borak, Rene Marsh and Greg Wallace contributed to this report.
Devastating hurricanes dealt corporate America a major blow:::::Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria dealt a big blow to corporate America.More than 40% of companies in the S&P 500 that have reported third-quarter earnings so far mentioned the hurricanes on investor calls, according to a Sentieo analysis.Flights were grounded, stores were closed, manufacturing production was halted and customers didn't go out to eat.Corporate profits still surged, led by strong consumer spending.But Harvey and Irma cost companies around $20 billion in lost business, estimated Gus Faucher, chief U.S. economist at PNC.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, put losses as high as $22.5 billion in the U.S. and $30 billion from Maria's staggering toll on Puerto Rico.By comparison, Hurricane Katrina cost the country $30.9 billion in lost output, Zandi told CNNMoney."This was an unprecedented quarter when it comes to natural disasters," AT&T (T, Tech30) CFO John Stephens said on an investor call Tuesday.The world's biggest telecom company blamed the hurricanes for a dip in video subscriptions this quarter.(AT&T is buying CNN parent Time Warner.)Big losses for travel Nearly every industry in the country has a major footprint in Texas and Florida, areas battered by Harvey and Irma.Many have locations in Puerto Rico as well.But cruise lines and airlines were hit particularly hard, Bank of America economists said in an October research note.Hurricanes upended insurance companies too.The industry has posted $6.9 billion of losses so far, said John Butters, an analyst at FactSet.Travelers (TRV) alone reported it could suffer $700 million in losses from payout claims.Related: The U.S. has been hit by two giant hurricanes.Here's the financial toll Airline earnings were also weaker.United Airlines estimated $210 million in lost sales, while JetBlue (JBLU) said this week that the storms would cost it $90 million in revenue.On Thursday, Expedia (EXPE) reported $20 million in pre-tax losses due to fewer hotel bookings, while Goodyear Tires (GT) said Friday that it lost $23 million in sales.Widespread impact The hits landed in unexpected places too: Budweiser and Bud Light sales were down at retail stores because of the storms, Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) reported, and Harley-Davidson (HOG) said the hurricanes cut motorcycle sales between 1.5% and 2%.Storms somewhat slowed economic growth in the third quarter, since companies produced and sold fewer goods and services.The economy still grew at an impressive 3% from July through September, but it could have been even higher without the hurricanes."If not for the hurricanes, the GDP would have been 3.5%," said Zandi.Related: Economy posts impressive growth despite hurricanes The economic rebound is already underway from the disasters and the impact should be short-lived, economists agree."Most of the negative impact appears to be behind us," said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics."There's no reason to believe that it would be anything more than a short-term hit."Zandi said lost activity from the hurricanes will be made up in the final months of 2017 and into next year."If people didn't buy cars or go on vacation because of the storms, they'll spend that money later," he said."Factories will eventually produce most of the output that they didn't make because of the storms."Auto sales rose 6.1% in September from the previous year, helped by GM's (GM) 12% spike and Ford's (F) 9% increase.Related: Chipotle's profit ravaged by hurricanes, hack and high avocado prices The home improvement and construction industries even got a lift from the hurricanes, as people started rebuilding damaged homes and replacing flooded cars.Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) reported upticks in September.United Rentals (URI), the largest construction rental equipment company in the country, cited hurricane recovery efforts this week to raise its outlook for the rest of the year.
Wild concepts from the Tokyo Motor Show:::::The most striking car revealed at the Tokyo Motor Show didn't come from Honda or Toyota but from an Italian automaker you may never have heard of.The company, Iso Rivolta, made very handsome coupes with Corvette engines during the 1950s and '60s, an era that saw the creation of many of Italy's most famous automobiles.The concept car from the now-revived Iso Rivolta looks edgier than the brand's rather understated classics but it sticks to tradition in terms of power.It has a 997-horsepower modified Corvette V8 engine and a 10-speed transmission.Designed by the Italian auto design firm Zagato, the Iso Rivolta Vision Gran Turismo will be available to drive in the video game Gran Turismo Sport on the Sony PlayStation 4.As many as five of these cars will be produced in real life for actual customers.There is no word yet on how much each one will cost.But it will, no doubt, be far cheaper to drive one in the video game.Among more familiar automakers, Toyota (TM) revealed the Fine Comfort Ride concept.Yes.That's its actual name.The van-shaped vehicle envisions a hydrogen fuel cell-powered luxury car with an emphasis on roominess over slick styling.The car's body tapers slightly toward the rear for better aerodynamics while maximizing passenger space.Like all fuel cell vehicles, it emits only water vapor as exhaust.Nissan's IMx concept looks like a boxier version of the Nissan (NSANF) Murano crossover.It is, according to Nissan, a fully autonomous vehicle with entertainment systems controlled by hand and eye movements.It's electrically driven with separate motors for the front and back wheels.(As with most concept vehicles, it's unclear how much, if any, of this technology actually exists in the car.)With little in the way of technological pretensions, Mazda's Vision Coupe concept is purely a design exercise.It shows what Mazda's designers are working on for future Mazda cars.It's supposed to be a more refined interpretation of Japanese design esthetics, Mazda (MZDAF) says.The body has what Mazda calls a "one motion" shape implying speed and grace.If you live in America, the Suzuki car you probably remember best was the old Samurai SUV.It was a tiny Jeep competitor.(Suzuki dropped out of the U.S. market five years ago.)The Suzuki e-Survivor concept is, essentially, a modern electric Samurai.Each wheel is powered by its own electric motor.Honda's Sports EV concept is a follow-up to the Urban EV concept unveiled at last month's Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany.Where the Urban EV had a boxy body reminiscent of an early Civic, the Sports EV has a lower, sleeker and more aggressive look.It's designed to be fun to drive even though it does have artificial intelligence technology, Honda (HMC) says.
GOP tax reveal to set off 'corporate hunger games':::::1.Tax bill revealed: President Trump's push to overhaul the U.S. tax system is about to face its biggest test yet.Up until this point, the GOP tax "plan" has been limited to a broad, mostly detail-free framework of ideas that many lawmakers and business groups could get behind.But come Wednesday, it will be all about the details when House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady promises to unveil his 1,000-page tax reform bill.And it's those critical details in the bill that could make or break the legislation.At issue: How will Brady propose to pay for the big business tax cuts Republicans have promised?Lawmakers, businesses and lobbyists will fight tooth and nail to preserve tax breaks they covet."Expect them to push back as if this was a life-or-death struggle because for many, it is," Chris Krueger, managing director of the Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in a recent report."Welcome to the corporate hunger game."The official path to modernize America's outdated tax system was created when the House narrowly (216-212) passed a budget this week that includes instructions to fast-track a tax reform bill that allows for $1.5 trillion worth of tax cuts over 10 years.But it won't be an easy path."The road ahead is bumpy and riddled with potholes," Isaac Boltansky, senior policy analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading, wrote in a recent report.Of course, Wall Street will be watching the tax battle very closely because hopes for massive tax cuts have helped send the stock market to new heights in recent months.Investors could get nervous if it looks like those tax cuts will be scuttled by GOP infighting.In any case, "expect some near-term volatility both in Washington and on Wall Street once the legislative text is released," Boltansky said.2.Jobs report: The Labor Department is scheduled to release October's job numbers on Friday.The U.S. lost 33,000 jobs in September -- the first monthly decline in employment in seven years -- thanks in large part to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.But overall, America's job market is in good shape.Unemployment is at a 16-year low, and weekly jobless claims are consistently down.The only problem is that wages aren't increasing by very much, making it difficult for consumers to keep pace with inflation.We'll see on Friday whether that continues to be the case.3.Fed meets as Trump mulls new chair: The Federal Reserve meets this week, with a decision on interest rates set to be announced on Wednesday.Don't expect too much: The Fed is not likely to raise rates this time.But Janet Yellen's term as Fed chair is coming to an end, and President Trump is expected to pick her successor -- or decide to stick with her -- next week.So even without a rate hike, there's a chance we could hear something interesting from Yellen.4.Apple's fourth quarter results: Apple (AAPL, Tech30) is set to announce its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.In August, Apple said it expects sales for the quarter to come in as high as $52 billion.Since then, the company has announced and launched three new phones.The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus have been on sale for weeks, and customers were able start ordering the iPhone X online this week.The X will hit stores on Friday.So far, sales of the 8 and 8 plus have reportedly been lackluster.According to the research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, the 8 and 8 plus accounted for just 16% of total U.S. iPhone sales in the quarter ending on October 1.The iPhone 7 and 7 plus, for comparison's sake, made up 43% of sales in the same time last year.5.Facebook earnings: Facebook (FB, Tech30) heads to the earnings stage on Wednesday.On Wall Street, at least, the social media giant has had a successful 2017.The company's stock has soared more than 50% this year.And though Facebook's growth has been slowing, the company is still expanding.But the company has also had some very public faux pas, from CEO Mark Zuckerberg's virtual visit to Puerto Rico to revelations that the social media platform hosted Russia-linked ads.Investors might ask Facebook to explain itself.6.Coming this week: Monday -- Mondelz (MDLZ) reports earnings Tuesday -- Aetna (AET), Kellogg (K), Pfizer (PFE), MasterCard (MA), Under Armour (UA) report earnings Wednesday -- Facebook, New York Times (NYT), Tesla (TSLA) report earnings; House releases tax reform bill Thursday -- Apple, Starbucks (SBUX), Yum!Brands (YUM), Ralph Lauren (RL), CBS (CBS) earnings Friday -- October jobs report; iPhone X hits stores
iPhone X screen repair: $275:::::Hot tip for anyone running out to buy Apple's new $1,000 smartphone: Don't drop it.The iPhone X, which hits store shelves November 3, is Apple's most expensive phone yet.But the higher price tag isn't reserved just for the phone.Repairs are more expensive, too.A broken screen will set you back $275, according to repair costs posted to the Apple web site.For comparison, a screen repair for Apple's new $799 iPhone 8 Plus, costs $169.The figures were reported earlier by MacRumors.Those repair prices come down if you splurge for AppleCare+ -- an extended warranty program that adds $199 onto the iPhone X's sticker price.Related: 10 things you need to know about iPhone X In return, AppleCare+ covers all but $29 of screen repairs and all but $99 worth of any other type of "accidental damage."There's a catch, however.AppleCare+ only covers two instances of accidental damage.If you accidentally damage your phone a third time, the cost of repairing hardware could run up to $549.AppleCare+ extends the basic warranty that covers non-accidental iPhone mishaps -- such as battery issues or a faulty headphone jack -- from one year to two.The iPhone X was unveiled to much fanfare last month.It boasts a radical update to the iPhone models of years past, with an all-glass display and an option to unlock with facial recognition.It also has an all-glass back, so owners run the risk of cracking either side of the phone.However, Apple has claimed the glass on the iPhone 8 and iPhone X is much stronger than earlier models, so it could be harder to break.Pre-orders for the phone began online Friday, and units were selling out quickly.The U.S. Apple Store site said it would take five to six weeks for new orders to ship.--CNNMoney's Heather Kelly contributed to this report.
Trump leaning toward banker Jerome Powell to run Fed:::::It appears President Trump is zeroing in on a choice for next Federal Reserve chair.Two sources told CNN on Saturday that Trump will likely name Jerome Powell to lead the central bank.Powell, a Republican, has been a governor on the Fed's board since 2012, and he was assigned to lead the bank's Wall Street oversight committee back in April.Trump has yet to make a formal decision, but the White House said he'd announce his choice next week.He could still change his mind, the sources said.His apparent lean toward Powell is a major development.For weeks there has been speculation about whether Trump would renominate current Fed chair Janet Yellen to another four-year term.Yellen was nominated by President Obama in 2013, and her current term expires in February 2018.During his campaign, Trump accused Yellen of making policy decisions aimed at earning political points for Obama.But since Trump was inaugurated, he softened his tone and has even praised Yellen's decision making.Yet, the pair stand at odds on several issues.Trump has promised to start peeling back the financial regulations put in place after the financial crisis of 2008.Yellen is generally not a fan of that idea.She argues they're key to the U.S.'s continued economic recovery, though she has suggested she'd be willing to take a second look at certain Dodd-Frank rules that apply to small banks.Yellen could not be immediately reached for comment on Saturday.Trump's pick for Fed chair is one of the most important decisions he'll make as president.The U.S. central bank leader is considered one of the most powerful posts in the world.On Friday, sources told CNN that the list of candidates Trump was considering was down to about three.The names included Yellen, Powell, and Stanford economist John Taylor Powell would be an unusual pick.Every Fed chair since 1979 has been an economist, but Powell's background is in investment banking.Powell is largely supportive of Yellen's approach to slowing raising interest rates as the economy improves.He's been backed by Mnuchin, who has spearheaded Trump's Fed chair search.
Four more women accuse Mark Halperin of harassment, bringing total to at least a dozen:::::Two days after CNN first reported that five women said "Game Change" co-author and journalist Mark Halperin sexually harassed or assaulted them during his time at ABC News, the number of accusers has grown to at least a dozen women, including four who are now sharing their accounts for the first time.Another woman, who shared her account in CNN's initial article on the condition her name not be published, is now speaking out on the record.The new accusations from the four women include that Halperin masturbated in front of an ABC News employee in his office and that he violently threw another woman against a restaurant window before attempting to kiss her, and that after she rebuffed him he called her and told her she would never work in politics or media.The alleged incidents occurred while Halperin was in a position of significant authority at ABC News, while the women were young and had little power.Halperin denies that he masturbated in front of anyone, that he physically assaulted anyone, or that he threatened anyone in the way described in this story.In a statement provided to CNN Friday evening, Halperin said, "I am profoundly sorry for the pain and anguish I have caused by my past actions.I apologize sincerely to the women I mistreated."Halperin said that in recent days, as he has read accounts of women he worked with at ABC News, he has felt "profound guilt."He said that for several years, around his departure from ABC News, he "had weekly counseling sessions to work on understanding the personal issues and attitudes that caused me to behave in such an inappropriate manner."He additionally said that his behavior had not continued after he left ABC News.(Halperin's full statement appears at the bottom of this article.)Related: Five women accuse journalist and 'Game Change' co-author Mark Halperin of sexual harassment The first of the four new accusers, who was at the time of the incident an ABC News desk assistant in her early 20s, told CNN she asked Halperin if she could meet with him for career advice in either 1997 or 1998.It was after 10 p.m. when she went into his office, she said.During their conversation, Halperin began to masturbate behind his desk while staring at her, the woman said."I sat in a chair across from him," she told CNN."He was behind a wooden desk so I couldn't see him from the waist down.As we had our conversation about my career he was masturbating.There was no question about it.""I pretended like I didn't know what was going on and we talked a bit more and then he abruptly wrapped up the conversation," she continued.The woman told CNN it was clear what Halperin was doing."There was an up and down motion," she said."I don't know if he made any sound at the end or how it was clear to me that he had climaxed," she said."But it was clear that he was satisfied -- like he stopped making that motion and stopped staring at me."A longtime friend of the woman's told CNN that the woman had told him her story years ago.The second woman told CNN she met Halperin in the late 1990s while she was interning at the White House."At the end of my internship, Mark said to me, 'When you graduate from college, if you're looking for a job, call me.'And I was super flattered and really excited.So when I graduated, I called Mark Halperin," she said.The woman told CNN that Halperin took her to lunch in Midtown Manhattan.They didn't talk about her career or jobs at all throughout the lunch, but she assumed that he knew it was why he called and that the topic would be addressed later.At the end of the lunch, after they walked out of the restaurant, she said, she extended her hand for him to shake it.Halperin, she said, had other ideas."He put both hands on my arms and threw me against the window of the restaurant hard.So my head banged against the window hard, in a way I thought people inside were going to think something terrible had happened to me," she said, adding, "This was rough, and hard, and violent.And not in a seductive way -- in a way that telegraphs some anger and meanness.""And he lunged at me," she continued, "with his body pressed against mine against the window and came at me with his open mouth."The woman said she was able to avoid his attempt to kiss her, get out from under him and walk away.About 10 minutes later, she said, he called her."I was really hoping he would be calling to apologize.And he said something to the effect of, 'You are never going to get a job.You're never going to be hired in politics or media.Why would anyone ever hire you?'And that's when I broke down and started crying," she told CNN.Two friends of the woman told CNN that the woman had told them about the incident more than a decade ago.A third woman, who worked as a desk assistant on "World News Tonight," told CNN that Halperin hit on her in the office during the Fall of 2006.The woman provided CNN excerpts from the journal she kept at the time that she told CNN referenced Halperin, although it only referred to the man as "an older man who is involved with someone else and has a powerful position at ABC.""He cornered me in the coffee closet, and introduced himself," the journal said."And knowing of course who he is, his national significance, and his importance in news, I squandered (sic) in nervousness.I noticed he had been eying me... he's in the newsroom a lot... but figured he was looking at the monitors behind me."Later, the woman wrote in her journal, the man pulled her aside when she was alone and "He whispered -- how old are you, do you have a boyfriend, and do you understand how important it is that we remain secretive?With that he told me he wanted to meet me in his office before I left for the night.Knowing perfectly well that his intentions were wrong, I went to him anyway -- if anything to save my dignity and stand up for myself for seeming more interested or suggestive than I was."At that time, the woman's account in her journal said, the man told her he was "extremely attracted" to her.The woman told Halperin it was best if they remained professional, but he didn't listen."As I gathered my things to leave, he leaned in to kiss me.I turned my head away, but he would not relent," she wrote in the journal."So in the awkwardness and pressure of the moment, I let him put his lips on mine.It was nothing -- not a kiss, just lips on lips.And he smelled like makeup.I went home, wanting to cry and vomit."The woman told CNN that what Halperin did was "part of the reason I didn't go for an off-air position," the term ABC News used to describe reporters who were embedded with presidential campaigns."I didn't want to work with him," she said, later adding the whole episode contributed to her decision to leave journalism all together.The woman, at the time, confided in a close friend.The friend told CNN she had told him the story years ago.A fourth woman, who was a 19-year-old ABC News intern in the summer of 1995, told CNN she was assigned to the political unit.She said she was working on a project when Halperin personally volunteered one night to assist her.He said he would go with her to a museum in New York City to review some archived CBS footage."I remember thinking to myself he's got a million associate producers, so why is he going with the intern to do research?"the woman recalled to CNN, but said at the same time she was "very impressed" by him and thrilled he'd want to help her with the assignment.The woman said the booths for reviewing footage at the museum were only meant for one person, but Halperin told her "he want[ed] to share" one.It was a tight fit, the woman said, so "our cheeks [were] touching.""And then I look over and he has a massive boner.And our legs are touching," she said."And at this point, I just flew up and got up.And he said, 'The night's not over!We need to end it with a margarita.'"The woman said she declined.The four new accounts bring the total number of women who have accused Halperin of sexual harassment to at least one dozen.Five women made accusations in CNN's original report Wednesday night, the Washington Post included an on-the-record account in an article it published Thursday night, journalist Emily Miller wrote on Twitter that she had been "attacked" by Halperin in the past, and on Thursday night a former CNN producer published an op-ed on CNN.com in which she accused him of sexually harassing her in his office at ABC News when she was just out of college, before she went to work at CNN.Related: Why I'm speaking up about Mark Halperin, and why I stayed silent so long In a Friday statement, an ABC News spokesperson told CNN that the company takes issues of harassment seriously and would like to encourage anyone who has been subjected to such treatment to "come forward so we can address them immediately.""While Mark left ABC News over a decade ago and no complaints were made during his tenure, we hold everyone at ABC News accountable for their behavior and how they conduct themselves," the spokesperson said."We know that our people do their best work in an environment where they feel respected, safe and supported.Harassment or retaliation of any kind is never acceptable."In addition to the new accounts, Lara Setrakian, who was one of the five women whose stories were included in CNN's Wednesday night report without her name attached, is now going on the record, both with CNN and in an op-ed for the Washington Post published Friday afternoon.In CNN's original article, she said Halperin had grabbed her breasts during an encounter in his office; he had denied doing so.She told CNN on Friday that Halperin's denial is false."I understand why he feels the need to deny it," Setrakian said."But it's not true.What he said is not true....There's absolutely no question of what happened in terms of unwanted physical contact."Setrakian said it "hurt to see [Halperin] rise and rise without any accountability.""It felt like the world was so stacked," she told CNN."It felt profoundly unfair to have feelings of anxiety as a woman in media while watching someone who was clearly misbehaving rise and rise in our industry with no apology, no thought as to how we felt before, no effort to apologize.No effort to reach out to us."Setrakian said now she is happy Halperin issued a form of an apology, but she wants to know what Halperin will do "to make it right."She told CNN the incident changed her."It made me hyper-conscious.First, it made me much more skeptical of people's intentions," she said."I think it made me hyper-sensitive to the idea that my career will depend on who finds me sexually attractive.And if the time comes when they don't I will be at a massive disadvantage.That upset me tremendously.And it made me move away from television.It made me feel like I had an expiration date."Mark Halperin's full Friday evening statement: I am profoundly sorry for the pain and anguish I have caused by my past actions.I apologize sincerely to the women I mistreated.The world is now publicly acknowledging what so many women have long known: Men harm women in the workplace.That new awareness is, of course, a positive development.For a long time at ABC News, I was part of the problem.I acknowledge that, and I deeply regret it.As I said earlier in the week, my behavior was wrong.It caused fear and anxiety for women who were only seeking to do their jobs.In recent days I have closely read the accounts of women with whom I worked at ABC News.I have not read these accounts looking for discrepancies or inconsistencies.Instead, in almost every case, I have recognized conduct for which I feel profound guilt and responsibility, some involving junior ABC News personnel and women just starting out in the news business.Many of the accounts conveyed by journalists working on stories about me or that I have read after publication have not been particularly detailed (and many were anonymous) making it difficult for me to address certain specifics.But make no mistake: I fully acknowledge and apologize for conduct that was often aggressive and crude.Towards the end of my time at ABC News, I recognized I had a problem.No one had sued me, no one had filed a human resources complaint against me, no colleague had confronted me.But I didn't need a call from HR to know that I was a selfish, immature person, who was behaving in a manner that had to stop.For several years around my departure from ABC News, I had weekly counseling sessions to work on understanding the personal issues and attitudes that caused me to behave in such an inappropriate manner.Those who have worked with me in the past decade know that my conduct in subsequent jobs at TIME, Bloomberg, NBC News, and Showtime has not been what it was at ABC.I did not engage in improper behavior with colleagues or subordinates.If you spoke to my co-workers in those four places (men and women alike), I am confident you would find that I had a very different reputation than I had at ABC News because I conducted myself in a very different manner.Some of the allegations that have been made against me are not true.But I realize that is a small point in the scheme of things.Again, I bear responsibility for my outrageous conduct at ABC News.I hope that not only will women going forward be more confident in speaking up, but also that we as an industry and society can create an atmosphere that no longer tolerates this kind of behavior.I know I can never do enough to make up for the harm I caused.I will be spending time with my family and friends, as I work to make amends and contributions both large and small.
Facebook announces new ad transparency efforts:::::Facebook has announced new plans to increase ad transparency and authentication requirements for advertisers, a move that comes amid ongoing scrutiny over Russia's use of social media to meddle in American politics.The social media giant will soon allow its users to see all active ads being run by any account, as well as an archive of ads related to U.S. federal elections.Facebook will also require political advertisers to verify their identities and will require them to include a disclosure in election-related ads that reads: "Paid for by."Users will also be able to click on the disclosure and see more information about the advertisers.The new efforts, which Facebook announced Friday, will be tested in Canada in November and go into effect in the United States next summer ahead of the 2018 midterms.The announcement comes just days before Facebook, Twitter and Google are set to appear before the Senate and House Intelligence Committees in a public hearing about their role in Russia's political meddling.All three companies have acknowledged that they sold ads to Russian agents who sought to sow discord in American politics.Earlier this week, Twitter similarly announced that it would label all political advertising on its platform and provide information about who bought the ads and what they spent.It is not clear that the new guidelines at Facebook and Twitter would have applied to the ads those companies have identified as having been purchased by the Russian trolls, due to the strict definitions of political advertising.Political ads are defined as those that mention a specific candidate, but the majority of Russian-bought ads were issue ads, focusing on divisive topics like race, refugees, immigration and gun control, and did not necessarily mention candidates.While Facebook's new transparency requirements will apply to all advertisers, it will only require verification for political advertisers.That effort will start with federal elections in the United States and then expand to elections in other countries and jurisdictions.Rob Goldman, Facebook's Vice President of Ads, said the company is "deeply committed to helping protect the integrity of the electoral process on Facebook.And we will continue to work with our industry partners, lawmakers and our entire community to better ensure transparency and accountability in our advertising products."Sen. Mark Warner, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and a co-sponsor of a new "Honest Ads Act" that would require greater transparency for online political advertising, commended Facebook for its efforts."Glad to see companies taking these issues seriously," he wrote on Twitter."We need to work together to improve ad transparency.We need the #HonestAds Act."
How Whitefish landed Puerto Rico's $300 million power contract:::::Whitefish Energy, a little-known energy firm based in Montana, has been stirring up controversy ever since it announced last week that it landed a $300 million contract to help restore Puerto Rico's electrical power.The contract is the largest to be awarded since recovery efforts began over a month ago.And several lawmakers on Capitol Hill are calling for government reviews of how this small firm with only two employees at the time Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico was chosen over bigger, more established utilities.The seeds of the deal were first sown after Hurricane Irma, which tore through the Caribbean and Florida in early September.Ricardo Ramos, the CEO of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, recounted to CNN that he was actively looking for contractors for the repair effort.Whitefish was one of seven companies that was competing for the work.Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski reached out to Ramos to tell him about his small firm's "special skills": repairing infrastructure in rural, rugged regions, according to Whitefish spokesman Ken Luce.But Irma ended up skirting by Puerto Rico, inflicting minimal damage.There was no need to immediately strike a deal.'We took the call and we're here' Less than two weeks later, it was a different story.Hurricane Maria was a devastating Category 5 storm, leaving millions on the U.S. island without power or communications.Techmanski reached out to Ramos again, offering to help -- this time, hoping to secure a contract, Whitefish spokesman Ken Luce told CNN.Techmanski ended up having a conversation with Ramos."All I can say is, we took the call and we're here," Techmanski told CNN last week."We called each other."In an interview with HLN on Friday, Luce described Techmanski as an entrepreneur who jumped on a plane when no one else was "interested in doing business with the utility company because they were in bankruptcy."Techmanski flew to Puerto Rico on Sept. 26 to meet with PREPA officials and to discuss how they could restore electricity to the crippled island.Sitting in a dimly lit conference room, Techmanski and the PREPA team used light from their cell phones to begin drawing up plans for rebuilding Puerto Rico's destroyed electrical grids, according to Luce."They met at a conference table with no lights to go through the map and determine the best way to work in the mountains," he said.Related: $300 million Puerto Rico power deal now under government review The other contender: Power Secure wanted $25 million upfront to do the job.But Techmanski wasn't asking PREPA for a down payment.Plus, the Whitefish CEO was agreeing to take care of the logistics -- lodging and food for the hundreds of journey linemen needed to restore power, according to Ramos.After the hurricane hit, the state-owned utility could have requested aid through the American Public Power Association, a network that provides help to other utilities during widespread power outages.But the closest states to Puerto Rico were already dealing with their own rebuilding efforts after hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Ramos told HLN on Thursday.And he believed they would not be able to respond quickly to the island's needs.The bankrupt utility, which was wrestling with $9 billion in debt, also couldn't afford to cover the costs of utilizing the network either, he said.Instead, Ramos chose Whitefish, inking the deal the same day Techmanski flew into Puerto Rico.Whitefish began working on the island less than a week later on Oct. 2.With the contract signed, Techmanski realized he was going to need help getting resources and equipment to the island quickly.So he reached out to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who also called Whitefish, Montana his hometown.Zinke's office acknowledged they received an email from Techmanski, but said no one at the agency took any further action.On Friday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters that ZInke was asked directly by President Trump if he had any involvement in the deal -- and Zinke said he didn't."This is a contract that was determined by the local authorities in Puerto Rico, not something the federal government played a role in," Sanders said at the briefing.A few hours later Zinke tweeted his own statement denouncing any ties to Whitefish winning the contract.Adding, all records "will prove no involvement.""Only in elitist Washington, D.C., would being from a small town be considered a crime," Zinke said.I had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish Energy receiving a contract in Puerto Rico.I welcome all investigations into the allegations pic.twitter.com/JQgVFR7Fp6 Secretary Ryan Zinke (@SecretaryZinke) October 27, 2017 Concerns are raised Government agencies usually will make a public request for help on a particular job.Often they will receive multiple offers and the agency reviews and accepts the best, lowest cost bid.Whitefish spokesman Chris Chiames told CNN: "In emergency kinds of situations, this isn't a typical [request for proposal] process."Both the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have made clear they did not sign off on the Whitefish contract and referred questions to PREPA, according to spokespersons for both agencies.FEMA oversees billions of dollars in disaster relief work and multiple audits by the inspector general have shown a pattern of problems in how these funds have been used.Ramos told CNN that FEMA didn't require prior approval of PREPA's contracts.But it does require a detailed audit of Puerto Rico's emergency spending.A FEMA spokesperson told CNN Thursday that based on its initial review, the agency has "significant concerns" with how PREPA awarded the contract, including whether the contract prices are "reasonable."Related: Questions swirl after small Montana firm lands Puerto Rico power contract The hourly rate for a site supervisor is set at $332 per hour and $227.88 per hour for a "journey lineman" in the contract, according to a contract seen by CNN.The deal also specifies the estimated cost of nightly accommodation would be $332 per worker and nearly $80 per day for food.On Friday, Whitefish's Luce told HLN that prices included in the contract were all negotiated with PREPA ahead of time.He explained that pricing included transportation for labor, the equipment and cost of paying for workers performing "very high risk jobs" that required "technical experienced" journey linemen."They are working off helicopters -- 50-, 60-foot ladders, dangling from wires," said Luce."These are very dangerous high-risk jobs that these men and women are undertaking to restore power in Puerto Rico."There's also a clause in the deal that bars PREPA, the FEMA administrator, the government of Puerto Rico and the Comptroller General of the U.S. from auditing the cost and profit elements of its labor rates.Luce also told CNN on Friday that the clause is "standard contract language," but promised to work with lawmakers in answering questions."We've been transparent on everything we're doing on the island and we understand those questions," said Luce.Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello told CNN that PREPA triggered an "emergency protocol" to start rebuilding the grid in Puerto Rico immediately after the hurricane hit."It was discussed with FEMA to make sure that it met with the standards and then of course that process went through," said Rossello.'We have to move fast' Already, Whitefish has scaled to just over 300 employees in Puerto Rico -- and it says 700 more are on the way.Such quick growth is typical among utility firms when they are awarded large contracts, the company said.PREPA's Ramos says he has no regrets over the Whitefish contract, despite all the controversy over the deal."If we went back in time, I would do it all over again," Ramos told CNN.Choosing Whitefish was cost effective, he said.The company had agreed to be paid in installments after the work was completed, inspected and approved by PREPA."We have a humanitarian crisis here and we have to move fast," said Ramos, adding Whitefish is "doing a great job."Since the deal was announced, several government reviews have been called for to determine whether the appropriate process was followed by PREPA.Related: San Juan's mayor takes on small Montana firm that won power contract Both the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general and a separate House committee are reviewing the agreement.Another Senate committee has also asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate.That decision is pending.On Friday, two top Democrats also asked the inspector general to examine FEMA and other agencies' role in awarding the contract and to look into whether it was an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars.Even Rossello has asked Puerto Rico's Office of Management and Budget to audit the Whitefish contract to ensure it's in compliance with the appropriate laws.Those results were expected to be released on Friday."If there is no wrongdoing, if it has been done correctly then we will push forward," Rossello told CNN."If there is wrongdoing in this process or any process there will be hell to pay."--HLN's Carol Costello and CNN's Julia Jones, Rene Marsh, Tristan Smith, Bill Weir,

Bill O'Reilly threatens to sue for $5 million over 'defamatory' Facebook post:::::Bill O'Reilly is threatening legal action against a former New Jersey lawmaker who penned a candid account of his ex-girlfriend's alleged encounters with the former Fox News host.In a summons filed Friday in a New York state court, O'Reilly's attorneys accuse Michael Panter of "making defamatory and false statements in a publicly-available social media post."They said the former Fox News host is seeking no less than $5 million for "the public hatred, ridicule, disgrace, and permanent harm to his professional and personal reputations as a result" of a post that Panter published on Facebook earlier this week.In the post, Panter recalled dating a woman who settled a lawsuit with O"Reilly."I read a blurb today that referenced her being bound by a non-disclosure agreement," wrote Panter."However, I hear O'Reilly spinning his falsehoods almost daily.This week he again said he did nothing wrong, while suggesting he's been persecuted and had very few complaints "to Human Resources" during his decades at Fox.Bill should be aware that not everyone is bound by a non-disclosure ...I am not."Panter went on the recount late night phone calls his ex-girlfriend received from O'Reilly, and said that O'Reilly frequently asked her out on dates."My ex's career was largely dependent on staying in O'Reilly's good graces," Panter wrote."For that reason, she was always hesitant to tell me some details -- likely out of fear than I could jeopardize her career by becoming involved.Sometimes information would slip out."Panter also claimed that O'Reilly worked with other Fox News executives, including former co-president Bill Shine, to pressure his ex-girlfriend into providing incriminating information on a woman who accused him of sexual harassment.Panter did not name either woman in the post.A lawyer for Shine did not respond to a request for comment.O'Reilly has emphatically denied the myriad sexual harassment allegations levied against him.After the New York Times revealed last weekend that he agreed to a $32 million settlement earlier this year with a woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, O'Reilly decried the report as a partisan hit job.Panter told CNNMoney on Thursday that he was prompted to write it after seeing O'Reilly repeatedly tout his clean record in Fox News' human resources department."When I read that, I picture Vladimir Putin defending his presidency by saying there have been no complaints to the KGB about him," Panter said.The post drew media attention on Thursday morning, prompting O'Reilly's camp to respond forcefully.Mark Fabiani, who is serving as O'Reilly's spokesperson, issued a statement that said, "Mr. O'Reilly will be commencing legal action against Mr. Panter, and the ex-partner he quotes, for all damages he and his family have suffered from this improper conduct."Fabiani called the post "completely contrived, false and defamatory, aimed at hurting Bill O'Reilly and his family."O'Reilly said Thursday on Twitter that he had commenced "legal action today against a man lying about me.""From now on, all defamation will be challenged in court," O'Reilly said."Enough."Later in the day, on his web show, O'Reilly told viewers that he "had to file a lawsuit against one of the smear merchants who are lying about me.""I didn't really want to do that.But at this point I have to stop the madness and I'm not going to bore you with it," he said."It's the same old stuff.There is obviously a witch hunt going on now and a lot of people are getting hurt in the harassment situation."O'Reilly didn't mentioned Panter by name in his tweet or on his show.Panter's Facebook post remains up.In a statement to CNNMoney on Friday, he said he may have his own case against O'Reilly."I am speaking the truth, and expect my account to be fully corroborated," Panter said."His actions give me a small sense of what victims must feel when speaking up against powerful men, and why more men hesitate to do so.After discussing this matter with a leading firm, I believe there is a strong basis to bring defamation claims against Mr.O'Reilly."Panter added that he hopes to not take such action, saying he'd prefer the matter to be "amicably resolved."
Reliable Sources podcast: What keeps '60 Minutes' ticking for five decades?:::::How does a TV program stay relevant for 50 years and counting?Jeff Fager, the executive producer of "60 Minutes," says it's all about creating a broadcast that "feels like it belongs in today's world."The key is to "anticipate what the big stories are, so that we can spend months reporting them.It's not about this week's events, but digging down deep about something that is in the news," Fager told Brian Stelter in this week's edition of the Reliable Sources podcast.The prestigious CBS News magazine show launched in 1968 and has since amassed 138 Emmy Awards starting in 1971 with Morley Safer's investigation on the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and continues to deliver impactful stories with each episode.Most recently, a collaboration between The Washington Post and "60 Minutes" that aired on October 15 led the Trump administration's pick for "drug czar" Tom Marino to withdraw from consideration.Marino, a Republican Congressman from Pennsylvania, had a primary role in promoting a bill that weakened the Drug Enforcement Administration's control over opioid drug distributors."This was, I think, a stunning story for a lot of people," Fager told Stelter.That included President Trump, who said in a press conference the day after the story aired: "I did see the report.We're going to look into the report.We're going to take it very seriously."A day after Trump's comment, Marino withdrew his name from consideration.That kind of impact is "a journalism dream," Fager told Stelter.Listen to the whole podcast here: While President Trump has yet to agree to an interview with "60 Minutes," Fager is optimistic it will eventually take place."I think the '60 Minutes' interview is an important interview to do," Fager told Stelter."The White House knows what we offer.And they know that we are going to ask very direct questions.I think they also know that we're going to be fair," he added.Fager talked with Stelter about "60 Minutes'" storied past, the subject of his new book "Fifty Years of 60 Minutes: The Inside Story of Television's Most Influential News Broadcast," published by Simon & Schuster.When he was approached by the publisher with the idea of writing a history of the show, Fager said he "felt the responsibility" to oblige."I'm not sure who else could tell the story," he told Stelter.Fager is surely qualified.He has been in the role of executive producer at "60 Minutes" for the past 14 years, taking over after the show's creator Don Hewitt stepped down in 2004.Hewitt "had an incredible energy about him," Fager said.He also had "an attention span of about 14 minutes," which gave him the idea for a news magazine where stories wouldn't have to be "long snoozers," but snappier and more engaging."He just thought television doesn't need to be boring, television should be exciting, too," Fager explained.That's why "60 Minutes" reports are usually about 12 and 14 minutes long, he said.That format gives "60 Minutes" a leg up in the current media landscape."I am actually confident about our digital future because our stories play so well on your mobile device," Fager told Stelter.
The Amazon effect: Whole Foods to hire 6,000 workers:::::Whole Foods is hiring: Amazon style.Taking a page from the online retailer's playbook, Whole Foods said Friday that it plans to add 6,000 workers via a nationwide "hiring day" next Thursday.All U.S. stores will participate, the company said.Full-time, part-time and seasonal jobs will be available.Those interested can either apply ahead of time or fill out an application at the store.Whole Foods said that it will make some job offers on the spot, after interviews.Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has used massive job fairs before -- it held them at 10 of its fulfillment centers over the summer to fill 50,000 open positions.But this recruitment push will be run entirely by Whole Foods, said a spokesman.Related: Amazon may be a factor behind the rumored merger between CVS and Aetna Amazon didn't hesitate to make its mark after it scooped up the grocery chain in August.On the same day that the $13.7 billion deal closed, Whole Foods lowered the prices on a number of items, from avocados to salmon.In January, Amazon said it would create 100,000 U.S. jobs this year.The 6,000 Whole Foods jobs don't count toward that goal, according to a Whole Foods spokesperson.
iPhone X pre-orders up to a six week wait:::::If you want an iPhone X when it's released on November 3, you'll have to wake up early, leave your house, and line up IRL at a store.Or you can spend around $3,000 on eBay to buy a phone off of someone lucky enough have secured an early pre-order before they sold out.Apple (AAPL, Tech30) opened up pre-sales for the $999 smartphone at 12 a.m. Pacific Time on Friday.There were a few complaints of technical issues on Twitter, like a screen saying Apple could not reach the "carrier systems" but that a phone was reserved.Apparently it was nothing serious enough to stop people from snatching up all the phones available on November 3 in a matter of minutes.That first round of smartphones appeared to sell out in 15 minutes in our tests.On the U.S. Apple Store site, wait times for the phone were already at two to three weeks by 12:15 a.m.Phones that work on Sprint were the last to go.As of Friday afternoon, the wait time was up to five to six weeks.Related: 10 things you need to know about iPhone X It's unclear if the longer wait times are due to unusually high demand for the new phone or a supply shortage.KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously estimated that Apple is only making 2 to 3 million phones available for launch day.He cites supply chain issues with the phone, including the camera's infrared dot projector, part of its new face-detecting feature."We can see from the initial response, customer demand is off the charts.We're working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible," said an Apple spokesman in a statement.The company said it will continue to take orders online.In store orders will start at 8 a.m. local time around the world on November 3.You can get an iPhone X at an Apple Store, but lines are often shorter at carriers and third-party retailers like Best Buy.
Months after sexual harassment allegations rock tech world, not much has changed:::::Silicon Valley had a sexual harassment crisis long before Hollywood did.Four months ago, a flood of women in tech shared their stories, from an investor exposing himself during a meeting to another kissing an entrepreneur without her consent.Companies promised investigations.Some investors resigned.People suggested ways to crack down, like more specifics on what qualifies as inappropriate behavior.But months later, there have been few tangible changes made by those in power, women say.The issue is far from resolved.For example, just this week, VC firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson confirmed to CNN Tech it is conducting an ongoing independent investigation into "allegations" around a founding partner which surfaced last summer.Despite the outrage, entrepreneur Denise Brosseau said the tech industry hasn't done much to make changes that would systemically support women in an industry dominated by men.There's "too much power, too much money, and too few reasons to change," said Brosseau, co-founder of women's network Springboard and CEO of consulting firm Thought Leadership Lab.Similar to the dynamic between Weinstein and the Hollywood actresses who have accused him of harassment, there's often no formal employer-to-employee relationship in tech.But there's a huge power imbalance.What does it take?According to a study conducted by Baloonr, an app for gathering anonymous feedback, about 35% of respondents said the best way to addressing tech's issue is to put more women in leadership roles.The study was conducted among 90 female venture capitalists and founders who've raised funding for their startups.The study found only 17% of participants believe a "code of conduct" could facilitate necessary change.Related: Ellen Pao: 'I turned down millions to tell my story' Baloonr is typically used by companies to poll their workers.But founder Amanda Greenberg launched a broader survey following the sexual harrassment allegations.More female venture capitalists Some women who've shared their harassment experiences said they aren't convinced that those in power -- investing partners and limited partners who control the funds -- are ready to make any real changes."Everyone is super supportive until they have to put their money where their mouth is," said Lisa Wang, cofounder of SheWorx, who spoke as part of CNNTech's Money, Power, Sexual Harassment special.Susan Ho, cofounder of Journy and one of the six women who spoke out against Caldbeck in June, said investors have since asked how they can help.Adding more female investing partners or investing in more female founders are efforts that could help but that many firms are shy about making formal commitments to do so, she said."I don't think we're going to see meaningful change unless people really realize they are leaving money on the table," Ho added.Policies The venture capital industry has long policed itself, but some hope that will change.The National Venture Capital Association, a tech trade organization, has committed to working on policy templates and trainings.In September, the association announced an initiative called Venture Forward that's devoted to addressing tech's sexual harassment and diversity and inclusion problem.NVCA president Bobby Franklin emphasized that the venture capital industry doesn't have highly regulated rules, unlike lawyers who can be disbarred for misconduct."Can you keep someone from being a VC?No," Franklin said."That's why we're trying to be deliberate.""What we'd like to do is help facilitate programs around sexual harassment training that we hope our members take advantage of and use these tools to educate their own firms about sexual harassment on a regular basis," said Maha Ibrahim, a general partner at venture capital firm Canaan Partners, who is on NVCA's board and is actively involved with Venture Forward.In August, NVCA held a three-hour sexual harassment workshop in San Francisco with roughly 60 attendees, including Brosseau and entrepreneur Cheryl Yeoh, who helped put the Malaysian startup ecosystem on the map.Yeoh spoke out against investor Dave McClure, who resigned from the firm he cofounded, 500 Startups, in the wake of harassment reports.McClure issued a broad apology for his behavior.Soon after, NVCA published its framework for moving forward.It included developing industry standard HR policies and best practices for startups.Related: Readers react to 'Money, Power and Sexual Harassment' Other ideas that surfaced during the workshop included an industry-wide third-party reporting tool, like Callisto, that could be a resource for reporting harassment.Callisto is already used on some college campuses to track harassment complaints and flag assailants who are repeat offenders.Another suggestion was to create a fund to help women in tech who are victims of harassment and want to pursue legal cases.(Ellen Pao, who sued Kleiner Perkins for sex discrimination, racked up $2.7 million in legal fees -- not something the average woman in tech can afford.)"While NVCA deserves praise for catalyzing a healthy discussion ... it maintains they're not in a position to spearhead [a] reporting tool or play an industry ombudsman role," said Yeoh, adding that some attendees formed a subcommittee after attending the workshop.But those who control the money are the ones who have the power to hold venture firms' feet to the fire, the women said.And most haven't yet, at least not publicly."Every firm should publicly commit to publishing their own internal policies and reporting mechanism," said Yeoh."Most firms still don't have it and have not taken any steps towards it yet.There's no good reason why that should be the case."Brosseau agrees: "Until this is an economic imperative, nothing will change."
Amazon second headquarters bid spans U.S., Mexico border:::::Amazon's proposal deadline for cities to host its second headquarters has passed, but a newly announced pitch has surfaced an innovative concept: a campus that spans three cities and two countries.In fact, a proposal out of New Mexico offers a bi-national campus that would include El Paso, Texas; Juarez, Mexico; and Las Cruces, New Mexico.The joint proposal comes from two New Mexico-based nonprofits: the Mesilla Valley Economic Development Alliance (MVEDA) and the Border Industrial Association."A bi-national campus that sits on the border [allows] Amazon the benefit of recruiting from two separate countries without barriers," said a spokesperson for MVEDA."We think this approach pushes the boundaries of how business has operated at a time when there is so much discussion about our border with Mexico."Related: Gambling site has Atlanta as the favorite in the Amazon sweepstakes The campus would be divided into seven hexagons and the U.S.-Mexico border would run through the middle.The groups envision a 70,000-acre campus with office buildings, parks, bike access and retail stores.The proposal also includes a solar and wind farm that could potentially provide for the energy needs of the majority of the campus.U.S. Border Patrol agents would be stationed on the campus, according to Davin Lopez, president and CEO of MVEDA.However, other details about how to keep the campus secure on the border will have to be discussed, he said."It's not unprecedented to have a private sector border crossing," Lopez told CNN Tech."With all the different discussions that are taking place in D.C. regarding amnesty and immigration ...This is a different solution.It's an opportunity for the private sector such as Amazon to be part of that answer.""Instead of building bridges or walls, we're building a border economy here," he added.If chosen, Lopez expects the new facility would boost the economies of both the U.S. and Mexico.Related: The city Amazon picks for its second headquarters will change forever But some experts aren't convinced that such a proposal would be enough to woo Amazon."This is a very novel bi-national approach, but I don't think the region has enough of an advantage over other applying cities in core areas [such as] workforce scale, education levels, aviation connectivity or public transit investment," said Joseph Parilla, a fellow at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program.MVEDA argues that its joint bid checks all the boxes Amazon wants, such as a metro area with a population of over 1 million, the ability to attract technical talent and proximity to major highways and international airports.Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has received 238 proposals across 54 states, provinces, districts and territories across North America.Bids have come from big metropolitan areas like New York and Los Angeles and smaller cities like Danbury, Connecticut.Atlanta is the favorite to win the new facility, according to Irish gambling site Paddy Power.The company announced plans for a second headquarters in September.It will cost at least $5 billion to construct and operate and will create as many as 50,000 jobs.Amazon plans to make a decision in 2018.CNNMoney's Julia Horowitz contributed to this report.
Aston Martin unveils Tom Brady edition:::::New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has five Super Bowl rings.He will not, however, have a Tom Brady special edition Aston Martin sports car that he helped design.Those cars will go to 12 other people who will pay about $360,000 each for the dark blue convertibles.The (take a deep breath) Aston Martin Vanquish S Volante Tom Brady Signature Edition costs roughly $50,000 more than your run-of-the-mill Aston Martin Vanquish S Volante.The Vanquish S Volante is an open-topped version of Aston Martin's Vanquish S sports car.It's powered by a 6.0-liter 580-horsepower V12.For the extra money, buyers will get a number of special features.Besides Tom Brady's signature on the metal door sill plates, the car will get "Ultramarine Black" exterior paint, a very dark blue, and "Dark Knight" interior leather, which is, basically, black.There are also exposed carbon fiber aerodynamic features on the exterior and gold Aston Martin badges along with Tom Brady's TB12 logo just behind the front wheels.The number 12 is significant here.Besides being the number of cars being offered, it's Brady's jersey number.All 12 cars are expected to be quickly spoken for, according to an Aston Martin spokesperson.Brady himself helped to choose the color combination, according to an announcement by Aston Martin.Aston Martin draws record $22.6 million "Going through the process of curating a unique Aston Martin has been fascinating," Brady said in the announcement."We started with a blank canvas and finished with this beautiful car."Brady is a long-time Aston Martin customer who already owns an Aston Martin DB11.He signed on as the company's official endorser earlier this year.The Tom Brady version was created by Aston Martin's new "Q by Aston Martin" customization division, a department that works with customers to create individualized color and trim packages for their cars.The department's name is a reference to the James Bond character Q who created special gadgets and cars -- sometimes Aston Martins - for the fictional British super-spy.Athletes usually make such deals with more mainstream car brands like Ford (F) or Toyota (TM), but there are exceptions.Basketball player Stephen Curry, for instance, recently became a "brand ambassador" for Infiniti, Nissan's (NSANF) luxury division.
Is now really the time for massive tax cuts?:::::America's economy and jobs market look quite healthy right now.But President Trump is demanding very expensive surgery anyway.New numbers released Friday show that the U.S. has grown at 3% for back-to-back quarters for the first time in three years.Unemployment is sitting at just 4.2%, the lowest in 16 years.And consumer sentiment rose in October to levels unseen since early 2004.Despite the obvious strength in the economy, Trump recently promised on Twitter the "biggest TAX CUT" ever, adding "we need it!"Trump says he wants to push through both tax reform, which would modernize the outdated tax code, and to provide tax cuts to individuals and businesses.Given how healthy the economy is, some economists are mystified over Trump's urgent push for tax cuts that are likely to be paid for by adding to America's mountain of debt.Related: Economy posts impressive growth despite hurricanes "No other president in modern economic history has tried to do this," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank."It just seems completely unnecessary.With unemployment at 4.2%, why on earth would we try to stimulate the economy?"Normally, presidents ask Congress for deficit-financed tax cuts when the economy is weak.That's what President Obama did in 2009 during the Great Recession, and President George W. Bush did the same after the 2001 downturn."This is kind of an odd time to get fiscal stimulus.It's not like we're in a recession, or coming out of one," said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC.Here's the problem: There will be another recession, eventually.And spending heavily to slash the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% today could leave Congress with fewer options to tackle the next downturn.The current economic expansion is already the second-longest ever.Related: Will Trump's tax plan really give you a $4,000 pay raise?The Tax Policy Center estimates that Trump's tax overhaul would slash federal revenue by $2.4 trillion over 10 years, and by $3.2 trillion over the second decade.And the national debt is already 77% of GDP, and slated to keep growing."The risk is we don't have the money for a rainy day.It's borderline irresponsible," said Rupkey.It's true that the U.S. economy is not perfect.Businesses remain reluctant to spend, and Americans aren't getting the raises they deserve.Wage growth has been sluggish, although that improved in September.It's also true that tax reform is an admirable goal, no matter how fast the economy is growing.Tax reform, which is aimed at making the sprawling and outdated system more efficient, is different and much less costly than tax cuts."Tax reform that is paid for is much better for the economy than a plan that adds to the debt," Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, wrote recently.Some experts believe that efforts to reform the tax code will fail once details of the bill are finally unveiled on November 1, leaving the GOP to push simple tax cuts instead."We continue to expect deficit-increasing tax cuts, not...deficit-neutral tax reform," Barclays economist Michael Gapen wrote in a recent report.Given that the U.S. economy is "at full employment," Gapen believes that tax cuts will provide a "temporary boost" to GDP of just 0.5 percentage points.That would leave 2018 growth near 2.8%.The White House was asked on Friday by reporters about the need for tax cuts given solid GDP growth.Related: How Trump's tax plan could backfire on Wall Street Kevin Hassett, chair of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, argued that the U.S. economy has accelerated because businesses are excited about tax and regulatory reform.Hassett also predicted that lowering the corporate tax rate and allowing businesses to immediately write off investments could increase GDP by 3% to 5%, as well as boost wages.Without tax cuts and tax relief, the U.S. will be stuck with "depressed wage growth," the White House said in a statement on Friday.Rupkey concedes that tax reform could boost wages, but he's skeptical that wage growth will accelerate by a meaningful amount.Some economists fear that stimulus at this point in the economic cycle could be too much of a good thing."The worry is that by adding fuel to what's already, believe it or not, a pretty fiery economy in the U.S., you risk driving inflation and overheating growth," said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Capital.Such an outcome could spur the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates so rapidly that it derails the stock market and burdens businesses and consumers with higher borrowing costs."Deficit-financed tax cuts are the wrong way to go at this point," said Faucher.--CNNMoney's Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report
Barbie's world shaken by Toys R Us bankruptcy:::::There's trouble in toyland, and companies are blaming Toys R Us.Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars, reported disappointing third-quarter results late Thursday and said it was hurt by Toys R Us' Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing last month.Earlier this week, Hasbro, the maker of My Little Pony and Monopoly, also blamed weak results on the Toys R Us bankruptcy filing.Both companies said they temporarily slowed shipments to Toys R Us ahead of its bankruptcy, and both said they are working with the retailer to get their toys on its shelves during the holiday season.Toys R Us had said when it filed for bankruptcy protection that it planned to work with suppliers and would keep its 1,600 Toys R Us and Babies R Us stores open.It did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.Even before the Toys R Us bankruptcy, toy makers have had trouble selling their goods to kids today, many of whom would rather play with an iPad.Lego said last month that sales of its colorful bricks fell for the first time in 13 years, and announced plans to cut 1,400 jobs.Mattel, whose revenue in North America fell 22 percent in the three months ending Sept. 30, said that about half of that decline was due to the Toys R Us bankruptcy.Globally, most of its brands saw sales declines.Barbie sales fell 7 percent and Hot Wheels fell 6 percent.Sales of its American Girl brand, whose 18-inch dolls typically cost more than $100, fell 30 percent."We suspected a rough quarter ... but that was really tough," said analysts at Jefferies.To try and turn the company around, Mattel said it plans to cut $650 million in costs over the next two years.It will also suspend the quarterly dividend it pays shareholders beginning in the fourth quarter.Shares of Mattel Inc. fell $1.37, or 9 percent, to $14.00 on Friday.Its stock has lost about half of its value since the beginning of the year.Hasbro shares dropped about 2 percent on Friday.But it's not all tough news in the toy world: FAO Schwarz, whose famous New York toy store was shut down two years ago, said Friday it opened 190 FAO Schwarz sections inside Bon-Ton, Carson's and other department stores that sell piano mats, stuffed animals and other toys.
US economy shows resilience with 2nd straight solid quarter:::::Powered by businesses and consumers, the U.S. economy grew at a solid 3 annual pace last quarter despite two devastating hurricanes evidence of economic durability and all but assuring that the Federal Reserve will resume raising interest rates late this year.Friday's figures from the government marked the first time in three years that the economy has expanded at a 3 percent or more annual rate historically, a normal pace for a healthy economy for two straight quarters.More than eight years since the Great Recession officially ended, the economy is still posting consistent gains in the job market, in business investment, in consumer spending and corporate earnings.Unemployment is at a 16-year low.Companies are restocking.An improving global economy is boosting U.S. exports.Stock prices are rising in tandem with company profits.The 3 percent annual growth for the July-September quarter in gross domestic product the total output of goods and services produced in the United States followed a 3.1 percent annual pace in the previous quarter.It was the strongest two-quarter showing since 2014.The economy managed to expand at a healthy rate last quarter despite the damage inflicted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which many economists think shaved at least one-half of 1 percentage point off annual growth in the July-September period.President Donald Trump has pledged to accelerate growth from the tepid 2.2 percent annual averages that prevailed since the recession ended in 2009.The administration was quick to hail the GDP report as evidence that Trump's economic program was already helping to lift the economy.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross asserted that Friday's GDP report "proves that President Trump's bold agenda is steadily overcoming the dismal economy inherited from the previous administration.... And as the president's tax cut plan is implemented our entire economy will continue to come roaring back."The administration contends that Trump's proposals for tax cuts, deregulation and tougher enforcement of trade laws will achieve annual growth exceeding 3 percent in the coming years.Most economists, though, have said they think that even 3 percent annual gains will be hard to achieve for an economy that, for all its strength, is enduring a slowdown in work productivity as well as an aging workforce.Many analysts believe annual growth in the current October-December quarter will amount to a rate of around 2.7 percent.Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said he envisions just 2.1 percent growth for all of 2017.He suggest that if the Trump administration manages to shepherd at least a modest tax cut measure through Congress, growth in 2018 could accelerate to 2.5 percent.But he said he expects further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve to slow the economy's growth to just 1.5 percent in 2019.Harvey made initial landfall in Texas on Aug. 25, and Irma blitzed Florida on Sept. 10.The government said that while economic activity ranging from energy refineries in Texas to citrus farming in Florida were hurt by the storms, it could not estimate how much the hurricanes had weakened overall U.S. growth last quarter.Private economists have estimated that the storms sapped between one-half and 1 percentage point from annual growth in the July-September period.But analysts say they think much of that lost output will be recovered as the affected areas are rebuilt.The 3 percent annual growth rate for third quarter GDP and the 3.1 percent pace in the second quarter followed a much weaker 1.2 percent annual increase in the January-March quarter.In the third quarter, consumer spending remained solid, though it slowed slightly to a 2.4 percent annual pace from a sizzling 3.3 percent rate in the April-June period.Part of the gain in consumer spending was due to auto sales, which accelerated from August to September the strongest month this year so far.The biggest drivers in last quarter's growth were a robust increase in business investment in equipment and an acceleration in companies' rebuilding of inventories.Other areas of the report showed weakness.Government spending fell for a third straight quarter.Residential construction declined.But trade added 0.4 percentage point to growth, with exports growing briskly while imports fell.On Thursday, the House gave approval to a Republican-proposed budget that would provide for $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next decade.Administration officials have said the tax cuts will spur faster growth and that the faster growth will erase much of the cost of the tax cuts.Democrats and many economists have challenged that forecast as unrealistic.
Probe of Ford Fusion steering wheels that may loosen, detach:::::U.S. regulators are investigating complaints that steering wheels can come loose or fall off in the Ford Fusion, a midsize sedan.A person in Georgia told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that a steering wheel fell into their lap in a 2015 Fusion when turning into a gas station on Sept. 23.People who file complaints are not identified in the NHTSA public database.The agency opened the probe after receiving three complaints about loose steering wheels.The probe revealed in documents posted Friday covers about 841,000 midsize sedans from the 2014 through 2016 model years.Two other people reported that the bolt attaching the wheel to the steering column came loose while driving and had to be retightened at a repair shop.The agency doesn't have any reports of crashes or injuries.Ford says it's cooperating with the investigation and that owners who have concerns should contact their local dealer.Investigators will determine how often the problem happens, how many vehicles are affected and will assess safety consequences of the problem.No recall has been issued.

guy.He was generous.He was on time.He knew his lines when he had them memorized but he was a different color.He was white.He was actually -- he made me look like I was a dark skinned person.He was so white so it was a different guy.But he -- whatever you want to say about trump, he has changed the game.So after the election I did -- I do this concert every year for the cancer foundation at T.D.Garden.This year it's November 18th.Yeah.So four days after the election, I did a concert and what I basically did was go up and stage and vent against Hillary and against trump and the audience was explosive so people -- I could tell they had -- half voted for Hillary and half voted for trump so to me I thought I got to write ray book about it because it got more and more divisive and nothing is getting done.So in trump's world which he's changed the game, celebrities can now become president so I think we have to look at it that's why I said George 2020.Weed to to stop -- yeah, let's change the process.I want to have -- talk about so you think you can dance or "Dancing with the stars" we should have a reality show to elect the next president.Someone said we already did that.Right.I mean, because the debates suck.We don't learn anything at the debates so I say you have a 13-week reality show called "President idol" as Howard Stern was calling it or I call it "America's got leaders."Four celebrity judge answer have all these people that want to run for 1 week, give them tanks, make them dance, sing, whatever you want to do and on November 2nd or 7th we vote by phone.That's it.No electric tort college.That's it.The winner is the winner.I mean I think that's the future, you know.Something to think about.It's so scary.Nick lachey would be a great presidential candidate on that show.I'm telling you.Justin Timberlake could be president.I think we need a woman.I want Oprah.Yay.There we go.I want Oprah.There you go.Because --S if.Oprah would be so great because you know every three weeks she'd give us free stuff.You know what I mean.That wouldn't suck.That would be great.That would be awesome.So anyway the book is about -- it starts with the election and just want to remind I'm out to make people laugh their asses off but I want to talk about racism.All the stuff that was so divisive that's still happening, racism and sexism and all that stuff and make people laugh about how twisted we have been in the last couple of years.And that we don't suck.And we don't suck?That is nice and remind ourselves how great of a country we are and like my democratic friends have lost their sense of humor.My Republican friends have lost their sense of humor and nothing is getting done.Look at the carvilles.No, no, no.You don't want me to be president.I'd be impeached within four months.All I would do can just a free beer for everybody.No fruitcake.No fruitcake.No fruitcake.But you can doesn't "Why we don't suck," it's out today.Out today.Are we done?This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

'Real Biz With Rebecca Jarvis': Hyperloop One co-founder Video:::::Transcript for 'Real Biz With Rebecca Jarvis': Hyperloop One co-founder Hey everybody I'm Rebecca Jarvis happy Friday welcome to reeled is here coming to you live from ABC news.We have a great guests today with us Schuermann commissioned art he is co-founder.She'll avengers and co-founder of virgin hyper loop one looking out my paper because.Your company hyper loop want you just got to name change because of the big investment from none other than Richard Branson this week hyper loop one knows sell this big investment.From a Richard Branson you also are now changing the name to virgin hyper loop one true.Tell people out there who haven't heard about hyper loop one until now what idiots like an all about.Well I believe one is revolutionary new transportation.Company and that is pursuing the idea that you on Moscow originally proposed.During transportation that airline speeds and into.And the way you accomplished.You basically in venture on sky in side of the steel tube.You create a vacuum in your vacuum you basically suck out here of that vacuum.For the same time you have levitation on the parallel tracks city of the pot actually levitating about it and should above two of a Christian and there are.Then you have a propulsion system the U we've invented over the last three years since just got enormous the company.The propulsion system.We've invented from Scruggs and we manufacture in Vegas.That is probably the biggest breakthrough that we've done he engineers.Virgin have removed one now.Are are really some of the very the most brilliant minds in the world.And just struggle is one of those I say.He's got one of those Manhattan Project type of brains.He can actually.You know invent these things created and build it was time incredible people around the world that he's been able to recruit.So now or it's last summer we reached a major milestones and actually.Launch the first pod.We didn't launch in North Las Vegas and in the deserts of Vegas.We bought the land.And thanks to the leadership of the governor and manner of governor of Nevada and the mayor of North Las Vegas we are able to accelerate the regulatory process.So we didn't have the usual obstacles that should build the structure and the structure is pretty epic it's.About two million pounds and we Bolton eleven months.Which will get to in a second is a signal.There were living in a pretty historical time we're actually able to build these tapes and shod.Challenges and faster periods of time than any other time in human history.That should get a lot of hope to people who are watching if they have dreams of building.You know incredible things that might seem impossible and and you know there are.We're here to tell you that this is actually in our over if you are you know.Have the tenacity and the commitment you can ban together with a bunch of people who also are believers.They make ideas that seem like Tennessee is actually real.We're living in a time where private companies are doing what nations used to do.You on this shooting rockets into the sky right.He's trying to colonize Mars.You sound like you know science fiction books I think that we grew up.Something like Asimov would have dream 4050 years ago.Except now it's not just streams in science fiction.This session the reality of our lives.Her physical laws so there's George Jess and dreams and cartoons that we June grew up was.And tables.Welcome to the future.I want to let people out there who are listening to you sure tonight top now.That we're taking your questions you can post your questions below I also have questions here from many of you who have already written to me on Twitter.I'm sure there will be a lot of that because.This whole thing everything that you described it is sort of like at page street Adams five but it isn't coming to life gives you had your test mission in that would could you call it a test mission load Goldberg hitting a moment your yacht it is losing your first flight how the first flight go how far.Did you did it actually helped.And two great questions so we Dylan.Pond and may and June unmanned July.We actually tested the entire system full skilled so this is a says two million pounds.The to really build on pile ons in the desert.With a fully integrated system.It's about almost twelve feet wide so it seems pretty much.It's above ground above ground an.I wanna just clarify for people because Ilan mosque between mention was one of the first people to start talking about this he has his boring company and their underground frighten him so can you let her above ground they're under I don't know we know it's not.So the on the choice point yes as you can you can do above ground now for version of who won you can also do.Underground for the tunneling they need and also do on the ground so many of you base of the use right of way is exempt existing right of ways.To build this.And you can also basically tunnel on borer your way and so.Now art it be going back to the original enough art at Al so me this structure.It's 500 meters long.What we do with the pod and and in the actual full full house.We we when 290 miles per hour in 500 feet and stop safely.So bit of mistrust us of seeing you know in that kind of environment could be make this happen we see if we break the answer was yes.The key thing that's important for you in the audience to understand.Is that all of the system and everything that we've built in the tests that we showed actually proves that we will get to settlement miles per hour.The only limitation was the distance of the tube itself.Still the tube went from 500 meters to three kilometers.OK and it would hit 700 miles per hour with the existing.System in design that we did that's why we're we say is worried there.OK if you can hit a 192 miles per hour in 500 feet the means are gonna hit southerner miles per hour in three kilometers the reason as.There's no friction it's a near vacuum.The propulsion is gonna continue into two speeded up.And in about thirty seconds forty seconds later it's gonna hit 700 miles per hour in that distance.Now when you commercialize a woman gets in his next phase which were and now we're in commercialization.Is.With.Visionary like Richard Branson.And investment by by virgin group.And how they were to join the board.That's gonna help us in the commercialization process we've graduated now from the R&D process solution on all the works so now we go to phase of signing contracts with governments and actually building.And breaking ground high food systems around the world five version if we bought.How far away are we from that actuality of governments signing up for this and saying.We're cool with S we're gonna regulated in some capacity and we're gonna allow you to take up the space to make this happen.It's a great question we're right there I think.You know and I was finished within.The and the next year.We should deal to make announcements of our first contracts with governments around the world not and the U.So most likely we're going to be building the first article loops and and places like.The middle East Asia and potentially your of my dream of course would be the bring it to America would love to build you a New York to DC.And do you know 35 minutes travel.Basically turning the citizens of metro stops.Bends the idea of Kano where you live and where you work.To zipping ghost city Center City center.And that's reality is we don't need a lot of realistic to build I believe stations they can be in the middle of the city.And then you're gonna build it you know transfer people on things done for us.So some of the questions 11 question we got from bong bong.Well I think it I don't know what your name is on bond but that's your Twitter handle Obama bonds BO and GE O Yong -- so bond bond asked.Will brands and hold a controlling interest what's his role in all of.It's.Richard Branson and the virgin group Vuitton made a minority investment and and and having of one.Richard is join the board of directors.We better than to a strategic partnership.For the same time we've merged goodies to global brands I've who have won and version.Together and we'll be rolling out of ground is version has bloop on.In the name in the company were illegally also changed to reflect that.So that's that's.He seems like up the kind of partner that would be very useful in this and that he in figuring out virgin airlines worked with government is accustomed to you.Dealing with some of the bureaucracy.And that weighed it definitely be in the path of any kind of moon shot venture likeness.Yes of soil amid.I've looked up to Richard for very long time he's on the great.Hunters in the world is built Brandon done is known worldwide.He inspires a lot of people's well and has a good human being.How many conversations dictate to sell him on the idea.Well we've known each other for some time so he's a for and became a virgin galactic astronauts some years ago early on.And so I wanted to go to space for the childhood you know my name is.Hide myself under coffee table I was growing up and Legos and spaceship.For hours and hours traveling on space so.That's why I signed up for virgin galactic and I look forward to making that trip in the future.What comes first your trip to Mars or someone taking a higher early.One the virgin higher early line from New York to Washington DC it.Over neglecting his has been around for along time that coin of you know goal takes time.You know long term vision.I think there are there they're nearer.You know getting there.So.I don't know what the exact dates are but.I would I would think that it's it's eminent.In terms of in order through so I guess you only announced it.Then.The in terms of Turkoglu.You know working around the world virgin have who have won tends to kind of break ground and build these things and you should be seeing them operational in the next 24 years.Two to four years and all right we have a question from Kalla who wants to know the estimated price for one way travel do you even have a sense for what pricing could be like.Sure.Well the key way to understand.The answer that question.As we don't intend to really try to you know profit from passenger travel or business model from the beginning when it started the company.One of two.Basically focus on cargo.And logistics because in the movement of goods is actually a much more.Interest and business model in the world if you can kind of shrink.Commerce.You can accelerate the economic growth of the world and create economic opportunity for many many more people are on the world.So this is very much on a mission driven from now perspective it is also was.The ideas the business phone I think is a beautiful business model and what I mean by the if you can move you know people on things as fast if he can move things in cargo this house.And by the way green.Queen lane.Then you can actually take the ports around the world and most salute the in the major ports in the world.Our.Because of their function.And the existing technologies are on the water fronts of all the major cities of the world.Now there's something about waterfront property.Real estate.It's actually quite valuable.Waterfront properties of these cities around the world are extremely valuable but they have they're forced to use it.To be able to bring goods and guess what happens in LA port.The value of the real estate deal and poors were worth about 200 billion dollars just by itself.It also brings in about 8000 trucks and these aren't small trucks is are 8018.Wheelers they go on the highway systems of LA every single day.That's a waste.Causes pollution causes congestion and it causes a lot of pain and loss of productivity.So you can actually move the port and make it in the desert.The trucks move out of the way have a cleaner city of less congestion.Also on law 200 billion dollars of those states to develop.And guess what that subsidizes the other business model which actually should make it very cheap for people travel back and forth.And the reason is if you're gonna unlock all of those goods.In that way and you gonna move those goods and real time.You actually want people moving around you wanna make the very cheap because that's gonna make the economic flows mover on the city's.And those reasons regions much not faster than ever before.I can hear the argument but with the way that you would lay this out to any and regulatory authority and government in terms of making the case for a why you should be on site be.Should there be subsidies for example for what your trying to build out I do think we have some questions coming in is that right Taylor human.Okay.Furnish Thomas that this isn't capable of withstanding a joke and he is.Good question some parishes are people out there in case they can hear it garish asked how much can the system withstand natural calamities if there's an earthquake or hurricane what happens.Sure thanks Dershowitz a great question I'm safety.Is extremely important for version has moved on.And it's actually quite term months to how we think about things.If you look at can a safety.Airlines.From the airline perspective.You're in a tin can up in the air 30000 feet if anything goes wrong.You know what's gonna happen for an it's not a very safe.Environment at that point so.In on the trains side.If you have the real man's.Due to any other cause.Because it's in open error.When a train or high speed rail.The rails.What happens is that.It moves all over the place it did it crashes.And that's also not very safe.If you have an environment where you're controlling the whole environment here and steal to.And you.The system we've designed.We've been very mindful of it reduces the possibilities of any kind of derailment.We've also designed the pods.Who also designed the pylons.So that they actually shift.We did that in terms of actually shifting towards temperatures and so it expands and contracts to the tube itself can slide around.Because of what we've actually invented so I can show that you if you ever come to Vegas.How big is is one pot how many people could be it seated in one hot and and do you believe that.The people would also be traveling with the cargo.Considered your very question you wanted to be bi directional C to use ago both ways it.You could and turned mixed pods.Where we are one part house cargo in the other part 'cause people.And so you will be able to makes those around.Because of the speeds that it goes you want and also have enough buffer in between the pods.And all of its automated so that it's extremely safe if you need one part of the stop.It creates a there's a sixty.And of logic to you actually regulate.Through the automation system all of those rules.Then on the cargo side and the people's side you want ability to different kinds a cargo and he also won a house.Plaza might fit more people and less people depending on you just let your location that's right.So the size of the plot does not need to be uniform.But you know if we need a pod for 35 people are putt for 65 people we can make that work.Because this is all inside of a steel container and the steel container this does the sides of it won't change all of that much.Does the technology to propel different shapes and sizes of pods for example or different sizes rather of pods.Did that technology have to change and adjust and given that and what happens if you know there are multiple different size pods all traveling within this this.That that the steel container.Sure.We'll some some to you and me wider than others depending on you know function.So so the idea wouldn't be an necessarily have different size pot in one Q that would just be different routes are going to be different sized chips right.And so it kind of you gotta think about it and kind of morphology -- ensued.If the functions and to determine what the actual design vision of the year of the size of the actual tube.The pods.You're not gonna have different widths of positive of this you know if I would.I have longer publish order prods.The other hospital this is you know creating a people talk about self driving automation etc.but the pause themselves should be able ago until April.And if you design different kinds of pods you can actually.Have the pods continue to do the last miles well so once you get in between mostly in Europe DC.The paused and then leave and take you home or to due to the office.You can kind of could you know create.Pooled situations where you know people commuting together.But all of these are electric bill that screen.I'm reminded of there's a boat in Chicago then starts out as a bus and then turns into a boat that takes people around the Chicago river anyway it'll exam the article yet that it's not.A we when my another ten million of them don't pogs.By luck.Of the teamwork.Meeker.And me.No Manila.Do you have any schedule through market rollout.Schedule for market roll out Malden.I am 08.Day.Her thoughts on.But the thanks to your questions in terms a commercialization.Version have to move on.The role it is you know once we sign the first contraris.We'd like to be able to break ground.Somewhere in the world in 2019.And then be operational by two points when he won 21 to.And those who believe.Either cargo or passenger.Just depends on what you know it the government there were talking to.What they need.For the nation.Here.Killing my math.It really be powered by.Funny adversity and we will really be powered by humans humans what a picture on its parent had great close.You know my daughter's favorite movie news monsters things and is remembered.They went from.Screams to laughter and joy actually high approval be powered by human joy people are going to be extremely

AP-NORC poll: Most have little fear of robots taking jobs:::::Most Americans believe their jobs, and the jobs of those they live with, are safe from automation at least for the next decade, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.And more than half think automation could make their work easier or more efficient in the future.The findings suggest that while Americans express concern about how automation technology might cause some other people to lose jobs, they are less worried about its effect on themselves.Fifty-seven percent of respondents said they thought it unlikely that they or someone in their household will be replaced at work by automation within the next 10 years, the survey found.A nearly identical proportion 56 percent said they consider it at least somewhat likely that their job will be improved by automation.Many think, for example, that such technology has made jobs safer.The poll's key findings echo those of other recent surveys.The Pew Research Center found in a survey released earlier this month that 70 percent of Americans believe it unlikely that they will lose their jobs to automation.Those assessments may well prove accurate, according to recent analyses that foresee far fewer job losses resulting from automation compared with studies several years ago that had suggested that up to half of U.S. jobs could be replaced over the next two decades.A report released this month by the education company Pearson, Oxford University and the Nesta Foundation found that just one in five workers are in occupations that will likely shrink by 2030.Still, the AP-NORC survey found that many Americans worry about the effects of new technologies on their daily lives and the job market.Three-quarters of respondents said they think it at least somewhat likely that "people will be more isolated from one another."And most say robots have cost jobs in factories a view supported by academic research and data showing that factories are now producing more with fewer employees.Three-quarters foresee at least some likelihood that many retail workers will be replaced by automation.A wide gap also exists in how people with different levels of education respond to such questions.Americans without college degrees are twice as likely as those with degrees to say it's very likely automation will cost them or someone in their household a job.That is in line with studies that have found that lower-skilled work is more likely to be automated.Among the poll's other findings: Americans vastly prefer dealing with people, rather than machines, when they order food at a restaurant.But in most other settings, many don't particularly care.Seventy percent of respondents said they preferred ordering food from a person.Nineteen percent said it made no difference.Just 10 percent said they preferred self-service.But at a supermarket checkout line, roughly half preferred the self-service option or had no preference.That may partly explain why the small automated restaurant chain Eatsa, which sold food without cashiers or waiters, had to close five of its seven restaurants last week.Most Americans still aren't using the latest technologies, some of which could introduce ground-breaking automation in the future.Uber, for example, is testing self-driving cars, which could over time eliminate work for its drivers as well as taxi drivers.Yet just a quarter of Americans use Uber or Lyft, the survey found.And barely 30 percent use a voice-activated personal assistant such as Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa.Just 29 percent at least occasionally pay for goods or services with their phones, rather than with cash or credit cards.The likelihood of whether someone has used online services and other technology tends to breaks down along educational lines.For example, 63 percent of Americans with at least a college degree have purchased goods or services online, while just 34 percent without a degree have.The AP-NORC poll of 1,038 adults was conducted Aug. 17-21 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.Respondents were first selected randomly using address-based sampling methods and were later interviewed online, by phone or in person.Online: AP-NORC Center: http://www.apnorc.org

True Religion Brand Jeans emerges from bankruptcy protection:::::True Religion Brand Jeans has exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a move that reduces how much the retailer owes while giving it more time to pay it off.The Los Angeles-based company said Friday that its debt reorganization plan was approved by a bankruptcy court on Oct. 5.The plan reduces True Religion's term loans from $471 million to $113.5 million and extends the time when the loans come due to 2022.CEO John Ermatinger says the plan clears the way for the company to improve its retail operations, grow the brand's digital presence and tackle other strategic goals.True Religion filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July.It's one of several retailers this year to seek bankruptcy protection, close stores or go out of business entirely.
US Treasury's inspector general clears plane trip:::::The Treasury Department's office of the inspector general says a trip that a top Treasury official took on a plane owned by a wealthy hedge fund operator did not violate applicable ethics laws.Ed Miller, chief of staff for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, flew with Nelson Peltz, a founding partner in Trian Fund Management, on a trip in March from Washington to Palm Beach, Fla., after Miller got clearance from the department's ethics lawyer that the offer was coming from a friend and not someone with business before the department.Rich Delmar, counsel to the inspector general at Treasury, said Friday that while accepting the flight was not a violation of law, it might have been more prudent to turn the offer down to avoid the appearance of conflict.
White House: Trump plans to make choice for Fed next week:::::President Donald Trump's press secretary said Friday that Trump plans to announce his choice for the next chairman of the Federal Reserve next week.But his press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, wouldn't discuss reports that the leading candidate is Jerome Powell, a member of the Fed's board.Asked about reports that Janet Yellen won't likely be offered a second term as Fed chair and that Trump is instead leaning toward Powell, Sanders said, "I can confirm that the president plans to make an announcement on that next week, but beyond that I don't have any other details to add."Yellen's term ends in February.Trump this week said his choice was down to "two and maybe three people," who are thought to be Yellen, Powell and John Taylor, a Stanford University economist.Trump, appearing not to want to miss a chance to build suspense, tweeted later Friday, "People are anxiously awaiting my decision as to who the next head of the Fed will be..."
Barbie's world shaken by Toys R Us bankruptcy:::::There's trouble in toyland, and companies are blaming Toys R Us.Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars, reported disappointing third-quarter results late Thursday and said it was hurt by Toys R Us' Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing last month.Earlier this week, Hasbro, the maker of My Little Pony and Monopoly, also blamed weak results on the Toys R Us bankruptcy filing.Both companies said they temporarily slowed shipments to Toys R Us ahead of its bankruptcy, and both said they are working with the retailer to get their toys on its shelves during the holiday season.Toys R Us had said when it filed for bankruptcy protection that it planned to work with suppliers and would keep its 1,600 Toys R Us and Babies R Us stores open.It did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.Even before the Toys R Us bankruptcy, toy makers have had trouble selling their goods to kids today, many of whom would rather play with an iPad.Lego said last month that sales of its colorful bricks fell for the first time in 13 years, and announced plans to cut 1,400 jobs.Mattel, whose revenue in North America fell 22 percent in the three months ending Sept. 30, said that about half of that decline was due to the Toys R Us bankruptcy.Globally, most of its brands saw sales declines.Barbie sales fell 7 percent and Hot Wheels fell 6 percent.Sales of its American Girl brand, whose 18-inch dolls typically cost more than $100, fell 30 percent."We suspected a rough quarter ... but that was really tough," said analysts at Jefferies.To try and turn the company around, Mattel said it plans to cut $650 million in costs over the next two years.It will also suspend the quarterly dividend it pays shareholders beginning in the fourth quarter.Shares of Mattel Inc. fell $1.37, or 9 percent, to $14.00 on Friday.Its stock has lost about half of its value since the beginning of the year.Hasbro shares dropped about 2 percent on Friday.But it's not all tough news in the toy world: FAO Schwarz, whose famous New York toy store was shut down two years ago, said Friday it opened 190 FAO Schwarz sections inside Bon-Ton, Carson's and other department stores that sell piano mats, stuffed animals and other toys.

Budget: Hammond faces spending dilemma, says IFS:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Philip Hammond says driving down the deficit remains 'the right way to go' The Chancellor is facing the conflicting pressures of a push to spend more while also trying to cut the deficit, a leading think tank has said.The Institute for Fiscal Studies said Philip Hammond was under pressure to fund public sector pay rises and spend more on the NHS, schools and benefits.Yet spending more in November's Budget would make it harder for him to cut the deficit, said the IFS's Carl Emmerson.Mr Hammond was in a "very difficult position", the deputy director said."Does he allow higher borrowing to persist, does he add to that with more spending, or does he try to offset that with higher taxes?"Even if the Budget, on 22 November, includes some "giveaways", it would not mean an end to austerity, he added."That's likely to continue, whatever he announces."The IFS said Mr Hammond may have to abandon the government's aim of balancing the public finances by 2025."Given all the current pressures and uncertainties, and the policy action that these might require, it is perhaps time to admit that a firm commitment to running a budget surplus from the mid-2020s onwards is no longer sensible," Mr Emmerson said.However, that could be politically unpalatable for the Conservatives.Mr Hammond told the BBC last week: "We've already moved the target for balancing the books out from 2020 to 2025, but continuing to drive down the deficit in a measured and sensible way over a period of years ... has to be the right way to go."The forecast for the deficit - the difference between the government's everyday spending and its revenues - is likely to increase significantly if the Office for Budget Responsibility cuts its prediction for productivity growth of 1.6% a year given the sluggish performance of the UK economy.If the OBR reduces its forecast to 1%, the IFS said, the deficit would more than double to almost 36bn by 2021-22.The projected deficit could be as much as 70bn if the Budget watchdog decides that productivity growth is closer to the 0.4% recorded over the past seven years.Image caption Carl Emmerson of the IFS says the Chancellor is in a 'very difficult position' Mr Emmerson said another complicating factor was Brexit, given the uncertainty around its impact on economic growth, tax revenues and the public finances.He and IFS research economist Thomas Pope wrote the report, Autumn 2017 Budget: options for easing the squeeze, which was funded by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the Economic and Social Research Council.The IFS is an independent research institute founded in 1969 that aims to better inform public debate on economics.It releases a closely watched analysis of each Budget the following day.
UK must prepare for fourth industrial revolution, says report:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The UK must do more to take advantage of technology such as robotics, a report says Advanced digital technology could give UK manufacturing a huge boost and create hundreds of thousands of jobs, a new report claims.The independent review, chaired by the head of Siemens UK, highlights the benefits of robotics, 3D printing and artificial intelligence.But Juergen Maier said the UK needed "greater ambition" to take advantage of such technology.His report calls for a commission to help business adopt the advances.The report, Made Smarter, brought together executives from companies such as Rolls Royce, GKN and IBM, with representatives from small firms as well as academics from the universities of Newcastle and Cambridge.Its recommendations will help inform the government's industrial strategy plans.Mr Maier said: "The business and academic community has set out a vision for much greater ambition needed for Britain to be a world leader in the fourth industrial revolution."Our proposals will help business understand, deploy and create the latest digital technologies, helping to secure more homegrown research and development and the creation of new industries and highly skilled, well-paid jobs."The report proposes: More targeted support for companies, re-skilling workers, and a National Adoption Programme piloted in the north west Five digital research centres to improve innovation and capability A national commission in charge of turning Britain into a global leader in industrial digital technologies The proposals were backed by CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn, who warned about the UK's international competition."The UK must compete with China, the USA and much of Europe where there are already advanced plans to embrace the fourth industrial revolution," she said.Sean Redmond, chief executive of software firm Vertizan and a contributor to the report, said the UK needed to "catch up with international competitors"."Smaller businesses that are growing at scale, especially industrial companies, need support learning about how digitalisation can help their business grow," he said.
Monarch investor Greybull would repay repatriation cost:::::Image copyright Getty Images The former owner of the collapsed airline Monarch says it has a "moral obligation" to help repay the taxpayer if it profits from the sale of assets.The government spent 60m getting passengers home after the UK's fifth biggest airline went bust.Now, Greybull Capital has pledged in a letter to the Transport Committee that it would help "defray the costs".But it is unclear if any profit will be made, as much depends on the future of Monarch's lucrative airport slots.Monarch's administrators, KPMG, are seeking clarification in court about whether or not they have the right to sell the take-off and landing rights.As Monarch's main secured creditor, Greybull - run by brothers Marc and Nathaniel Meyohas and Richard Perlhagen - has first call on any cash realised from asset sales.In a statement on Sunday, Greybull said: "We concur wholeheartedly with the secretary of state's recent statement that any stakeholder who finds themselves in-pocket at the end of the administration process would be under a moral obligation to contribute to other stakeholders."This would include helping to defray the costs incurred by the Department for Transport in repatriating Monarch customers."This was first discussed in principle with the secretary of state and his department several weeks ago.We also agree with the secretary of state that it is premature to prejudge the outcome of the administration."Greybull's letter to the committee, sent on 24 October and signed by Mr Meyohas, underlined the private equity firm's commitment to "profit sharing with stakeholders".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Final Monarch planes leave their base at London Luton Airport This is why the firm felt a moral obligation to help foot the bill for the repatriation from any profits, Greybull said.About 110,000 passengers were on holiday and booked to fly home when Monarch ceased trading at the start of October.The Civil Aviation Authority described efforts to return passengers to the UK as "the biggest peacetime repatriation effort".In addition, more than 2,000 people lost their jobs, with many still struggling to find work.The job of selling Monarch's assets and returning any money to creditors and investors is in the hands of KPMG.The administrators maintain they have the right to sell the airport slots, reportedly worth about 60m, and have gone to court to establish this right."Given the complexity of the slot exchange process, we are seeking a judicial review on this particular matter," Blair Nimmo, partner at KPMG, said in a statement on Friday.Airport slots are assigned to airlines twice each year by Airport Coordination Limited.Slots can also be taken on by an airline in the event of a takeover.In its letter to MPs, Greybull repeated its regret over the airline's collapse."We have acted responsibly and been a highly supportive shareholder of Monarch since 2014."We remain deeply sorry and saddened that circumstances beyond its control led to the failure of Monarch despite the best efforts of so many to turn around the company and the significant capital provided by Greybull to rescue Monarch from bankruptcy since 2014."
What's gone wrong in the UK car market?:::::Image copyright PA Until recently, new car sales in Britain were booming.In 2016, a record 2.7 million were registered.It was the fifth year in succession that the market had grown.Now, things look very different.In September, new registrations fell by 9% compared with the same period the year before, according to the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).It continued a downward trend that has been visible for the past six months.And this week, Pendragon, one of the country's biggest car dealers, issued a surprise profits warning.It said waning demand for new cars and a consequent fall in the price of older vehicles would take a heavy toll on its earnings.So what's gone wrong?The first thing to say is that car sales are still pretty strong, by historical standards at least.You can see that from the graph below.In fact, most analysts had expected sales to tail off this year, if not by the levels we've actually seen.That's partly because the market is very cyclical.Once people have a car, they tend to keep it for a number of years, and rapid growth is difficult to sustain.But changes in the market have also had an impact.One of the main factors driving the market has been the growth of so-called Personal Contract Purchase plans, or PCPs, for private buyers.These are essentially leasing agreements, with an option to buy at the end of the contract, typically after three years.PCPs have proved very popular, in part because they allow buyers to obtain new cars while making lower monthly payments than would normally be required under traditional forms of financing, such as hire purchase.They also encourage people to get new cars more often - because at the end of one contract, many people simply take out another.But now that growth is tailing off."It's running out of steam now," says David Leggett of industry analysts Just-auto."The industry has been very adept in getting people on to these schemes, driving them on to three-year replacement cycles.But now, most people who wanted to take out PCPs have done so."At the same time, interest rates are going to go up, inflation is rising and household budgets are being squeezed.So a drop-off is to be expected."Used car sales, meanwhile, have been more resilient.After hitting record levels in the first three months of the year, they fell 0.7% in the second quarter, the most recent period for which figures are available.Anecdotal evidence suggests the brakes may be coming on in this market too.But according to the SMMT, even though new car sales had been expected to fall this year, the decline has been far higher than expected.Tamzen Isacsson, the industry group's director of communications, says there have been two main factors at play.Over the first part of the year, she says, the government put out "very unclear signals about its air quality plans", which hampered demand for diesel cars in particular.Diesels have been a key target for air quality campaigners, particularly since the Volkswagen emissions scandal erupted in late 2015.In July, after weeks of speculation, the Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra) announced that sales of all new diesel and petrol cars would be banned by 2040.Although the proposed ban doesn't include hybrids and won't come into effect for more than two decades, it does appear to have had an impact on sales.In September, for example, registrations of diesels were down more than 20% compared with last year - continuing a trend seen over several months.Sales of electric cars and hybrids have risen sharply, but not enough to make up for the decline elsewhere.The other major factor, according to the SMMT, is Brexit.Tamzen Isacsson insists it is "the greatest challenge the industry is facing at the moment".Consumer confidence, she says, is key to the health of the new car market."If consumer confidence is low, people delay purchases of big-ticket items like cars."With so much confusion about the impact of Brexit and where the economy is heading, it's not surprising they're holding back."It is imperative for the future health of the new car market that we get some clarity on this."
Facebook denies 'listening' to conversations:::::Image copyright Getty Images A Facebook executive has denied the social network uses a device's microphone to listen to what users are saying and then send them relevant ads.Rob Goldman, the tech giant's vice-president of ads, was responding to a tweet by PJ Vogt, the presenter of a tech podcast called Reply All.Anecdotally, many people report seeing adverts which appear to be related to recent, real-life conversations.Mr Vogt had asked for details of these specific occasions."I run ads product at Facebook.We don't - and have never - used your microphone for ads.Just not true," Mr Goldman wrote.When another Twitter user asked him if that included Instagram, which is also owned by Facebook, he replied, "Yes."PJ Vogt got hundreds of replies to his original tweet."A co-worker got an ad saying, "So you popped the question!"minutes after he proposed, before he told anyone it had happened," wrote Tori Hoover."At work, happened to me though earlier this year.Working as a barista, got a burn, talked to my partner in person about it, went to Target, bought the burn cream, and saw an ad on FB for the exact product I purchased.Never searched for product either," wrote Brigitte Bonasoro.In a statement on its website from 2016, Facebook denied the practice."We show ads based on people's interests and other profile information - not what you're talking out loud about," it said.One theory is that the ads and their connection to an individual are purely coincidental - that the ad may have appeared before but had not been noticed because it had no prior relevance."If you take something that has a tiny chance of occurring and give it enough opportunities to occur, it inevitably will happen," said mathematics professor David Hand from Imperial College London when the BBC investigated whether smartphones were "listening in" to conversations last year."We are evolutionarily trained to seek explanations."Do you have concerns about privacy and advertising on social media?Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk You can also contact us in the following ways:
Theresa May in renewed effort to close gender pay gap:::::Image copyright Getty Images More companies should publish details of their gender pay gap in a renewed effort to improve equality in the workplace, Theresa May has said.Big companies will soon be required to publish pay gap data, but the prime minister now wants smaller firms to play their part.Reducing the gap "once and for all" requires "sustained action" from employers, she said in a statement.But TUC chief Frances O'Grady said action, not words, was needed.'Real step change' The government has already introduced a legal requirement for all employers with more than 250 employees to publish their data on gender pay and bonuses by April 2018.But Mrs May is now appealing to smaller firms to disclose their pay details.She also urged companies to take steps to help women progress through the ranks of management, ensuring better female representation at senior levels.Mrs May said firms should strive to make flexible working a reality for all staff by advertising all jobs as flexible "from day one" unless there were "solid business reasons" not to.On Thursday, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the overall gender pay gap rose marginally from 18.2% in 2016 to 18.4% in 2017.The gap for full-time workers, however, fell to a record low of 9.1% - down from 9.4% the previous years.Earnings in first fall for three years Sexism 'was pervasive in finance' Is the gender pay gap in sport closing?Bank under fire for lack of diversity Image copyright Reuters Image caption Theresa May said sustained action was needed to address the gender pay gap Mrs May said: "It is encouraging news that the gap has fallen this year for full-time workers."But the gender pay gap isn't going to close on its own - we all need to be taking sustained action to make sure we address this."We need to see a real step change in the number of companies publishing their gender pay data and offering progression and flexibility for all employees."That's why today I am calling on more businesses, both small and large, to take action to make sure the gender pay gap is eliminated once and for all."'Damp squib' However, Ms O'Grady, the TUC's general secretary, said the pay gap would continue to close at a "snail's pace" unless the government "comes down much harder on employers".She said: "This announcement is a damp squib that will have little impact.Companies should be forced to publish their pay gaps - not merely encouraged."Real action would be fining businesses who do not share information on what men and women are paid, and making firms explain what steps they are taking to close their pay gaps."
PFI: five firms avoid tax despite £2bn profits, BBC learns:::::Image copyright Getty Images Five offshore PFI companies paid little or no corporation tax during a five-year period despite making profits of nearly 2bn, the BBC has learned.The five companies specialised in lending money through Private Finance Initiatives (PFI).They own hundreds of public assets including schools, hospitals and even police stations.The BBC has also learned that a small number of big offshore companies are currently on a buying spree.They are buying up a number of the UK's public buildings.Research carried out by the think tank that investigates PFI deals, the European Services Strategy Unit, reveals the extent of the buy-up in Britain.Nine off-shore infrastructure funds own between 50% and 100% of the equity in 335 PFI/Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects.This amounts to 45% of all 735 current projects 12 offshore companies have bought equity in 74% of the 735 current projects Education and health projects, including schools and hospitals, account for two-thirds of the purchases by offshore companies Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the Public Accounts Select Committee, told the BBC's The World Tonight: "Frankly it is shocking.Our taxes are paying for our schools and hospitals... and yet these companies are clearly profiting and paying no UK tax.I don't think that was ever envisaged when PFI was established."Ms Hillier, MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, also expressed concern at the concentration of so many public assets in so few hands offshore."I think nobody foresaw this sale of the debt on to companies and this conglomeration.Now we have so few companies owing such a large amount of the debt and that is a big concern."She described UK public assets as a "cash cow" adding: "Now there is a very big gap between the owner of the debt and the service and organisation paying for it."Image copyright Andrew Hosken Image caption Dexter Whitfield, Director of the European Services Strategy Unit Dexter Whitfield heads the European Services Strategy Unit which carried out the PFI research for public bodies and other organisations.He said offshore companies were making huge profits from buying public assets, with annual average returns on their PFI investments as high as 28%.But Mr Whitfield said the companies paid little or no UK corporation tax despite making huge profits.He said: "PFI is essentially a private sector profit machine.If the government adopted a strategy of building the public infrastructure directly through public investment and operating it through their in-house services this whole edifice would not exist."All these transactions are a product of the fact that there is so much money to be made in PFI."Mr Whitfield said five offshore PFI funds made profits of 1.83bn over the five-year period ending in April 2015, but paid little or no corporation tax.However, this was disputed by one offshore PFI giant, HICL Infrastructure Ltd, based in Guernsey.It said Mr Whitfield's research took no account of the fact that tax was paid both by the company's subsidiaries and by shareholders on their dividends.A spokesman said: "At the project level, HICL invests in a number of companies, which are incorporated in the UK and accordingly taxed by HMRC."Image copyright Andrew Hosken Image caption Professor Marcel Levi, chief executive of University College London Hospital Meanwhile, many PFI deals are causing headaches across public services, particularly in the NHS.The University College London Hospital's NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH) told the BBC that its PFI debt was far too high, mainly due to interest rate charges of between 7% and 8%.This meant an annual bill of 30m, at least double what he believes UCLH could be paying if the debt was re-scheduled.Professor Marcel Levi, UCLH Chief Executive, told the BBC: "If we spend an enormous amount of money on paying interest rates and this PFI debt, then that's money we cannot spend on patient care, on nurses, on treatment and management systems."And it's money that is not being spent on achieving targets for A&E and cancer waiting times, he added.
Hotel booking sites probed by consumer watchdog:::::Hotel booking sites are to be probed by the UK's competition watchdog to see if consumers are being misled by them.The Competition and Markets Authority is concerned that rather than helping consumers, the sites might actually be making it more difficult for them.The CMA said it was "concerned about the clarity, accuracy and presentation of information on sites".The investigation will examine areas such as hidden charges, search results, and discount claims.Leading booking sites include Expedia and Booking.com.In a statement, booking site Trivago, which is majority owned by Expedia, said: "Trivago will work with the CMA to explain the benefits it delivers to consumers looking for their ideal hotel."Booking.com said it would not be commenting at this time.According to the CMA, about 70% of people who shop around for accommodation use hotel booking sites.Nisha Arora, a senior director at the CMA, told the BBC's Today programme: "We are concerned about the clarity and accuracy of these sites.Rather than helping consumers they may actually be making it more difficult for them."She explained that the suggestions offered by such sites were not ranked solely on the preferences entered by the user."When you put in your criteria - which room you want, when you want to stay - they are listed in a certain order.This is not just influenced by consumer preference but by commission - commercial considerations - and consumers might not be aware of this."Image copyright AFP The British Hospitality Association (BHA) said it welcomed the probe as many of its members were concerned about the "vast power" of online booking agencies.It highlighted "high rates of commission, use of misleading information, pressure selling, and a lack of transparency"."In the process guests are paying more than they should for rooms."The BHA also said contract terms with some sites often included clauses that stopped a hotel offering a lower price on its own website than that offered to the online travel agent.Simon Calder, travel editor of the Independent, also highlighted commission rates: "The starting rate is 15%, which means that 15 out of every 100 stay is being taken by the intermediary."Hotels sometimes pay even more commission for increased visibility - i.e.giving the booking site even more in return for a higher profile on search returns."He says he tends to contact the hotel direct, to see if they will match the online rate and "perhaps provide a bonus such as a welcome drink or a free breakfast into the bargain".Image copyright Getty Images The CMA has written to companies across the whole sector.It is seeking evidence from both the websites and hotels, and would also like consumers to get in touch with it and share their experiences.It will look into how search results are ranked, and it also wants more information on whether extra charges, such as taxes and booking fees, are clearly displayed.Another area being looked at is the way sites display how many rooms are left, how many people are viewing a particular hotel and messages that claim to state the last time at which a similar room was booked.Ms Arora said the CMA wanted to hear how the sites gathered the information for these claims.The CMA is concerned this is used for "pressure selling", creating a "false impression of room availability or rush customers into making a booking decision".Social worker Valentin Danciu, from Ipswich, told the BBC that he had used a hotel booking website to reserve an apartment in Germany which was advertised at 31 per night.However, when the booking confirmation arrived it also included a 22 service charge and a 45 cleaning fee.Mr Danciu said he had been using hotel booking sites for years, but this time seemed to have missed the small print.He said until he received the email confirmation he had been given no indication that the total amount would be more than 90.The investigation into hotel websites follows a year-long CMA probe into price comparison sites.The CMA concluded that price comparison websites worked best for car insurance and worst for broadband.
US economy grows faster than expected in third quarter:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Spending on autos increased, helping US GDP to grow at 3% The US economy expanded at an annual pace of 3% during the three months to the end of September, which was stronger than expected.The growth extended the robust activity reported in the previous quarter, when US GDP grew at an annual pace of 3.1%.Analysts had been expecting a sharp slowdown after back-to-back hurricanes battered several states in the quarter.But consumer spending held steady, despite a drop in homebuilding investment.Together the two quarters mark the strongest six months of economic activity for the US since 2014, the Commerce Department said."Overall, this is a very solid performance, given the disruption caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma," wrote Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics."Their net effect seems to have been smaller and shorter than we expected."What went into the figure?Consumer spending, which increased at a hearty 3.3% rate in the second quarter, slowed to 2.4% growth - a deceleration probably caused by the hurricanes.Construction spending also fell, but exports and business investments in equipment and intellectual property accelerated from the previous quarter.Economists warned that estimates of business inventories, a major factor in the GDP rise, can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter.Excluding that category, GDP - a broad measure of goods and services made in the US - increased at an annual pace of 2.3%.The Commerce Department cautioned that its figures did not capture all the losses caused by the storms, which caused widespread closures of factories, offices and airports in states such as Florida and Texas.Its GDP estimates, for example, do not measure activity in US territories, such as Puerto Rico, which suffered some of the most severe damage.The Commerce Department estimated that storm-related damage to fixed assets, such as homes and government buildings, totalled more than $131bn (100bn).It also said it expected the government and insurers to pay more than $100bn in insurance claims, with foreign companies accounting for more than $17.4bn.Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross claimed Friday's GDP report a sign of progress, calling it a "remarkable achievement in light of the recent hurricanes".President Donald Trump has made hitting annual GDP growth of 3% a goal, and pledged tax cuts and other policies intended to reach that pace or higher."President Trump's bold agenda is steadily overcoming the dismal economy inherited from the previous administration," Mr Ross said."As the President's tax cut plan is implemented, our entire economy will continue to come roaring back."On a year-on-year basis, GDP was up 2.3%, the Commerce Department said in its report, which is an advance estimate that will be revised as more data is collected.That pace is roughly in line with US expansion since the 2007-2009 recession.Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard University, said the growth reflects improvement in the labour market and other areas that date back to the Obama administration.While some of the president's plans may boost growth, they're not in place yet, he said."Let's make no mistake - this was a very good number," he said."Jobs have been improving, consumption's been improving, businesses are doing better, there is a profound inequality problem but the US economy, despite not much from President Trump, has been doing well."Economists said the underlying economic strength shown in the report makes it more likely that central bankers at the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again by the end of the year, as expected.The price index for consumer spending, a closely-watched measure of inflation, increased at 1.3% in the third quarter, excluding food and energy.That remains below the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
Jigsaw fashion chain seeks buyer:::::Image copyright Jigsaw The High Street fashion chain Jigsaw is looking for a buyer.Controlling shareholder John Robinson, who founded the firm in 1970, has appointed KPMG to help with approaches by potential buyers or investors.A Jigsaw spokesperson confirmed: "There have been a number of approaches directly to Jigsaw, around the purchase of a minority or majority stake. ""No sale process has been activated but we continue to have conversations with interested parties," she said.Jigsaw has more than 80 stand alone stores, as well as concessions in department stores such as John Lewis and Harvey Nichols.It has a small international presence as well, in Bloomingdales in the US as well as outlets in Australia and the Netherlands.The company's most recent accounts for 2016 show Jigsaw had a turnover of 95m and profits of 6.2m.Squeezed consumer The news comes against a background of weakening retail sales and rising inflation, which is squeezing consumer spending power.This week, figures from the business lobby group the CBI showed the sharpest fall in September retail sales since the crisis in 2009.Last week, official figures showed third-quarter retail growth slowed to a year-on-year rate of 1.5%, its lowest since the second quarter of 2013.The figures come as the Bank of England contemplates its first interest rate rise in a decade.
Volkswagen diesel scandal still hitting profits:::::Image copyright EPA Volkswagen's diesel emissions scandal has continued to hit its profits, according to the latest figures from the carmaker.Third-quarter operating profit before costs related to the scandal was 4.3bn (3.8bn), an increase of 15% on the same period in 2016.However, once additional provisions in connection with the diesel issue were accounted for, operating profit was 1.7bn, 48% down on last year.VW said there was "a lot to be done".However, chief executive Matthias Mueller said: "Our operating business is strong, our financial position robust."'Financial cushion' VW said the diesel scandal had cost the carmaker about 14.5bn so far this year.However, Frank Witter, the VW management board member responsible for finance, said the firm had "an adequate financial cushion", although the diesel issue was nowhere near an end."Although there is still a lot to be done, we can definitely be satisfied with what we have achieved so far," he added.VW is facing tens of billions of pounds in compensation and fines after admitting to cheating on diesel emissions tests.The carmaker said that apart from the emissions scandal, other challenges included the economic situation, intense competition in the market and exchange rate volatility.Despite "persistently challenging market conditions", however, VW said it expected that deliveries of new cars to customers in 2017 would "moderately exceed the prior-year volume".
JC Penney shares slump after outlook cut:::::Image copyright Getty Images US department store chain JC Penney's shares closed down 14.7% in early trading after it cut its full-year profit outlook sharply.The retailer said adjusted earnings per share would now be two to eight cents instead of 40 to 65 cents.It also said it expected not to report any sales increase for the year, having previously said 2017 sales would be as much as 1% higher than the year before.The firm has been struggling with declining clothing sales.Traditional department stores are losing ground to discount retailers and online giant Amazon.JC Penney has been trying to turn around its business by expanding in other categories, such as toys and white goods, while reducing its dependence on clothes.As a result, it has been selling clothing at heavy discounts to clear outdated lines and make way for an overhaul of its range."We took the necessary steps to accelerate inventory liquidation primarily across all apparel divisions, which increases available funding to invest in new and trending merchandise categories," said chief executive Marvin Ellison.
Brexit: EU bank may not fully repay UK until 2054:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Alexander Stubb tells Today it will take more than 30 years for UK to get 3bn EIB investment back Billions of euros of British taxpayers' money could remain locked into an EU bank for more than thirty years after Brexit, the UK has been warned.Alexander Stubb, vice president of the European Investment Bank - in which the UK is a 16% shareholder - said it would not be fully repaid until 2054.He described Brexit as a "travesty" but denied the move was a punishment."The EIB has leveraged the economy of the UK many, many fold over the years," he told BBC Radio 4's Today.The UK has 3.5bn euros (3.1bn) of capital at the bank and a House of Lords report said the UK's investment could be worth 10.1bn (8.9bn) euros taking into account reserves and profits.Established in 1958, the EIB uses capital provided by EU countries to make loans at low rates, often for major infrastructure projects.All 28 EU nations are shareholders in the Luxembourg-based bank, with the UK being the largest alongside Germany, France and Italy.Mr Stubb, a former prime minister of Finland, told the BBC that the UK's money could be tied up for decades in after it leaves the EU in 2019."Everyone on both sides of the negotiating table agree that we have to pay back the 3.5 billion euro, basically in cash, and that will happen over a long period, up until 2054, because that's when the loans are amortised."'Travesty' He insisted that no-one in the bank wanted to "punish" the UK for leaving and actually wanted to "alleviate the pain" of Brexit."I have a British heart pumping, I am married to a Brit, my children have dual nationality and I think Brexit is one of the biggest travesties that we have seen in the modern era," he said."So I will do everything in my power to alleviate the pain, but the economic facts are just such that there are no winners in Brexit - apart from perhaps a few lawyers.Unfortunately, we will see this in the coming years."The BBC's Ross Hawkins said Today had heard how delays in authorising new loans while the UK remains part of the EU could see fewer social homes built.One housing association, Stonewater, said it may build around 300 fewer homes because its application for 100m to build new properties had ground to a halt.Its executive director John Bruton told the programme: "The Bank has been waiting for assurances from the UK government before the application can be progressed."
RBS 'on track' with third-quarter profit:::::Image copyright Getty Images Royal Bank of Scotland has said it is "on track" after seeing a 392m profit for the July-to-September period, with profits for the year so far now 1.3bn.RBS said it was only the second time since 2008 that the bank had turned a profit for three consecutive quarters.However, the bank said it could not be sure of a full-year profit, since it was hoping to settle a dispute with the US Department of Justice.The cost of that settlement is likely to push RBS into a loss.It relates to claims that RBS mis-sold mortgage bonds leading up to the 2008 banking crisis.On Thursday, the bank settled a separate US criminal investigation that accused its traders of lying to clients over investments between 2008 and 2013.The Department of Justice (DoJ) said RBS would pay $44m (33.4m) under the non-prosecution agreement.RBS said it had self-reported that issue to the US authorities and was pleased the matter was now resolved.'On track' The third-quarter profit compares with a loss of 469m for the same period last year.RBS said it had taken out 708m in costs as part of a simplification programme that had reduced the size of the business.The bank said it had made no further provision for mis-selling of payment protection insurance, while conduct and litigation costs were 125m for the quarter."Our strategy to deliver a simpler, safer, customer-focused bank is working," said RBS chief executive Ross McEwan."We have grown income, reduced costs, made better use of our capital and continued to make progress on our legacy conduct issues."Our core bank continues to generate strong profits and we remain on track to hit our financial targets."RBS is still 73% owned by the government following its emergency bailout in 2008.Profit 'question mark' Earlier this week, the financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, said it might take "further action" over the way RBS mistreated some small business customers.The FCA published an interim report into failings by the RBS division that dealt with struggling businesses, known as the Global Restructuring Group (GRG).The regulator flagged up "widespread" mistreatment of customers in some areas by the GRG.In response to the report, RBS said it had acknowledged failings and again apologised for its mistakes."More progress, but no update on the DoJ investigation and the spectre of GRG still leaves a question mark over whether the bank really can return to profitability next year," said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital."Shares have risen 60% in the last year as RBS has begun to show profits, but if investors get a whiff that profits are not coming next year, they may lose patience."
End of an era for Hong Kong trading floor:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A stockbroker's journey from heyday to the end of an era It's a bittersweet day at the Hong Kong stock exchange.Trading at the physical trading floor will close, after 31 years.In its heyday, during the 1980s and 1990s, the floor was home to more than a thousand traders.But the rise of electronic and internet trading has changed the industry irrevocably.This is something Christopher Cheung, who started in the industry in 1971, has experienced first hand."I have a deep affinity for this place.Every day, coming to work, we all sat side by side and talked all day," the lawmaker and the founder of Christfund Securities told me on the last day that he put on his distinctive red trader's vest."But, I know that things are changing.And financial technology is also changing.So, even if I am not entirely willing to leave, and to let this place go, we need to adjust and get with the times."Deep history Hong Kong's first stock exchange was formed in 1891, when this city was still a British colony.In the old days, I'm told, trading was dominated by British expatriates.That's why Hong Kong Chinese traders formed their own trading associations starting in the 1960s.The four different exchanges merged in 1986, moving into the current building in the central business district.By then, Mr Cheung had already been working for 15 years."At that time, there were more than a thousand people working here," he recalls."The printers were printing all the time.We were so busy sometimes, that we couldn't type all the info, so people would shout out what they were going to buy".Image copyright AFP Image caption Hong Kong's stock exchange was home to more than a thousand floor traders at its peak The frenetic excitement of the floor, not to mention the fortunes that were made and lost, came to define Hong Kong as a freewheeling, capitalist financial centre.But by the year 2000, the "open outcry" style of trading was completely abolished.Around the same time, many brokerages began moving trading operations to their own offices, instead of keeping people on the floor of the exchange.In that year, floor trading accounted for more than 20% of total turnover.In recent years, floor trading has contributed only a negligible amount with only a few dozen traders turning up on any given day.Francis Lun, who now owns his own brokerage, started working in the securities industry 20 years ago.He too was feeling sentimental about the closure."It's sad," he said."You have to wax nostalgic about the good old days."I'm sorry to say that when automation began to affect the real world, at first I thought that drivers would be the first to lose their jobs, because if you have autonomous driving, you don't need a driver.But sadly it's the floor traders who lost their jobs".Curtain closes The mood is sombre on the floor of the exchange on Friday.I saw only one trader when the opening bell rang at exactly 9:30.With tears in his eyes, Mr Yuen told me he was feeling very sad.Image copyright BBC Sport Image caption Hong Kong trader Mr Yuen "This place is like my home.In fact, I was here more than I was at home.So, closing this place is like, for me, losing my home".After the closing bell, more than one thousand traders, former traders, financial industry veterans and government officials will gather one more time on the floor to toast each other and to remember the good old days.Officials at the exchange say the floor will be renovated and turned into a space for conventions and exhibitions.

How Facebook saved a dying mill town:::::Image copyright Alan Brandt A mill town with high unemployment has seen its fortunes changed by Facebook's need for data servers.But will the town have to radically change to save itself?The people of Prineville live deep in a valley surrounded by dense forests.In the 1800s, it was the first place in central Oregon where white settlers drove out Native Americans to start a city.Steve Forrester's grandparents got here in 1902.When he was growing up in the 1970s, Prineville felt idyllic."It was a magical, magical place to grow up," he remembers."My dad worked in the sawmill industry as an electrician; my mom didn't work.We all learned to hunt and shoot a gun."We all learned how to drive in the forest before we were 16.In the spring, we could snow-ski in the morning and water-ski in the afternoon."And everybody had a job, and everyone did well."Prineville was the largest producer of ponderosa pine in the world.But when the federal government restricted logging and increased protections for animals like the spotted owl, the city's milling industry was decimated.As an adult, Forrester took a job with one of the few remaining mills, because he wanted to live in Prineville.Eric Klann was driven by the same devotion.He's the seventh generation of his family to live here.Out of college, he also took a job in Prineville that he knew wouldn't last."There was always a little voice in the back of my head saying, 'What are you doing - you want to be here, but you're in a dying industry,'" he says.A few years later, the US housing bubble burst and demand declined for parts made by the last mills.Lots of people lost jobs and left.It felt like Prineville couldn't catch a break.Image copyright Alan Brandt Image caption One of Prineville's new kind of "factory" - a data server farm Both Forrester and Klann felt lucky to land jobs at the city - Forrester as city manager, Klann as city engineer.Their chance to save Prineville arrived in 2009 in the form of a mysterious email from a company called Vitesse."For the longest time, we had no idea what Vitesse meant," he says.All Klann knew is that Prineville's natural resources made it perfect for a new industry - the information industry, created to save the massive amounts of information people post on the web.Vitesse wanted to build a big warehouse and fill it with rows and rows of servers - servers that tend to get hot.Central Oregon's cold nights could cool them naturally.Klann remembers the first in-person meeting with Vitesse, and how it felt like Prineville's last chance."Right before I walked into our conference room to meet with their nine lawyers, I got an email and our unemployment rate had peaked at 23%," Klann says."I got that email and I walked into that room, and I kept thinking, 'I better not screw this up.'"Klann and Forrester decided to outperform the other cities Vitesse was considering.They showed the company their small town could move at big-city speed, by responding to Vitesse's questions day and night."What we heard back is that other cities weren't doing that," Forrester says.Their strategy worked, and in 2010, Prineville finally learned who Vitesse actually was."They had the big finger with a thumb-up Facebook sign, and we all pressed the button and it lit up, et cetera," Mayor Betty Roppe says, recounting the new data centre's groundbreaking."That was the big announcement - it was Facebook."It was Facebook's first data centre of its own.Mark Zuckerberg was there, and Roppe had planned to give him a cowboy hat to show the city's pride in its cowboy culture."Cowboy hats are not cheap.They said, 'Do not get Mark Zuckerberg a cowboy hat.He does not want a cowboy hat.'OK.So, I got him a hoodie.He wears hoodies all the time," she says.When she presented the gift, Roppe gave Facebook's founder a kiss on the cheek."He just blushed like he wanted to have the floor open up and swallow him."Image copyright Rupa Shenoy Image caption Mayor Betty Roppe oversaw Prineville's transformation after data centres were built in the city Seven years later, Facebook has two more data centres in Prineville and six others across the world.Apple's moved into Prineville, too - it's built three data centres here.All of them sit high above Prineville's valley, in huge, long, flat buildings painted pale blue and gray so they blend in with the sky.About 500 employees work in the centres, most of them from Prineville.Security's tight, so few other people ever see inside.Despite their low profile, the data centres have had a profound impact.Roppe says the mills taught Prineville a lesson - not to rely on just one industry.So they're putting in things that appeal to lots of employers - like good roads, walking and biking paths, modern wastewater treatment, a new hospital and a state college outpost.But now that the city's successful, officials have a lot more to think about.Like, how do you slow success down?"We can keep the small-town feel.I'm sure of it," Roppe says."We don't want to be a big city."The cost of housing is up, so city officials know they have to build more affordable housing.And Mayor Roppe's own granddaughter, with a college degree, can't find a living wage job.So, they have to keep bringing in new employers.All city manager Forrester can do is calibrate the development carefully.He worries about Prineville changing too much, too."We are small-town people.We live the Western lifestyle," Forrester says."The quiet and peace of central Oregon is a beautiful, beautiful thing, and to be able to make a living here is tremendous."But Forrester says he's seen that central Oregon towns that don't adapt will die.And he knows they have to risk changing Prineville in order to save it.The World is a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH.This piece is part of the series 50 States: America's place in a shrinking world.
Are too many tourists visiting Iceland?:::::Image copyright Getty Images An explosion in tourism saved Iceland's economy.But in a country of just 300,000 people, how much tourism is too much?It's a cold, overcast and blustery day in Iceland, but that hasn't put off the busloads of tourists at the Blue Lagoon - one of the country's most popular attractions.The lagoon is a pool of geothermally heated water.It is rich in minerals and is said to be good for your skin.Its creation is something of an accident.Locals noticed the run-off from a local geothermal power plant was a strange shade of blue and started bathing in it.Located between Reykjavik and the airport, it's now become a "must-do"' on tourist itineraries."In our first year in 1994 we had about 50,000 guests, and this year we will be welcoming 1.3 million," says Grimur Smundsen, the Blue Lagoon's chief executive.That success reflects the astonishing growth of tourism in Iceland as a whole.Last year 1.7 million people visited Iceland - more than triple the number that came in 2010, when the small island nation of just 330,000 was still reeling from a catastrophic banking crisis and the eruption of Eyjafjallajkull - a volcano that grounded air traffic across Europe for a week.Image caption This year 1.3 million tourists will visit the Blue Lagoon, says Grimur Smundsen At the time the eruption was seen as a disaster for tourism, but that pessimism proved ill-founded."In the long term it had a tremendous positive effect because Eyjafjallajkull was one of the things that put Iceland on the map."Mr Smundsen says."Maybe tourists heard of Iceland for the first time in the various airports when they were stranded."The sudden interest from travellers could not have come at a better time.When Iceland's three major banks collapsed in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, there were fears they would take the rest of the economy with them.Nine years later the economy is growing at more than 7% a year, unemployment is less than 3% and foreign currency is rolling in.The tourism boom is leading to a construction boom and the creation of tens of thousands of jobs."Tourism really helped us take off," says Gylfi Magnusson, a professor at University of Iceland and a former minister for economic affairs after the banking crisis."Certainly the recovery would have taken considerably longer if it hadn't been for this unexpected boom."But the sudden influx of foreign visitors has not come without problems.Some sites lack the infrastructure to cope with the rising numbers.Image caption "We don't have any neighbours anymore," says Reykjavik resident Benony Aegesson In summer Reykjavik's restaurants are filled to capacity.There is a shortage of hotel rooms, meaning that AirBnB has flourished, and Reykjavik's main shopping streets have been turned into a stream of tourist shops selling Icelandic wool jumpers and soft toy puffins."We don't have any neighbours anymore," says Benony Aegesson, who has lived in downtown Reykjavik since the 1970s.He says virtually all the flats around his home are now rented out to tourists."It was very fashionable for young people to live here, but the prices are getting so high that the young people can't afford it anymore."Speculators have come here and bought up apartments and stores and we're worried about its future as a residential area.If it's only old people and tourists here, there is a danger it will die."Is there a limit to the number of tourists a small nation like Iceland can accommodate?Inga Hln Plsdttir is the director of Visit Iceland, and has been in charge of promoting Iceland as a tourist destination for the past decade.She says the question is a difficult one to answer.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Areas outside the capital Reykjavik are looking for more travellers to come and visit, says Inga Hln Plsdttir "If you said there would be five million people coming to Iceland in five years and you told me they would all be coming to Reykjavik, i would really worry," she tells me."But we've been putting the focus on the other regions of Iceland.If you get numbers like that spreading around Iceland, visiting other communities then you have a completely different scenario."At this point I don't think we have an overflow - if you talk to someone just outside Reykjavik they're complaining that they want more travellers to come and visit them."I asked long-time Reykjavik resident Benony Aegesson if he would ask people not to come to Iceland on holiday."No, I wouldn't do that," he says: "We're not against tourists per se, but nobody wants to come to a ghost city.Of course they saved us from our financial crisis - that we are grateful for."
The flying drones that can scan packages night and day:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pinc's flying drone scans warehouse packages Flying drones and robots now patrol distribution warehouses - they've become workhorses of the e-commerce era online that retailers can't do without.It is driving down costs but it is also putting people out of work: what price progress?It could be a scene from Blade Runner 2049; the flying drone hovers in the warehouse aisle, its spinning rotors filling the cavernous space with a buzzing whine.It edges close to the packages stacked on the shelf and scans them using onboard optical sensors, before whizzing off to its next assignment.But this is no sci-fi film, it's a warehouse in the US - one of around 250,000 throughout the country, many gargantuan in size: retail giant Walmart's smallest warehouse, for example, is larger than 17 football fields put together.And these automated drones are now doing the jobs humans - on foot, or operating fork-lift trucks and mechanical lifts - used to do: and they're doing them more cheaply and more accurately."Every year companies lose billions of dollars due to misplaced items and faulty inventory records in their warehouses," says Fadel Adib, an assistant professor of media, arts and sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Image copyright Hardis Group Image caption Hardis Group's EyeSee drone can fly autonomously "Today's inventory management requires workers to scan items manually, which is a very time consuming and error-prone process.It's impossible to keep track of all items in the warehouse."Two drones can do the work of 100 humans over the same time period, according to supply chain specialist, Argon Consulting.This means they can do several tours of a warehouse - even at night - compare results, identify discrepancies, and build up a much more accurate picture much more quickly.Drone makers claim scanning accuracy of close to 100%.Matt Yearling, chief executive of Pinc, one of the firms offering such aerial robots, says they can save warehousing and logistics companies millions of dollars."Nobody has 100% accuracy - including Walmart and Amazon," he says."For a warehouse that is 95% accurate, it means that 5% is ambiguous.So if the warehouse is storing $100m [75m] worth of inventory, then $5m is uncertain."Typically the retailer will have more than one warehouse.So, if you multiply the problem across the warehouse network you are talking big dollars."Pinc's drones use hydrogen fuel cells, enabling them to fly for up to two hours - four times as long as some battery-powered drones.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images French firm Hardis Group has also launched an inventory-scanning drone - EyeSee - and emphasises how autonomous it is."Flight orders and flight plan execution are ensured by our Android application," says Stephane Cadenet, manager of the firm's drone programme."Our solution is simple to use: no installation, no infrastructure adaptation and no driver.The only thing to do is unpack the drone.The calculation of the flight plan is automatic."Other companies, such as Infinium Robotics, have also developed drone scanning systems.Of course, retailers have been using robots and automated systems in warehouses for some years.In 2012, fashion brand Net-A-Porter said its robot pickers were already 500% faster than humans, while online retailer Amazon's Kiva robots have almost become famous.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Instead of humans walking miles to pick goods, these robots take the shelves to the pickers "Innovators are working to make drones and robots an integral part of warehousing, inventory, and logistics," says JP Gownder, a principal analyst at research firm Forrester."Over the next 10 years, these technologies look set to revolutionise these spaces."But all this cost saving and efficiency comes at the expense of jobs for humans.The $2.3tn e-commerce industry is huge and growing, but almost 75% of e-commerce companies employ no more than four people.So it is no coincidence that in the US some 89,000 shop workers were laid off between October and April this year, while employment in New York City clothing stores has declined for three consecutive years.Forrester estimates that automation technologies, including artificial intelligence, will replace 17% of US jobs by 2027.And growth in new types of employment will not be enough to compensate."Automation does create opportunities for new jobs - equivalent to 10% of today's jobs," says Mr Gownder."But that still leads to a net 7% loss of jobs due to automation, which has to be made up by macro-economic growth, non-automation related jobs, and monetary policy."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Ocado warehouse run by robots Ryan Bax, industry analyst for mobility at research consultancy Frost & Sullivan, concedes that the use of drones and robotics in warehousing will lead to job losses, but believes growth elsewhere will compensate for this."As automation reduces the demand for lesser qualified jobs, the need for specialised skills within the logistics sector will grow," he maintains.And he thinks automation tech may even become mandatory once it has been shown to reduce accidents in the workplace."The use of automated technologies will permit warehouses to operate 24-hour days and improve stock management accuracy, but beyond this they will provide significant benefits to safety within the workplace."This will be small comfort for the thousands of warehouse workers displaced by drones and robots, but it is the inevitable consequence of our desire for online convenience, cheaper prices and faster deliveries.
What's behind the rise of Asia's stock markets:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Analysts believe the strong appetite for Asian stocks can continue Memory chips and China's economic muscle are among the factors that have put a rocket under Asian stocks this year, pushing markets to record or multi-year highs."Everyone hated Asia markets for a long time," says Josh Crabb, head of Asian equities at Old Mutual Global Investors."Now we've moved on from there".Moved on indeed: South Korea's Kospi sits at a record; Japan's Nikkei 225 index is above a two-decade high; Hong Kong's Hang Seng is around a 10-year peak, while markets in India, Taiwan and Indonesia are among the others scaling fresh heights.It's an unusual moment for equities in the region as strong corporate profits, economic stimulus and growth are overshadowing nearby political risks."Markets seem impervious to events," says CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy."Sabre-rattling from North Korea barely makes a dent".And some analysts argue that as long as US markets keep their cool, there's plenty of good times for investors in Asia still to come.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many markets in Asia are trading at historic or multi-year highs Since the 2009 crash, global markets have been moving steadily higher - with a few stumbles en route.Regional growth Massive liquidity coupled with ultra-low interest rates has created a fertile environment for stocks to thrive.Asia has enjoyed a tailwind from record gains on Wall Street.At the same time, China's economy - aiming for 6.5% growth this year - has been underpinning the broader region for some time.The world's second largest economy has a big impact on the fortunes of other countries, even as its growth rate moderates.Take South Korea: It's seen double-digit export growth for the last 11 months, thanks largely to China, which buys about one-quarter of its products sold offshore."China's improving economic conditions can really be seen as a trigger for the equity run in Asia," says IG Markets analyst Jingyi Pan.Image copyright AFP Image caption Asia is home to two of the world's three largest economies, China and Japan Japan's economy is also gathering steam.Exports are climbing and strong domestic spending on devices like cameras and computers from China is driving growth.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's re-election, and the likely continuation of his Abenomics policies, was met with cheers from investors.Ed Rogers, chief executive of Rogers Investment Advisors in Japan believes the benchmark Nikkei index can track even higher."Japan has a long way to go.There's $18tn in cash on the sidelines," he says, adding that most of that money is currently invested in low-yielding Japanese government bonds."There's a similar boat load of money that wants to get out of China," Mr Rogers says.Earnings bump That money could find plenty of homes in Asia where equities are cheap relative to other parts of the world.Companies in the region are strengthening, and well-received results this earnings season have given markets a boost.For South Korean firms, the outlook is even brighter.CLSA analyst Paul Choi says at the beginning of 2017, people were expecting 10% corporate earnings growth, now that forecast is around 50%.It's got a lot to do with memory chips.Higher prices for chips used in electronic devices have spurred index heavyweights like Samsung and SK Hynix, as well as the broader market.In fact, Mr Choi says that fluctuations in the value of memory chips is more threatening to South Korea's market than provocations from its northern neighbour.Which brings us back to North Korea.Image copyright AFP Image caption North Korea insists it needs a nuclear-weapons programme to ensure its survival Investors appear largely unshaken by displays of military aggression - missile tests and provocations against Japan - and analysts say markets have factored in the risk.Rogers Investment Advisors Mr Rogers describes the North Korea threat as "kind of overblown".That attitude will shift dramatically if threats turn to action.Until then, other risks to the Asian rally loom larger.'Unknown' threat Turning off the stimulus tap and the ratcheting up of interest rates will dampen enthusiasm, while analysts point to China's ballooning debt as another threat to the region.Mr Rogers says political risk and "unpredictability" hang over Asian markets and unexpected moves could stunt recent rallies.The threat of the "unknown" is a familiar refrain from market-watchers in the region."The most damaging risks are the ones we don't forecast," says CMC Markets' Mr McCarthy.A final recurring note of caution is the rush on Wall Street.Recent gains have been inspired by strong earnings, along with hopes of tax reform and business friendly policies under President Trump.But the chorus of concern about the market's sharp rise is growing on Wall Street.History shows a gradual climb-down from the record highs on US markets is unlikely, and a collapse could shock the world."If the US blows up, most things will come off.[Asia] won't be immune," says Josh Crabb of Old Mutual Global Investors."Markets tend to get euphoric and then they get fearful.Theoretically you shouldn't have boom and bust, but human behaviour drives stock markets more than logic."
The US and Iranian battle over the pistachio nut trade:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Relations between the US and Iran have an outsized impact on the global trade in pistachios There are lots of casualties in international conflicts but this one is nuts, you might say - although strictly speaking the pistachio is a seed.The international pistachio trade has faced unexpected headwinds due to the tensions between Iran and the US.The global pistachio industry is a multi-billion dollar a year sector that is continuing to grow in value as its popularity as a foodstuff grows.The US and Iran dominate the world's trade in pistachios - collectively controlling between 70% and 80% of yearly output for the last decade.Over the last forty years, Iran's growers have faced pressures from sanctions, tariffs and restrictions on their ability to access international financial tools.Although pistachios themselves were not on the list of sanctioned products, restrictions on global banking made trade difficult for Iranian farmers.All that changed in 2016 following the Iran nuclear deal, officially The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).This agreement with the US and its allies removed sanctions.It wasn't just Iranian oil that came flowing back onto the international market, pistachio exports began gaining overseas markets.Trump's threat That progress could face challenges though.US President Donald Trump called the agreement created under his predecessor the "worst" deal the US has ever made.In October he decertified the agreement.The move passes responsibility to the US Congress to evaluate and determine whether it believes Iran is compliant with the terms and if the US should remain in the deal.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Over 90% of US pistachios are grown in California President Trump said in the speech announcing his decision that the agreement "threw Iran's dictatorship a political and economic lifeline," but had failed to prevent Iran's "sprint" towards nuclear weapon development.For Iran's pistachio industry the threat of losing the deal and reinstating sanctions could mean the return of what Hojat Hassani Sadi, deputy director of the Iran Pistachio Association calls "unfair and unequal competition".Ancient roots The pistachio industry in Iran dates back thousands of years.By contrast, pistachio farming in the US started in the 1930s with Persian seeds.The boom in commercial pistachio cultivation came after the US severed ties with Iran following the 1979 hostage crisis, after which the US and its allies placed sanctions on Iran.Over the next several decades, even in countries where Iranian pistachios were welcomed, restrictions on its companies' ability to access international financing made it hard for the industry to flourish.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Archaeological evidence suggests pistachios were first grown in what is now Iraq in 7,000BC During that time the US market expanded, with farmers - mainly across California - planting the crop.But in 2014. hot and dry weather conditions across the western US cost the industry nearly half its crop and cut profits for 2015 - the year those nuts were sold - by close to $1.4bn (1bn).Globally, pistachio prices rose, but for Iran's growers it was also an opportunity.Price competition The price of pistachios has been on the rise since 2002.Richard Matoian, executive director of the American Pistachio Growers (APG) trade association, attributes this to increased awareness of their health properties and global demand for healthy snacks."The industry has been pushing the products with advertising," he says, adding that middle-class demand in developing markets has also boosted exports.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Increased demand in China has been key to sector growth.Between 2008 and 2013 Chinese imports of US pistachios rose 146% according to APG.But the 2014 drought saw the price of California's nuts rocket from $3/lb (453g) to over $5/lb.By contrast Iran's pistachio yield that year was strong.In markets like China, they were able to undercut American prices by close to $0.20/lb.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Pistachio plants grow best in arid climates but that leave crops vulnerable to water shortages A strong growing year in 2016 has helped the US market recover and led to a moderation in price.But Iran has another advantage that helps it in global trade - its location."Iran has a transportation advantage.They can certainly take markets away and China is an example of that," says Mr Matoian.Uphill march The advantages and disadvantages for Iran are not only linked to sanctions.Iran claims its pistachios have a better taste, as do several large European distributors, though the US and Iran mainly grow the same strain.(Turkish pistachios, for example, are a different variety.)The US also imposes a 241% tariff on Iranian pistachios meaning even without sanctions the US market has been all but cut off for Iran.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Aging water infrastructure in Iran is a major difficultly for Iran's farmers Water shortages are another problem for Iran.According to Mr Sadi it is the "major obstacle to growth" for his industry.Iran's pistachio sector is second in the world following the strong 2016 season in the US.And with the two countries dominating so much of the global market, Iran isn't in dire need of a comeback.But for the growing number of pistachio fans around the world increased access to Iran's pistachio exports and decreasing prices would be a sweet outcome.
The 350 million people who don’t even exist:::::Image copyright Getty Images Whenever any report has a "global" subject matter it's never long before there's a massive, global-size statistic, counting people by the millions and billions.News reports on global problems like to gesture to devastation and deprivation on an epic scale, counting out the suffering in numbers so big that they almost lose meaning.And maybe they actually do go astray.Because the annual monitoring report on education from the United Nations education agency, Unesco, makes the point that global figures on access to education could be out by a factor of 350 million.That's not a minor gap in the headcount.That's the equivalent of the combined populations of the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain.Undocumented and invisible These "invisible" people, below the demographic radar, are described as "the poorest of the poorest".These are families growing up in places where censuses and administrators do not reach.These are millions of unregistered lives in sprawling slums around some cities in the developing world, or in families living illegally and undocumented as migrants.Unesco's report says that the conventional means of gathering information - such as household surveys, censuses and records of birth and death - are only likely to be accurate for populations that are settled, visible and accessing services.Image copyright EPA Image caption How accurate are international figures on education targets?Shifting and excluded populations, even in their tens of millions, are harder to identify and can slip away from the spreadsheets and the data gatherers.Children living on the streets might not show up in the numbers not making it to school.They won't even count enough to be absences.The homeless or nomadic are missing from population studies going from house to house.Unwanted refugees driven over borders by political violence can be left uncounted and unrecognised by reluctant hosts.The UN agency estimates an undercount of 250 million in household surveys used in developing countries and says another 100 million are likely to be outside the reach of official statistics, including those living as illegal immigrants in wealthier countries.Taking account This year's education monitoring report focuses on accountability.But the Unesco study highlights that holding governments accountable for failing to deliver education services depends on knowing how many people need to be supported.More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch.International goals to cut illiteracy and increase access to school places need to recognise that some of the most disadvantaged are not even part of the target.Unesco says that it raises the question of who is responsible for people who don't even appear in national figures.Such discrepancies appear in the UN agency's own range of figures.Unesco says that its annual statistics for children without access to school include an estimate for those hard to reach communities.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption More pupils are getting access to school - but 264 million are still missing out But in comparisons for inequalities in access and public spending on education, Unesco says these "invisible" millions are not included.The UN agency makes the point that if the "mantra" of the current development goals is that "no one is left behind", for hundreds of millions, they never even get as far as being recognised as existing.As such, "no one is ultimately held to account for protecting their rights".Missing school This year's newly-released figures show 264 million young people without access to primary or secondary school.The report warns of six successive years in which education has received a declining share of aid budgets.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Undocumented migrants and the homeless can go below the radar of official figures And an international group of former education ministers, the Atlantis Group, including former UK education secretary Nicky Morgan and US education secretary Arne Duncan, has called for a greater commitment to aid for education.Last month, another UN agency, Unicef, reported there had been "nearly zero progress" in the past decade on improving access to school in the poorest countries.And earlier this month, Unesco's Institute for Statistics warned of a "staggering" problem in lack of quality in schools, with more than 600 million young people who have been to school but are lacking basic skills in literacy and numeracy.Counting in education and making education count remain a challenge.
Why businesses are saving the humble text message:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The firm that sends two billion text messages per year If you think that WhatsApp is killing the humble text message you may need to think again.A growing number of us are sending far fewer text messages than we used to.Armed with our fancy smartphones, in recent years we have instead switched to the likes of Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, Snapchat, and of course WhatsApp for our chats.As a result, the number of text (or SMS, as they are officially known) messages being sent per day around the world has now fallen far behind the more hi-tech rivals.At WhatsApp alone, 55 billion messages are now sent globally every day, more than twice the 22 billion figure for SMS messages.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People are switching from texts to the likes of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger Yet while the number of text messages being sent by people in the developed world has fallen since 2011, there continues to be one big growth area - notification SMS messages sent from businesses to customers.Most of us are now increasingly receiving such text messages on a regular basis, such as when you are being reminded of an opticians' appointment, when an engineer will come to repair your boiler, or when a delivery is going to arrive.One company at the forefront of this business text messaging industry is a small English firm Esendex, based in Nottingham, in the East Midlands.With just 200 employees, it now sends out two billion text messages per year, on behalf of 30,000 businesses and other organisations, up from 100 million texts in 2010.Image caption Businesses are now increasingly sending text messages to their customers Esendex is already the biggest player in the UK, France and Italy; it is growing strongly in Germany, Spain and Australia.And it is a lucrative business.Esendex has annual revenues of 23m a year, as firms pay it a fee for every text sent.Meanwhile, a report earlier this year predicted that the global business text message industry would be worth $70bn by 2020, up from $55bn in 2014, as more and more texts are sent out to customers.Geoff Love, Esendex's chief executive, says while friends may like to chat over Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, there are a number of key reasons why businesses prefer to send out text messages instead."SMS is the only app that's on every phone in the world, so no matter who you are trying to communicate with, you know they can receive a text message."Test messaging facts SMS stands for Short Message Service The first text was sent in 1992 by British software engineer Neil Papworth.It read simply "Merry Christmas" 15.2 million texts are sent globally every minute Text messages are read, on average, within five minutes of being received Text messages are up to 160 characters in length Google is working on a new version of text messaging called RCS or Rich Communication Services, which aims to make it more similar to WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger "That's not the same with WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger or any of the other applications.SMS is simply ubiquitous," he says."SMS is also very powerful - people read text messages.95% of text messages are read within five seconds, so you know your message will get there quickly and cheaply."And with SMS we know that the text message has been delivered to the person's phone."Image caption Geoff Love says firms use SMS because it is on every mobile phone in the world Majority-owned by a private equity firm, Esendex is continuing to quickly expand overseas through a determined acquisitions policy.Given that the global marketplace is a crowded one, with a large number of firms touting to help businesses send out text messages to their customers, mobile phone industry expert Ben Wood, says Esendex is right to have wanted to grow quickly."It is a cutthroat business, down to fractions of a penny in terms of margins," says Mr Wood, who works for research group CCS Insight."So scale is all important, companies need to be growing in the space in order to make sure that they're able to buy messages at scale, and therefore compete when they're tendering for business."Image caption Esendex's head office is in Nottingham With its main overseas offices in Barcelona, Spain, and Melbourne, Australia, plus others in France and Italy, Mr Love says an attempt to break into the US market failed."Melbourne and Barcelona grew quickly, [but] things were tougher in America, and we ended up closing down our American operation."Not all of the [US] mobile telephone networks could communicate with each other, so you'd be in a situation where you might send a message and it wasn't received because the two networks didn't have any kind of agreement between them to receive messages, which was crazy."This is the second story in a new series called Connected Commerce, which every week highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.The first feature in the series, looked at a Canadian winemaker who has to battle winter temperatures of less than -25C."In Europe, whilst it appears to be more complicated because people speak different languages, in reality they are far more similar," says Mr Love.Yet there are some differences in Europe, he adds, with companies in Germany demanding far more stringent tests on the software and technology.Image caption The global mobile phone market is taking over the world Entering the Australian market also brought an unforeseen issue - due to the time difference it can't shut down its UK head office computer systems overnight for maintenance, because it is daytime in Australia."It forced us to become a 24/7 business," says Mr Love."That was quite hard to begin with because it meant changing the way we operated... but in the end it turned into quite an advantage because the companies we are working with are using us for mission-critical stuff 24/7 anyway."Our customers are in every single industry you can think of, it could be a very small business or a massive enterprise.But typically it's organisations who really need to communicate with a large number of people very quickly."
Could this 10-year-old fix Pakistan's waste problem?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Zymal Umer has discovered there is money to be made in recycling "If people just thought for a moment before dumping their rubbish then maybe they wouldn't do it as it harms our environment."Zymal Umer, 10, sighs as she takes in the view of a makeshift rubbish dump on the outskirts of her hometown Sargodha in Punjab, Pakistan.But could the girl dubbed the country's "youngest social entrepreneur" by many have a solution?For now, there are colourful piles of plastic bags, metal and general waste as far as the eye can see.Wafts of smoke fill the air with a putrid and toxic stench as much of the refuse is set on fire.What's in front of Zymal is just the tip of the iceberg that is Pakistan's problem with waste.According to the country's environment protection department, 20m tonnes of solid waste is generated a year and the figure is growing by 2.4% annually.Landfill issues "This is a situation you can find across all of Pakistan - these bags are not biodegradable and people carelessly discard them.They don't really think about recycling," Zymal says.Image caption Zymal turns old newspapers into gift bags Proper solid waste management has never been practiced in the country; only half of the rubbish generated is collected by the government and there is a severe lack of adequate landfill sites.Dumping and burning remain the most common methods of disposal and much of the uncollected waste poses serious risks to public health.Beautiful bags Zeebags is Zymal's bid to try to reduce pollution and increase awareness about the environment.The schoolgirl turns old newspapers into bright and beautifully decorated gift bags which are then sold to family and friends and most of the profits distributed to various local charities.In the space of just three years she has gone from selling a few bags to selling hundreds - worth $4-5,000.Image caption Pakistan has a real problem with waste "I learnt to make the bags by watching YouTube."It is hard to balance my schoolwork with running Zeebags, so I make them at the weekend or during the holidays with my cousins."My father and grandfather pay for my raw materials and if they didn't help me, it would be very hard to keep my project going," she says.One charity Zymal's money goes to is called SOS Children's Villages, which helps orphaned and destitute children across Pakistan.Image caption Zymal has used the money she has raised to help other children "Through my income I've been able to pay for water coolers, washing machines, batteries and the type of things they need for daily life," Zymal explains."To see the happiness on their faces gives me a lot of satisfaction and motivation to carry on."Her innovative and charitable enterprise has attracted a fair bit of attention with TV and newspaper coverage labelling Zymal as "Pakistan's youngest social entrepreneur".Award winner Zeebags has also won a number of awards in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the USA."I was very excited to get some international recognition for my work and proud to get some positive exposure for my country and parents."Image caption Zymal believes her business has the potential to grow much larger Selling online has opened up her business to a new world of possibilities."In Pakistan it's thought girls cannot work independently but I haven't faced any difficulties and my aim is to continue my work."I want to become a businesswoman in the future and expand Zeebags through my website and showcase other people's products, too."The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators."My biggest ambition is to grow my project not just in Pakistan but also globally," she says.Kalsoom Lakhani is founder of Invest2Innovate, an organisation that helps start-up companies in Pakistan grow and attract funding.She says the country needs to think about the future for entrepreneurs."While we have this enormous potential we need to be always thinking, how we enable that potential and how we continue to not only allow young people to start a business but allow them to grow businesses."Pakistan has already begun to tackle its environmental problems through legislation, establishing government agencies and accepting technical help from international donors.But the response is still fragmented and not a particularly high priority in a country racked with more pressing security and political issues.Image caption Zymal has to balance her social enterprise with her schoolwork This gives Zymal's work even more urgency.She hopes her success will start to change people's minds about the seriousness of taking care of their environment."It is important so future generations can live in a clean and safe world," she says."I want to be able to say I've played my part but it's up to others to do something themselves, too."
How you could be Postman Pat for a day and earn extra cash:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cartoon characters Postman Pat and Mr Plod represent a bygone era in deliveries A growing number of start-ups are trying to help retailers deliver goods to customers more quickly and at lower cost.But can they really compete with the big courier and postal firms?It was a road accident in the Norwegian mountains that inspired the idea for start-up delivery company Nimber.One of the founders was on his way to a ski-jumping competition near Lillehammer when he saw a postal truck had overturned on the road."No one was hurt, but all these cars were just passing by," says Nimber chief executive Ari Kestin, whose partner Knut Bjerke made the trip."He thought, why don't they stop and carry some of the parcels to their destinations?A light-bulb came on."Nimber was launched soon after, joining a wave of new apps aimed at shaking up the delivery market.The website connects people who want to send large, awkward-to-carry goods, with members of the public travelling in the same direction.These "crowdsourced couriers" name their own price, Mr Kestin says, but are usually cheaper than using a traditional courier service or postal firm, such as FedEx or Royal Mail.Image copyright Nimber Image caption Nimber's crowd-sourced couriers often transport large goods "If you're driving from London to Manchester anyway, you will probably accept a lower price to deliver a package than a big delivery firm would," he says."We are making use of spare capacity and allowing people to monetise their movements."The site, whose main markets are Norway and the UK, has more than 40,000 registered "bringers" and 80,000 senders.It handles hundreds of deliveries a day of things like bikes, car parts and furniture.So far it has focused on serving people selling second-hand goods on sites like e-Bay and Norway's finn.no, but it has just started working with several big retailers, including Norway's largest meat and eggs producer, Nortura."Nimber is a great choice because it is environmentally friendly and doesn't create more traffic or pollution," a Nortura spokeswoman tells the BBC.But using members of the public to deliver goods does have its drawbacks.Mr Kestin admits that his service may not be as economical as a traditional delivery service for smaller items.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Its crowdsourced couriers are not always available to handle deliveries, and, on occasion, pull out at the last minute - although "that's quite rare", he says.This isn't stopping other firms experimenting with the crowdsourcing model.Some, like Uber Rush, Deliveroo and Instacart are using crowdsourced couriers to deliver packages, groceries and hot food locally - often more cheaply and quickly than major couriers could.Belgium postal giant Bpost and DHL are among those to have experimented with crowdsourced couriers.And Amazon launched its "citizen delivery" service Flex in 2015.With global retail e-ecommerce sales forecast to rise 23% this year to $2.3tn (1.8tn), it's not surprising start-ups are trying to muscle in on a delivery market still dominated by national postal services and courier firms like UPS, DHL, FedEx, Blue Dart and PostNL.These account for more than 90% of e-commerce deliveries, not including food, estimates Alex le Roy, an analyst at consultancy Transport Intelligence."These start-ups are basically serving the needs that the larger delivery companies can't meet," he says."That's because typically, traditional postal companies can deliver packages more or less anywhere, but they can't do it quickly."And the big courier firms can deliver quickly, but charge much higher prices when they deliver to out-of-the-way places or carry awkwardly shaped goods."Nimbler start-ups can also help smaller retailers reach new markets.Image copyright Fetchr Image caption Idriss Al Rifai and Joy Ajlouny co-founded Middle East-based Fetchr Fetchr, for example, is a Dubai-based delivery company aiming to connect retailers with around four billion people worldwide who live in places without street names or house numbers."There is this huge demand for online shopping in emerging markets, but many big retailers are facing the same problem," says Fetchr co-founder Idriss Al Rifai."How can you grow if you can't deliver large numbers of parcels?"The firm uses a customer's smartphone GPS location as the address.As soon as one of Fetchr's couriers has picked up a package from a retailer, it notifies the customer, offering them a two-hour delivery slot.The customer then shares their location with Fetchr."Fifteen minutes before the firm delivers, we will ask the customer to share their location again - and if they have moved elsewhere, that's fine," Mr Al Rifai says."Even when there is an address, people don't want to be pinned down for hours to receive a package."The firm, which employs 2,000 of its own couriers, serves brands such as supermarket chain Carrefour and Gucci, in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.It hopes to expand internationally, having raised $41m (31m) in investment in May, but will face competition from the likes of the UK's What3Words and South Africa's WumDrop, which are also addressing the "lack-of-address" issue.Image copyright Weengs Image caption Weengs collects retailers' goods, packs and delivers them Some start-ups, such as Red Stag Fulfilment in the US and UK-based Weengs, are offering one-stop-shop services aimed at taking the delivery hassle away from small businesses."Shipping companies expect you to have packed your items properly, have done an analysis of your shipping costs, and prepared your customs paperwork," explains Weengs co-founder Alex Christodoulou."But many small businesses don't have the expertise to do this efficiently - it costs time and money."Weengs manages the whole shipping process from end-to-end, collecting your items unboxed and packing them at its warehouse in Kings Cross, London."We then measure your item with a laser and create a box exactly fitting the dimensions of your goods," says Mr Christodoulou.This reduces costs because some delivery companies charge by volume, not weight, he says.Big retailers sending lots of parcels can often negotiate bulk discounts on delivery costs.Smaller retailers can't.So Weengs pools its customers' orders and shops around between 10 to 30 courier firms to bring down costs, says Mr Christodoulou.His firm has handled 200,000 orders since launch in 2015, but faces competition from more established comparison services, such as parcel2go.com."These firms are already re-distributing the share of delivery volume from traditional delivery companies to smaller ones and individuals," says e-commerce consultant Kunle Campbell."I think more delivery companies will adopt their approaches, and it could cut the costs of delivery across the board."That will be music to the ears of all e-commerce entrepreneurs.
Dolly Parton's nine-to-five approach to music:::::Image caption Dolly Parton is known as much for her business acumen as her song-writing skills Even when she's talking about cold, hard cash, Dolly Parton manages to seem down to earth.She's promoting her new children's album "I Believe in You" and is in top, self-deprecating form, talking to the BBC."It's hard for me to spend money on tonnes of stuff because I'm going to look the same, no matter what I wear.If I wear diamonds I'm still going to look like a rhinestone," she tells me.Still, if Dolly was inclined to buy diamonds, she could afford them.She's known as much for her business acumen as her song-writing skills.At the start of her career she took lessons from her dad, she says: "Even though he wasn't an educated man, he wasn't able to read and write, daddy had a great sense of business.Image caption Dolly Parton at Glastonbury - in the past year she's earned some $37m "He said, 'Don't let other people take advantage of you, keep your mind on your business.'So when I got into the music business I thought of it as a business."Early on she launched her own publishing company and hung on to the rights to her songs, and she says that other artists should do the same."As soon as you start making money, you should invest and get into other businesses that you can fall back on if you don't make it big, or if you make it big and you fall on hard times."That attitude has served her well over the years and continues to do so, according to Forbes magazine's Celebrity 100 list.It claims Dolly earned $37m (28m) in the year to June 2017, with most of this coming from her Pure and Simple concert tour and income from her Dollywood theme park in Tennessee.Image copyright Jason Davis Image caption Dolly visits Vanderbilt children's hospital in Tennessee Brian Warner, founder of website CelebrityNetworth.com, estimates her total fortune to be $500m (379m) but says this is conservative."We think that Dollywood alone is worth around $200m; $100m for the land itself and $100m for the brand - you could class it as an intangible asset."On top of that she makes a lot of money from touring and has had a 50-year career in which she's sold millions of records and has also written songs for other artists."Mr Warner says "I will always love you", a hit Dolly wrote and recorded in 1973, has made her more than $20m in total.He explains that although individual music contracts may vary, "as the writer of a song you might be keeping 50% of the revenue or more and as a writer and performer you could be getting 80%".Image copyright Wes Ramey for Dollywood Image caption The Barnstormer ride at Dollywood Dolly's own version of "I Will Always Love You" was a big commercial success, topping the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart twice, in 1974 and 1982.Whitney Houston made the song a hit all over again when she recorded a version for the 1992 film The Bodyguard.It was number one for 10 weeks in the UK charts and for 14 weeks in the US.The song had another resurgence in 2012 after Ms Houston's death.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: The proceeds from Dolly's latest album won't be adding to her fortune, though; instead they'll be going to the Imagination Library.Set up in 1995 it aims to improve child literacy by distributing free books to children in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia.Image copyright Keystone Image caption Dolly in London in 1977 Dolly says her own impoverished childhood in Tennessee inspired the library and has shaped her attitude to money in general."Being brought up poor means I don't take things for granted, and no matter how much money I make, I'll always count my blessings quicker and more often than I count my money.She has "always realised the value of a dollar", too."Even now if I go in a store it's hard for me to pay a huge amount of money for one item.I say 'good Lord', what could mummy and daddy have done with that!"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dolly's Imagination Library scheme provides books for children At 71 years old, Dolly's career has spanned more than five decades and following her Glastonbury performance in 2014 she's reached a whole new audience.So what's the secret of her longevity?"I think a lot of people can relate to me, because of my upbringing and because I'm from a big family.I think people see me as an aunt, an older sister or a cousin.I've been around so long I'm part of their family."Dolly will be hoping that this loyal fan base will support ambitious plans to expand her empire.The DreamMore hotel at Dollywood, opened in 2015, is "doing well" and she is thinking of franchising it.She'd also like to do more kids projects and launch a line of wigs, cosmetics and clothes."I've still got a lot to do...I'm going to be an old lady before I get it done but at least I'm going to be working till I fall over dead!"Dolly Parton is a force of nature and a tremendously successful one at that; it's hard to imagine her ever stopping.
Is this the most influential work in the history of capitalism?:::::Image copyright Alamy Image caption Renaissance mathematician Luca Pacioli is seen as the father of double-entry bookkeeping In 1495 or thereabouts, Leonardo da Vinci himself, the genius's genius, noted down a list of things to do in one of his famous notebooks.These to-do lists, written in mirror-writing and interspersed with sketches, are magnificent."Find a master of hydraulics and get him to tell you how to repair a lock, canal and mill in the Lombard manner.""Draw Milan.""Learn multiplication from the root from Maestro Luca."Leonardo was a big fan of Maestro Luca, better known today as Luca Pacioli.Pacioli was, appropriately enough, a Renaissance Man: - educated for a life in commerce, but also a conjuror, a chess master, a lover of puzzles, a Franciscan Friar, and a professor of mathematics.Today he is celebrated as the most famous accountant who ever lived.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.Pacioli is often called the father of double-entry bookkeeping, but he didn't invent it.The double-entry system - known in its day as "bookkeeping alla Veneziana," or "in the Venetian style" - was being used two centuries earlier, around 1300.The Venetians had abandoned as impractical the Roman system of writing numbers, and were instead embracing Arabic numerals.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Venice in the 1300s - when Marco Polo set off on his famous travels to the Far East - was already a sophisticated crossroads of trade and ideas They may have also taken the idea of double-entry book keeping from the Islamic world, or even from India, where there are tantalising hints that double-entry bookkeeping techniques date back thousands of years.Or it may have been a local Venetian invention, repurposing the new Arabic mathematics for commercial ends.Intricate transactions Before the Venetian style caught on, accounts were rather basic.Early medieval merchants were little more than travelling salesmen.They had no need to keep accounts - they could simply check whether their purse was full or empty.But as the commercial enterprises of the Italian city states grew larger, and became more dependent on financial instruments such as loans and currency trades, the need for a more careful reckoning became painfully clear.We have a remarkable record of the business affairs of Francesco di Marco Datini, a merchant from Prato, near Florence, who kept accounts for nearly half a century, from 1366 to 1410.They begin as little more than a financial diary, but as his business grew more complex, he needed something more sophisticated.Image copyright Alamy Image caption We can see how Datini tracked his increasingly intricate financial transactions Late in 1394, Datini orders wool from Mallorca.Six months later the sheep are shorn.Several months after that, 29 sacks of wool arrive in Pisa, via Barcelona.The wool is coiled into 39 bales.Of these, 21 go to a customer in Florence and 18 go to Datini's warehouse, arriving in 1396, over a year after the initial order.They are then processed by more than 100 separate subcontractors.Eventually, six long cloths go back to Mallorca via Venice, but don't sell, so are hawked in Valencia and North Africa instead.The last cloth is sold in 1398, nearly four years after Datini's original order.Fortunately, he had been using bookkeeping alla Veneziana for more than a decade, so was able to keep track of this extraordinarily intricate web of transactions.Enormous influence So what, a century later, did the much lauded Luca Pacioli add to the discipline of bookkeeping?Quite simply, in 1494, he wrote the book."Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita" was an enormous survey of everything that was known about mathematics - 615 large and densely typeset pages.Image copyright Stockholm University Library Amidst this colossal textbook, Pacioli included 27 pages that are regarded by many as the most influential work in the history of capitalism.It was the first description of double-entry bookkeeping to be set out clearly, in detail and with plenty of examples.Pacioli's book was sped on its way by a new technology: half a century after Gutenberg developed the movable type printing press, Venice was a centre of the printing industry.Symmetry and balance His book enjoyed a long print run of 2,000 copies, and was widely translated, copied, and plagiarised across Europe.Double-entry bookkeeping was slow to catch on, perhaps because it was technically demanding and unnecessary for simple businesses.But after Pacioli it was always regarded as the pinnacle of the art.Image copyright Alamy Image caption This 1585 woodcut shows a German merchant's accountant doing double-entry bookkeeping As the industrial revolution unfolded, the ideas that Pacioli had set out came to be seen as fundamental to business life.The system used across the world today is essentially the one that Pacioli described.Pacioli's system has two key elements.First, he describes a method for taking an inventory, and then keeping on top of day-to-day transactions using two books - a rough memorandum and a tidier, more organised journal.Then he uses a third book - the ledger - as the foundation of the system, the double-entries themselves.Every transaction was recorded twice in the ledger.If you sell cloth for a ducat, you must account for both the cloth and the ducat.The double-entry system helps to catch errors, because every entry should be balanced by a counterpart, a divine-like symmetry which appealed to a Renaissance Man.Practical tool It was during the industrial revolution that double-entry bookkeeping became seen not just as an exercise for mathematical perfectionists, but as a tool to guide practical business decisions.One of the first to see this was Josiah Wedgwood, the pottery entrepreneur.At first, Wedgwood, flush with success and fat margins, didn't bother with detailed accounts.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Josiah Wedgwood used the insight gleaned from detailed accounts to weather a severe recession But in 1772, Europe faced a severe recession and demand for Wedgwood's ornate crockery collapsed.His warehouses began to fill with unsold stock and workers stood idle.Wedgwood turned to double-entry bookkeeping to understand where in his business the profits were, and how to expand them.He realised how much each piece of work was costing him - a deceptively simple-sounding question - and calculated that he should actually expand production and cut prices to boost business.Others followed, and the discipline of "management accounting" was born - an ever-growing system of metrics and benchmarks and targets, that has led us inexorably to the modern world.More from Tim Harford: How the invention of paper changed the world The warrior monks who invented banking How the world's first accountants counted on cuneiform What tally sticks tell us about how money works But in that modern world, accounting does have another role.It's about ensuring that shareholders in a business receive a fair share of corporate profits - when only the accountants can say what those profits really are.Here the track record is not encouraging.Image copyright AFP Image caption Enron's collapse in 2001 was the biggest in US corporate history A string of 21st century scandals - Enron, Worldcom, Parmalat, and the financial crisis of 2008 - have shown us that audited accounts do not completely protect investors.A business may, through fraud or mismanagement, be on the verge of collapse.Yet we cannot guarantee that the accounts will warn us of this.Complacency Accounting fraud is not a new game.The first companies to require major capital investment were the British railways of the 1830s and 1840s, which needed vast upfront investment before they could earn anything from customers.Investors poured in, and when railway magnates could not pay the dividends that the investors expected, they simply faked their accounts.The entire railway bubble had collapsed in ignominy by 1850.Perhaps the railway investors should have read up on their Geoffrey Chaucer, writing around the same time as Francesco Datini, the merchant of Prato.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Accountancy did not protect Chaucer's Shipman character from an audacious con In Chaucer's Shipman's Tale, a rich merchant is too tied up with his accounts to notice his wife being wooed by a clergyman.Nor do those accounts rescue him from an audacious con.The clergyman borrows the merchant's money, gives it to the merchant's wife - buying his way into her bed with her own husband's cash - and then tells the merchant he's repaid the debt, and to ask his wife where the money is.Accountancy is a powerful financial technology - but it does not protect us from outright fraud, and it may well lure us into complacency.As the neglected wife tells her rich husband, his nose buried in his accounts: "the devil take all such reckonings!"Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
Will Australia's 'miracle economy' keep on winning?:::::Image copyright Getty Images It was the year Australia went to war in the Gulf, when Monica Seles and Boris Becker won tennis grand slams in Melbourne, and The Simpsons was first shown on Aussie television, while a swooning Bryan Adams was a hit with love-struck teenagers ("Look into your heart, baby").It was 1991, and the last time Australia tasted the bitter economic taste of recession, defined in these parts, at least, as two or more back-to-back quarters of negative growth in real gross domestic product, or the value of all services and goods.Since then, Australia has sidestepped the worst effects of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and its more destructive big brother that hammered global markets a decade or so later.Australia's economy - the "wonder down under" - has somehow dodged the unstoppable forces that sent other wealthy countries tumbling into reverse.For this, a nation of 24 million people must thank not only sound judgement by those in charge but also good fortune, according to Shane Oliver, chief economist at financial services company AMP in Sydney."I certainly don't see Australia as being a miracle," he says."It has had a bit of good luck and good management, but it would be dangerous to assume that it is never going to have a recession again."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Coal production helped the Australian economy stay afloat The economy is growing by about 1.9% per year, according to the Reserve Bank.In 2012, that figure was 3.7%.Weaker growth means that pay packets are shrinking for many workers when adjusted for the rising cost of living, and near-record levels of underemployment are stifling wage increases.In August, retail sales posted their biggest retreat in about four-and-a-half years, falling by 0.6%, with cafes and restaurants reporting declining turnovers.Period of transition?Rocks, coal and demand from China insulated this country from the global financial meltdown in 2008, as a red-hot mining industry delivered unprecedented wealth.Surging commodity prices fuelled the bonanza in Western Australia and Queensland, which propped up under-performing states in the south-east, where most Australians live.Shane Oliver says the situation has now "been turned on its head" and Australia is once again in transition.The mining boom has faded, but areas that once struggled have bounced back in part because of record low interest rates that have unleashed a frenzy into the housing market.Image copyright Getty Images Meanwhile, eye-watering wads of public money have poured into infrastructure projects, which are redefining parts of New South Wales, the most populous state.There was another critical factor that helped Australia to largely avoid the ravages of the global financial crisis - unprecedented spending by the Labor government that boosted public expenditure by a whopping 13% in an attempt to stimulate growth.It was a classic Keynesian economic manoeuvre to use billions of dollars to sustain household spending, demand and employment.Australia loves to win.Here international cricket matches are akin to "wars" and Olympic gold medals - or a lack thereof - are greeted with congratulatory back-slapping - or hand-wringing.If there was a podium for economic success, this is a country that would be bending forward to accept the award.More than 25 years of uninterrupted growth is a remarkable achievement, although there is debate about the competition.Some commentators believe the recent economic prosperity enjoyed by the Netherlands lasted for (only) 22 years, putting it firmly into silver medal position behind the Aussies.Right place, right time Tim Harcourt, an economics fellow at the University of New South Wales, believes Australia deserves the plaudits."This time the 'lucky country' made its own luck."The Hawke-Keating [government] reforms of the 1980s and 1990s - the currency float, tariff changes, and embrace of Asia - set up us up for a quarter of a century of growth."Australia found itself in the right place at the right time and embraced the Asia century," he argues.Image copyright Getty Images But as the economy has soared, some Australians have been left behind.At almost 13%, youth unemployment is more than twice the national average.Labouring work had left 21-year-old Mohammad Al-Khafaji, the son of an Iranian refugee, with endless back pain and homelessness soon followed."I was just trying to apply for jobs online, and then people were just putting me down saying 'you are never going to get that job', so I just stopped trying," he says.'Muddling along' Mohammad is now employed by a hire car company in Sydney, and has ambitions to one day be the boss.He works with Shiv Dhingra, an Indian migrant from Punjab.They are proof that much of Australia's economic might is down to immigration."I am the only one working in my family," Shiv explained."I am the main financial support they have.I am working seven days a week for the last year.I've got plans for my own business."Image copyright Charity Bounce Image caption Charity Bounce runs sessions in partnership with professional athletes Both young men were helped by Charity Bounce, a Sydney-based non-profit organisation that uses basketball to reach out to the disadvantaged and long-term unemployed, who, according to chief executive, Ian Heininger, also deserve a slice of Australia's prosperity."We find a lot of the young people are desperate to find work," he says, "desperate to find an opportunity that is going to get them into a place where they are contributing back to the world."But will they be part of an ever-expanding economy?Mr Oliver thinks Australia's luck will eventually run out, but not for a while."The Aussie economy is probably going to continue muddling along, not fantastically strong as housing slows and consumer spending remains a bit weak," he predicts."We are probably going to go for at least another few years before we have that recession some people say is inevitable."
How can you help your local online business go global?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Online shopping has become a $2.3tn global business In 1995, someone sold a broken laser pen for $14 on a site called AuctionWeb.This was the rather inauspicious start for online shopping, an activity that now generates a colossal $2.3tn (1.75tn) in global sales.But these days, shoppers want to pay in any number of ways and this can cause headaches for retailers wanting to expand abroad; so what should they do?Nigel Whiteoak is the co-founder of LoveCrafts, a virtual hub for knitting and crochet enthusiasts to share their creations and buy supplies.Having a website rather than a bricks-and-mortar shop meant the team could sell their wares to the world.But taking payments for these international sales wasn't proving straightforward."One of the biggest realisations we had when looking to expand was that credit card penetration is generally much lower in most markets outside the UK and US," he explains."In Germany, open invoices are very common where you process the payment using a third party, deliver the goods directly to the customer, and then they pay that third party once we have delivered their crafts.Image copyright LoveCrafts Image caption LoveCrafts founder Nigel Whiteoak says selling abroad has significantly boosted sales "Whereas in Brazil and Turkey they tend to use local credit cards and pay in instalments."These regional quirks were difficult to cater for.But then he came across a Dutch payment company, Adyen, whose payment processing platform harnesses machine learning to customise the payment method depending on which country the buyer is in.Adyen's clients include heavyweights such as Netflix, Uber and Spotify, so Mr Whiteoak was surprised to find out how affordable its service was, with a minimum monthly invoice of $100 (75) and transparent per-transaction processing and commission charges."Before we started selling outside of the UK we had a turnover of around 6.5m," he says."Last year we posted 10.9 million, and with the bulk of our sales coming from overseas, this growth is directly linked to our ability to offer local payment methods."Sales have grown 125% over the last three years, he says, proving that knitting and crochet is big business.Image copyright LoveCrafts Image caption LoveCrafts has found that people in different countries like to pay in different ways Payment difficulties contribute to about 15% of online shoppers abandoning their virtual shopping baskets before completing the purchase, research suggests.That and difficult-to-navigate, fiddly websites.Research from Barclaycard finds that while customers demand faster, more innovative and mobile-friendly ways to pay, the reality is one of declined cards, verification delays and annoying hidden transaction fees."Remove the need for consumers to set up an account first," advises Greg Liset, Barclaycard's head of small business, "and partner with suppliers that have reliable payment systems that work first time."Also, with online cross-border sales expected to soar over the next few years, being able to offer multiple currencies is essential."Knowing what payment options locals prefer is crucial to e-commerce success.Research from 2Checkout finds that in the US, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and American Express still dominate the payments landscape.But in other countries different favourite payment methods have emerged.For example, in China Alipay now accounts for 54% of online sales.In the Netherlands the iDEAL payment system is used for 44% of sales.In Japan, JCB and Konbini are popular.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Shoppers in different countries have their own favourite ways of paying But in India many shoppers still prefer paying in cash.So Indian start-up BookMyTrain is aiming to simplify the online purchase of rail tickets by offering a cash-on-delivery payment option with its app, as many people in India don't have payment cards.It is also using chatbots to take customers through the booking process one step at a time.Simon Johnson, general manager at software provider Freshworks, the firm providing the chatbots for BookMyTrain, says: "Most customers today use messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger because they like how you can keep a conversation going with whatever device they are using."You don't have to be a massive company to personalise the experience more effectively and [smaller] retailers need to have that personal touch to compete with big e-commerce players."Other payment platforms besides Adyen helping online retailers sell globally with tailored experiences include 2Checkout (formerly Avangate), PayU, PayPal, Stripe and Braintree.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Costs are usually transparent and related to sales volume.With PayPal, for example, retailers can expect to pay 2.9 % of the transaction value plus about 23p per order.Similarly, Stripe doesn't charge extra for accommodating different cards or currencies with a flat rate of 1.4% plus 20p per transaction.But selling abroad isn't just about offering flexibility over ways to pay and support for multiple currencies, it's also about understanding local customs and cultures, argues Nir Debbi, co-founder of e-commerce platform Global-e. "A common pitfall for businesses marketing themselves abroad is a lack of awareness of the different cultural phenomena," says Mr Debbi.Planning for international shopping events such as Singles Day in China or Japan's "lucky shopping bags" at New Year "can improve international conversion rates dramatically", he says, "but you need the insight, local knowledge and access to these sales peaks to be able to plan and apply an appropriate strategy."Later in this e-commerce series we'll explore the best ways for online businesses to market themselves.
Milwaukee Bucks aim to bounce back on and off NBA court:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo is an emerging star in the NBA What has historically made Milwaukee famous has been its beer and its motorcycles, but now NBA basketball side, the Bucks, is also hoping to fly the flag for the US city.Although the team situated on the western shore of Lake Michigan has picked up just one NBA national title, in 1971, in its 50th season it is now hoping to transform its fortunes.The club has wealthy owners in the shape of New York hedge fund billionaires, and has one of the top young players in Giannis Antetokounmpo.It has also signed a groundbreaking shirt sponsorship deal with Harley-Davidson, and as the current regular season gets under way it is moving into a new stadium.As well as being specifically designed for basketball and offering a better fan experience, the Wisconsin Entertainment and Sports Center stadium will also host music and entertainment events.And the playing season has got off to a bright start, with victory in the opening game over Boston Celtics.Championship dream "Our aims are sporting and financial," Bucks president Peter Feigin, who has previously worked in the theme park and executive jet industries, tells me.Image copyright Milwaukee Bucks Image caption The Wisconsin Entertainment and Sports Center stadium is due to open in August 2018 "Our owners are very motivated about the team winning on the court, and also about growing the business to be one of the best in US sport."At present the club is closer to breaking-even financially rather than making a profit, but it is hoped playing success can bring wider brand exposure and enhanced commercial revenues.Meanwhile, the new venue where the club will be the main leaseholder will also bring in increased match day income through executive boxes and improved catering.The team has high hopes for the season ahead.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Milwaukee Bucks (green) won their opening match against the Boston Celtics 108-100 "There are four rounds of play-offs, we got to the first round last year and the expectation is to go at least one round better this time," says Mr Feigin, a former head of marketing for the New York Knicks NBA team."It is achievable - we are in the Eastern Division, which is not as strong as the Western Division, and if we are healthy for the season and have no injuries we will do great."He adds: "We are in these games to win a championship; it is all directed towards ultimately winning a championship."'International appeal' Central to any playing success is up-and-coming star Giannis Antetokounmpo, a 22-year-old born in Athens to Nigerian immigrant parents."We have the most-emerging star in the NBA, he is already in the top seven of uniform sales, and had tens of millions of video views," says Mr Feigin."He has gone from 'recognised' to superstar in less than 12 months.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Giannis Antetokounmpo sports a shirt with the fans' chant: Fear the deer "We have been able to grow our European appeal and our Asian appeal via Giannis."And the potentially exciting nature of the team has seen the Bucks double the number of live TV games they will be involved in this season, from nine to 18."That will be big for us not only on viewing impressions, but big for the brand too," adds Mr Feigin, who prior to joining the Bucks three years ago worked for Six Flags Theme Parks in the US.He was also previously president and chief operating officer of Marquis Jet, where he was the driving force behind Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway's NetJets acquisition of Marquis in 2010.Image copyright Milwaukee Bucks Image caption NBA rules allow teams to sign shirt sponsors for three years Mr Feigin says Milwaukee as at a city is at an "inflection point" between its industrial heritage past and a newly-modernised future, something which also applies to its shirt sponsors for the next three years - local motorbike brand Harley-Davidson."Harley are trying to reposition themselves for the next generations, and the NBA can help them do that," he says."They want to reach a young, diverse, more international market."Public funding Mr Feigin has been in London this month meeting to publicise the new stadium, pitching it as "a must-play for sports and entertainment" which will host 200 major events a year.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Post-industrial Milwaukee is in the midst of regeneration The $524m (395m) arena is a public-private partnership, with just over half the cash coming from hedge-fund club owners Marc Lasry, Wes Edens and Jamie Dinan, as well as $250m in public funding."It was very challenging to get this approved; especially at at time when there have been questions about the economy, and debates around healthcare and education," admits Mr Feigin."But a professional sports team can bring in much more than the stadium outlay, through income tax and sales tax."Image copyright Alamy Image caption Kareem Abdul-Jabbar led Milwaukee to their only title success in 1971 He says in return for that $250m outlay, the venue will help bring in more than $1bn over 15 years for the state."The stadium will also create a ripple effect in increasing nearby commercial and residential values," he adds.Bucks season-ticket holders and members will be offered deals on entertainment tickets.Conversely, it's hoped music fans will enjoy the stadium experience enough to come back for a Bucks game.Naming rights Building work began on the new stadium last June, with the club due to move into its new home on Labor Day weekend next year - the first weekend of September."The current venue was not built around basketball as the lead sport, but for ice hockey," says Raj Saha, the arena's general manager, and formerly on the management team of the O2 in London.Image caption Mr Feigin and Mr Saha have been in London to get support for the new stadium "The viewing sight lines where we currently play are not ideal for basketball," says Mr Saha, with only one third of the seats close to the action.The club is looking for six to eight long-term founding commercial partners for the new stadium, paying around $2m a year.Those who have signed up include multi-industrial firm Johnson Controls and bank BMO Harris.The search is on for a stadium naming rights partner, which would pay about $7m a year for 20 years."We are still looking for a naming rights partner.We would have loved to have finalised it by now but are in negotiations with a number of potential partners," says Mr Saha.Image copyright Populous Image caption The new stadium will host a variety of non-basketball entertainment As well as music acts, the arena will also host attractions such as UFC martial arts, boxing, Disney on Ice, and other events."We have an idea of how the first four weeks will look," says Mr Saha."Opening night is important and we'll go big for that, but the first 100 days will also be very important, too, to creating a success story."
The Chinese blockage in the global waste disposal system:::::Image copyright European Photopress Agency Image caption In Hong Kong, 2,500 tonnes of waste paper are piling up at its docks every day Imagine the world as a global waste disposal system.Now imagine it with a blockage.And what if that waste is backing up around the world, reappearing in places where you really don't want it to be.That blockage is about to happen in China and the flood is going to start seeping out into waste disposal operations around the world.Three months ago, China decided to ban 24 different grades of rubbish as part of its "National Sword" campaign against foreign garbage.Until now China has been importing millions of tonnes of the world's waste every year to feed its recycling industry.The Bureau of International Recycling China estimates that China last year imported 7.3 million tonnes of plastic scrap from Europe, Japan and USA, and 27 million tonnes of waste paper.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China's action in halting various categories of waste imports will hit recycling around the world Robin Wiener, president of the US-based Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, said: "More than 155,000 direct jobs are supported by the US industry's export activities, earning an average wage of almost $76,000 and contributing more than $3bn to federal, state, and local taxes."A ban on imports of scrap commodities into China would be catastrophic to the recycling industry."The new restrictions have yet to be agreed by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and China could still change its mind, but the waste is already starting to back up.In Hong Kong, 2,500 tonnes of waste paper are piling up at its docks every day.Easy option For China the problem is simply one of pollution.Its submission to the WTO reads: "We found that large amounts of dirty wastes or even hazardous wastes are mixed in the solid waste that can be used as raw materials.This polluted China's environment seriously."Image copyright Jamie Robertson Image caption Mike Baxter says sending waste overseas was the easy option Western recyclers admit that China has been a cheap and easy waste bin for their industry.In theory the rubbish from your recycling rubbish bin is meant to be treated or sorted before it goes in the container overseas, but the rules have too often been ignored and rarely enforced.Mike Baxter, external affairs director at the recycler RPC Group, says: "The easiest option for years has been put it into a container and send it overseas where the labour is cheaper and it can be sorted by hand."But with the ban expected to come into full effect by the new year, if not before, the UK industry has written urging the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to help with the expected overflow.Even so, Robin Latchem, editor of the recycling industry magazine MRW believes the recyclers are not spelling out the problems loudly enough, and says: "Why no mention of growing domestic stockpiles of waste and the danger of more fires or incidents of waste crime?"I don't think it is scare-mongering to set out such fears, along with concern that public perception of the recycling industry in its widest sense will be heavily scarred by greater fly-tipping, larger-scale dumping and more plumes of heavy black smoke crossing housing estates."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Western recyclers admit that China has been a cheap and easy waste bin for their industry No minister from Defra was available for comment, but a spokesman told the BBC: "We are aware of this situation and are looking into the potential implications."Opportunities But there is flip side to the problem - an opportunity for the recycling industry.In the UK for example, a lot of the waste is high quality, such as off-cuts from plastic manufacturing and plastic bottles that have failed quality tests but can be reprocessed.That presents "a great opportunity", says David Wilson commercial manager of Vanden Recycling, a Hong Kong-based company with a new plastics recycling operation in Peterborough, in the UK."China has voluntarily given up a six million tonne a year industry.We'll be selective about it and we'll go for materials we understand and markets we understand, but some of that lost capacity will be rebuilt here," he says.Image copyright Jamie Robertson Image caption Vanden Recycling's David Wilson says the China ban creates new opportunities Low quality waste is a different matter, however, and it requires some drastic rethinking of the whole supply chain.As waste begins to back up through the system, like any commodity in oversupply, it loses value.In the UK, for example, local authorities have been able to generate useful income from selling that waste on to the recyclers.That income is going to fall sharply.Andrew Bird, chairman of the UK's Local Authority Recycling Advisory Committee (LARAC) says as demand from China disappears, other markets are emerging, especially in India and wider Asia.Nevertheless, "there is going to be a little bit of pinch point, to say the least, and that will have an effect on price - that's the biggest risk for local authorities".New technologies One answer to tackling the global oversupply of low quality waste is the development of new technologies.Recycling Technologies has developed a method of recycling the most unappetising mix of dirty plastic into something it calls Plaxx, a fuel oil which can be used for myriad applications, including as a source for new recycled plastic.Image copyright Jamie Robertson Image caption Adopting new technologies is one long-term solution, says Adrian Griffiths Adrian Griffiths, the company's chief executive, admits there's no shortage of "feedstock" - the term for all the raw material that feeds the process."We chemically recycle plastic.We take it back to the original material so it can become more plastic again: plastic, back to oil, and back to plastic again.Anything that goes to landfill currently is feedstock for us, and since the recycling figures are so low the vast majority of the plastic we want is not in recycling use anyway."Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: But tackling the global back-up of waste after China's changes will require investment.Surprisingly, it is waste paper recycling that can cost the most.A plastics recycling plant could require a 5m ($6.5m) investment to get it up and running, says Simon Ellin, chief executive of the Recycling Association.But a paper mill could cost up to 500m.However, RCP's Mr Baxter says investors are not going to step in unless there is a market for recycled goods, and he believes governments have a role to play."It's not just a case of recycling the material.It's having markets for the recyclates that are produced, and this is where government could come in."In the UK, he would like to see the government push local authorities and all government institutions to purchase recycled products.For Mr Bird, from LARAC, responsibility for tackling the long term problems of waste must lie throughout the global product supply chain, but especially with manufacturers.And he says one particular change could have a dramatic effect - the widespread adoption of Extended Producers' Responsibility."It means producers having to pay to ensure the products they are manufacturing can be dealt with in an effective, and environmentally cost-effective way."Meanwhile, the waste is piling up and the clock is ticking.Listen to Jamie Robertson's report on China's ban on waste imports here on BBC World Service's World Business Report programme.
The winemaker who battles temperatures as low as -25C:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How the wines of Canadian winemaker Norman Hardie are winning fans around the world.With winter temperatures regularly dipping below -25C at his vineyard, winemaker Norman Hardie definitely didn't choose an easy place to grow his grapes."Minus 25 is the absolute death knell for vitis vinifera [the common grape vine], we actually have to bury our vines in the winter [to protect them].It's a huge job," says the 51-year-old."And then we can get snap spring frosts that can quickly ruin a crop.We lost more than 80% in 2015."While most of us associate winemaking with warm countries, Mr Hardie has since 2004 been making wine in Canada.Image copyright Johnny C Y Lam Image caption Norman Hardie Winery is currently continuing with its 2017 harvest Based in picturesque Prince Edward County, Ontario, a two-hour drive east of Toronto alongside Lake Ontario, the summers are more often glorious.The winters, on the other hand, are harsh, which means that the team at Norman Hardie Winery face a race against the cold weather every November."I have 80,000 plants today, so that is almost a quarter of a million canes [the vine's branches] that we have to tie down by hand, and then cover with a mound of earth," says Norman."Before we then carefully open up and untie in the spring."If that wasn't labour intensive enough, come April and May Norman and his team have to light fires and position wind turbines to try to drive away late frosts.But sometimes, such as in 2015, they just aren't that successful.Image copyright Johnny C Y Lam Image caption Norman Hardie says that Canada's cool weather helps him to make excellent wine Up against such challenges, you might question why Norman ever chose to plant vineyards and build a winery in Ontario.He says that despite the challenges, the combination of cool weather and the clay and limestone soil of Prince Edward County allow him to make world class wines."The great wines are always made on the edge, and we're certainly on the edge," says South African-born Norman, who prior to going into winemaking had been a sommelier (wine waiter) in Toronto."I'd rather be here than anywhere else in the world because the flavours we get out of these soils are unique."Image copyright Norman Hardie Winery Image caption While many wine regions around the world have cold winters, they aren't as cold as Canada's Primarily making white wines from chardonnay and red wines from pinot noir, Norman Hardie's wines now have a cult following in Canada, and are even said to be the favourite tipples of Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau.But from day one, Norman - who studied winemaking in Burgundy, Oregon, California, South Africa, and New Zealand prior to establishing his own winery - wanted his wines to be sold internationally.This brought his next big challenge - how to persuade a sceptical world to take Canadian wine seriously, when even Norman admits that 30 years ago the country made "terrible wine".Image caption Canadian wine production remains a drop in the global ocean Norman's solution was to turn himself into a travelling salesman, and build up his wine's global reputation "one top sommelier one top buyer, and one top wine journalist, at a time flying around the world, pounding the pavement, speaking to people, changing people's ideas about Canada".So attending wine fairs, visiting wine importers, and knocking on the doors of Michelin-star restaurants, he started to slowly build up export orders.This is the first feature of a new 20-week series called Connected Commerce, which highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.Focusing particularly on the UK and New York, Norman says his personal, face-to-face approach enabled him to let some of the most influential people in the global wine world "understand what we're doing, why we're doing it, and how we are doing it".He adds: "You can only do that with face time, and once you have them they are your evangelists."From selling 6,000 bottles in 2004, Norman Hardy Winery produced 240,000 in 2016.From that 6,804 bottles were exported across eight countries - China, Denmark, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, Taiwan, the UK, and the US.And he still is regularly overseas promoting his wines, including spending five to six days every year in the UK.Back at the winery, there are now six year-round employees, rising to 50 in the busy summer months and at harvest time in late September and October.The business now has annual revenues of 4.1m Canadian dollars ($3.3m; 2.5m).John Downes, a London-based wine expert, who has the top master of wine qualification, says that Norman was right to recognise the fact that as Canada is such a little known wine region he had to do a lot of marketing work to "stand out" on the global stage.Image caption Prince Edward County is now home to 40 wineries Mr Downes adds: "A lot of people in wine don't tell stories, they say 'here's my wine what do you think about it?'."But they don't tell the story behind the wine, and that gives the picture of the wine to the consumer.Norman does that very well."While exporting wine is not without its challenges, such as the need to produce different labels for each country, Norman says that building up a vibrant export business has also boosted his sales in Canada.Now preparing to bury the vines for another winter, Norman says: "That credibility, that international credibility, says you're doing something right."

electric vehicles, and specifically the batteries that power them.The big push towards electric isn't just about industrial strategy, it's about trying to tackle China's immense pollution problems - the most obvious of which is dirty air.With incentives for infrastructure and aggressive quota demands for, mostly foreign, manufacturers, this is part and parcel of Beijing's effort to make China's economy less focused on government investment and cheap exports - and instead to one that is technologically advanced, with a sustainable base and driven by consumer spending.So is a bad smell and worries about fumes a price worth paying for this progress, I ask Yanli?Yes it is, she intimates.The windows are firmly shut, though.Survival of the fittest Almost 3,000km (1,800 miles) away in Shenyang, taxi driver Mr Yu points to where the lead smelting plant used to stand, where he worked.It's long gone, replaced by car dealerships and apartment blocks.You can buy a Cadillac where he used to walk through the now demolished main gate.It's 15 years since he was laid off in the wave of liberalising economic reforms with compensation of just over a year's salary - about $5,000 (3,700).Despite the years he gets visibly emotional when I ask if there's any part of the city that's still recognisable from his time as a steel worker.He says he was "abandoned" by the government.There was no training for a new job, no support aside from the pay-off.But two children and a taxi licence later he's a believer in reforms that bring competition to the market place.Image caption Mr Yu was laid off from his job as a worker and now drives a taxi "I think the rule 'survival of the fittest' should apply", he says as we drive around, "baggage should be cast aside" he adds.But there is also this, "isn't it true that the people should be properly settled?"They know a lot about "settling" workers in Shenyang.It's the capital city in China's weakest performing province.Liaoning was once the manufacturing heartland.Now it's trying to rescue the towns and cities around the coal mines and steel plants that help make up this country's "rust belt" and is about to get its first privately owned bank, called the "revitalisation" bank.Away from car dealerships and the mega malls we go to Linsheng on Shenyang's outskirts.Food and rubbish is dumped in piles on its main street.One ground floor apartment in a housing estate has a home-made pigeon coop in a bay window.Parts of the building are decaying.It's home for the workers at the nearby coal mine.As China tries to tackle chronic over-capacity in its traditional industries it's also moving away from dirty coal to heat homes and power its economy.Many mines are being mothballed.A bus driver outside Linsheng's pink-painted community hospital tells me he used to do 17 trips to the mine every day, now it's just seven."A lot of people have retired but the company is not able to hire new employees - nobody wants to come because the salary is low."Image copyright AFP Image caption A construction site in Shenyang, the capital of China's weakest performing economic province As the sun goes down a woman who runs a fruit stall says her business had taken a 30% hit in the last two years, which she puts down to workers' salaries falling.The market boss claims people are buying pork and making it last for two or three days instead of buying daily.A retired miner, who like most of the people we talk to in Linsheng doesn't want to go in front of a microphone, says income for some is down 50%.Still growing So what of taxi driver Mr Yu's call for "survival of the fittest"?President Xi Jinping shows little sign of going that far.It looks like his government's early pledge to enhance market forces - giving them a "decisive role" has remained just that, a pledge.Thousands of factories have been closed but that's as much about their polluting effect than their productive inefficiency.There have been consolidations in various sectors of the myriad state-owned enterprises.The (almost all state-owned) banks have come in with debt for equity deals - something close to a bail out - for the most troubled companies.But there hasn't been a wave of bankruptcies.Preserving social stability is likely to be the main reason for this.A wave of concentrated unemployment could see protests that could threaten order.Indeed 2016 actually saw increased cheap credit and a boost in government spending.Rather than an assault on inefficient state-owned entities, many going, only with increased - and cheaper - debt.Still, the world's second largest economy continues to grow, at rates many in the developed world would envy; 6.7% last year, but the rate of growth is slowing, a plateau is approaching.Debt bubble?Debt and risk are the two things that some think will combine to produce an economic catastrophe in China - but not Mark Weinberger, the CEO of EY, one of the big four accountancy firms."I don't see an impending catastrophe," he says, when we met in Shanghai: "The growth is still there to be able to pay off debt".Such optimism is perhaps not surprising from a man who advises the mayor of China's second city.But Mr Weinberger warns nobody should be complacent: "When the debt gets so large it crowds out growth because of the cost of that debt - that becomes a problem".And China's debt is huge; it is currently about 260% of annual economic output and is predicted to rise.What makes it particularly worrisome is that the bulk of this is held by state-owned corporate entities.Risky practice has been growing too, particularly around the so called "shadow banking" sector.So much so that Beijing cracked down on the insurance market in particular, and went after some of China's best known private firms who were deemed too risky in the way they raised money.Image caption EY chief executive Mark Weinberger says he doesn't see "an impending catastrophe" Firms who owned or had stakes in New York's Waldorf Astoria, Deutsche Bank, Club Med and Wolves FC were all targeted.It's steadied the boat, but that appears all.Other far more significant reforms have not yet happened; financial market reforms, substantial rural land reform, changes to the internal passport-like hukou welfare system.One thing that is happening though is a deepening of the role of "the party" at the top of China's state firms.There were reports this summer that foreign owned firms or joint ventures have been asked to give the Communist Party equal say over their major corporate decisions.Xi Jinping faces a multitude of challenges in his country's economy as he embarks on his second term at the top.Strengthening the party's hold on the means of production is one of Beijing's responses.
From torture victim to human rights student:::::Image caption Noura Al Jizawi has come to study in Toronto after escaping Syria's civil war Noura Al Jizawi has survived more than a decade of extreme risk.Now she's going back to her interrupted life as a student.Growing up in Homs in Syria, the 29 year old has been a student activist, experienced imprisonment and exile and has been a leader in Syria's opposition.Now eight months pregnant, she has gone back to her studies, beginning a master's degree at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs.Noura's first awareness of human rights - and of their absence - came early: "I remember when I was just a kid, I was angry because we couldn't choose our notebooks."We could have only one type of notebook - one with a photo of Assad's father on it."Missing persons She soon learned that other, much worse things were wrong with her country.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Homs this summer showing the damage of war "Many of the students, a couple of years older than me, were mentioning their missing fathers.I became aware we had missing persons in Syria."While I was growing up, I remember hearing mothers supporting each other... they were the mothers of missing persons."Those guys were the detainees arrested by Assad's father in the 1980s.Some of them are still until this moment missing there were no bodies, there was nothing, just silence."Activism and arrests Noura came up against the regime as an undergraduate at the University of Homs - and reading books such as George Orwell's Animal Farm chimed deeply with her own experience.More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch.Noura's increasing activism, her work as a blogger, publishing imaginative allegorical fiction, and her readiness to speak out, led to two early arrests.Nevertheless she continued this dangerous work, accessing forbidden websites to distribute anti-regime articles, disseminating ideas of democracy and non-violent protest."We never believed there would be a real revolution in our lifetimes," she said.And then, in December 2010, the Arab Spring began in Tunisia, and spread rapidly, arriving in Syria with a demonstration in Damascus in March 2011.Image copyright Reuters Image caption A mother in Homs with a locket of her lost son "For me it was like a dream.We have a revolution."Noura was still in Homs, but was in touch with activists around the country, and abroad.She became an organiser of demonstrations and an advocate for the rapidly rising numbers of detainees.Social media In the response that followed, many of her friends were killed, many others imprisoned and tortured."To be honest we were not shocked, we knew too well that this regime would not allow people to demand their rights."They were more shocked, she said, by the lack of any effective response from the international community."We were saying, back in the 70s and 80s, when there were great massacres in Syria, there was no internet, there no media channels."But we thought, now we have the social media channels, hopefully this would protect us.But it did not protect us."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Noura's young life has been against a background of war: A fighter in Homs Noura moved from city to city, organising, motivating, dodging the authorities - until in May 2012, she was ordered off a bus in Damascus by armed men and bundled into a car."It was not an arrest, it was abduction, a kidnapping," she said.Tortured in prison Noura emerged seven months later.During that time she was detained in some of Syria's most notorious prisons, and said she had been tortured with electric shocks and beatings.She plays this down, saying that so many have endured - and are still enduring - far worse.For her the hardest experience to bear was hearing the sounds of her fellow-prisoners being tortured.Her captors realised this psychological torture would be more effective in her case - but still she remained silent.Noura explained how she survived: "I was not afraid for myself, I didn't care about myself...I cared only about the revolution I cared about the people who were still continuing this revolution outside."Image copyright Reuters Image caption Homs this summer showing the damage of war "We were still a non-violent movement on the ground... and I kept thinking about them...I wanted to make sure that in the questioning I would not speak about any one of those activists.I would pray to my body not to break down."Noura was released late in 2012, and believes that an international campaign played a part in this: "For sure, all of those activities protected me.That is why we need this advocacy, all the time, for all detainees and for missing persons."For Noura, the torment continued, as her younger sister, Alaa, had also been imprisoned and was suffering even worse: "They tortured her harder than me, many times, because of me."Alaa was released in a terrible physical state; the family decided they had to leave Syria, and fled to Turkey to get urgent medical treatment."She was my only reason to leave Syria," said Noura."Otherwise I would still be there."Image caption Noura became a representative in peace talks in Geneva In four years of exile in Turkey, she joined the coalition of Syrian opposition forces, (SNC) and became its vice-president in 2014, as well as being elected to sit on its negotiation panel in Geneva.She joined because she realised this much-criticised group of mainly male, middle-aged "hotel revolutionaries" needed "the blood of youth" and also a strong female voice.Geneva was a real challenge for Noura: "I felt I had to be calm and clever, I had do everything I could do, to interact."She worked hard to get an agreement to break the two-year siege of Homs.Many of its surviving citizens were dying of starvation.'Scholars at risk' Noura resigned from the coalition in 2016, but continued working for an NGO she had created, Start Point, which provides advocacy and psychological support to Syrian women who have suffered torture and sexual violence in detention.She had also met her husband in Turkey, another Syrian activist in exile, who was one of a network of cyber-security experts working for the Munk School's Citizen Lab; hence the Toronto connection.Noura came to Canada as one of 24 international students with scholarships in the university's "scholars at risk" programme.With her daughter due to be born next month, Noura is aware of how this might change her activism.But she's determined not to give up the fight.She sees the master's degree as another step to help her continue her work to bring democracy to Syria."I feel also that being a mother makes me closer to the future... this baby is the future, and maybe will not have to live as our generation live."
From sweets to furniture: The secrets of selling online:::::Image copyright Geoff Pugh Image caption Lavinia Davolio says selling her luxury sweets on Amazon Marketplace has been good for business What are the best ways to sell online?And how do you make sure you have a website that really works?Part one in our eight-part series exploring all things e-commerce.Lavinia Davolio makes luxury handmade sweets inspired by her Italian heritage.She says her business received a boost when she opened a store on Amazon's Marketplace."It's easy for clients to discover something unique and handmade if it's available through such a trusted online platform," she says."And it means we can offer convenient next day delivery at a competitive price and give our boutique confectionary an incredible reach and visibility."Lavinia is one of thousands of small businesses who've decided to set up shop on an e-commerce marketplace - Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Alibaba's Taobao, Rakuten to name some of the largest - rather than go through the hassles of setting up their own websites.Amazon charges retailers a 15% commission, but in return even the very smallest entrepreneurs can get a slice of the retail titan's global pulling power just by uploading images and descriptions of their products and then setting their pricing.For an additional fee, Amazon will store and dispatch your goods - the kind of one-stop convenience that is ideal for newbies, suggests Alan Braithwaite, a visiting professor at Cranfield School of Management.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Despite the convenience of online shopping, people still love the physical store "Something like Amazon Marketplace is a no-brainer," he says."Entry costs are very low and straightaway you have a very wide marketplace at your fingertips."When you're starting out with your own website you're having to attract the traffic, which means a lot of search engine optimisation [SEO].This can be complicated and mean extra costs if you need outside help."Some e-tailers want more creative control over their online shops, however - and to keep more of the sales income for themselves.Going it alone is certainly a lot cheaper than it used to be, but according to payment processor WorldPay, the average small business spends 2,500 on setting up an e-commerce platform.At its most basic this will cover product display and listing, navigation structure, a shopping cart facility, search features and secure payment gateways - a checklist that swells with business growth.DIY website providers such as Wix, Weebly and SquareSpace, help the technical novice with design templates and SEO support from as little as $4.50 (3.40) a month.And these days, off-the-shelf "software-as-a-service" add-ons can give a basic website selling and fulfilment functionality that "means you can be online and trading for as little as 500," says Prof Braithwaite.But "cheap isn't always best," he warns."It's your front window so it can be worth spending a bit extra - around 5,000 on a developer."And Clare Jackson, founder of e-tailer The Wooden Furniture Store, points out that you have to be prepared to improve and adapt your website constantly or risk losing sales.You can't pay your set-up fee then sit back and relax.Image copyright The Wooden Furniture Store Image caption Clare Jackson says she had to adapt her website's content for mobile screens When they discovered that most customers were coming to their website from mobiles, they had to completely rethink the design."With mobile users likely to be on slower connections it's crucial to get more speed into the user experience, so we introduced image optimisation and a content delivery network."This adapts content to the sizes of screen and devices being used, meaning that the images load much quicker."A fast website loading speed is crucial for e-commerce success.Research by application performance company, Apica, finds that 40% of online shoppers refuse to wait more than 10 seconds for a website to respond.The website change cost just $200 but has contributed to a 500% hike in sales from mobile and a 230% upturn in mobile visitors, says Ms Jackson."As a small business, we combine our agility with the kind of technologies which just a few years ago would have been unaffordable for someone our size," she says.Image copyright Iffley Road Image caption Wife-and-husband team Claire Kent and Bill Byrne moved their running wear business to Shopify Claire Kent and Bill Byrne, the husband-and-wife team behind luxury running wear, Iffley Road, found that replacing their bespoke website with the "easy and intuitive" e-commerce platform, Shopify, made a big difference to their online business.They liked the fact that they were no longer reliant on a third party but could make changes to the site themselves in minutes.Ms Kent, a former Morgan Stanley equity analyst who had never used Facebook or Twitter before, and who admits to being "completely untechnical", says she has found analysing customer data surprisingly straightforward using Shopify.A range of tools gives her data on purchase frequency, customer lifetime value, gross margins and net profit - insights she credits with doubling sales."It's like I've suddenly got glasses on whereas before I was blind," she says."I'd say to anyone that you really need to be looking at analytics every day as you learn so much."More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images She advises retailers to accept that a website will need to evolve with customers' changing expectations."Many SMEs prioritise aesthetics over function; you can have a site that looks amazing but if you don't have the right platform then it just isn't going to deliver."Listening to feedback and acting on it is also crucial, argues Prof Braithwaite."Get friends and families to transact on [your website] and listen to feedback, making sure that payment is secure and seamless is an absolute priority; customers won't come back if this isn't right.""Fail fast, fail often" may be the mantra amongst the technology giants in Silicon Valley, but it is also apt for online retail entrepreneurs.You have to make mistakes, learn from them, and adapt quickly to achieve success in this global online marketplace.The next feature will look at the best way to take payments and market your online shop.
Can these beads stop 'history's biggest mass poisoning'?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A handful of these resin beads can save lives The beads of resin may not look like much but they could save hundreds of thousands of at-risk people in Bangladesh and parts of India.Human Rights Watch says up to 20 million people are at risk from arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh.Millions have already suffered from what the World Health Organisation calls "the biggest mass poisoning in human history".Millions of "tube-wells" have been dug across Bangladesh since the 1940s.The simple pumps were rolled out across the country by the government and NGOs from the 1970s onwards as a way of delivering cost-effective bacteria-free water.However during the 1980s cases of arsenic poisoning began to emerge.Arsenic can not be seen or smelt; the first signs of its impact are skin lesions which only emerge once the poisoning has taken place.The poisoning can set off a range of heart diseases and cancer and the external symptoms look a lot like leprosy, which can lead to victims and their families being shunned by the local community.A heavy price Image caption Siaton Nessa says arsenic poisoning has ruined her life and affected her family as well Siaton Nessa Meherpur has lesions on her skin from arsenic poisoning.She's in her mid-50s and she says the disease has blighted her entire family."Because of this well my whole skin is filled with black patches," she says."I am worried about my children because no one is prepared to marry them."While the government has made efforts to replace the wells, in many rural areas they are still the primary source of water especially as many families have dug their own tube wells.Human Rights Watch estimate 43,000 people die each year in Bangladesh from illnesses caused by arsenic poisoning.New solutions Image caption Minhaj Chowdhury's Drinkwell is offering an "entrepreneurial solution" to the water crisis Minhaj Chowdhury, 28, was raised in the United States but visited family in Bangladesh during school holidays."It shocked and deeply saddened me to think how we never had to worry about water being fatal in the US but here in Bangladesh one in every five deaths was associated with unsafe drinking water," Mr Chowdhury says.After his grandfather died due to a disease linked to water he decided to take action.The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators.In 2013 he founded Drinkwell, in partnership with Dr Arup K SenGupta who invented a particular type of resin technology and had already been active in implementing it in India.The resin removes arsenic and other harmful substances from water and once it has been used Drinkwell filters the water through a series of other tanks to take out other harmful substances.The water is sold locally by "Drinkwell" entrepreneurs and the money raised is used to maintain the system.The pricing is set depending on location but a monthly subscription costs anywhere between $0.05 (4p) and $0.12 for 20 litres (4.4 gallons) a day.Entrepreneurial opportunity According to the United Nations, 30% to 50% of all water projects fail after huge investments because of a failure to maintain the facilities.Image caption Drinkwell entrepreneur Habibur Rehman's plant in Manikganj, Bangladesh sells 150,000 litres a day Dr Khairul Islam, the country director for the charity Water Aid in Bangladesh' believes that social entrepreneurs have a role to play in tackling the arsenic poisoning.Dr Islam told the BBC that the main problem so far has been operation and maintenance.Because Drinkwell includes operational and maintenance costs at the centre of its model he says it is the kind of model "this country needs".The first Drinkwell plant began dispensing water in the Manikganj district in 2015.Today that one plant alone has 750 daily customers and dispenses 150,000 litres a day.The network has grown across the country, often by going into schools to deliver safe drinking water for students' meals, from there the word spreads across communities.There are now 30 Drinkwell filtration plants in India and Bangladesh serving more than 100,000 people.Mr Chowdhury believes this is just the start for Drinkwell.He hopes to eventually reach hundreds of millions of people across Asia.He is already talking to the Bangladesh government about rolling out the technology across the country.By involving the communities in the maintenance through their entrepreneur network Mr Chowdhury believes the system can provide clean water "forever".
The 'working class boy' who built a £1bn business:::::Image copyright RationalFX Image caption Mr Davdra's wife recently treated him to a new Harley Davidson Paresh Davdra is thrilled about the brand new Harley Davidson waiting for him in a friend's garage.It's not a sign of a mid-life crisis, he insists, but a wedding present from his wife who he married in August.He just has one more test to pass to get his motorcycle licence, then he can hop on the bike and whizz around London for meetings.The boss and co-founder of money exchange firm Rational FX, which reported revenues of more than 1bn ($1.3bn) last year, has a life that's worlds apart from his parents and grandparents.They were forced to flee Uganda in 1972 when dictator Idi Amin gave the Asian population just 90 days to leave the country."They came to the UK with just 50 between them," says the softly-spoken Mr Davdra."My grandfather had his own tailoring shop, but they had to leave everything behind."His family pulled together and bought a house in Harrow, north London, with his dad securing a job as clerk, and later as a financial controller, at a foreign exchange broker.Image copyright RationalFX Image caption Paresh Davdra co-founded RationalFX in 2005 Their fighting spirit rubbed off on the younger Davdra."We were never really given anything - if I wanted something, I had to earn it."From the age of 16, he spent the school holidays holding jobs in a mobile phone shop and in telesales, while out of term at Middlesex University, he worked at his dad's firm, taking up roles from filing to working in compliance.He studied marketing and computer science at university, but tells me that technology does not come naturally to him."If you told my team I had this degree, they wouldn't believe you.I'm always the one calling IT to connect the laptop to the printer," he laughs.As soon as Mr Davdra graduated, in 2003, he joined his dad's company as a foreign exchange dealer, helping clients to buy and sell large quantities of foreign currencies.He was in the role for just over a year, working with Indian-born Rajesh Agrawal, a friend of his father's who had arrived in the UK in 2001.But two factors would spur him to quit."I'd tried to buy a property with my dad but the bank rejected the mortgage application," Mr Davdra says."It deflated me."Image copyright RationalFX Image caption RationalFX is based in Canary Wharf, London At the same time, Mr Agrawal resigned from his IT manager role."When he decided to quit, I badgered him.I asked him to tell me what he was doing," Mr Davdra says.The two met for coffee and quickly agreed they wanted to set up a company together.The idea was to support customers buying property abroad with their currency needs."Everything we were doing at the old firm was manual, but we thought we could offer the same service online," Mr Davdra says.However, the duo faced a serious challenge: money.Mr Davdra was only a year out of university and had already taken out a personal loan to buy a BMW.When Mr Agrawal took their business plan to the bank and asked to borrow 10,000, he was swiftly rejected.But he returned a few days later and asked for 20,000 to buy a car.The bank said yes."I then sold my BMW and we were set," says 37-year-old Mr Davdra, who also moved into Mr Agrawal's home to save on rent.Image copyright RationalFX Image caption Mr Davdra's grandfather had to flee Uganda in 1972 With just 32,000 between them, the pair launched their foreign exchange brokerage, RationalFX, in 2005.Like many start-ups, the next difficult task was signing up customers."We got on the phones and started pitching to estate agents and attended every property industry event there was," recalls Mr Davdra."We'd be in the office all day from 8am, then we'd just be at it in the evenings."Their big breakthrough came when they signed a number of estate agents who were selling properties in Dubai.However, just two years after launching, the financial crisis hit.Mr Davdra reflects candidly on how it changed his young mindset.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: "I was 27 at the time and the business was doing great guns, and I was well on my way to being rich.That's all I thought about it."It wasn't really about building a business - that comes with time and maturity.But the crash brought that along.It was a good learning curve."Rational FX also felt the fall-out from the crash, with its growth slowing.But it weathered the storm and went on to diversify.Today, its clients range from high-net worth individuals, either buying property or making investments, to medium-sized businesses, such as firms exporting cars or importing textiles.Image copyright RationalFX Image caption RationalFX employs 110 people It reported revenues of 1.3bn in 2016, up from 1.1bn the year before, and pre-tax profits of 2.3m - largely because the firm reinvested heavily in its business, Mr Davdra says.After enjoying success with Rational FX, the founders had an idea for an offshoot company - an online money transfer platform aimed at individuals sending lower sums to family overseas."We felt that Rational FX was driving revenues, but Xendpay [the new company] was more of a social initiative, to try and bring the costs of remittance down for people working hard to bring their families out of poverty."Xendpay has a "pay what you want" model, although it does suggest a minimum commission of 0.3-0.4% of the transaction.Mr Davdra says that more than 70% of users pay the suggested fee, 10% hand over more, and the rest pay nothing.The platform isn't profitable yet, although Mr Davdra expects it to break even next year."It was a bit of gamble but a risk we were willing to take."'Still growing' Last year Mr Agrawal stepped down from the firm after he was appointed Deputy Mayor of London for Business.He still owns 70% of the business, and is a non-executive director, while Mr Davdra holds the remaining shares.Mr Davdra says he "misses him"."Apart from business, over the last 12 years we have developed a good relationship.He's a very very close friend."For now, there are no plans to sell RationalFX, although private equity firms approach the firm "an average of twice a day"."Our brands are still growing and are quite young.It's all about the right opportunity," Mr Davdra says.Headquartered at Canary Wharf, RationalFX and Xendpay together employ 110 members of staff.Despite his penchant for expensive bikes and cars, Mr Davdra - who still lives in Harrow - has his feet firmly on the ground."I think we're pretty humble.We're working class, and we just do normal stuff.It's the way we've been brought up."
How the humble S-bend made modern toilets possible:::::Image copyright Alamy "Gentility of speech is at an end," thundered an editorial in London's City Press, in 1858."It stinks!"The stink in question was partly metaphorical: politicians were failing to tackle an obvious problem.As its population grew, London's system for disposing of human waste became woefully inadequate.To relieve pressure on cess pits - which were prone to leaking, overflowing, and belching explosive methane - the authorities had instead started encouraging sewage into gullies.However, this created a different issue: the gullies were originally intended for only rainwater, and emptied directly into the River Thames.That was the literal stink - the Thames became an open sewer.Image copyright Alamy Cholera was rife.One outbreak killed 14,000 Londoners - nearly one in every 100.Civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette drew up plans for new, closed sewers to pump the waste far from the city.It was this project that politicians came under pressure to approve.The sweltering-hot summer of 1858 had made London's malodorous river impossible to politely ignore, or to discuss obliquely with "gentility of speech".The heatwave became popularly known as the "Great Stink".Unlikely figure If you live in a city with modern sanitation, it's hard to imagine daily life being permeated with the suffocating stench of human excrement.For that, we have a number of people to thank - but perhaps none more so than the unlikely figure of Alexander Cumming.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.A watchmaker in London a century before the Great Stink, Cumming won renown for his mastery of intricate mechanics.King George III commissioned him to make an elaborate instrument for recording atmospheric pressure, and he pioneered the microtome, a device for cutting ultra-fine slivers of wood for microscopic analysis.Image copyright Alamy Image caption Alexander Cumming's S-bend was crucial in the development of the flushing toilet But Cumming's world-changing invention owed nothing to precision engineering.It was a bit of pipe with a curve in it.In 1775, Cumming patented the S-bend.This became the missing ingredient to create the flushing toilet - and, with it, public sanitation as we know it.Simplicity Flushing toilets had previously foundered on the problem of smell: the pipe that connects the toilet to the sewer, allowing urine and faeces to be flushed away, will also also let sewer odours waft back up - unless you can create some kind of airtight seal.Cumming's solution was simplicity itself: bend the pipe.Water settles in the dip, stopping smells coming up; flushing the toilet replenishes the water.While we've moved on alphabetically from the S-bend to the U-bend, flushing toilets still deploy the same insight.Image copyright Alamy Rollout, however, came slowly: by 1851, flushing toilets remained novel enough in London to cause mass excitement when introduced at the Great Exhibition in Crystal Palace.Use of the facilities cost one penny, giving the English language one of its enduring euphemisms for emptying one's bladder, "to spend a penny".Hundreds of thousands of Londoners queued for the opportunity to relieve themselves while marvelling at the miracles of modern plumbing.If the Great Exhibition gave Londoners a vision of how public sanitation could be - clean, and smell-free - no doubt that added to the weight of popular discontent as politicians dragged their heels over finding the funds for Joseph Bazalgette's planned sewers.More than 170 years later, about two-thirds of the world's people have access to what's called "improved sanitation", according to the World Health Organization, up from about a quarter in 1980.That's a big step forward.Economic cost But that still means two and a half billion people don't have access to it, and "improved sanitation" itself is a relatively low bar.It "hygienically separates human excreta from human contact", but it doesn't necessarily treat the sewage itself.Fewer than half the world's people have access to sanitation systems that do that.More from Tim Harford: What the dynamo reveals about technological revolution Battery bonanza: From frogs' legs to mobiles and electric cars How the lift transformed the shape of our cities How air conditioning changed the world The economic costs of this ongoing failure to roll out proper sanitation are many and varied, from health care for diarrhoeal diseases to foregone revenue from hygiene-conscious tourists.The World Bank's Economics of Sanitation Initiative has tried to tot up the price tag.Across various African countries, for example, it reckons inadequate sanitation lops one or two percentage points off gross domestic product (GDP), in India and Bangladesh over 6%, and in Cambodia 7%.That soon adds up.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Open sewers are a common sight in Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya The challenge is that public sanitation isn't something the market necessarily provides.Toilets cost money, but defecating in the street is free.'Positive externality' If I install a toilet, I bear all the costs, while the benefits of the cleaner street are felt by everyone.In economic parlance, that's a "positive externality" - and goods that have positive externalities tend to be bought at a slower pace than society, as a whole, would prefer.The most striking example is the "flying toilet" system of Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya.The flying toilet works like this: you defecate into a plastic bag, and then in the middle of the night, whirl the bag around your head and hurl it as far away as possible.Replacing a flying toilet with a flushing toilet provides benefits to the toilet owner - but you can bet that the neighbours would appreciate it, too.Contrast, say, the mobile phone.That also costs money, but its benefits accrue largely to me.That's one reason why, although the S-bend has been around for 10 times as long as the mobile phone, many more people already own a mobile phone than a flushing toilet.If you want to buy a flushing toilet, it also helps if there's a system of sewers to plumb it into, and creating one is a major undertaking - financially and logistically.Image copyright Otto Herschan Image caption Joseph Bazalgette, standing top right, views the Northern Outfall sewer being built below the Abbey Mills pumping station in 1862 When Joseph Bazalgette finally got the cash to build London's sewers, they took 10 years to complete and necessitated digging up 2.5 million cubic metres (88 million cubic ft) of earth.Because of the externality problem, such a project might not appeal to private investors: it tends to require determined politicians, willing taxpayers and well-functioning municipal governments.And those, it seems, are in short supply.According to a study published in 2011, just 6% of India's towns and cities have succeeded in building even a partial network of sewers.The capacity for delay seems almost unlimited.Geographical quirk London's lawmakers likewise procrastinated- but when they finally acted, they didn't hang about.As Stephen Halliday recounts in his book The Great Stink of London, it took just 18 days to rush through the necessary legislation for Bazalgette's plans.What explains this sudden, impressive alacrity?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Houses of Parliament, photographed in 1858, the year of the Great Stink A quirk of geography: London's Parliament building is located right next to the River Thames.Officials tried to shield lawmakers from the Great Stink, soaking the curtains in chloride of lime in a bid to mask the stench.But it was no use.Try as they might, the politicians couldn't ignore it.The Times described, with a note of grim satisfaction, how MPs had been seen abandoning the building's library, "each gentleman with a handkerchief to his nose".If only concentrating politicians' minds was always that easy.Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
What is happening with Japan Inc?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Japan's reputation for precision manufacturing is coming under more pressure Japan has long been held up as a shining example of integrity, assured quality and reliable products.But the deepening scandal at Kobe Steel over falsified figures could further tarnish the Made in Japan brand.Kobe's troubles started when it admitted last weekend to faking data about the quality, strength and durability of some of the materials it delivered to more than 200 companies including Boeing, Nissan and Toyota.On Friday it said the number of firms involved had risen to 500.The news has wiped out about $1.8bn (1.3bn) off Kobe Steel's market value this week.But with at least half a dozen major Japanese companies admitting to fraud and misconduct in as many years, questions are being raised over why this keeps happening and if there's a systemic problem in Japan.'Cutting corners' Experts say the long term slowdown in economic growth from the 1990s onwards has been a major contributing factor.It has forced Japanese firms to change their business models, and this appears to have taken its toll."Large corporations used to live in a stable, predictable and growing market, but things have changed and some companies may have resorted to cutting corners," says Takuji Okubo, managing director and chief economist of Japan Macro Advisors, in Tokyo.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kobe Steel's Hiroya Kawasaki apologised for the "tremendous trouble" the firm had caused Until two decades ago, Japanese firms were focussed on growth strategies but the realisation that their economy would no longer grow as strongly anymore meant companies had to concentrate on restructuring, cost-cutting and extreme efficiency.Speaking to the BBC, Martin Schulz, senior research fellow at Fujitsu Research Institute in Tokyo says these painful adjustments have seen some companies struggle "to adjust to the new rules of the game".The push to improve efficiencies made management desperate to show positive results, sometimes even testing the limits of quality control, he says.Mr Schulz adds core-employees and managers have been stretched to the limit, which in some cases, resulted in overwork and misconduct.But the need to open up new markets overseas to boost profits has created other problems for Japanese firms, especially at their subsidiaries abroad.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kobe Steel is Japan's third largest steelmaker Florian Kohlbacher, director of the Economist Corporate Network for North Asia, says some companies tried to grow too quickly by expanding overseas without having enough experienced managers to supervise operations.Detecting fraud The misconduct at Kobe Steel follows scandals at carmakers Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi Motors, as well as car airbag-maker Takata Corp, which filed for bankruptcy in June after a global recall sparked by 16 deaths and many injuries.Just two weeks ago, Nissan Motor recalled 1.2m vehicles that had been certified by unauthorised technicians.And the electronics giant Toshiba Corporation is still reeling from the consequences of an accounting scandal in which its profits were inflated.Despite the prevalence of such high profile cases, experts say quality and compliance remain paramount in Japan.But they still expect more scandals involving fraud and misconduct to be uncovered in future.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Manufacturers of cars, trains and planes are checking if they used sub-standard Kobe Steel materials Mr Kohlbacher says this is partly because new technology such as the internet of things and sensors have made it easier to detect wrongdoing, errors and fraud, while digitisation has helped to spread information about problems and improve transparency.While it is still unclear how the data tampering at Kobe Steel was uncovered, "in a more transparent corporate environment, companies have to come clean on mistakes and misconduct much earlier," says Mr Schulz.Expect more scandals Furthermore, more fraud and misconduct scandals are also expected to be uncovered as a result of laws to protect whistleblowers that came into effect in 2006.The most explosive case came to light five years later when Michael Woodford, the British president of Olympus, became the most senior corporate figure in history to blow the whistle on his own company.His revelations uncovered a $1.4bn (880m) accounting fraud scandal in which the Japanese medical and equipment firm hid investment losses dating back to the 1990s.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Quality control questions at Kobe Steel could further erode trust in Japanese firms Mr Kohlbacher says more people have reported wrongdoings since the laws were enacted but it is difficult to confirm exactly how many people have been able to use the legislation to raise the alarm about wrongdoing in their companies.And debate still rages in Japan on whether whistleblowers are adequately protected because the laws do not provide for penalties against companies that punish staff by dismissing or demoting them.Some argue there are further safeguards from wrongdoing provided by Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency, which opened in 2009.Image copyright Reuters Image caption The news has wiped out about $1.8bn off Kobe Steel's market value It was created following several accidents caused by substandard products and a number of food poisoning scandals including a case involving Chinese dumplings."Any manufacturer that had a defective product would once have been dealt with by a government ministry but the Consumer Affairs Agency took over these responsibilities," says Keith Henry from the consultancy firm Asia Strategy.Mr Henry adds that the new reporting system focuses much more on the consumer rather than the manufacturer, with regulatory authorities willing to investigate and prosecute cases of misconduct.Rebuilding the brand Some people believe the unwanted spotlight on Japanese firms could actually have a positive effect."There seems to be wide agreement now that just focusing on costs and increasing profitability won't be sufficient as future strategies," says Mr Schulz.Mr Kohlbacher says he now expects "companies to have a close look at their operations and make sure they amend any problems before they turn into something major".But some warn tougher penalties are needed for companies that fail to meet government standards because self-regulation does not always appear to work.Citing the recent Dentsu case last week in which the Japanese advertising giant was only fined 500,000 yen (US$4,400; 3,321) for breaching labour regulations, Mr Okubo says "I think there's something very wrong here."But rather than highlighting a systemic problem in Japan, Mr Okubo says the prevalence of misconduct cases was evidence that "corporate governance in Japan is working" because firms are reporting internal problems so that they can be dealt with.As for companies that want to distance themselves from the fraud and misconduct, he says: "It is about time that each manufacturer stops branding itself as 'Japanese' and instead starts to build their own brand".
Formula One teams' costs rocket after rules changes:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lewis Hamilton during the Japan F1 Grand Prix Next weekend Britain's Lewis Hamilton could secure his fourth Formula One title at the United States Grand Prix.His Mercedes team is a staggering 145 points ahead of arch-rivals Ferrari despite the sport introducing rules this year which aimed to put the brakes on the dominance of a single outfit.They came at a hefty cost.The new regulations were designed to make for closer racing by increasing aerodynamic and mechanical grip through the introduction of wider tyres and wings.According to one of the teams it has "rewritten" the rulebook and the impact is just as noticeable off track as on it.But if some had hoped the rules might stop Mercedes from running away with the F1 championship they will have been disappointed.Ironically, they have also forced up its rivals' costs.Only the frontrunners have had the resources to foot the bill from their cashflow whilst one of the outfits lower down the grid even had to get a driver to cover the cost.Research has revealed that new regulations fuelled a 167.6m increase in the F1 teams' costs in 2016.They rose 14.5% to hit a combined 1.3bn - the highest-ever total recorded in the sport.F1 cars are designed the year before they race so the bulk of the investment in them is paid for then, too.It means that the cost of this year's campaign is reflected in the teams' 2016 accounts and the final one of them was filed last week.Eight of F1's ten teams have to file publicly-available accounts - the only exceptions are Ferrari as its outfit is run by the car manufacturer itself, and Swiss-based Sauber where firms don't have to release their finances.The costs of the teams' operating companies came to an average of 165.9m in 2016, topped by Northamptonshire-based Mercedes which spent 274.9m excluding the investment in its engines.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption F1 teams' costs rose 14.5% to hit 1.3bn last year It is the highest ever total recorded on the accounts of a British F1 team and even eclipses the turbocharged spending levels before the 2008 economic crash which drove Toyota and Honda out of the sport.At the other end of the spectrum is last year's new entrant Haas F1 which spent a third as much as the championship leaders.Haas has managed to keep its costs down by taking advantage of a new rule allowing teams to buy in more parts than before.Haas uses a Ferrari engine with a chassis created by Italian manufacturer Dallara which also makes the cars for the F2 junior series.Relying on suppliers reduces research and development expenditure which, along with staffing and engine costs, is one of their biggest costs - it rose across the board in 2016 as teams had to design cars to meet the new regulations.They were introduced by F1's governing body the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) to address criticism that the outcome of races was clear before they started due to the dominance of Mercedes.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Haas has kept costs down by buying in more parts than before With Hamilton at the wheel it has won both the constructors' and the drivers' championship for the past three years running.This year is set to be no different but there has been a far higher price to pay.Writing in the introduction to its accounts Mercedes' team boss Toto Wolff notes that there has been "an increase of 27.9m in operating costs mainly due to the impact of technical regulation changes and movement in foreign exchange rates".The 2016 accounts for Force India, also based in Northamptonshire, give more insight into the effort required to meet the new rules.It says that combined with the change in tyre-sizes "our traditional method of retaining 50% of the previous season's car and updating the remaining 50% is not possible for 2017".Over 90% of Force India's car this year is completely new.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Force India has helped cover its increased costs with cash from driver Nikita Mazepin The team planned to cover its increased costs with income from an unlikely source: a driver contract signed with Russian youngster, Nikita Mazepin, "secured a cash injection ahead of significant regulation changes ahead of the 2017 season", said Force India.Mazepin was just 16 when he signed up last year and he has tested for the team twice since then, most recently in July after the Hungarian Grand Prix.He has ample resources to pay as his father Dmitry became a billionaire through owning the mineral fertiliser producer Uralchem.Despite this, Force India still chalked up a net loss of 11.6m - the largest of any team in 2016.The regulation changes even dented the bottom line of British manufacturing giant McLaren.Its went from a net 3.4m profit in 2015 to an after-tax loss of 3.2m the following year.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption For F1 teams, victory on the track is more important than making a profit Overall the teams made a combined net loss of 2m last year.Perhaps surprisingly this is nothing new as unlike most businesses, profit is not the barometer of success in F1.Instead teams judge their performance on racing results and tend to spend all of their income on this in a bid for victory.Some even pump in more than they make, with additional funds usually coming from owners' pockets or debt.The theory is that it is better to win and make no profit than make money and finish low in the standings.Victory on track increases a team's ability to bring in more sponsorship,, as brands are prepared to pay more to be associated with a winner.The teams' revenue generally comes from three sources with two providing the lion's share.They are fuelled by F1's huge television audience (390m viewers last year).The first key revenue source is sponsorship which comprises around a third of the teams' revenue, Another third comes from prize money.F1's parent company, which is owned by American investment firm Liberty Media, pays the teams around 66% of its annual profits as prize money and it came to $985.5m (742m) in 2016.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Despite numerous failed attempts there are new proposals to introduce a budget cap for F1 teams Payments from owners represent around half of the teams' remaining revenue and the marketing benefit from the exposure on TV compensates for this investment.If costs increase these payments often rise to compensate and last year Red Bull poured in four times more money into its flagship team.Its investment into Red Bull Racing hit 40.6m as costs surged 9.2% to 197m.As its owner has deep pockets Red Bull Racing doesn't need to rely on drivers who pay but income from them is the remaining source of revenue for F1 teams.They are a hallmark of teams at the bottom of the grid but their days could be numbered.Despite numerous failed attempts F1 hasn't given up on introducing a budget cap and recent reports suggest that Liberty Media will shortly present plans to the teams for introduction in 2021 when their current race contracts expire.But it will be the sport's governing body, the FIA, that will ultimately decide on any changes A limit of 114m has been suggested and this would level the playing field as the smallest teams are already below this whilst the frontrunners would have to scale back.Although it may seem like a logical direction for the sport to go in it would make the recent boost in spending seem all the more pointless.
Where are all the women in economics?:::::Image caption Clara Starrsjo is a second-year economics student at Cambridge University We hear a lot about the under-representation of women in so-called STEM fields - science, technology, engineering and maths.But the proportion of women in economics is by some measures smaller.In the US, only about 13% of academic economists in permanent posts are women; in the UK the proportion is only slightly better at 15.5%.Only one woman has ever won the Nobel Prize in economics - American Elinor Ostrom in 2009.And there wasn't even a single woman on some of the lists floating about guessing who this year's prize winner would be - it went to the behavioural economist Richard Thaler.Some have argued that these figures aren't necessarily the result of bias.Maybe, they say, women are simply behaving rationally and choosing different disciplines that are perhaps more suited to their temperament and skills, or choosing to work in different but related fields.But Cambridge University economics lecturer Victoria Bateman says that can't really explain all of the gap."I think that that way of thinking about the problem is completely false," says Dr Bateman, who is a fellow at Cambridge's Gonville & Caius college."But I think [it] helps explain why economists have for too long hushed up this problem."Because if economists' models are suggesting that sexism doesn't exist, that it's all a result of people's free choices and... their personal characteristics, then you deny the fact there is a problem."'Hotties' vs 'Wharton' In fact, there is a growing body of research suggesting that there are some biases - overt and subconscious - that might be contributing to the lack of women in academic economic departments.Image caption The proportion of women choosing to study economics at the undergraduate level in the UK has declined over the last decade.A study published by University of California, Berkeley's Alice Wu made waves earlier this year.Using natural language processing, Wu analyzed over one million posts on a website called EconJobRumors.com, which is a sort of online forum where academic economists discuss job openings and candidates.Like many places on the internet, the conversations aren't particularly pretty or politically correct.Wu found that when posters on the site discussed female economists, they used starkly different terms than those that were used to discuss male economists.Many of those words are incredibly offensive.Posters tended to discuss a woman's physical appearance (hot and hottie were in the top ten) whereas those terms used with men tended to emphasise their intellectual ability (Wharton and Austrian - for the school of economic thinking - were in the top terms for men).'Women incur a penalty' The paper caused a lot of debate within the economic community - with many saying that what people say on the internet isn't necessarily an indication of how they truly think.University of Bristol professor Sarah Smith says: "I think it's an extreme view.I don't think it's a representation of everyone in the profession."But, she adds: "I don't think it's surprising when you tie it up with looking at the proportion of women at different levels."Prof Smith - who is also the chair of the Royal Economic Society's Women's Committee - cites other evidence that suggested a bias against women in the economics profession, such as a paper published by Harvard researcher Heather Sarsons.Image copyright Heather Sarsons Image caption Heather Sarsons found that women's contributions to co-authored papers tended to be undervalued That paper found that an additional co-authored paper on an economist's resume correlates to an 8% increase in the probability of a male economist getting a tenured post - but only a 2% increase for female candidates.Interestingly, the gap decreased if women co-authored papers with other women.Ms Sarsons wrote in the paper: "While solo-authored papers send a clear signal about one's ability, co-authored papers do not provide specific information about each contributor's skills.I find that women incur a penalty when they co-author that men do not experience."Her paper, she added in a footnote, was intentionally single-authored.There are more studies - ones that suggest that female economists' papers take six months longer to peer review in top journals than their male counterparts; that when women get tenured faculty jobs in economics, they get paid less; and that even if a woman makes it to the front of a lecture hall - there might be no men listening to them.Image copyright Victoria Bateman Image caption Victoria Bateman organised a Women in Economics day at Cambridge in 2015 to encourage more young women to enter the field."There was a very interesting and quick bit of number crunching that was done by the Centre for Global Development which has headquarters in both Washington and London," says Cambridge's Dr Bateman."When they looked at male attendance at the seminars that they run they found that it fell off quite dramatically whenever gender was mentioned in the seminar topic."Dr Bateman says the fact that there are so few women at the top has meant that many young women can't view themselves in those positions.She notes that in the early 2000s the proportion of women studying economics in British universities was around 30%.It's down to just 26% today.'Only half the story' That women aren't even choosing to enter the discipline really surprised me.So I went to Cambridge to speak to some of the current undergraduates in economics.Image caption Paulin Nusser says she noticed that there were very few women teaching her economics courses.I met Paulin Nusser, a final year economics, student at the University Centre on a busy Sunday.I asked her what her experience studying economics had been like."When I think back to my lectures last year for instance out of the 11 lecturers and supervisors I had throughout the year that are based in the faculty - just one was a woman," she says.This is why she says it can sometimes be hard to imagine a career in academic economics, even though she hopes to pursue it at postgraduate level."Representation is just something that does affect me because I am subconsciously looking for role models or someone where I can say you know, 'oh that could be me standing up there teaching this lecture'."Clara Starrsjo, a second-year student says she notices that her male and female classmates approach economics problems differently - which often leads to better, more comprehensive answers.This is why she's become passionate about increasing the number of women who study economics - including meeting with potential female economics students at a Women in Economics day each autumn.I ask her why she tells these women they should enter the field - even if the odds may seem stacked against them."For the moment economists have only looked at the world around them through male eyes and this only provides us with half the story," she says she tells them."And with only half the story how can we get results that will help the whole population?"
'Tell me phone, what's destroying my crops?':::::Image copyright Peat Image caption Voruganti Surendra says farmers are finding pest and disease recognition apps "very useful" India's farmers have never had it easy; drought, crop failure, low market prices and lack of modernisation have taken their toll on the nation's population, about half of whom work in agriculture.Every year thousands of farmers take their own lives.So can crop management apps help?Voruganti Surendra is a farmer who grows paddy rice on an acre of farmland in Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh.He and hundreds of his fellow farmers are using a new app that can recognise a growing number of crop pests and diseases and give advice on how to treat them."It is very useful," he says."Farmers need it."The app, called Plantix, was developed thousands of miles away in Berlin, Germany, by a group of graduate students and scientists who came together to help farmers combat disease, pest damage and nutrient deficiency in their crops."It was really important for us to understand what farmers wanted," says Charlotte Schumann, co-founder of Peat (Progressive Environmental & Agricultural Technologies) the company behind the app, "so we did a lot of groundwork in India".Image caption Peat boss Simone Strey (left) and co-founder Charlotte Schumann created the Plantix app After months criss-crossing this vast country by train, conducting research in rural areas, the team concluded that a diagnostics app featuring image recognition would help farmers most, especially since smartphone prices were falling to affordable levels."The smartphones gave many of them access to the internet for the first time," says Ms Schumann.There are 500 or so farmers in Mr Surendra's village of Karlapalem in Bapatla Mandal, growing rice, maize, cotton, banana, chilli and a host of other crops.While just 20 own their own smartphones, these lucky few share them so that their fellow farmers can take photos of their crops and upload the images to the app.The farmer photographs the damaged crop and the app identifies the likely pest or disease by applying machine learning to its growing database of images.Not only can Plantix recognise a range of crop diseases, such as potassium deficiency in a tomato plant, rust on wheat, or nutrient deficiency in a banana plant, but it is also able to analyse the results, draw conclusions, and offer advice.Image copyright Peat Image caption The app can recognise different types of pest damage and suggest treatments These abilities rely on deep neural networks, or DNNs, which processes information in a way similar to how biological nervous systems operate."It works a bit like the human brain," says Peat's chief executive, Simone Strey.Initially, or if the image recognition software gets confused, pathologists and other experts will provide information about what the app is looking at."Obviously, it needs some backup from human experts," says Ms Strey.The app had to be multi-lingual because "the farmers often use different names for crop diseases than those used by scientists", she says."And if the farmers don't know the scientific name, they won't be able to search for solutions online."It is currently available in Hindi, Telugu and English in India, and in five other languages for use in other countries.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption About half of India's 1.3 billion people work in agriculture But Peat is not the only firm developing smartphone apps to help farmers.In Africa, for instance, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research - a body dedicated to food security - has just won a $100,000 (76,000) award to expand its research and bring a similar app to farmers across the continent.David Hughes of Penn State, who co-leads the project, describes it as "transformative" and says they "can amplify by 100 times what we have achieved so far".In fact, the number of digital helpers that can fit in farmers' pockets has grown dramatically in recent years.They include fertiliser firm Yara's ImageIT app, which uses photos to measure nitrogen uptake in a crop and offer recommendations to farmers.University of Missouri's ID Weeds app helps farmers identify unwanted plants.And John Deere's GrainTruckPlus app helps with grain harvesting storage and fleet logistics.Then there's PotashCorp's return-on-investment calculator, called eKonomics, and AgVault 2.0 Mobile's Sentera app, which controls drones that can systematically film entire fields autonomously and feed back the footage for analysis.Image copyright Yara Image caption Yara's ImageIT app aims to measure the nitrogen content in plants "Technological innovations play a very important role," says Harsimrat Kaur Badal, India's Minister of Food Processing Industries, in reducing waste, improving hygiene, creating jobs, and addressing "farmers' distress".Krishna Kumar, chief executive of CropIn Technology, a data-driven farming company, believes agricultural "start-ups [will] innovate fast and change every aspect of the industry".While such apps are practically useful to farmers now, it is the data they collect that is potentially more useful in the longer term, argues Peat's Ms Strey."Each farmer represents a data point, and it's really the data set that's valuable.Research on this scale in this field hasn't been done before by any global research organisation."This is why farmers don't usually have to pay to use such apps."If you want to collect data, you don't make the users pay," says Ms Strey.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Peat's database currently contains some 1.5 million images - up from 100,000 a year ago, with 80% of its 300,000 to 400,000 users currently in India.Geo-tagging offers insight into which plants are grown where, and whether or not they are healthy.Apps can record the weather, too, and build up a picture of the climatic conditions.Such knowledge is valuable not just to the farmers themselves but also to producers of fertilisers or pesticides, to the food industry which wants to source crops, and to governments keen to see the bigger picture in their countries.As such, the challenge, according to CropIn Technology's Mr Kumar, is not merely to gather the data, but to "make sense of it and present it as actionable insights to agri businesses".
The companies making bicycles from wood:::::Image copyright Connor Wood Image caption Connor Wood makes its bike frames from white ash or black walnut The forerunner of the bicycle - the laufmaschine or running machine - bears only a passing resemblance to the pedal-bikes we know today.Invented in 1817, it had no chain and was powered by the rider pushing his feet along the ground in a walking or running motion.Even more unusually, its frame was made from wood.Jump forward to 2017, and a crop of bike makers is turning back the clock - at least in terms of using wood as a core material.These firms make their bicycles in part, and occasionally wholly, from woods such as ash, oak and walnut.They are driven by a love of craft and design, the desire to use natural materials, and a passion for cycling itself.Image copyright Connor Wood Image caption Chris Connor decided to combine his long held passions for woodwork and cycling And they have attracted a small but growing base of enthusiastic customers, willing to pay high prices for their lovingly crafted creations."People like having something unique, something different," says Chris Connor, the founder of Connor Wood Bicycles."They also appreciate the craftsmanship.Not a lot of things are built by hand these days."The company was born in 2012, after the 48-year-old American decided to combine his long held passions for woodwork and cycling.All his bikes all have wooden frames; the other parts, such as the gears and wheels, are made from steel, carbon or rubber.Prices range from $3,500 (2,600) to $11,000.Sales have gradually been increasing, but it hasn't been easy, says Mr Connor.That's because of a perception among some cyclists that wooden bikes may break or be unsafe.Image copyright Niko Crepnjak Image caption Woodster Bikes makes its frames from beech and bog oak In fact, Mr Connor says wood is very durable, which is why it's used to make tool handles, skis, boats, even light aircraft.It also absorbs vibrations well, making cycling on bumpy roads smoother, less tiring and quieter."And of course, these bikes look great," says Mr Connor, who makes his frames made from "strong but flexible" white ash or "eye candy" black walnut.A recently published book called "The Wooden Bicycle: Around the World" features 111 companies that make bikes from wood or bamboo.Only one, Splinterbike in the UK, sells 100% wooden models with its bikes featuring wooden gears, chains and wheels.Image copyright Tjaa Matii Image caption Woodster Bikes cost from 2,500 euros to 17,000 euros However, most limit their use of wood to the frame, and occasionally parts such as the handlebars and forks.Other parts will be made from materials typically associated with bikes, such as aluminium.It is the unique design of wooden bikes, and their bespoke craftsmanship, that underpins their appeal, says Gregor Cuzak.The Slovenian co-founded Woodster Bikes after meeting woodworker Iztok Mohoric, who had recently designed a bike with a wooden frame."I wasn't interested at first, but after I saw it and took a ride, I was immediately convinced," Mr Cuzak says."People were watching me as if I was driving a wild sports car."Image copyright Thessa Lageman Image caption Piet Brandjes, right, co-founder of Bough Bikes with his son Bob Like other firms in the space, Woodster is targeting customers who appreciate the finer things in life.Its bike frames are made of woods such as beech and bog oak, and prices range from 2,500 euros (2,190) up to 17,000 euros.In addition, every customer gets a book with a story about how their individual bike was made."We even plant a new tree at the same location where we cut one for your bike," Mr Cuzak adds.Piet Brandjes, 63, who co-founded Dutch firm Bough Bikes, agrees that wooden bikes "attract attention".For that reason, firms in the Netherlands such as Novotel and Rabobank have bought Bough Bikes for their guests and employees to use.More stories from the BBC's Business Brain series looking at interesting business topics from around the world: The bikes are also used in a shared bike scheme at Schiphol Airport business park, in Amsterdam, so workers can give them a spin.Mr Brandjes says all his models have French oak frames, handlebars and front forks.However, customers don't need to worry about them getting wet in the rain."The bikes in the shared scheme have been outside for three years and they still look good," he says."As long as wet wood dries again, it's fine.You just need to polish it once a season."Image copyright Bough Bikes Image caption Bough Bikes Everyone I spoke to reported feeling frustrated by assumptions that wooden bikes were less safe and sturdy than other bikes.Mr Connor tells me that by using the right woods and construction techniques, his bikes are perfectly durable."A strong seasoned wood, laminated to itself in strips with reversing grain directions, bonded with aerospace adhesives is incredibly tough."Add in interspersed layers of carbon fibre and Kevlar, like in my bikes, and the strength far exceeds the requirements for making a reasonably lightweight performance bicycle frame."As for how they function, Mr Brandjes points out that all of his bikes have been tested by TUV Rheinland, a renowned German organisation that certifies products.Image copyright Bough Bikes Image caption French oak However, other obstacles may hinder firms in the space.For one thing, wooden bikes tend to be heavier than many road bikes.The various models of the three companies I spoke to weigh between 9.9kg and 25kg."You can't make them as light as carbon bikes," says Mr Connor, "but I don't think a pound or two more or less matters."The people who buy them are not competitive riders, he adds.Too pricey?Another issue is that wooden bikes tend to cost a lot, which may be preventing higher volumes of sales.American firm Renovo, whose bikes start at $3,995, is probably the number one producer of wooden bikes worldwide.And yet it told the BBC it had only sold 1,000 models since it was founded in 2007."If someone manages to create a wooden bike for under 1,000 euros (914), sales might rise," Mr Cuzak says.He has only sold 10 bikes since he started in 2015, meaning that he and his partner still have to work on the company in their spare time.However, Mr Connor runs his business full time, having sold around 65 pieces to date.And Bough Bikes has shifted about 600 bikes since it was founded in 2012.Summing up what many in the wooden bike industry believe, Mr Cuzak says, "this is not a regular business, but a slow business".However, he adds: "We've planted the seed and are now waiting for the tree to grow.I believe it will, eventually."
How maps are powering the tech revolution:::::Image copyright Geovation Image caption From Hugh Grant to maps - this space now houses Ordnance Survey's start-up hub Remember Hugh Grant's bachelor pad in About a Boy?This epitome of a cool central London home has now given itself over to the British map maker Ordnance Survey.It's the site of their start-up hub, helping young companies which are using their mapping technology.It's a world away from Ordnance Survey's (OS) concertina'd, paper-based business, but location, location, location still matters here.Where we are and where we want to go is at the heart of so many of the world's most innovative businesses.Think of Uber, Deliveroo, Airbnb, the development of driverless cars, and drone deliveries.All of these companies need location data to power their software.In fact there are very few sectors which don't rely on it.Some estimates say the global market for core geographical information will exceed $13bn (9.6bn) by 2025, according to consultancy firm Navigant.Image copyright Ordnance Survey Image caption Maps are increasingly being digitised for use in new technologies Carmakers are among the companies hungry for mapping data, according to Martin Garner of tech consultants CCS Insight."Developments in mapping are mainly being led by the transportation industry in its push towards intelligent and self-driving cars and trucks," he says.In December 2015, for example, BMW, Daimler, and Volkswagen's Audi acquired the digital mapping company HERE from Nokia for $3.1bn to provide their own in-house source of data.Mr Garner says the value of location data lies in its ability to mirror every aspect of the world around us.He says technology is turning maps into living databases of places, objects and people where live information comes from a wide range of sources, and is used by lots of different people.Image copyright CNH technology/OS Image caption Ordnance Survey technology is being used in the development of driverless tractors OS, founded back in 1791, makes most of its 150m yearly revenue from the private companies who use its data - such as Garmin's sat navs - and through big public sector agreements providing data for bus routes, planning and flood prevention.But a third of its products can be used for free.It's that information - on our roads and rivers - which provides the backbone for so many other companies, including Google Maps.OS decided to open the Geovation hub in London in 2015.The company felt it was behind the curve on how its mapping data was being used and that it wasn't seeing the benefits of giving the information away for free.Image caption The company has been mapping Britain since 1791 - the official year of its foundation - including these maps from the 1920s The hub's 900 members range from industry stalwarts to A-level students, but are mainly start-up companies who rely on location data to develop their products.Taking a leaf out of the financial industry's book, they've even developed a new word for the companies they work with: Geotech.For Alex Wrottesley, who runs the hub, there are many advantages of this kind of interaction with start-ups, and he says it's often the best way of bringing things to market.One of the companies based in the hub is Openplay, which aims to create a comprehensive list of leisure activities and venues across the UK, including in church halls and community centres.Its boss, Sam Parton, uses a combination of OS maps and shoe leather to build the database."Parks and open spaces don't have postcodes so it can be very difficult to find events happening in them.We've gone out and practically listed them ourselves," he says.Image caption Sam Parton from Open Play is using OS data to build a database of leisure venues Richa Bhalla who runs Pedals, a green courier company based in the Geovation Hub, says mapping is about more than getting goods from A to B.It tries to use commuters to deliver packages in the safest and least polluted way they can.Pedals overlays OS data with other sources to do this."It is all about logistics, getting to places as fast as possible, using green cycle lanes rather than busy roads," Richa says.Apart from those companies that have won free placements on one of their accelerator schemes, the programme is funded by a small fee from the businesses who work there and sponsorship deals with private companies.However, the OS is also looking to the start-ups as future money spinners - as it starts to take stakes in the most successful.The aim, it says, is "to create new revenues for our long-term future".Image copyright Geovation Image caption Richa Bhalla from Pedals says coming up with greener routes is something she really cares about Implicit in this drive for innovation and those words "long-term future", is the axe that has hung over the future of the OS in recent years.OS was made a government-owned company in 2015 - a technical term meaning it has greater commercial freedoms such as how to pay its staff - but it remains in the control of the state alongside the likes of Companies House, Network Rail and the Royal Mint.There was speculation when this happened that the government could look to sell it.However, in a recent statement, the Department for Business said categorically "there are no plans to privatise Ordnance Survey".Image caption The Geovation hub is a world away from the traditional cartography done by the Ordnance Survey OS sees its long-term future in embracing new technologies like providing data for smart cities, the roll out of 5G and driverless cars.And it's not the only one.James Hodgson, a senior analyst in smart mobility and automotive at ABI Research, says the mapping industry is being transformed."Profitable map building isn't a matter of owning the capital for map creation," he says.Instead, it's about having the ability to ingest data from lots of devices to "build a continuously up-to-date, accurate representation of the world"."As traditional map building becomes less viable and less profitable, the traditional map builders are having to innovate."Mr Wrottesley is confident OS knows what its core customer wants: "We've been selling our services for 200 years."For OS - like others in the mapping industry - it's about how to map the next few decades as well.
Portsmouth owner Eisner's journey from Disney to Pompey:::::Image copyright Shutterstock Image caption Michael Eisner watched a lot of football in Europe and the US before buying Portsmouth Two decades at the helm of global entertainment giant Walt Disney might seem a strange apprenticeship for taking over a lower-level English football club, but Michael Eisner insists it is the latest logical move in his high-flying business career.The 75-year-old American completed his takeover of historic south coast club Portsmouth in August for 5.67m, buying it from fans who had stepped in with their own money to save the club.The club, nicknamed Pompey, had fallen on hard financial times since winning the FA Cup in 2008, and had dropped from the Premier League to the bottom tier, but did get promoted back to League One at the end of last season.After a lifetime working for some of the biggest US and international TV and film firms, including ABC and Paramount as well as Disney, the native of New York state had launched his own investment firm, and was looking for interesting projects to back.Mr Eisner, whose net worth is estimated at $1bn (760m), and his Tornante group will invest 10m in the club.'Passion is key' "What is an American guy doing getting involved with English football?," he says."Well, I am qualified for this new role.In a way I feel my whole career has led up to this."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Portsmouth FC is starting out on what Mr Eisner hopes is a march back up the league tables Indeed, during his time in the entertainment industry Mr Eisner was involved in a number of sports-related projects, including TV scheduling, film production, and the acquisition of clubs."There are differences between sport and entertainment - one must be scripted, planned, produced, and the other is more spontaneous, extemporaneous.But both have conflict, a climax and an ending," he observes."And whatever your brand, product, league, club - the idea of loyalty or passion is key."And Eisner says it was the raucous fan reaction to Portsmouth winning promotion, and the League Two title, last season that was the final factor in convincing him to buy the club.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Eisner says it was the passion of the fans that convinced him to buy Portsmouth FC "Because of this mad enthusiasm I found Pompey irresistible," he said at the Leaders sports conference in London."I had first heard about the possibility of acquiring the club when I was looking at the possibility of buying a US sports team.Investing in US sport is very expensive.The NFL has its physical problems which scare me."It [football] just seemed a great thing to me and my family.We got hooked on the game in the UK."'Excitement and history' Mr Eisner and his three sons, Breck, Eric, and Anders, make up the Portsmouth board, along with Andy Redman, president of Tornante, and Portsmouth FC chief executive Mark Catlin.Despite its recent woes the club has a strong heritage, winning the League title in 1949 and 1950, and FA Cup in 1939 as well as nine years ago.Image copyright Getty Images/Hulton Archive Image caption Mr Eisner says he was struck by Portsmouth's historic past "When I passed through the Fratton Park turnstiles I felt like I did when I stepped through the doors at Disney - a sense of excitement and of a rich history," he says."Portsmouth fans are passionate.[After] four strange owners the fans stepped in and bought the team."Pompey fans had done a remarkable job but it seemed they would need additional investment to build the brand."He says there were another reasons, apart from fan passion and history, that he and his family wanted to buy a football club.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The new owners say they have plans to upgrade Fratton Park stadium One is the fact that football has a global appeal, and also - in a currently fractured media landscape - "the only appointment-to-view [TV] is for sports events"."Today, viewers can watch the shows they want any time they want on on multiple devices.But sport fans want to watch their teams compete in real time," he says.That means that sports, and football, TV rights will always be in high demand by broadcasters looking for content.Image copyright Shutterstock Image caption Mr Eisner was introduced to the fans before the opening game of the season against Rochdale As well as the expertise and cash that Eisner is providing, he is also promising to improve the stadium and promote managerial stability."Over time we will make the match day experience the pleasure it should be," he says, adding the club will also continue to build on its strong community work, for which it has won a number of Football League awards.Michael Eisner: A Sporting Life Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Michael Eisner at the launch of an ESPN sports-themed restaurant "At ABC TV in 1970 we made a crack in the traditional entertainment wall, by moving NFL Football to prime time on a Monday night.ABC was the smallest network and needed success," he says.It became one of the longest-running prime time shows ever on commercial network TV.At Paramount he oversaw production of sports films Players, North Dallas Forty, and the Bad News Bears trilogy.In 1984 he became Disney chairman and the company produced the film The Mighty Ducks.Disney in 1993 then created an actual ice hockey team called the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, now the Anaheim Ducks.In 2006-07 the team won the NHL's Stanley Cup.Disney also produced baseball film Angels in the Outfield in 1984.In 1997 Disney took over the California Angels team.It was renamed the Anaheim Angels and under Disney's ownership won its first World Series championship in 2002.During Mr Eisner's time at Disney it also acquired leading sports cable TV channel ESPN in 1996.His current private firm bought the Topps sports trading card firm in 2007.It is licensed to produce English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Uefa Champions League, and Indian Premier League cricket products.'Triumph of the underdog' Mr Eisner now says the club, which sits mid-table in League One, now needs stability and continuity on and off the playing field.He believes if club owners give their manager support, then the coaching team will have the confidence to lead the team to success."If you look at the great sports teams, you try to find a great manager and stick with him through thick and thin," he says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Eisner says there are similarities between Portsmouth and Disney fans He says he hopes current manager Kenny Jackett will be in the post for a decade, and oversee success during that time."The Disney fans are similar to Portsmouth fans," he says."When I went there it was about to be broken up.The fans' love of Disney helped support it."All of Disney's sports films had the same theme - the triumph of the underdog.With Portsmouth we hope to get it right in fact, not fiction."We will get there - being slow, steady and smart."
Four solutions to the disposable coffee cup problem:::::Image copyright Getty creative Image caption Is the price of our growing addiction to takeaway hot drinks an ever higher mountain of landfill?Since last year, when we were all made aware of the UK's unrecycled cup mountain, some of us have found it hard to buy a takeaway coffee without being wracked with guilt.In the UK, we throw away an estimated 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups every year.In theory, they are "recyclable", but in practice, only a tiny percentage is dealt with sustainably.Yet so far, there's no agreed way forward.Parliament's environmental audit committee has been hearing the latest thoughts from campaigners and industry on how we can improve on our record in this area.A lot of the biggest names in takeaway beverages, including Caffe Nero, Costa Coffee, McDonald's, Pret A Manger and Starbucks, have signed up to a scheme to collect and recycle more of the current type of cups.Costa is also collecting cups from rival brands in its shops.But others believe a more fundamental rethink would work better.Here are four ways the coffee cup waste problem might be tackled.1.Frugalpac: 'Just change the cups' Conventional cups can be recycled, but only in special facilities, thanks to the lamination that makes them waterproof.Frugalpac, based in Ipswich in the UK, manufactures cardboard cups that can be recycled in regular recycling plants.Image copyright Frugalcup "We looked at this three years ago: everyone was blaming someone else, the cup makers, the coffee shops, councils.We thought, why don't we go out there and solve the problem?"says Frugalpac's founder, Martin Myerscough.He has a patent for his cup - made of recycled materials, with an only very lightly attached plastic lining (representing about 10% of the weight of the cup), that separates easily during recycling.It's a more pragmatic solution, he argues, than trying to set up specialist collection points for conventional cups, because we already have recycling bins.He has done trials with independent coffee shops and is working with Starbucks.Of course, consumers will still have to remember to put them in the right bin, and he is still working on replacing the plastic lid.2.CupClub: 'Like city bike rental for cups' Safia Qureshi points to chai wallahs in India as one of her initial inspirations.There, tea is poured into glasses that are washed and reused.We all used to drink milk and Coca Cola from returnable, reusable bottles.So why not coffee?Image copyright Bailey-Oscar "The current model for reusable cups is that the consumer needs to buy the cup and take it in.The ratio of consumers doing that is 2% of all the total coffee sold," she points out.Instead, she proposes that the customer joins Cup Club and picks up a reusable cup when they buy their coffee.It can be returned later to one of several collection points.Cup Club is responsible for collecting washing and redistributing the clean cups to participating retailers.Because the cups are tagged and registered to your account - using RFID, the same technology that's on an Oyster travel card - Cup Club can text you a reminder if you've forgotten to return a cup and charge you if you keep it.Image copyright Cup Club "I'm very passionate about putting an end to products that are only used one time," says Ms Quereshi "It's a selfish and arrogant stance."She's starting with company offices and universities, but is aiming ultimately for a London-wide scheme.Its success will rely on enough retailers subscribing, but she has received an Ellen MacArthur Circular Design Challenge award, which will support her in developing the idea further.3.TrioCup: the origami cup Tom Chan, an engineering student from Hong Kong studying in the US, said he saw the coffee cups piling up in the rubbish bins outside his university building and wanted to do something about it.He has now patented his TrioCup, a triangular-shaped cardboard cup, with sticking up flaps "like bunny ears".Those ears can be folded down and tucked in to close it.The entire cup is recyclable and, without the need for a separate plastic lid, potentially cheaper than normal cups.Image copyright TrioCup "I decided if I were to make a new cup, it needed to have more features than just being eco-friendly," he says.So he aimed for some other selling points too, such as spill-resistance."From my anecdotal research, a lot more people spill their coffee than you think."He says you can drop a TrioCup from waist height and most of the coffee will stay in the cup.He thinks the shape makes the cups easier to hold and gives them "a cool aesthetic".Even the origami folding technique is pretty simple, he says.Image copyright TrioCup Next month, Mr Chan, another recipient of an Ellen MacArthur award, will be making several thousand cups per week for use in the university coffee shop.4.Cupffee: the edible cup The ultimate waste-free cup, though, must be this: a coffee cup made of cereals that you can munch on like an ice cream cone, once you've downed your drink.Image copyright Cupffee Three friends from Plovdiv in Bulgaria, Miroslav Zapryanov, Mladen Dzhalazov and Simeon Gavrailov, came up with their "waffle" recipe containing no preservatives, colourings or coatings a few years ago and have been working on commercialising it ever since.Apparently slightly sweet and crisp, it will hold your coffee for up to 40 minutes.And if you decide not to snack on it, it will biodegrade within weeks.They say they were inspired by a desire to change the world.They might only be changing the diets of a limited number of Bulgarian coffee drinkers, but they are ambitious.The founders say that with a shelf life of six months the Cupffee could meet the needs of the big High Street coffee chains.But many other firms are thinking along similar lines, at least when it comes to compostable cups.Companies such as Bristol-based Planglow have successfully commercialised what they say is fully biodegradable food packaging, including coffee cups.And they boast clients from restaurants to contract caterers, sandwich shops to Parliament, so policy makers presumably are familiar with this option.
10 toughest places for girls to go to school:::::Image copyright Unicef Image caption South Sudan has been named as the worst place in the world for education for girls Debates about schools in richer countries are often about the politics of priorities, what subjects should be given most importance, who needs extra help and what needs more public spending.But for families in many developing countries questions about education can be a lot more basic - is there any access to school at all?Figures from the United Nations suggest there has been "almost zero progress" in the past decade in tackling the lack of school places in some of the world's poorest countries.A further report examined the quality of education, and the UN said the findings were "staggering", with more than 600 million children in school but learning next to nothing.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In Niger, four out of five adult women remain illiterate While in affluent Western countries, girls are often ahead of boys in academic achievement, in poorer parts of the world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, girls are much more likely to be missing out.And on the UN's International Day of the Girl, the development campaign, One, has created a ranking for the toughest places for girls to get an education.Conflict zones Across these 10 countries, most of those without school places are girls.These are fragile countries, where many families are at risk from poverty, ill health, poor nutrition and displacement from war and conflict.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Refugees displaced by fighting this summer in South Sudan Many young girls are expected to work rather than go to school.And many marry young, ending any chance of an education.UN figures indicate girls are more than twice as likely to lose out on education in conflict zones.Image copyright Unicef Image caption Refugees in Chad: Conflicts have disrupted the educations of tens of millions The rankings are based on: the proportion of girls without a primary school place the proportion of girls without a secondary school place the proportion of girls completing primary school the proportion of girls completing secondary school the average number of years girls attend school female illiteracy rates teacher training levels the teacher-pupil ratio public spending on education For some countries, such as Syria, there was insufficient reliable data for them to be included.Here are the top 10 toughest places for girls' education: South Sudan: the world's newest country has faced much violence and war, with the destruction of schools and families forced from their homes.Almost three-quarters of girls do not even make it to primary school Central African Republic: one teacher for every 80 pupils Niger: only 17% of women between the ages of 15 and 24 are literate Afghanistan: wide gender gap, with boys more likely to be in school than girls Chad: many social and economic barriers to girls and women getting education Mali: only 38% of girls finish primary school Guinea: the average time in education among women over the age of 25 is less than one year Burkina Faso: only 1% of girls complete secondary school Liberia: almost two-thirds of primary-age pupils out of school Ethiopia: two in five girls are married before the age of 18 A shortage of teachers is a common problem across poorer countries.Last year, the UN said another 69 million teachers would need to be recruited worldwide by 2030 if international promises on education were to be kept.Image caption Florence Cheptoo learned to read at 60, when her grandchild brought home a library book The report says there are great economic dividends if girls can be kept in school.And there are great gains for individuals, such as Florence Cheptoo, who lives in a remote village in Kenya and learned to read at the age of 60.Gayle Smith, president of the One campaign, called the failures in education for girls a "global crisis that perpetuates poverty"."Over 130 million girls are still out of school - that's over 130 million potential engineers, entrepreneurs, teachers and politicians whose leadership the world is missing out on."More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch.
The shampoo bottle saving babies from pneumonia:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Bangladeshi doctor who turned a shampoo bottle into a low-cost lifesaver "It was my first night as an intern and three children died before my eyes.I felt so helpless that I cried."In 1996, Dr Mohammod Jobayer Chisti was working in the paediatric department of the Sylhet Medical College Hospital in Bangladesh.That evening he made a promise that he would do something to stop children dying from pneumonia.About 920,000 babies and small children die from the disease each year, mostly in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.After two decades of research, Dr Chisti has now come up with a low-cost device with the potential to save thousands of babies' lives.Expensive machines Pneumonia affects the lungs after infections from bacteria like streptococcus (strep throat) or a virus such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).The lungs become swollen and fill with fluid or pus, reducing their ability to take in oxygen.In developed countries hospitals use ventilators to help children with pneumonia to breathe.But each machine can cost up to $15,000 (11,000) and must be operated by specially-trained staff which can make them too expensive for hospitals in developing countries such as Bangladesh.The World Health Organisation's recommended low-cost alternative treatment for severe pneumonia - low-flow oxygen - still results in one in seven children dying.Image caption The pressure from the bubbles in Dr Chisti's device keeps the small air sacs of the lungs open Dr Christi got his inspiration from a machine he saw while working in Melbourne, Australia.This uses continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to prevent the lungs from collapsing, helping the body to absorb enough oxygen.But it is expensive.When he returned to work at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, he started work on a simpler, cheaper bubble CPAP device.He and a colleague took a discarded plastic shampoo bottle from the intensive care unit, filled it with water and inserted one end of some plastic supply tubing.The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators."The children inhale oxygen from a tank and exhale through a tube which is inserted into a bottle of water producing bubbles in the water," Dr Chisti explains.The pressure from the bubbles keeps the small air sacs of the lungs open."We tested it on four or five patients at random.We saw a significant improvement within a few hours."Successful Trial "Doctors worked so hard; oxygen, a pipe for food, and then a white round bottle was connected with water bubbling away," says Kohinoor Begum, whose daughter Runa was treated by the device."After the treatment, when my child recovered, I felt so happy."After a two year study, Dr Chisti published the results in The Lancet magazine.It showed children treated with the bubble CPAP device had much lower death rates compared with those treated with low-flow oxygen.At a cost of just $1.25 (1), the device appeared to cut mortality rates by 75%.The device also makes much more efficient use of oxygen, slashing the hospital's annual oxygen bill from $30,000 (23,000) to just $6,000 (4,600).Dr ARM Luthful Kabir, professor of paediatrics at Ad-din Women's Medical College, says a nationwide study is still needed but the results are encouraging.Image caption Kohinoor Begum and Rezaul Karim with daughter Runa, one of 600 babies treated using the device "I think this innovation has great potential to reduce the mortality rate drastically because any hospital can afford this," Dr Kabir says.So far, about 600 children have benefited from the low-cost life saver.Dr Chisti has been promoted and is now head of clinical research at his hospital but the father-of-three still finds time to play with the children on the ward.When asked how he feels to be fulfilling that promise he made 20 years ago he replies: "I have no language to express this."He wants every hospital in developing countries to have the CPAP device available to them."On that day, we can say that pneumonia-related mortality is near zero."

From fluffy pillows to concrete: The uses of captured CO2:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Your fluffy pillows and memory foam mattress could be helping to reduce CO2 Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are contributing to global warming, so could technologies removing some of the gas from the atmosphere help slow the process?When you tuck yourself into bed tonight - curling up on your memory foam mattress and fluffy pillows - consider this: you could be helping to reduce climate change.This is because CO2 can now be captured from the air and stored in a range of everyday items in your home and on the street.It can be used to make plastics for a whole host of things: the insulation in your fridge-freezer; the paint on your car; the soles of your shoes; and the binding of that new book you haven't read yet.Even the concrete your street is made of could contain captured CO2.UK-based Econic Technologies has invented a way of encouraging CO2 - a typically unreactive gas - to react with the petrochemical raw materials used in the making of many plastics.In this catalysed form, the CO2 can make up to 50% of the ingredients needed for making plastic.And recycling existing CO2 in this way reduces the amount of new CO2 emissions usually resulting from the process."Our aim is that by 2026, the technology will be used to make at least 30% of the polyols [the units making up plastic] made globally, and that would reduce CO2 emission by 3.5 million tonnes each year," explains Rowena Sellens, chief executive of Econic Technologies."This is equivalent to taking more than two million cars off the road."Image copyright CarbonCure Image caption CarbonCure's Robert Niven thinks his firm's concrete is far more environmentally friendly The company is currently working with partners in industry to introduce its technology to market.Canadian company CarbonCure Technologies is recycling CO2 and putting it into concrete.CarbonCure takes waste CO2 from industrial emitters - such as fertiliser producers - and injects controlled doses of the liquid gas directly into the concrete truck or mixer.The reaction that takes place creates calcium carbonate particles that become permanently bound within the concrete - and make the concrete up to 20% stronger.Today, CarbonCure's technology is installed in more than 60 concrete plants across Canada and the US, supplying hundreds of construction projects.Another company, Carbon Engineering, captures CO2 and uses it to make diesel and jet fuel.While Carbon Clean Solutions, in the Indian port of Tuticorin, captures CO2 from a coal-fired power plant and turns it into soda ash (sodium carbonate), an ingredient in fertilisers, synthetic detergents and dyes.But will such carbon capture efforts really make much difference?Simply put, levels of "greenhouse gases" - CO2, methane and nitrous oxide are the main ones - have been rising rapidly because we've been burning fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - to make electricity and power our transportation, amongst other human activities.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Should we be reducing the amount of CO2 used in making plastics, or simply using less plastic?At the 2015 Paris climate conference, 195 countries agreed to try to keep global temperatures to within 2C of pre-industrial times by reducing emissions.But to achieve this target by 2030, the world needs to cut emissions - CO2 accounts for about 70% - by 12 to 14 gigatonnes per year, says John Christensen, director of a partnership between the UN Environment Programme and the Technical University of Denmark.A gigatonne is a billion tonnes.Econic, by contrast, hopes that by 2026, its technology will be responsible for reducing CO2 emissions by 3.5 million tonnes each year.And CarbonCure has demonstrated that its technology can help a typical medium-sized concrete producer reduce CO2 emissions by 900 tonnes a year.Globally, the concrete industry could reduce CO2 emissions by more than 700 million tonnes a year, the company believes."It's great to have these options coming up," says Mr Christensen, "but there's no silver bullet, no single solution."Image copyright Ashley Cooper Image caption Greenpeace's Doug Parr thinks renewable energy is a better way to reduce CO2 emissions Environmentalists are also concerned that such carbon capture technologies merely delay the fundamental shift society needs to make to become a low-carbon economy.A plastics factory producing less CO2 is still environmentally unfriendly, the argument goes."Research into new technologies and approaches that can help reduce carbon emissions is vital, but it must not become an excuse to delay action on tackling the root of the problem - our dependence on fossil fuels," says Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK."A process that appears to reduce emissions or increase efficiency can lock us into maintaining industries that could be replaced with much greener options."In addition, Mr Christensen points out that these carbon capture technologies tend to be very costly because they are so small-scale.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "The advances are positive but it's far from what is needed," he argues.Another challenge is what to do with the recycled carbon.Some have suggested burying it in the ground or deep under the ocean, but the consequences of this are not fully understood.So it's better to reduce the amount of emissions we produce in the first place through increased use of renewable energies, such as wind, hydro and solar power, environmentalists argue.This could reduce emissions by up to 50% of the amount needed."Use all the technologies available to bend the [emissions] curve down.Then carbon capture can come in," says Mr Christensen."It could have an important role to play."
Have you been nudged?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Richard Thaler has won a Nobel prize for his research into 'nudge' theory Think the Nobel prize for economics has nothing to do with you?In some years that may well be true.But this year's award has gone to Richard Thaler who, in his book Nudge, was one of the first to outline how tiny prompts can alter our behaviour.The Nobel judges are clearly keen on the discipline, since they awarded fellow behavioural economist Daniel Kahneman the Economics prize in 2002.Since when "nudge theory" has been applied to a wide range of problems.Here are a few ways you may have been nudged yourself.Fly in my bowl Image copyright Getty creative In probably the most well-known example, spillage around the toilet, an age old problem for at least half of the human race, was cut by 80% using an ingeniously simple intervention.First introduced at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam back in 1999, the idea was simple: etch the image of a fly in the urinal and men cannot help but take aim, saving on clean-up costs as well as alleviating unpleasantness.The painted porcelain was one of Prof Thaler's early favourite examples of tweaking the environment in a way that makes us change how we behave.Taxing issues When David Cameron became prime minister in 2010, one of his pet projects was the "Nudge Unit" or to give it its official title: the Behaviourial Insights Team.It set about encouraging better behaviour amongst UK citizens in a range of ways from letting you know that other people had filled in their tax returns (so you should do yours now) to offering a more personal approach at the job centre.But the most eye-catching, for those on the receiving end, was what you were sent if you failed to pay your car tax.A big heading shouted: "Pay your tax or lose your Ford Fiesta" (or whatever car you owned) accompanied by a photograph of the untaxed car.The focused approach paid off.A more positive tone was taken with the wealthy failing to pay their taxes.They received letters explaining how their taxes would help improve local services, and pointing out what would disappear without funding.These tweaks saw 210m in overdue tax paid into the Treasury.Baby face Woolwich in south-east London had a problem with anti-social behaviour.During the riots in 2011 several shop fronts were smashed in.The following year advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather, embracing the new science of behavioural economics, offered an innovative strategy.Knowing that even the toughest heart is melted by the sight of a infant, they spent a night with graffiti artists painting pictures of local babies' faces onto the shutters protecting the shop windows.The move was credited with helping to reduce anti-social behaviour by 18% in Woolwich.Ringing up sales If you've ever been on the phone to a salesperson, you may well have heard one of the following: "Most people in your position buy this" or "This deal is only available today".The first plays on our susceptibility to "social norming" - we think if others are doing it they must have a good reason.The second is based on loss aversion: we hate the idea of missing out.Thirdly, there can often be a tone of inexplicable cheeriness.Relentless positivity is catching apparently, and makes us feel good about signing up.Big brands have embraced the idea.For example, a team from Ogilvy and Mather has coached staff selling subscriptions to the Times and the Sunday Times to use these persuasive techniques.Did they work on you?Image copyright Getty creative Opting out In the past, people who want to donate their vital organs in the event of their death have usually been asked to "opt in" by putting their name on a register.Thanks in part to behavioural economics, there's a growing trend to adopt policies that presume consent and ask objectors to "opt out".Though the results are inconclusive it's clear we've embraced the concept - that we need to design the system in a way that helps us to "do the right thing" rather than rely on individuals' consciences.Likewise, we all know we need to save for our retirement, but it can be hard to summon the will-power.The "save more tomorrow" approach pioneered in the United States saw employees automatically signed up to pay into a pension, but starting with very small contributions to avoid loss-aversion that could make them baulk.Only later do payments rise.All if all this makes you feel as though the policymakers and marketers are only out to manipulate us, well at least thanks to Prof Thaler we now understand what they're up to a little better.
'I quit Google and launched a business with my mum':::::Image copyright Rahul Akerkar Image caption Munaf Kapadia and his mother Nafisa Munaf Kapadia runs a successful "pop up" restaurant at his family's home in Mumbai.His mother also works as head chef.While watching TV one Sunday afternoon back in 2014, Munaf Kapadia had an argument with his mother that would change his life.The then 25-year-old Google employee wanted to watch US cartoon the Simpsons, but as usual, his mother Nafisa preferred to see her favourite Indian soap opera and switched channels.It got Mr Kapadia thinking.His mum had lots of skills, but in his view she spent too much time watching bad TV.Image caption Diners usually eat Bohri food from the same large platter, or "thaal" Determined to get her doing something more meaningful, he struck upon an idea.Nafisa had always been good at cooking "Bohri" food, an Indian cuisine that is much feted, but hardly served anywhere in their home city of Mumbai.And so he decided to email 50 friends, inviting them for lunch at the family home."We settled on a group of eight friends of friends, and served them my mom's food," recalls Mr Kapadia, now 28."Then we started doing it every Saturday and Sunday, opening it up to the public and charging like a restaurant.That's how The Bohri Kitchen was born."Image caption Members of the public dine at the Kapadias' home every weekend Traditionally, Bohri cuisine has only been available within the Dawoodi Bohra community, a small Muslim sect that lives in parts of India and Pakistan.As Mr Kapadia says, "you literally had to beg Bohri friends or gatecrash Bohri weddings" to get a spoonful of it.It blends Gujarati, Parsi, Mughlai and Maharastrian influences, and is often enjoyed by groups of friends or families, who eat from the same large steel platter, or "thaal".For his first "pop-up" lunch, Mr Kapadia charged guests 700 rupees (8, $11) per head for a traditional seven-course banquet.By the time they had finished eating he knew the idea had potential.Image caption Mutton Khichda -

How the search for a 'death ray' led to radar:::::Image copyright Getty Images You can trace the extent of our reliance on air travel to many inventions.The jet engine, perhaps, or the aeroplane itself.But sometimes inventions need other inventions to unlock their full potential.For the aviation industry, that story starts with the invention of the death ray, or at least an attempt to design a death ray, back in 1935.Officials in the British Air Ministry were worried about falling behind Nazi Germany in the technological arms race.The death ray idea intrigued them: they had been offering a 1,000 prize for anyone who could zap a sheep at a hundred paces.So far, nobody had claimed it.But should they fund more active research?Was a death ray even possible?Image copyright Sasha Image caption Harry Grindell Matthews claimed to have invented a death ray in 1923, but couldn't persuade the British government to buy it Unofficially, they sounded out Robert Watson Watt, of the Radio Research Station.And he posed an abstract maths question to his colleague Skip Wilkins."Suppose, just suppose," said Watson Watt to Wilkins, "that you had eight pints of water, 1km [3,000ft] above the ground."And suppose that water was at 98F [37C], and you wanted to heat it to 105F."How much radio frequency power would you require, from a distance of 5km?"Opportunity Skip Wilkins was no fool.He knew that eight pints was the amount of blood in an adult human, 98F was normal body temperature and 105F was warm enough to kill you, or at least make you pass out, which - if you're behind the controls of an aeroplane - amounts to much the same thing.So Wilkins and Watson Watt understood each other, and they quickly agreed the death ray was hopeless: it would take too much power.But they also saw an opportunity.Clearly, the ministry had some cash to spend on research.Perhaps Watson Watt and Wilkins could propose some alternative way for them to spend it?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Robert Watson Watt played a key role in developing radar technology Wilkins pondered.It might be possible, he suggested, to transmit radio waves and detect - from the echoes - the location of oncoming aircraft long before they could be seen.Watson Watt dashed off a memo to the Air Ministry's newly formed Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence.Would they be interested in pursuing such an idea?They would indeed.What Skip Wilkins was describing became known as radar.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.As Robert Buderi describes in his book The Invention That Changed the World, the Germans, the Japanese and the Americans all independently started work on it too.Spectacular breakthrough But by 1940, it was the British who had made a spectacular breakthrough: the resonant cavity magnetron, a radar transmitter far more powerful than its predecessors.Pounded by Nazi bombers, Britain's factories would struggle to put the device into production.But America's factories could.For months, British leaders plotted to use the magnetron as a bargaining chip for American secrets in other fields.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Prime Minister Winston Churchill decided Britain should share its radar research with the US Then Winston Churchill took power, and decided that desperate times called for desperate measures.Nerve-wracking journey Britain would simply tell the Americans what they had, and ask for help.So in August 1940, a Welsh physicist named Eddie Bowen endured a nerve-wracking journey with a black metal chest containing a dozen prototype magnetrons.First, he took a black cab across London: the cabbie refused to let the clunky metal chest inside, so Bowen had to hope it wouldn't fall off the roof rack.Then, he took a long train ride to Liverpool, sharing a compartment with a mysterious, sharply dressed, military-looking man who spent the entire journey ignoring the young scientist and silently reading a newspaper.Then, he took a ship across the Atlantic.What if it were hit by a German U-boat?The Nazis couldn't be allowed to recover the magnetrons; two holes were drilled in the crate to make sure it would sink if the boat did.But the boat didn't.Image copyright MIT Museum Image caption MIT's Radiation Laboratory went on to spawn 10 Nobel laureates The magnetron stunned the Americans.Their research was years off the pace.President Roosevelt approved funds for a new laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - uniquely, for the American War effort, administered not by the military but a civilian agency.Industry got involved: the very best American academics were headhunted to join Bowen and his British colleagues.Patchy rollout By any measure, MIT's Radiation Laboratory - known as the Rad Lab - was a resounding success.It spawned 10 Nobel laureates.The radar it developed, detecting planes and submarines, helped to win the War.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Radar played a crucial role in helping Britain and her allies win World War Two But urgency in times of war can quickly be lost in times of peace.It seems obvious that civilian aviation would need radar too, given how quickly it was expanding.In 1945, at the War's end, US domestic airlines carried seven million passengers.By 1955, this figure had risen to 38 million.And the busier the skies, the more useful radar would be at preventing collisions.But rollout was slow and patchy.Some airports installed it; many didn't.In most airspace, planes weren't tracked at all.Pilots submitted their flight plans in advance, which should in theory ensure that no two planes were in the same place at the same time.But avoiding collisions ultimately came down to a four-word protocol: "see and be seen".Disastrous crash On 30 June 1956, two passenger flights departed Los Angeles Airport, three minutes apart: one was bound for Kansas City, one for Chicago.Their planned flight paths intersected above the Grand Canyon, but at different heights.Then thunderclouds developed.One plane's captain radioed to ask permission to fly above the storm.The air traffic controller cleared him to go to "1,000 on top" - 1,000ft above cloud cover.See and be seen.Nobody knows for sure what happened: planes then had no "black box" flight recorders, and there were no survivors.At just before 10:31, air traffic control heard a garbled radio transmission: "Pull up!We are going in..." Image copyright Alamy Image caption The 1956 crash was a watershed moment in the history of airline safety From the pattern of the wreckage, strewn for miles across the canyon floor, the planes seem to have approached each other at a 25-degree angle, presumably through a cloud.Investigators speculated that both pilots had been distracted by trying to find gaps in the clouds, so passengers could enjoy the scenery.Accidents happen.The question is what risks we're willing to run for economic benefits.More from Tim Harford: Why did we use leaded petrol for so long?How the smartphone became so smart Battery bonanza: From frogs' legs to mobiles and electric cars How economics killed the antibiotic dream That question is becoming pertinent again with respect to crowded skies: many people have high hopes for unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones.They're already being used for everything from film-making to crop-spraying.Companies such as Amazon expect the skies of our cities soon to be buzzing with grocery deliveries.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There have been occasions of near misses between drones and other aircraft Civil aviation authorities are grappling with what to approve.Drones have "sense-and-avoid" technology, and it's pretty good, but is it good enough?The crash over the Grand Canyon certainly concentrated minds.If technology existed to prevent things like this, shouldn't we make more effort to use it?Within two years, what's now known as the Federal Aviation Administration was born in the United States.And American skies today are about 20 times busier still.The world's biggest airports now see planes taking off and landing at an average of nearly twice a minute.Collisions are absurdly rare, no matter now cloudy the conditions.That's thanks to many things, but it's largely thanks to radar.Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
Could a hacker hijack your connected car?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption What if your self-driving car took on a mind of its own?As more carmakers adopt "over the air (OTA)" software updates for their increasingly connected and autonomous cars, is the risk of hacker hijack also increasing?Imagine jumping in your car but being taken somewhere you didn't want to go - into oncoming traffic, say, or even over a cliff.That may seem like an extreme scenario, but the danger is real.Hackers showed two years ago that they could remotely take control of a Chrysler Jeep.And earlier this year, Tesla boss Elon Musk warned about the dangers of hackers potentially taking control of thousands of driverless cars."I think one of the biggest concerns for autonomous vehicles is somebody achieving a fleet-wide hack," he said, speaking at a National Governors Association meeting."In principle, if someone was able to... hack all the autonomous Teslas, they could say - I mean just as a prank - they could say 'send them all to Rhode Island' - across the United States."And that would be the end of Tesla, and there would be a lot of angry people in Rhode Island."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tesla can update its cars' software wirelessly, but what are the risks?Mr Musk insists that a kill switch "that no amount of software can override" would "ensure that you gain control of the vehicle and cut the link to the servers", thus preventing the Rhode Island scenario.As cars become more sophisticated, incorporating semi-autonomous features such as lane keeping, automatic braking and self parking, and their "infotainment" systems are connected to the internet, the amount of software code needed to control these systems is ballooning.Keeping all these software programs updated has typically required drivers to visit the dealership."For automakers and their customers alike, such repair-shop visits are a huge waste of time and money, and online updates can significantly reduce this," explains Dr Markus Heyn, board member of automotive electronics and processing supplier, Bosch.So OTA updates give manufacturers the ability to respond quickly as problems arise.And fixing bugs this way is safer than sending out physical USB sticks - which is what Chrysler did to patch its Jeep.Critics pointed out that criminals could have intercepted the USB sticks and sent out their own malware-infected versions instead.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Can you be sure your self-driving car is taking you where you want to go?It's hardly surprising then that there are strong moves in the industry towards OTA updates, which mean that new features can be added, and bugs patched, in just an hour or two, all without inconvenience to the owner.General Motors, for example, says it expects to be updating engine software using its OnStar network by the end of this decade, thanks to a new electrical architecture for its vehicles.Meanwhile, Bosch is planning to start offering OTA updates through control units and in-car communication infrastructure developed in-house, distributing the updates via its "internet of things" (IoT) cloud.Research consultancy IHS Markit estimates that by 2022, 160 million vehicles globally will have the capability to upgrade their onboard computer systems over the air.Electric carmaker Tesla recently demonstrated the benefits of OTA updates when Hurricane Irma was threatening Florida early in September.As people were warned they should evacuate, Tesla owners were given an unexpected and potentially life-saving freebie - an extra 45 miles of range.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Florida Tesla owners fleeing Hurricane Irma were given extra range via an over-the-air update The ability to go further without a recharge was already built into the cars, but was unavailable to drivers until the company unlocked extra battery capacity."We have a certain number of cars which we sell at a 60kW [kilowatt] price point, but for reasons of manufacturing efficiency we install a 75kW battery, which people can upgrade," a spokeswoman explains."A customer wrote to us and asked if it would be possible to increase it temporarily as they were planning their route out of Florida."Tesla unlocked the extra power by sending an OTA update to the cars via wi-fi or 4G.But there's no doubt that OTA updates present a new set of risks.For a start, we've all, at one time or another, attempted to update the software on our computer or phone, only for the process to go wrong.An unusable car could be rather more of a problem than a "bricked" - or unusable - phone.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images In 2015, 15% of car recalls in the US were related to software errors, up from 5% four years before.When an update fails it's automatically re-sent, but this doesn't always have the desired effect.On one occasion early last year, a Tesla software update designed to add an "autopilot" feature is believed to have affected the climate control of thousands of vehicles.Then there is the risk of "man-in-the-middle" attacks - hackers intercepting the updates in transit.This is why extra special care is taken over OTA updates, says Robert Moran, an expert in car connectivity and security at NXP Semiconductors.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption You wouldn't want hackers taking control of your car on this road...or any other for that matter "There are checks at each stage of the update process," he says."Updated software coming over the air is going to be received in parallel."Only once it's passed a number of security checks - Does it have validation?Is it from a trusted source?- is the new software actually used."It's at a different level to what we have with laptops today."Manufacturers are also addressing the hacker threat by isolating the various systems in the car so that, for example, the radio is isolated from the steering wheel, the powertrain from the brakes - each system protected by its own encryption."Ultimately, as cars have become more connected, it does potentially create a bigger target," admits Mr Moran, "and hackers have always altered their techniques as technology changes."But, he argues: "The fact that we can provide over-the-air updates is a security feature in itself, as it gives us the ability to respond and make changes."Carmakers know that consumer trust is crucial, so security it paramount.The big question is whether they are cleverer than the hackers.

Copley Center for Costume Design at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Deborah Nadoolman-Landis is well placed to offer an opinion.She's been a costume designer for more than 40 years and her work on Coming to America, the 1988 comedy starring Eddie Murphy, secured her an Oscar nomination.Image copyright Elizabeth Hotson Image caption Deborah Nadoolman-Landis designed the outfits for Raiders of the Lost Ark In the industry, she's affectionately known as the "Mother of Indiana Jones" for designing the outfits worn in Raiders of the Lost Ark."People are supposed to fall in love with the people on screen and when you fall in love with Indiana Jones you want something from the character.Memorabilia is an extension of falling in love with the film."It doesn't stop at cinema, she adds.Ms Nadoolman-Landis also designed the costumes for Michael Jackson's 1983 Thriller music video, which "everyone was obsessed with" at the time."Michael's red jacket ended up being sold for $1.2m (900,000)," she says.But not everything in the world of memorabilia costs the earth, says Jon Baddeley, head of Bonhams auction house in the UK.Granted, Bonhams New York sold the piano from the film Casablanca for $3.4m, and Mr Baddeley hopes to sell a Robby the Robot prop, used in the 1956 classic Forbidden Planet, for seven figures at an upcoming auction.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bonhams New York sold the piano from Casablanca for $3.4m But he says it is quite possible to start a memorabilia collection for free."The film posters and lobby cards made to advertise films in cinemas often get thrown away.So why not make friends with your cinema manager and ask for posters or cut-outs when you see a film you like?"So could today's rubbish be a future collector's item?An original poster for the 1933 monster adventure film King Kong can fetch around 70,000."Who knows?"says Mr Baddeley."But remember, whatever you buy you've got to live with it.Have it framed and enjoy it.If it goes up in value you've got a double whammy, if not, you've still got something you enjoy."At the auction, Stephen Lane, the head of Prop Store, gives me a whistle-stop tour of the day's top lots.He won't be giving anything away for free but says that, in amongst the stratospherically expensive nuggets of movie gold, there are some very affordable items.Image copyright Prop Store Image caption A creature costume from Aliens was sold for 50,000 "The lots start at 40 to 60.For that you'd be buying crew items or gifts, things like call sheets which were used in the production.It might not be quite as personal but it's still something from your favourite film."That's good news for first-time auction visitor and Blade Runner fan, Chris Dagger."I don't have a big budget, the most I can spend is around 500," concedes Mr Dagger."I've got my eye on the Blade Runner crew jacket.I've always been a fan of the film and with the new one coming out, I'd love to buy it."The jacket in question is dark maroon satin with the name "Tim" stitched onto the front.More stories from the BBC's Business Brain series looking at interesting business topics from around the world: The firms that donate as many goods as they sell How do you like your wine - with a cork or screw-cap?Are changeable heels the end to women's sore feet?Do the colours you wear at work matter?"I don't have much chance of getting it," says Mr Dagger."There are people here with a lot of money to spend, a lot more than I've got, but we'll see."In the imposing auditorium of the BFI Imax the auction gets underway.Things don't look good for Chris.A single grey T-shirt, embossed with "Peace through superior firepower", which was worn in the film Aliens, is sold for 3,000.And a full alien creature costume from the same film fetches 50,000.Image copyright Elizabeth Hotson Image caption Chris Dagger bid for a Blade Runner crew jacket Chris holds his number "26" bidding card nervously, waiting for his lot to be called.The auctioneer announces a starting bid of 250, and within seconds Mr Dagger is pushed to his maximum bid of 500 for the Blade Runner jacket.There are no further bids in the auditorium, but there's an agonising wait as the auctioneer checks whether other offers have come in by phone or email.None have, and to his delight and astonishment, Mr Dagger gets what he came for.Out in the refreshment area, he takes a couple of deep breaths and poses for photos next to a poster for Blade Runner 2049, the film's soon-to-be released sequel."It's such an iconic film and if you're a fan you know all the trials and tribulations they went through to make it."And here we are, surrounded by posters for the current film.I'm just really happy, there's not much more I can say."With the 22% buyer's premium, VAT and shipping charges, the final bill is 700, which doesn't make the jacket a cheap purchase.But Chris says it was definitely worth it.
Why big brand perfumes may be losing their allure:::::Image copyright Gallivant Image caption Nick Steward is the founder of Gallivant fragrances Corporate giants such as Estee Lauder, L'Oreal and Coty have dominated the fragrance market, but could that be about to change?"Everything smells the same - people are getting bored of the big brands and want something different," says Nick Steward, the London-based founder of a new fragrance brand, Gallivant.He is convinced that there is a growing appetite for "something more personal that other people don't have".Mr Steward decided to start his own company after several years as creative director of the trendy Paris house L'Artisan Parfumeur."I wanted to do something clever and interesting, avoiding all the froth, focused on the best materials," he says.He now sells his fragrances online and via specialist retailers in the US, Italy, Germany and as far away as Australia.Image copyright Gallivant Image caption Gallivant fragrances are smaller than the standard industry size The Gallivant range of unisex fragrances are inspired by and named after cities such as Tel Aviv and London.They are packaged in air-travel-friendly 30ml bottles - smaller than the standard industry sizes.Mr Steward says that also makes them more affordable, reflecting consumers' desire to have a variety of fragrances to choose from.Reception from both consumers and retailers has been positive since the launch earlier this year, but he admits the road to profitability will be a challenge: "It's a really tough business to make money in."He is seeking a slice of the fragrance market - worth about $27bn (20bn; 22bn) a year globally - but it is dominated by corporate giants such as Estee Lauder, L'Oreal and Coty.Image copyright Chanel Image caption Chanel's latest campaign stars Kristen Stewart These firms spend tens of millions of dollars a year in a bid to make their fragrances seem impossibly alluring to consumers, using celebrities such as Kristen Stewart, star of the latest Chanel campaign, or Charlize Theron, who features in ads for Dior J'Adore.Seeing glamorous ads on TV, in the cinema or in magazines means consumers are more likely to try, if not buy, one of the hundreds of perfumes on the market.Despite the daunting competition, Michael Edwards, publisher of global perfume database Fragrances of the World, says some consumers are favouring niche and artisan fragrance brands like Gallivant because they offer something special that none of their friends will have.He believes that innovation in the sector is coming from smaller brands because the big players are afraid of taking risks.The big brands want a new launch to appeal to as wide a range of consumers as possible, meaning they often produce something "bland", he says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Coty, behind brands including Gucci Bloom, reported a loss in August "The future lies in bespoke - younger people want something of their own.While marketing is crucial, word of mouth is even more crucial," says Mr Edwards.The fact that some of the bigger names in the industry are struggling suggests he may be right.Even Coty - the New York beauty brand behind famous names such as Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, Gucci, Hugo Boss and Chloe - has faced headwinds this year.In August, it reported a surprise quarterly loss that was partly blamed on "materially" higher marketing costs for the launch of new fragrances, including Gucci Bloom and Hugo Boss Tonic.L'Oreal, which sells fragrances under brands including Yves Saint Laurent, Ralph Lauren and Diesel, also reported disappointing sales and profits for its most recent quarter.Image copyright Mike Masoni Image caption Michael Edwards founded the Fragrances of the World guide But Roshida Khanom, an analyst at market research firm Mintel, says the industry giants are not taking the threat from upstart rivals lying down.Chanel, one of the world's most well known perfume makers, has revamped its range, launching No5 L'Eau in time for the Christmas rush last year.The new version of Chanel's classic fragrance - aimed squarely at younger generations - helped boost sales of the No5 range by a fifth.At the same time, the French company also launched its first new fragrance in 15 years last month, Gabrielle, with a big-budget ad campaign.Image copyright Getty Images What do people want from a perfume?The experience of wearing the fragrance - not the bottle or the packaging - is still the most important thing for consumers, says Michael Edwards, publisher of global perfume database, Fragrances of the World.Most people want a scent that is "pretty easy to like", he says.A fragrance has to entice at first sniff with a compelling "top note", and convince the buyer that it will linger sufficiently long on his or her skin.Above all else, he says: "It must make the wearer feel special."Retailers will be hoping that the launch will help return the fragrance sector to modest growth in the UK after two years of what Ms Khanom calls "disappointing sales".Mintel estimates UK sales will be worth about 1.5bn this year, making it the fifth-biggest market globally behind Brazil, the US, Russia and France.As with other retail sectors, she says one of the problems is savvy consumers who try out products in a physical store but then go online to buy it for less.Manufacturers are spending more on the bottle and packaging, as well as marketing, in a bid to get consumers to buy their fragrances.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some consumers think celebrity fragrances are "tacky" But the power of another popular trick - releasing a fragrance emblazoned with the name of a celebrity, such as Britney Spears, Beyonce or Jennifer Lopez - appears to be waning.Mintel says that a third of consumers describe this approach as tacky."Celebrity fragrances are just not aspirational in the way they used to be," says Ms Khanom.Of course, for Gallivant's Mr Steward this is good news.But while some Gallivant buyers want it to remain a tiny brand only they know about for "bragging rights", Mr Steward says that is not sustainable."I can't live just selling five bottles a year."
Modernising female voice for Qatar:::::Image caption Sheikha Hind represents a young, modern face for the blockaded Qatari ruling family If the personal is political, then Sheikha Hind, a senior member of Qatar's ruling royal family, gives a very direct answer to her views on the end of the driving ban for women in Saudi Arabia."I have two asthmatic boys and when you need to take them in an emergency at 02:00 - and your husband is on a business trip... We're talking about safety.""It's a great decision," she says, as a parent as well as a driver, distancing herself from any suggestion that women should not have equal rights in such matters.Sheikha Hind, 33, is the sister of the ruler of the wealthy state of Qatar - a country currently at the centre of a tense blockade and Middle Eastern power struggle.If Qatar's neighbours want to isolate the country, Sheikha Hind is on a mission to reach out and present a distinctly modern, young and female face to the outside world.Image copyright Adrian Haddad Image caption Almost two-thirds of students in Qatar are women "When the blockade happened we were all shocked.We didn't see it coming."And, speaking in London, she says she wants to counter perceptions of her country being an "ultra-conservative" Muslim state.Her own background is determinedly international, having been a student at Duke University in the United States and at University College London in the UK.This exposed her to some of the narrow views held by young Westerners about the Arab world."When I was in America, I got a comment that I thought you lived in tents," she says."What I'd like people to understand is that we're as normal as you are."We might have different traditions and cultures, but that doesn't make us very different.We all want highly educated citizens.We all want to have opportunities for every single person in our country."Image caption Qatar has a policy of investing in education for a future "knowledge economy" Education has been a big deal for Qatar - including pouring huge amounts into building a campus for eight international and two Qatari universities.Sheikha Hind is now chief executive of the Qatar Foundation, the vehicle created almost 20 years ago for an epic-scale investment in education.It has the hard-headed ambition of turning Qatar into a "knowledge economy" built on a well-educated workforce - ready for when the income from gas and oil runs out."In the end, we're a very small country.If we can make sure that the majority of our residents are educated so that they can be active citizens, then we'll be satisfied.We still have a long way to go, but we've started."But education is about asking difficult questions.For instance, can students discuss the merits of democracy over an autocracy?"I'm sure they have those debates," she says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Gulf state of Qatar has been transformed by the income from gas and oil "That's something we teach our students.You think for yourself, you listen to every side of an argument.We support that approach.""We have academic freedom in our campus and that encourages dialogue and any topic or issue," she says.Although she adds that in defining "democracy", there is a wide "spectrum" of meanings.In terms of women's access to education, she says that 65% of students in Qatar are women - and the current challenge is to recruit more men into higher education.She is from a line of strong women - daughter of the Sheikha Moza, mother of the current ruler and often described as one of the most influential women in the Middle East.Growing up in the centre of the country's ruling family, she says "work and personal life are not really divided".She is part of the next generation of Qatar's royal family, redefining the next stage of the country's development.Image copyright Education Above All Image caption Education Above All has been supporting education for refugees in Lebanon This will mean investing even more in education - and finding better ways to motivate wealthy young people who have grown up without any hardship to spur them on.Sheikha Hind says she is looking to develop different types of school to raise standards and to tackle the problem of motivation.The blockade has so far not stopped one of Qatar's biggest below-the-radar exports - education to some of the world's poorest countries and out-of-school refugees.Although Qatar has high profile "soft power" projects, not least hosting the World Cup, its extensive funding for education, including under the Education Above All banner, has often been curiously hidden away."It's a very cultural thing.It's also rooted in Islam.If you donate money, you don't put your name on it," she said."We're not very good at taking credit.It's something that we'll have to change and we'll have to talk about it," said Sheikha Hind.As with so many parts of this question of Qatar's identity, she says "the perception is very different from the reality".More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch.
US business schools 'hurt by Trump immigration policies':::::Image copyright Nottingham Business School Image caption Nottingham Business School - part of Nottingham Trent University - has seen international student applicants increase by 25% Mention Nottingham in a conversation and for many people the first thing that comes to mind is Robin Hood.I've had the Disney movie song "Robin Hood and Little John walking through the forest" stuck in my head since visiting the city.But the story being told here today is very different from the fable of old.Instead of stealing from the rich to give to the poor, it's students hoping to get rich who are flocking to this city two hours north of London.Nottingham Business School - which is part of Nottingham Trent University - has seen a 25% rise in interest from international students this year.That's believed to be partially due to an unlikely source: Donald Trump.While many Americans might have voted for the president partly because they valued his business acumen, an unlikely casualty of his immigration policies is said to be American business schools.'Exaggerated' shift "One of the things we noticed post the [presidential] election in the US last November was a change in students' expressed intent to study in the US," says Sangeet Chowfla, the president and chief executive of the Graduate Management Admissions Council (GMAC).The GMAC is the non-profit organisation that administers the GMAT, a standardised test most students around the world take to get into business school.It published a survey of 1,000 global business schools this month, which found that international student interest in American business schools had declined by nearly two-thirds since the 2016 presidential election.Meanwhile, international student interest in programs in Canada, for example, has increased by nearly the same amount.The same goes for programs in continental Europe and the UK.Image copyright GMAC Image caption International students have said the US election result impacted their application decision While that trend has been happening for some time, Mr Chowfla says he was surprised by the steep drop."The magnitude of the change was exaggerated this year," he says.Part of the decline was due to student concerns about immigration policies - most notably, the ability to get an H1B visa after graduating.The H1B is typically given to "skilled" immigrants to the US, like computer programmers, and 85,000 visas are awarded each year via a lottery system.It is often used by companies in Silicon Valley to bring in tech talent - but it has also been used by outsourcing companies.Critics, including President Trump, have said those companies use the program to hire foreign workers instead of Americans - and he's proposed reforming it.That's scared international students, particularly those pursuing business degrees, who use the programs as stepping stones to better or more well-paid careers.A global degree While the number of foreign business students in the US may be declining, for many American students, business remains a global enterprise.Monica Kelly is one of those students.Though she hails from Seattle, Washington, she's spent most of her career in Los Angeles."I was in a position where I reached senior management level and I was looking for a way to expand my global opportunities," she says.Monica decided that in order to seize those opportunities, she had to go abroad for business school.That's how she found herself at Nottingham.And she's not alone.At Nottingham, I spoke with two other students from India, and the program boasts a class made up of people from 104 countries.Almost all of them said business was an increasingly global endeavour.Because of that, they fretted they wouldn't be able to get international experience in the US, a country they feel has increasingly turned inwards.Image copyright David Baird Image caption NBS Dean Baback Yazdani said UK business schools suffered 5 years ago after new visa restrictions were introduced That they're attracted to a business school in the UK, however, is no accident."In the UK, we have gone through a period where the MBA [the main business school qualification] suffered quite a bit," says Baback Yazdani, the dean of Nottingham Business School.That was partially due to visa restrictions that were put in place five years ago, which limited the ability for graduate students to get post-study work visas.Since then, Nottingham has worked hard to build its program around "experiential learning" - meaning that in addition to traditional classes, students travel abroad to work for companies in places like Italy and Rome.The school also focused on helping students secure internships at companies that might sponsor them for visas, or that might be able to hire them in other parts of the world.Businesses close to Nottingham include Boots, which has merged with the pharmacy chain Walgreens in the US."Overall the MBAs are a saturated market - and it's a global market," says Mr Yazdani."There are very sophisticated consumers for this market.So they know what they want and they know it's everywhere.So they are looking for differentiators and value."Speaking of value - at an annual price of 16,500, or around $22,000 at today's exchange rates - the Nottingham program is under half what most students at US business schools end up paying per year.Lessons for the US?Today, there are more than 5,000 students in its various business degree courses.Image caption Nottingham is known for Robin Hood, who hid out in nearby Sherwood forest Nottingham's administration says that their pivot could possibly help US schools."My guess is that's probably happening now in the [US], and that the universities [there] will be going through the same trajectories," says Nottingham Business School lecturer Phil Considine."We're kind of five years ahead of them."In Nottingham's atrium, banners are strung from the rafters welcoming international students, who start classes today.Looking out through the school's windows, you can see the beginning of the famed Sherwood Forest - where story has it Robin Hood hid out with his merry men.For US business schools, who might not be feeling too merry, "stealing" a lesson from Nottingham might be a good way to make it through leaner times.
Can ice structures solve a Himalayan water crisis?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Engineers in the Himalayan Desert are coming up with solutions which could help the world's water crisis.Credit: Natural History Unit It's midnight at 3,500m (11,000ft) above sea level, the coldest time of the day, in one of the coldest places on the planet.In the middle of winter, temperatures here plunge to -30C (-22F).A group of 10 volunteers are gathering; putting into place a plan to solve a water crisis in Ladakh, the northern most region of India, in the high Himalayas.They are building manmade ice structures, more than 30m tall, that they hope will melt early in the spring and give villagers and their farms the water they need.The ice structures are the brainchild of engineer Sonam Wangchuk.Born in Ladakh, he has worked for several years to find innovative solutions to everyday problems facing the local communities."We tend to get the solutions created in New York or New Delhi, but they don't work for us here in the mountains.I believe mountain people have to find solutions for themselves," he says.Image copyright Rolex/ Stefan Walker Image caption Sonam Wangchuk is the inventor of the ice structures Villagers in Ladakh face harsh living conditions.Road blockages in the winter months mean they are cut off from the rest of the country for most of winter.Mr Wangchuk says the effects of climate change are adding to the problem.He says there are signs that global warming is damaging the delicate climatic water balance in the Hindu Kush Himalayan range."We can see that the glaciers are receding, to higher altitudes.There is less water in spring, but in the summer months we have experienced dangerous flooding.The water flow in the valley has become erratic," he explains.Mr Wangchuk was inspired by a fellow engineer working in the region, Chewang Norphel.Mr Norphel had created flat artificial glaciers at heights of 4,000m (13,123ft) and above.But the villagers were reluctant to climb up to those levels.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Life in Ladakh has always depended on glacial melt-water Mr Wangchuk says he was crossing a bridge when the idea for his ice structures crystallised."I saw that there was ice under the bridge, which at 3,000m (9,842ft) was the warmest and lowest altitude in the whole area," he recalls."And this was in May.So I thought - direct sunlight makes the ice melt, but if we protect it from the sun, we can store ice right here."Ladakh Remote villages at an altitude of 2700m (8860ft) to 4000m (13,123ft) above sea level Population of almost 300,000 Winter desert temperatures as low as -30C (-22F) Meagre rainfall of on average only 100 mm annually And so, in 2013, he and his students from the Secmol Alternative School began to create prototypes of the ice structures near the village of Phyang.They call the structures "stupas" because they bear resemblance to Tibetan religious stupas - elegant hemispherical or conical structures with pointed tops that contain relics, such as the remains of Buddhist monks.The technology behind the ice structures is simple.Pipes are initially buried under the ground, below the frost line, before the final section of the pipe then rises vertically.Due to the difference in height, temperature, and the gravitational force, pressure builds up in the pipe.The stream water eventually flows up and out from the pipe's raised tip like a fountain.The sub-zero air freezes the water to gradually form a pyramid like structure.Image copyright Sonam Wangchuk Image caption In late spring, the melting ice stupa provides water for the crops "We are freezing water that goes unused in winter and, because of the geometric shape it doesn't melt till late spring," says Mr Wangchuk.In late spring the artificial glacier starts to melt and water can be used for drip-irrigation of crops.The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators.As the ice structures look like the familiar religious stupas, Mr Wangchuk believes that this leads to a better sense of ownership amongst the locals.After some initial success with one ice structures in 2014 the nearby Phyang Monastery got involved.The Buddhist monks asked the team to build 20 ice stupas.A successful crowd funding campaign raised $125,200 (96,500).This money funded a 2.3km (1.43 mile) pipeline which brought water down to Phyang.Mr Wangchuk claims this pipeline can support at least 50 ice stupas.Mr Wangchuk is also now helping to build ice stupas near the winter sports resort town of St Moritz in Switzerland.Image copyright Rolex/ Stefan Walker Image caption The ice stupa team are working to made many more of the structures After an initial prototype is built and tested, the Swiss want to expand the project to counter the phenomenon of fast-melting glaciers in the upper reaches of the Swiss mountains."In exchange for the ice stupa technology, the Swiss will share their expertise and experience in sustainable tourism development with the people of Phyang, to revive the dying economy of the village," says Mr Wangchuk.But he feels positive about the future."We want to train enthusiastic youth through our university, and eventually we are hoping to create a whole generation of ice or glacier entrepreneurs.''
What will stop these self-driving lorries colliding?:::::Image copyright Scania Image caption Scania believes 5G could improve communications between "platooning" lorries What impact could 5G - the new high-speed mobile technology being trialled around the world - have on the way we work and play?Swedish transport company Scania believes lorries could use far less fuel if they drove much closer together, controlled by wirelessly communicating onboard computers.But to prevent these "platooning" lorries crashing into each other, you'd better be sure your communications are fast and reliable.So Scania is working with Ericsson on trials of the new 5G (fifth generation) wireless broadband technology, due to be rolled out globally in 2020.It promises much faster data transfer speeds, greater coverage and more efficient use of the spectrum bandwidth."Platooning works very well with wi-fi, but in dense traffic situations with many vehicles communicating, 5G is designed to offer more reliable communication," says Andreas Hoglund, Scania's senior engineer for intelligent transport systems.This is because 5G direct communication is designed to handle fast moving objects and congestion more efficiently, he says."Faster communication will make it possible to reduce the distance between vehicles in the platoon, which might further reduce the air drag and give positive effects on fuel consumption," he explains.This could help create "a more efficient, greener" world.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: What is 5G?5G is designed to accommodate the growing number of devices reliant on a mobile internet connection - from fridges to cars - and is 10 times faster than the highest speed 4G can manage."It will enable a lot of applications which were unthinkable before," says Mischa Dohler, professor in wireless communications at King's College London.South Korea has plans to implement 5G for the Winter Olympics in February 2018, giving visitors access to virtual reality (VR) content on their mobiles.One of the UK's first 5G test-beds is in Brighton, where non-profit innovation hub, Digital Catapult Centre, has just completed a series of workshops for small businesses."Hypothetically, 5G is fast enough to download a 100GB 4K movie in two-and-a-half minutes," says Richard Scott, innovation manager at Digital Catapult."But it isn't just about speed - [5G] has specific features that will unlock and enable new technologies."Chiefly, these include fewer dropped connections and lower latency - the time it takes for data to be stored or retrieved.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "Wi-fi is fine if you are sitting with a few people in a meeting, or moving slowly around indoors," explains Rahim Tafazolli, head of Surrey University's 5G Innovation Centre."However, once you start to move quickly and the number of people increases to more than 10 - at Waterloo Station, for example - you need to have a system that can hand over connection between radio cells without causing a drop in signal, and which can accommodate several people simultaneously."Wi-fi can't do that."This is because every wi-fi signal has a defined range, whereas 5G will be flexible, enabling mobile devices to switch automatically between the various newly available frequencies.One frequency will be for long-range connections, across rural areas for example; one will be for urban environments, providing high numbers of users with high-speed connectivity; and there will also be a high-capacity frequency for densely populated areas, such as sports stadiums and railway terminals.This flexibility will lead to "an ever-expanding array of new business services", Mr Tafazolli believes, and could be critical to the success of autonomous vehicles and the internet of things.Faster wireless connectivity should also give VR and augmented reality (AR) technologies a boost, argues Digital Catapult's Mr Scott.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Faster mobile connectivity could greatly improve virtual reality experiences "If you have a very detailed, immersive VR experience and you try to run it over a mobile headset currently, there is enough latency... that it makes you feel sick," he explains.So high-quality VR experiences rely on headsets being "tethered" to a computer, which provides the necessary computing power.5G offers the opportunity to recreate high-quality experiences on the move."It could enable you to have an experience comparable with home gaming on your mobile," says Mr Scott, "allowing you to compete or collaborate with other people in real time."Andy Cummins of Brighton-based digital agency, Cogapp, says 5G will allow his firm to create much more exciting AR and VR content for visitors to museums and galleries."Without [5G] these types of experiences... would at best seem laggy and unintuitive," he says.And Tim Fleming, founder of Future Visual, another Brighton company preparing to trial 5G, says: "We are very interested in in-store retail VR experiences, and creating a flagship VR experience that can be taken to any location."At the moment we have to use a dedicated PC, but with 5G you just need a headset and a mobile device.The heavy lifting is done in the cloud.That's very interesting."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 5G enthusiasts say it could underpin smart cities and augmented reality services Of course, 5G roll-out is not without its technical challenges.Installing all the base stations and antennae is very expensive, and many of today's devices will not be compatible with the new technology.It is not clear at the moment who is going to pay for it.But Ericsson's head of 5G commercialisation, Thomas Noren, is confident that 5G services will be cheaper to run because the network will be more energy efficient and production and operational costs will be lower.There is clearly still much detail to iron out, but research consultancy Ovum predicts that there will be 389 million 5G subscriptions globally by the end of 2022.Users still struggling with patchy 4G coverage maybe forgiven for being a little sceptical about the ambitious claims being made for 5G.But the potential to transform a number of businesses - and create many new ones - is clearly there.
Monarch's rise and fall charts British holiday trends:::::Image copyright Globus Image caption Monarch was originally part of Globus - which pioneered package holiday tours Monarch, which has just gone into bankruptcy, was part of a travel group whose origins reach back 90 years, long before the days of mass air travel.Through the heady 1970s and 80s, when foreign package holidays were the height of fashion, to the new era of relentless competition from budget airlines, Monarch still plied the skies.But by 2017 fierce competition had made the business untenable.And on 2 October it ceased operating.A history of Monarch In 1928 an enterprising young Swiss Italian, Antonio Mantegazza, spotted a gap in the market.He realised tourists visiting his idyllic corner of Europe might pay to be ferried across Lake Lugano.So he bought a gondola and launched a tourism business that would eventually become travel giant Globus.Forty years later in 1968 the Mantegazza family spotted a new way to ferry tourists their way.They decided to back a new airline being founded by British businessmen, Bill Hodgson and Don Peacock, that would bring British holidaymakers to Europe's beauty spots.Monarch was launched with just two planes operating from a hangar at Luton Airport, and a new era of package holidays took off.Bill Hodgson's daughter, Mary-Anne Hardie, remembers the airline in those days as "one big happy family".While her father was managing director, her mother designed the first uniforms for cabin crew, in canary yellow.The family tested the in-flight meals at dinner time at home.Image copyright MOnarch Image caption Monarch introduced the British public to the affordable package holiday By the 1970s package holidays had really taken off.Brits embraced the chance to take an exotic continental break instead of shivering with a thermos flask in Skegness.Monarch was aimed, not at the wealthy, but at ordinary families: "The man who came home on a Friday and put money in a jam jar to save for a summer holiday," says Ms Hardie.In those days flying felt like a luxury, with coq au vin, boeuf bourguignon and free drinks on the menu.But times were anything but easy.The oil price spike of the early seventies sent another big name in package holidays, Court Line, into administration.Monarch might have gone under too; Miss Hardie remembers her father being "very stressed".But the attitude in the industry was of mutual support says Ms Hardie, "not as cut-throat as it is now" and Monarch survived.It even took on some of Court Line's redundant staff.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Package holidays to the Med have become a summer staple for many British families In the 1980s, while package holidays remained popular, there was a growing market for independent travel, with holiday-makers opting to mix and match their own flights and hotels.Monarch responded by offering its first scheduled flights from Luton to Minorca in 1985.From then on it was competing directly with other carriers, not just as part of a tour operator.Mr Hodgson had retired by then, one of his few regrets being that he'd bought the BAC 1-11 aircraft, that were so much noisier than the Boeing 720 "whispering giants" he'd bought before, says his daughter.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Benidorm became one of Spain's most popular resorts for British visitors In 1995 newly founded low-cost airline easyJet set up its own base alongside Monarch in Luton and the budget airline industry grew rapidly, taking couples on weekend citybreaks, stag and hen parties to ever more exotic destinations, to ski resorts in winter, the beach in summer."With the low cost airlines it was easier to book direct; that's when Monarch started to struggle really," says Ms Hardie.The focus moved away from customer service towards those who offered the cheapest fare.For a while there was room for everyone.And by the time of the financial crisis in 2008 Monarch had 32 aircraft flying to over 100 destinations in India, Africa, Caribbean, United States and Europe.But it couldn't last."The competition was relentless.It was expanding.It had very deep pockets even back when I was running Monarch seven or eight years ago," recalls Tim Jeans, the firm's former managing director."There were warning signs then and I think subsequently the market has only got more difficult."Competition is all fair and normally very, very good for consumers, but ultimately competition can be unsustainable.And the demise of Monarch is a direct result of that," Mr Jeans says.Image copyright Gareth Cattermole Image caption In 2007 Monarch teamed up with record label Hed Kandi to offer less family-oriented holidays to Ibiza Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Monarch's Managing Director at the time was Tim Jeans (L) In 2011 the Arab Spring pushed up oil prices once again.Over several years the Mantegazza family poured money in to patch up Monarch's balance sheet.But finally with a gaping deficit in the company's pension plan, in 2014, the family had had enough.They put a final 50m into the company they had owned for half a century, and sold it on to turnaround specialists Greybull Capital.The company abandoned long haul routes and 700 jobs were cut.It turned out to be only a temporary reprieve.Even a hefty investment from Greybull wasn't enough to bring Monarch up to fighting weight to take on the budget carriers.Terrorist attacks in Egypt, Turkey and Tunisia, the migrant crisis in southern Europe and more recently the weakness of the pound following the EU referendum vote have all kept UK holiday-makers away from some of Monarch's most popular destinations.On 2 October 2017 the airline's accountants KPMG announced the business would close and authorities launched the biggest peacetime repatriation of Brits to bring Monarch's last 110,000 passengers home.But the airline itself has run out of runway.
100 Women: Do women on boards increase company profits?:::::"Having women on company boards leads to better financial performance" came the headlines from report after report, highlighting a business statistic guaranteed to capture the imagination and prompt debate.What better way to encourage companies to focus on equality and diversity than to make them think of their bottom line?In the UK, the 30% Club was set up in 2010 with the aim of having women make up at least 30% of the members on every board.In the US, the Thirty Percent Coalition - a group of people who are chief executives and chairs of their companies - was created to achieve the same thing.Of course, there are many other - and some say better - reasons to argue for gender equality, but we wanted to look at whether this broadly accepted claim is true - does having more women on the board really mean the company makes more money?Academics have warned against jumping to simple conclusions.A report published by Credit Suisse last year said companies with at least one woman director received a better return on their investments compared with companies with all-male boardrooms.They say companies where women made up at least 15% of senior management were 50% more profitable than those where fewer than 10% of senior managers were female.But Prof Alice Eagly, at Northwestern University in the US, says many of the studies commissioned by corporations are "naive" as they don't consider other variables.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some European countries have introduced quotas for female board members She explains that more sophisticated pieces of analysis carried out by academics have shown very small positive correlations between female board members and financial success.But this is an average - in some companies the relationship was neutral and in some it was negative.And proving causation is far harder.It is difficult to say that it is having more women on boards that makes companies do better, rather than other factors - something corporate reports acknowledge.This is because companies with more women on boards are different in other ways, too, according to Prof Eagly.For example, firm size seems to be one of the most significant factors in determining profitability.And larger companies are likely to employ more women at every level.More innovative companies were more likely to use their talent effectively, regardless of gender.And companies that were already more profitable may have been more able to focus efforts on diversity, she says.A study looking at the gender make-up of the top management of the US's biggest firms, not only their board members, found female representation in top management improves firm performance but only in companies that are "focused on innovation".'Add women and stir' And, interestingly, female board members appear to have more of a positive impact on their company's performance in countries where women have more equal rights and treatment overall.It looks like there is a relationship between more successful companies and those with more women in senior positions in general, but it's not enough to simply "add women and stir", as Prof Robin Ely at Harvard Business School puts it.Another study from a group of German, Dutch and Belgian researchers found "the mere representation of females on corporate boards is not related to firm financial performance if other factors are not considered".It relies on there being a good company culture too.If women are in the minority in a room that is hostile to them, they are unlikely to be able to have a positive effect and that applies to other kinds of diversity too, the study suggests.Focusing on numbers without also addressing structural diversity issues is not enough, according to Prof Ely.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In the biggest US companies on the stock market, around 16% of board seats are held by women Looking at how many spaces on a board are filled by women doesn't tell you how influential the board is, and it doesn't tell us whether those women are being listened to and allowed to have an impact, Prof Ely points out, as "not all spots on a board are created equal".There is some evidence that having three women on a board of 12 to 15 people is the tipping point for them to actually be heard and able to have an influence at all.So there are good arguments for the 30% rule - it just doesn't necessarily translate directly to profits.In fact Corinne Post, a professor of organisation management at Lehigh University, says that board members don't have a direct influence on the bottom line of a company, but they do have a greater influence on corporate social responsibility.She found that there was a five times stronger correlation between a company having female board members and stronger performance when it comes to ensuring they are environmentally friendly as a company, or involve themselves in philanthropy for example, than the correlation between female board members and profits.Profitability is highly complex and there's even evidence that chief executives might not have much of an influence on company profits."In companies with any women on their board at all, they tend to have between one and three - are you really saying the gender of three people on a board is going to have an impact on the bottom line?"Prof Ely asks.For Northwestern's Prof Eagly, the most pertinent question is why we would need evidence women bring in more money than men, before they are given equal status on boards."Why should you rule out 50% of the population from important jobs.It's about social justice not about profits."Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
