Florida parts ways with coach McElwain after losses allegedly trigger death threats for football team:::::The University of Florida and Gators Coach Jim McElwain have agreed to part ways Sunday, a day after a third consecutive loss and shortly after he said that its football team and players' families had received death threats over their losing season.McElwains downfall was more about relationships than records (3-4, 3-3 Southeastern Conference).His already strained rapport with administrators reached a new low last Monday when he said Florida players and families had received death threats.The bombshell shocked Athletic Director Scott Stricklin, who had not been previously notified about a potentially harmful situation.Stricklin met with McElwain later that day, and the coach rebuffed a request to provide more information about the threats.The athletic department responded with a statement that essentially criticized McElwain for being uncooperative.McElwain said two days later that he would provide more details about the death threats when it becomes unmanageable, but gave no other details.Stricklin named defensive coordinator Randy Shannon the teams interim coach for the final four games.We want to thank Coach McElwain for his efforts in leading the Gator football program, Stricklin said in a statement.We are confident Coach Shannon will provide the proper guidance to the players and rest of staff during this time, and we will begin a national search for the next head coach.The parties are negotiating McElwains $12.5 million buyout.Florida, which is still paying former coach Will Muschamp, would like to significantly reduce McElwains sum and could use his actions over the last week as leverage.Regardless of the outcome, McElwains tenure will be remembered for failing to fix a floundering offense.Three years ago, McElwain proclaimed he could win with his dog at quarterback.The Gators currently rank 113th in total offense, in triple digits nationally for the third time in McElwains three seasons.McElwain went 22-12 with the Gators, including 4-9 against ranked teams, and became the first coach in league history to take a team to the SEC championship game in his first two years.Florida was eliminated from contention in the Eastern Division with a 42-7 loss to rival Georgia on Saturday.It was Floridas most lopsided loss in the series since 1982.I know what I was brought here to do.Look, we havent been good on offense, I get it, McElwain said on Saturday night.Weve won a few games, but we havent won enough.We havent won a championship.Thats real.Thats life.That is this business, and I take full responsibility for all of it.McElwains problems started long before last week.The former Alabama assistant and Colorado State head coach complained publicly about Floridas facilities shortly after taking the job and openly questioned the schools commitment to the football program two years later.His initial comments came while the Gators were planning to build an indoor practice facility and his most recent ones came after they had announced plans to build a $60 million, stand-alone football facility.Fox Sports analyst Joel Klatt called him out for his history of unsportsmanlike conduct, tweeting: McElwain treated his staff at Colorado State terrible once he got the Florida job that they helped him get...Sorry I dont feel sorry.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Florida Gators oust Jim McElwain as head coach:::::GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida and coach Jim McElwain have agreed to part ways a day after a third consecutive loss and nearly a week after he said his players and their families had received death threats.Athletic director Scott Stricklin made the announcement Sunday and named defensive coordinator Randy Shannon the team's interim coach for the final four games.The parties are negotiating McElwain's $12.5 million buyout.Florida (3-4, 3-3 Southeastern Conference), which is still paying former coach Will Muschamp, would like to significantly reduce McElwain's sum and could use his actions over the last week as leverage.More Florida Gators news Regardless of the outcome, McElwain's tenure will be remembered for failing to fix a floundering offense.Three years ago, McElwain proclaimed he could win with his dog at quarterback.The Gators currently rank 113th in total offense, in triple digits nationally for the third time in McElwain's three seasons."We want to thank Coach McElwain for his efforts in leading the Gator football program," Stricklin said in a statement."We are confident Coach Shannon will provide the proper guidance to the players and rest of staff during this time, and we will begin a national search for the next head coach."McElwain went 22-12 with the Gators, including 4-9 against ranked teams, and became the first coach in league history to take a team to the SEC championship game in his first two years.Florida was eliminated from contention in the Eastern Division with a 42-7 loss to rival Georgia on Saturday.It was Florida's most lopsided loss in the series since 1982.McElwain's downfall was more about relationships than records.His already-strained rapport with administrators reached a new low last Monday when he said Florida players and families had received death threats.The bombshell shocked Stricklin, who had not been previously notified about a potentially harmful situation.Stricklin met with McElwain later that day, and the coach rebuffed a request to provide more information about the threats.The athletic department responded with a statement that essentially criticized McElwain for being uncooperative.The school's position was basically this: If there were death threats and administrators did nothing about them, the Gators would be legally liable if something horrible happened.If McElwain exaggerated the threats or made them up altogether, then he essentially sullied an entire fan base without merit.McElwain made the situation even worse two days later when he said he would provide more details about the death threats "when it becomes unmanageable."McElwain seemed resigned to his fate Saturday night."I know what I was brought here to do.Look, we haven't been good on offense, I get it," he said."We've won a few games, but we haven't won enough.We haven't won a championship.That's real.That's life.That is this business, and I take full responsibility for all of it."McElwain's problems started long before last week.The former Alabama assistant and Colorado State head coach complained publicly about Florida's facilities shortly after taking the job and openly questioned the school's commitment to the football program two years later.His initial comments came while the Gators were planning to build an indoor practice facility and his most recent ones came after they had announced plans to build a $60 million, stand-alone football facility.His comments rubbed Florida officials the wrong way.They probably would have found a way to live with them had McElwain delivered on promises to improve an offense that has been mostly dormant for a decade.McElwain didn't make Florida's offense any better than his predecessor and repeatedly failed to adequately develop a quarterback.The Gators surely will hire another offensive-minded coach to start the next rebuild.Mississippi State's Dan Mullen seems like the obvious choice.The 45-year-old Mullen was Florida's offensive coordinator under Urban Meyer and worked for Stricklin in Starkville, Mississippi.His resume includes a No.1 draft pick (Alex Smith), an NFL Rookie of the Year (Dak Prescott) and a Heisman Trophy winner (Tim Tebow).Mullen also is familiar with the pressure of coaching in the SEC and in Gainesville.Other possible candidates: Syracuse's Dino Babers, Iowa State's Matt Campbell, Central Florida's Scott Frost, Washington State's Mike Leach, Southern Methodist's Chad Morris, Memphis' Mike Norvell and South Florida's Charlie Strong.
Chargers win streak comes to an end in Foxborough:::::FOXBOROUGH, Mass.(AP) Tom Brady passed for 333 yards and a touchdown, Stephen Gostkowski added four field goals and the New England Patriots held on to beat the Los Angeles Chargers 21-13 on Sunday.It was the fourth straight victory for the Patriots (6-2).The loss snapped a three-game win streak for the Chargers.Los Angeles (3-5) got on the board first when Melvin Gordon found a seam on the outside and rumbled down the sideline foran 87-yard touchdown run.But the rest of the game was marked by Los Angeles mistakes and inability to move the ball offensively.New England got its lone touchdown via a 2-yard toss from Brady to Rob Gronkowski in the second quarter.The Patriots went 1 for 4 in the red zone, but were able to cobble together the Gostkowki field goals and a safety.The Chargers cut the Patriots lead to 18-13 with 8:30 to play following a 24-yard touchdown pass from Philip Rivers to Travis Benjamin and failed 2-point conversion pass.They got the ball back a final time after New England added Gostkowskis fourth field goal.But Rivers pass with 1 second remaining was intercepted at the goal line by Jonathan Jones.Rivers finished 17 of 30 for 212 yards.Los Angelesmistakes were highlighted in a wild wayin the second quarter when Benjamin muffed a punt inside the Chargers 15, recovered it and retreated all the way to own goal line while trying to reverse field.He was wrapped up there by New Englands Brandon King and tackled in the end zone for a safety.Rivers had a similarly head-scratching play early in the third quarter when he rolled to the outside to escape the pass rush, but had the ball slip out of his hands for a fumble.He recovered, but the play resulted in a 20-yard loss and a sack credited to Patriots linebacker Kyle Van Noy.Other than Gordons touchdown run, the Chargers were mostly ineffective offensively in the opening 30 minutes.They ran only 19 total plays.By comparison, New England passed the ball 26 times in the first two quarters.
Panthers send struggling Buccaneers to fourth straight loss:::::TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Cam Newton threw for 154 yards and one touchdown and Carolina's defense didn't allow a TD for the second straight week, helping the Panthers snap a two-game losing streak with a 17-3 victory over the struggling Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday.Newton rebounded from a subpar performance in a 14-point road loss to the Chicago Bears, leading a 17-play, 82-yard TD drive that consumed more eight minutes of the opening quarter, then completed three passes to Christian McCaffrey to set up a field goal for a 10-0 halftime lead.More Tampa Bay Buccaneers news The Bucs (2-5) have lost four straight.The Panthers put the game away in the fourth quarter, intercepting Jameis Winston twice, with Mike Adams' pick leading to Newton's 25-yard TD pass to Kelvin Benjamin to make it 17-3.Carolina's defense picked up where it left off in only allowing three points against Chicago, which returned a fumble and interception for the only touchdowns in a 17-3 victory that knocked Carolina (5-3) out of first place in the NFC South.The Panthers forced three turnovers by Winston, limiting the Bucs to Patrick Murray's 41-field goal in the third quarter.Linebacker Luke Kuechly returned for Carolina and had a fourth-quarter interception after sitting out the previous week with a concussion.Julius Peppers sacked Winston in the second quarter, forcing a fumble and moving ahead of Hall of Famer Chris Doleman for fourth on the career sack list with 151.Newton completed 18 of 32 passes and was intercepted once.He rushed for a team-high 44 yards, including a 20-yard burst on the drive he finished with his TD pass to Benjamin.The Panthers converted five third downs on the long scoring drive that led to Jonathan Stewart's 1-yard TD run.Winston, who continues to play with a sprained AC joint in his throwing shoulder, was 21 of 38 for 210 yards with two interceptions.Doug Martin rushed for 71 yards on 18 attempts for the Bucs.INJURIES Panthers: None reported during the game.Buccaneers: Played without starting CBs Brent Grimes (shoulder) and Robert McClain (concussion).UP NEXT Panthers: Return home to face division rival Atlanta, a matchup of the last two teams to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl.Buccaneers: Play on the road for the third time in four weeks, traveling to New Orleans.
Houston Texans kneel during anthem in protest of Bob McNair comments:::::A majority of Houston Texans players took a knee Sunday during the national anthem ahead of their game against the Seattle Seahawks in protest against controversial remarks made by the team's owner.Texans owner Bob McNair had met with the team Saturday morning and apologized for his previous comments that "we can't have the inmates running the prison" during a meeting of NFL owners.Even after the meeting with McNair, the Texans held a players meeting in Seattle to decide how to game the game Sunday, ESPN reported, citing a league source.HOUSTON TEXANS OWNER MAKES SECOND APOLOGY FOR 'INMATES RUNNING THE PRISON' REMARK Texans left tackle Duane Brown told ESPN he anticipates "up to 65 to 70 percent" of the team's players could kneel as part of the protest in Seattle, adding the players would not remove the team's decals from their helmets as had been discussed.McNair's remarks caused a firestorm of criticism from athletes inside and outside the NFL and prompted an initial apology from the 79-year-old Friday."I know they were upset," McNair told the Houston Chronicle about his meeting with the players."I wanted to answer their questions.I told them if I had it to do over again I wouldn't use that expression."NFL PLAYERS SEEK MEETING WITH GOODELL, MCNAIR, KAEPERNICK The comment was published in an ESPN The Magazine story about two recent days of meetings among owners, players and others to discuss the protests that have drawn the ire of President Donald Trump.Players, following the lead of former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, say they kneel to protest social injustices, particularly against African-Americans.Trump has sharply criticized the protests and even called on NFL owners to fire players.The meetings earlier this month did not result in a policy change that would require players to stand for the anthem.Owners and players are expected to meet again next week to discuss initiatives.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Preview: Magic riding high heading into matchup against Hornets:::::TV: FOX Sports Florida TIME: Pregame coverage begins at 5:30 p.m. Coming off one of their most impressive performances in recent years, the Orlando Magic will try to ride the momentum to a fourth straight win when they visit the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday night.The Magic completed a two-game homestand with one of the most eye-catching results in the NBA this season Friday night, a 114-87 blowout of the San Antonio Spurs.Evan Fournier led the way with 25 points, 12 of which coming on 4-for-4 3-point shooting.But the Magic was nearly equally efficient inside and out, recording 58 points from the perimeter and 56 from inside the paint against the perennially stingy Spurs.Orlando Magic on FOX Sports Florida "I'm impressed with how we're playing offensively," Magic coach Frank Vogel gushed after the win."Nobody is forcing things at the rim.Nobody's forcing it on the perimeter, and as a result, we're getting better and better looks on each possession.That's why you're seeing the offense clicking the way it's clicking."Orlando's 4-1 start also includes a 114-93 stunner at Cleveland.The Magic won just 29 games last season.Saturday's game opens a four-day three-game trip that will continue through New Orleans and Memphis.The Magic will encounter an old pal in the opener of the trip, one who's playing at a very high level these days.Center Dwight Howard, who played the first eight years of his NBA career in Orlando, is now with his fifth team.The first five games as a Hornet have gone quite well, with Howard averaging 14.4 points and 17.4 rebounds.He has snatched at least 15 rebounds in all five of his games, a first in Charlotte history.Despite getting 19 points and 16 rebounds from Howard, the Hornets are coming off a 109-93 home loss to Houston on Friday.But they are expected to get another productive big man, Cody Zeller, back from a bruised right knee on Sunday.Zeller contributed a total of 40 points, 25 rebounds, eight assists and five blocked shots when the Hornets dominated the Magic last season, sweeping the four-game series by an average of 21.8 points per game.Without Zeller in the lineup, the Hornets have slipped defensively this season, having allowed 100 or more points in three of their five games.They are 0-3 when giving up 100 or more, 2-0 when limiting the opposition to 99 or fewer.The problem: The club has alternated its good and bad defensive performances, with the result being alternating losses and wins."There are still too many mistakes," Zeller observed from the bench."We have shown flashes of things to come -- that we can be one of the better defensive teams in the league."Continuing the pattern, the Hornets tipped off their current three-game homestand with a 110-93 win over Denver.But they followed that by allowing the Rockets to make 22 3-pointers in Friday's loss.The Magic, meanwhile, have hit nearly 50 percent of its shots this season, up from 44 percent last year.Orlando buried 57.1 percent of its attempts, including 47.8 percent of its 3-pointers, in Friday's win over San Antonio.
Preview: Buccaneers try to climb out of last place in NFC South in home matchup vs. Panthers:::::TV: FOX Time: 1 p.m. CAN'T GET TO A TV?WATCH IT LIVE ON FOX SPORTS GO TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The surest path to the playoffs is winning a division title.It's also a journey that doesn't figure to be easy for Carolina and equally inconsistent Tampa Bay in the NFC South, where two games separate first and last place.Beginning Sunday, the Panthers (4-3) will play five of their remaining nine games within the tightly contested division that produced the past two NFC representatives in the Super Bowl.The last-place Buccaneers (2-4) play six of their final 10 against Carolina, Atlanta (3-3), and current division leader New Orleans (4-2), which has rebounded from an 0-2 start to win four straight games.More Tampa Bay Buccaneers news The Bucs and Falcons are riding three-game losing streaks.The Panthers, coming off a 14-point road loss to Chicago in which they failed to score a touchdown, have dropped two straight after winning four of five to begin the season.As a result, none of the teams have been able to separate themselves from the others."For the most part that's the way it is throughout the league," Carolina coach Ron Rivera said of the way the race is shaping up."There are just a couple of teams right now that have stepped ahead of everybody else," Rivera added."Other than that, I think it's the parity the league is looking for."The Panthers shrugged off a 21-point home loss to New Orleans to beat New England and Detroit on the road to soar to the top of the standings.Losses to Philadelphia and the Bears the past two weeks dropped them behind the first-place Saints.Tampa Bay, meanwhile, has the league's second-ranked offense but has been a huge disappointment defensively, allowing 30 or more points in three of its four losses.The way the Bucs played in losing at Arizona and Buffalo the past two weeks, coach Dirk Koetter reiterated his struggling team can't afford to look at the division race beyond playing the Panthers on Sunday."The only thing you can do right now is get one win," Koetter said."I showed the guys the division standings, and we are what we've earned to this point," the coach added."The fact that some other teams got beat in our division is in our favor, and it is a factor (that) we have not played division games and those games can move you up fast.But we have to play better football."All four teams have held the division lead at some point over the first half of the season.Rivera expects more of the same down the stretch."I don't know if we'll separate ourselves until Week 10 or 11, maybe in two or three more weeks there might be separation," Rivera said."But if there isn't, I promise you this is going to come down to the last three or four weeks where we're going to wind up playing each other again."Some things to watch Sunday: WINSTON'S SHOULDER Despite playing with a sprained AC joint in his right shoulder, Bucs quarterback Jameis Winston threw for 384 yards and three TDs in last week's 30-27 loss to Buffalo.For the second straight week, he did not throw in practice on Wednesday and Thursday, but is expected to make his 39th consecutive start since entering the NFL as the No.1 overall draft pick in 2015.CHUNK PLAYS This could be the week Panthers quarterback Cam Newton gets back on track.Carolina has struggled with picking up big chunk plays over the past two games with only one pass completion of longer than 20 yards.The Bucs have struggled against the pass and Newton has taken advantage of those types of teams this season.Carolina is so desperate to find a deep threat that they've claimed wide receiver Kaelin Clay off waivers from Buffalo and there is a good chance he could be active this week.Rivera has been waiting for rookie Curtis Samuel to make plays down the field, but that hasn't happened so far."When we're playing Panther football it's pretty exciting and when we're not it's just a lethargic team out there that's motionless," Newton said."That has to change.We have to give ourselves reasons to celebrate and be enthusiastic while out there on the football field.When you do that, that's contagious."KUECHLY'S RETURN All eyes will be on Panthers middle linebacker Luke Kuechly if he returns to the field as expected this week.Kuechly suffered his third concussion in three years on Oct. 12 against the Eagles.He spent three weeks in the NFL's concussion protocol the previous two instances, but this one was shorter as he's only missed one game.The Panthers will need the three-time All-Pro linebacker against a team that likes to throw to its tight ends and backs.Starting safety Kurt Coleman, who missed three games with a knee injury, also is slated to return this week.SHEPARD HOMECOMING Panthers wide receiver WR Russell Shepard returns to face his former team, the Buccaneers.Shepard had a 40-yard TD in Carolina's season opener, but hasn't contributed much since then.Still, he is well respected in the Bucs locker room.Winston called Shepard a "great teammate" and "workaholic."The quarterback added: "I'm so proud of him and what he has achieved.I can't tell you how much Russell Shepard taught me as a football player and as a friend."107 View Gallery Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports | Reinhold Matay

USC rolls over Arizona State:::::TEMPE, Ariz. -- Ronald Jones II ran for 216 yards and two touchdowns, Sam Darnold revved up No.21 Southern California's offense with three touchdown passes and the Trojans rolled to a 48-17 victory over Arizona State on Saturday night.USC (7-2, 5-1 Pac-12) rebounded after a 49-19 thumping by No.9 Notre Dame last week by racking up 607 total yards to remain atop the Pac-12 South.Darnold completed 19 of 35 passes for 266 yards, and Tyler Vaughns had six catches for 126 yards with a pair of scores.Jones helped the Trojans pick up 341 yards rushing after they were limited to 76 yards against the Fighting Irish.Arizona State (4-4, 3-2) relapsed on defense after consecutive strong showings, missing tackles and assignments while giving up multiple big plays.The Sun Devils fell behind 31-3 before gaining some momentum on a bizarre play to end the first half but couldn't stop the Trojans to keep it going.Manny Wilkins threw for 259 yards and accounted for two touchdowns for Arizona State.Darnold picked Arizona State apart early when he wasn't being pressured, hitting Deonta Burnett on a 32-yard TD pass on the opening drive and Vaughns on a 42-yard catch-and-run score late in the first quarter.He later threaded a pass between three Arizona State defenders for a 19-yard touchdown pass to Vaughns that put the Trojans up 28-3.One bizarre play gave Arizona State life.Wilkins completed a Hail Mary to Kyle Williams on the final play of the first half, a play ruled short of the goal line by the officials.USC's players trotted off the field while a few of Arizona State's lingered as the officials went to a review.After about five minutes of review, they ruled Williams caught the ball in the end zone before falling out to the 1.Arizona State's PAT team took the field, but had to wait as the Trojans' special teams unit returned from the locker room.Brandon Ruiz's extra point cut USC's lead to 31-10, and the Sun Devils pulled within two touchdowns on Wilkins' 1-yard dive to open the second half.Arizona State's penchant for missing tackles gave USC the momentum back when Jones, who had a 67-yard scoring run in the first half, shed several defenders on a 64-yard run to make it 38-17.THE TAKEAWAY USC got its mojo back after the letdown in South Bend, dominating Arizona State on both sides of the ball.Arizona State's defensive renaissance appears to be over.The Sun Devils were overmatched by USC's size and speed, unable to put up much resistance to fall two games behind the Trojans in the Pac-12 South.UP NEXT USC hosts Arizona next Saturday with the Pac-12 South lead on the line.Arizona State hosts Colorado next Saturday.
Suns put up a fight but lose to Blazers again:::::PORTLAND, Ore. -- The Portland Trail Blazers didn't expect to see the same Phoenix team they beat by a record score in the season opener.They were right.Damian Lillard scored 25 points, C.J.McCollum had 23 and the Trail Blazers outlasted persistent Phoenix 114-107 on Saturday night.Lillard hit a 10-foot runner with 29 seconds left to give the Blazers (4-2) a four-point lead in a game where they never led by double digits.Jusuf Nurkic had 17 points and nine rebounds, and Pat Connaughton scored 13 points off the bench for Portland.The game looked nothing like the matchup in Phoenix on Oct. 18, when the Blazers won 124-76, the largest margin for a season opener in NBA history.Since then, Phoenix has gone through a coaching change that seems to have given the Suns a spark.Earl Watson was fired following an 0-3 start, replaced on an interim basis by assistant coach Jay Triano.Phoenix came into Portland on a two-game winning streak, and threatened to make it three."It was a tough win.I was really impressed with Phoenix.They really turned their season around in a short amount of time.It's sure a different team than the one we played a week and a half ago," Portland coach Terry Stotts said.Devin Booker hit 11 of 19 shots and scored a season-high 34 points for Phoenix (2-4).T.J. Warren and Alex Len had 12 points apiece for the Suns."I thought we played the right way," said Triano, a Portland assistant under Stotts for four years."I didn't think we finished our shots down the stretch, but we put ourselves in a position, on the road, to win a game.I give our guys a lot of credit."The Blazers led 98-91 early in the fourth quarter, but couldn't pull away.Phoenix pulled within a possession on three occasions, and had a chance to tie with less than a minute to play when Marquese Chriss missed a 20-foot jumper.Lillard pounced, split the Phoenix defense and hit a floating runner to put Portland ahead 110-106."We're just not playing well offensively.The ball is moving, we're getting good looks, and when those good looks don't fall, we just try to make things happen.That's when we have the turnovers and the low percentage of shots," Lillard said.Portland led 61-57 at halftime after making eight 3-pointers and shooting 48 percent.Connaughton hit his first four shots off the bench, including three 3-pointers, as the Blazers opened a 36-30 lead early in the second quarter.Lillard and Nurkic, a combined 3 of 15 during the first half, scored 16 of Portland's first 18 points of the second half.Still, the Blazers couldn't shake Phoenix.Booker scored 10 points to keep the Suns within 92-89 heading into the fourth quarter.TIP-INS Suns: Rookie guard Mike James graduated from Northeast Portland's Grant High School in 2008.This is the fourth time Phoenix has played Portland in October, including twice during preseason.Booker has reached double-figure scoring in his past six games against Portland.During this stretch, Booker is averaging 23.7 points per game.Blazers: Forward Meyers Leonard is out four to six weeks (right lateral ankle sprain).The injury occurred during a practice earlier in the week.Lillard reached the 9,000-point milestone during the third quarter.With 402 career games, Lillard is the fastest Blazer to score 9,000 points.The Blazers have won five consecutive games over Phoenix, their longest winning streak over the Suns since claiming seven straight wins from November 1987-November 1988.Portland outrebounded the Suns 53-46, the fifth time in six games it has won the rebounding battle.LILLARD STILL SEARCHING Lillard continues to struggle with his shot this season, after making just 7 of 21 against Phoenix.Through six games, Lillard is shooting 37.9 percent (33 of 87), and 30 percent (17 of 56) over his last three games.The distance doesn't seem to matter, as Lillard is shooting 37.5 percent (12 of 32) from 3-point range."I'm bouncing into my shots.I had a couple of shots tonight where I was like, `How did that not go in?'When I had good rhythm into it, I had good legs go into it.It just didn't go into the basket," Lillard said.UP NEXT Suns: Visit Brooklyn on Tuesday.
Cousins' triple-double powers Pelicans past Cavs, 123-101:::::NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- DeMarcus Cousins came to the bench for the final time as the crowd rose to its feet.He exchanged high fives with Pelicans teammates and fans on the baseline, then motioned to the crowd with his raised right hand to keep the adulation coming.If Cousins, Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday keep playing the way they did against LeBron James' Cavaliers, there will be plenty more scenes like that.Cousins had 29 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, and the Pelicans pulled away for a convincing 123-101 victory over Cleveland on Saturday night."I enjoy winning.Don't you?"Cousins said when asked about his interplay with the jubilant crowd."If we play like this on a nightly basis, we've got a very good chance of being the team that we want to be."Davis added 30 points, 14 rebounds and three blocks to help New Orleans win for the third time in four games.New Orleans' All-Star frontcourt tandem had help from the backcourt, too, with Holiday scoring 29 points and E'Twaun Moore 24 as the Pelicans shot better than 53 percent."We're locked in as a unit.We feel like we can battle with the best of them.We're starting to understand what it takes to win games," said Cousins, who's played in only 22 games with Davis since the trade that brought Cousins from Sacramento after last season's All-Star Game."We're still learning how to play with one another, but the ball movement's been good lately.Defensively, we've been good."Cousins mostly scored on powerful inside moves, once dribbling through three converging defenders.He also tossed in the sporadic 3.Davis provided his usual mix of decisive spot-up jumpers and crowd-pleasing dunks, either on the break or crashing the boards for put-backs.Holiday complemented penetrating dribble drives with four 3s."We're going to be a special team," Davis said."We don't feel it.We know it."Kevin Love had 26 points and 11 rebounds for the Cavs, who were without Derrick Rose and trailed most of the game.James had 18 points and Dwyane Wade 15 for Cleveland, which has lost three of four.After trailing by 13 at halftime, Cleveland briefly appeared to be taking control with a 21-7 run during which Love hit three 3s, grabbed four rebounds and added an assist."We were playing with a lot of confidence.Guys were shooting their shots, not thinking twice about it," Love said of the Cavs' third-quarter surge to a brief 73-72 lead."When we play like that, we're tough.We just haven't put together a good 48-minute span."Cousins' three-point play on a driving layup and Holiday's 3 were bookends of a 12-2 run that put New Orleans back up by nine, and the Pelicans never trailed again.Love briefly left the game after falling to the floor, clutching his left knee under the basket.He returned in the fourth quarter, but the Pelicans put the game away with a 13-3 run, capped by Holiday's fourth 3-pointer, which made it 108-89."They're a tough team to defend," Love said.TIP-INS Cavaliers: Although Rose previously sounded optimistic that his left ankle sprain would be healed enough to play in New Orleans, coach Tyronn Lue said before the game that Rose was still in pain."I don't know about a setback, but he still had soreness this morning when he tried to warm up," Lue said.Lue added that he inserted the 6-foot-5 Iman Shumpert in the starting lineup against New Orleans because he felt that was the best option for defending the 6-4 Holiday.Pelicans: Newly acquired F Josh Smith made his debut late in the first quarter for his first NBA action since the 2015-16 season.He made his only shot and grabbed two rebounds in a little less than seven minutes.The Pelicans finished 13 of 31 (41.9 percent) from 3-point range.NO PANIC James, Love and Wade all said Cavs are unhappy with their recent play, but aren't about to overreact after six games."We know we have to get a lot better.We're frustrated," Love said."But in no way are we going to panic."Wade, meanwhile, recalled Miami's middling start when he and James first became teammates there in the 2010-11 season."It just takes time to get that continuity," Wade said."At some point, we'll get tired of being a .500 ball club."EARLY PUSH Moore, who is starting while New Orleans awaits the recovery of Rajon Rando from a preseason core muscle injury, helped the Pelicans build an early double-digit lead.He hit his first five shots -- three of them from 3-point range -- and the last of those made it 40-27 early in the second quarter.WADE'S NEW WORLD Wade came off the bench for a second straight game, but didn't seem to mind."I like the role that coach has me in," Wade said."Put the ball in my hands, allow me to make plays, allow me to score and attack and be myself."He looked fine after missing one game with a left knee bruise.He drove past Holiday for one, soaring two-handed dunk and also set up a graceful floater with a behind-the-back move.UP NEXT Cavaliers: Host the New York Knicks on Sunday night.Pelicans: Host the Orlando Magic on Monday night.
Bellinger, Dodgers top Astros 6-2 to tie World Series 2-all:::::HOUSTON (AP) -- Cody Bellinger pulled into second base with his first World Series hit and said: "It's a miracle!"With the Dodgers three innings from falling into a deep deficit, the rookie slugger sparked a late comeback that stopped the Houston Astros' surge.Hitless in 13 at-bats, Bellinger doubled and scored the tying run in the seventh inning , then doubled home the go-ahead run off struggling closer Ken Giles in a five-run ninth that lifted Los Angeles to a 6-2 win Saturday night and tied the Series at two games apiece."Sometimes you see in the postseason you want to try to do too much, and that's what I was doing," Bellinger said."Today I tried to make an effort of not doing too much, and when you do that you get two hits sometimes.It's a crazy game."George Springer put the Astros ahead with a two-out homer in the sixth , the first hit off Los Angeles starter Alex Wood.The crowd at Minute Maid Park, where Houston had been 7-0 this postseason, was revved up in anticipation of the Astros having a chance to win the first title in their 56-season history on Sunday.Instead, the Series will go back to Los Angeles no matter what.Clayton Kershaw starts Game 5 for the Dodgers on Sunday night and Dallas Keuchel for the Astros in a rematch of the opener, when Kershaw pitched Los Angeles to a 3-1 win.Bellinger, a 22-year-old bopper who set a National League rookie record with 39 home runs this season, struck out four times in Game 3 and once more in the fifth inning -- his eighth whiff of the Series.Dodgers manager Dave Roberts expressed faith Friday night in Bellinger and again Saturday afternoon."He's got that calmness about him," Roberts said."And when things speed up, he has a way of sort of resetting and not letting it spiral."During batting practice, Bellinger tried to emulate teammates Andre Ethier and Logan Forsythe by hitting the ball to the opposite field."I was always told these really good hitters hit the ball the other way in BP and I had never done it, and I wanted to try it," he said."I hit every ball in BP today to the left side of the infield.I've never done that before in my life.Usually I try to lift.I needed to make an adjustment."Bellinger lined a fastball to the opposite field over Marwin Gonzalez into the quirky corner next to the left-field scoreboard, chasing starter Charlie Morton.He came home on Forsythe's two-out single off Will Harris.Giles entered to start the ninth and got into immediate trouble, allowing a leadoff single to Corey Seager and a walk to Justin Turner.Bellinger took a low slider, then lined a fastball at the letters to left-center.He dropped his bat and raised a hand while running to first and clapped his hands half a dozen times in excitement after sliding into second.36 View Gallery Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports | Jerome Miron "Every day you see him grow a little bit more," Wood said."I think everybody kind of had the same message with him: `We believe in you.You're our guy.You're special.Remember that.'"Joe Musgrove relieved and allowed Austin Barnes' sacrifice fly and Joc Pederson's three-run homer , his second home run of the Series."You like that!You like that!"Pederson yelled to teammates, a la Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins , as he came back to dugout.Wood, Brandon Morrow, winner Tony Watson and Kenley Jansen combined on a two-hitter -- the first-ever in the Series in which both hits were home runs.Jansen allowed Alex Bregman's two-out long ball in the ninth , the 15th home run of the Series, most ever through four games, before retiring Jose Altuve on a flyout.Giles, the loser, was charged with three runs."They were all crappy pitches, not where I wanted them," he said."I need to do better.I need to pick up this team.I need to carry my weight."He has an 11.75 postseason ERA, allowing runs in six of seven appearances."When you're a back-end reliever," Astros manager A.J.Hinch said, "unless you're extraordinarily dominant, you're only talked about when you suffer, when you struggle.So for him, he can handle it mentally.He can handle it physically."Springer put the Astros ahead when he drove a curveball, Wood's 84th and final pitch, over the left-field scoreboard and into the Crawford Boxes.Wood dropped to a knee on the mound and watched the ball land in the seats and rebound onto the field.Houston was nine outs from winning for the 18th time in 20 home games since returning to Minute Maid Park after Hurricane Harvey, and from becoming the first major league team to start a postseason 8-0 at home.But the Dodgers tied the score in the seventh.Bellinger pointed skyward when reaching second standing up on his opposite-field hit.He clapped both hands above his head, said "It's a miracle!"and pointed for the ball to be saved.Los Angeles had been 1 for 17 with runners in scoring position before Forsythe's hit.Making only his second appearance since Sept. 26, Wood accomplished a feat that eluded Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Orel Hershiser and other Dodgers pitching greats.In the team's 109th World Series game, Wood became the first Dodgers pitcher to hold an opponent hitless through five innings.Houston had put a runner on in 14 consecutive innings before the 26-year-old lefty retired the side in order in the first.Morton was nearly as stingy, allowing three hits in 6 1/3 innings.This was the first Series game in which both starters allowed four baserunners or fewer."The innings were rolling pretty quickly there the first four, five, six innings," Wood said."It kept us both of us locked in."Chris Taylor singled leading off the first but was thrown out on a delayed steal attempt that ended the inning, the first runner caught stealing by Houston catcher Brian McCann since June 18.That was part of a streak of 15 straight outs by Morton before he hit Barnes on the right forearm with a pitch leading off the sixth.Enrique Hernandez's single put runners at the corners and Taylor hit a two-hopper to third that Bregman scooped on an in-between hop and threw home in plenty of time for McCann to tag Barnes, who tried to stop about 10 feet from the plate and fell.Bregman also threw out the Yankees' Greg Bird at the plate in the fifth inning of Game 7 in the AL Championship Series."We're a super-resilient team," Bellinger said."Taking one here to make sure we go back to LA is huge."

Mayfield leads No. 10 Oklahoma to 49-27 win over Texas Tech:::::NORMAN, Okla.

No. 25 Iowa State upsets No. 4 TCU 14-7:::::AMES, Iowa (AP) -- TCU is no longer unbeaten.The Horned Frogs have only themselves -- and a resurgent Iowa State defense -- to blame.Kyle Kempt threw for 202 yards and two touchdowns and 25th-ranked Iowa State upset fourth-ranked TCU 14-7 on Saturday, leaving the Big 12 without an undefeated team heading into November.Iowa State's win might have seriously hampered the league's ability to get a team into the playoff after missing out a year ago.But TCU coach Gary Patterson believes the Horned Frogs still control their own destiny.TCU (7-1, 4-1 Big 12), Oklahoma State (7-1, 4-1) and Iowa State (6-2, 4-1) are tied atop the league -- and the Cowboys play in Ames in two weeks.Oklahoma (6-1, 3-1) played Texas Tech on Saturday night."We've still got a chance to play for a Big 12 title.Does it hurt our chances for the playoff?Probably.We still played good enough defense to win," TCU coach Gary Patterson said.Marcel Spears intercepted a Kenny Hill pass with 1:16 left to seal it for the Cyclones.They forced a pair of turnovers in the red zone in the second half in winning their fourth straight game, two of them over teams ranked in the top five on game day."We go into games thinking we're going to try to shut teams out," Iowa State linebacker Joel Lanning said of a defense that held the Horned Frogs scoreless.Kempt put Iowa State ahead 14-0 at the break with touchdown passes to Matt Eaton (17 yards) and Hakeem Butler (4 yards).TCU answered to open the second half on a 94-yard kickoff return by KaVontae Turpin.But Brian Peavy intercepted Hill in the end zone in the third quarter and brought it back 70 yards, and Willie Harvey caused Hill to fumble a ball recovered by Iowa State at its own 15-yard line with 7:11 to go.Hill had his worst game of the season, finishing 12 of 25 passing for 135 yards and those two very costly interceptions.The Horned Frogs also committed 11 penalties for 104 yards."The reality of it is, it's hard to stay the course.But these kids are doing that," said Iowa State coach Matt Campbell.THE TAKEAWAY TCU: The Horned Frogs can still make an argument for a playoff spot -- if they win out.But that'll be a tall order with a trip to Oklahoma on tap for Nov. 11 after next week's home game against a dangerous Texas team."Back to the drawing board," TCU cornerback Jeff Gladney said.Iowa State: It's time to stop asking if the Cyclones are for real and start asking who can stop them in the Big 12.Iowa State's defense is allowing less than 14 points a game in league games, and it bailed out an offense that couldn't find its footing in the second half."They really believe in each other," Campbell said."The first half, the offense at times picked the defense up, and in the second half the defense picked the offense up.Good teams do that."POLL IMPLICATIONS TCU might tumble out of the Top 10, and Iowa State will certainly jump up a few spots.But early losses at home to Iowa and Texas will keep the Cyclones from climbing too high in the rankings.KEY NUMBERS Iowa State won despite gaining just 255 yards and converting on 3 of 13 third downs.Darius Anderson rushed for 95 yards on 12 carries, and Kyle Hicks had 80 yards on 12 attempts.The Cyclones converted on two of its three trips to the red zone.Iowa State is now bowl eligible for the first time in five years.But the goal of simply making it to a bowl game no longer matters for a team that's on pace to be one of the best in school history.HE SAID IT "We had a formula: not turning the ball over and beat people at their own game.We did not do that," Patterson said.UP NEXT TCU hosts Texas on Nov. 4 Iowa State travels to face West Virginia next Saturday.The Mountaineers lost at home to Oklahoma State 50-39 on Saturday.

NFL players seek meeting with Goodell, McNair, Kaepernick:::::An NFL team owners recent inmates running the prison remark has prompted a group of the leagues players to call for a meeting Monday to clear the air.The Washington Post reported Saturday that a panel called the Players Coalition has requested a meeting Monday in Philadelphia with league Commissioner Roger Goodell, Houston Texans owner Bob McNair, and free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick.It wasnt immediately clear if all parties had agreed to attend.Meanwhile, ESPN reported Saturday that the Houston Texans players were planning to stage an unspecified protest against McNair's remarks prior to Sunday's game against the Seahawks in Seattle.Many players have been deeply troubled by the disturbing comments made by Texans' owner Bob McNair, the Players Coalition said in a statement.It is ironic that such a quote would emerge in the midst of an ongoing struggle to highlight injustices suffered by people of color, including our nation's deeply flawed approach to criminal justice and inhumane treatment of imprisoned people.McNair has apologized twice since making what he described as a very regretful comment during a recent league meeting about players national anthem protests.The comment was published in ESPN The Magazine.But McNair insisted afterward that he wasnt referring to the players as inmates when he said, We cant have the inmates running the prison.Instead, he said, he was describing the relationship between team owners and the league office in New York.Nevertheless, in a league on edge over race-related matters -- sparked in large part by Kaepernicks 2016 protests against American societys treatment of people of color the inmates remark wasnt accepted well.Last season Kaepernick, who was with the San Francisco 49ers, began kneeling during the national anthem before games, saying he was protesting police killings of African-Americans.But many critics argued that protesting during the anthem was disrespectful to the nation and especially the members of the U.S. military.After President Donald Trump made a veiled reference to Kaepernick as a son of a bitch during a September speech in Alabama, more players joined the protest even though Kaepernick was out of the league by then.In their statement, the players asserted that McNairs remark suggested that some league officials were not taking their concerns seriously.As long as the prevailing reality of our league includes a culture where owners feel such behavior and language is permissible, our cause will continue to be stifled and progress will remain elusive, the statement said.This isn't about being a player or a club owner - but basic human decency.According to ESPN, the Players Coalition is led by Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins, retired wide receiver Anquan Boldin and other players who are engaged in community activism.

World Series 2017: Dodgers vs. Astros Game 5 Live Updates:::::Top 2nd: Keuchel finds the strike zone again.The real Dallas Keuchel showed up for the second inning, as he needed just 13 pitches to deal with the bottom of the Dodgers order.Keuchel ran the count full against Austin Barnes but eventually got the catcher to fly out to right.Charlie Culberson grounded out to short, and Chris Taylor grounded out to third to end the inning.Bottom 1st: Kershaw takes over with a 3-0 lead.Clayton Kershaw answered Dallas Keuchels hectic first inning with an incredibly quiet one on his end.He needed just two pitches to retire George Springer on a grounder to third.Alex Bregman popped out to center and then Jose Altuve struck out on a slider that went through the heart of the strike zone to end the inning.As reported on the broadcast, Kershaws career record in games in which he is spotted a three-run lead is 124-19.Waldstein: The Astros have some work to do offensively after an uncharacteristically sloppy top of the first.Two walks and two hits given up by Keuchel, a muffed ball by left fielder Marwin Gonzalez and a terrible throw to second base by Yuli Gurriel combined to hand the Dodgers three runs.Is this really the Astros?This team can catch it and throw it, as old-timey baseball folks like to say, and Keuchels lack of command was puzzling, too.Tall order to have to score three runs against Kershaw, but the sliver lining of falling behind early is that they have nine innings to work with ... make that eight.Astros go down in order in the first.Top 1st: Dodgers get to Keuchel early ... again.Dallas Keuchel spotted Clayton Kershaw three runs in a matchup of aces.Houstons top starter gave up a leadoff single to Chris Taylor and then with one out, he issued back-to-back walks to Justin Turner and Kike Hernandez.He struck out Cody Bellinger, but Logan Forsythe laced a two-out single to left that brought in two runs.An inning where the control artist Keuchel could not find the strike zone got even weirder when Forsythe left too soon on a stolen base attempt and Keuchel threw to first to try to pick him off.Forsythe was caught between bases and Yulieski Gurriel threw wildly to Jose Altuve at second.As Altuve struggled to get the ball and then get back to the bag to tag Forsythe, Hernandez raced in from third to score, increasing Houstons lead to 3-0.The call was challenged by Houston but was upheld.Keuchel got out of the inning when Yasiel Puig hit a dribbler in front of the plate and was thrown out at first by Brian McCann, but at that point he had already spotted baseballs best pitcher a three-run lead and had thrown 32 pitches.Advertisement Continue reading the main story George W.

The Battle-Scarred West Wing Veteran Scripting the N.F.L.s Anthem Message:::::It is a curious career moment for a man who cut his teeth on the campaign trail and spent part of his post-White House days working for corporate titans like Oracle and Facebook.But, as Sosnik and others who know him attest, Lockhart is a wartime general, not a peacetime general for institutions facing conflict.Thats not to say the troops are always in agreement.In interviews with about a dozen league and team executives all of whom refused to speak on the record several owners seemed pleased with his approach to addressing the anthem controversy, which was to strive for a way for the N.F.L.to appear patriotic while respectful of its players who were kneeling to raise awareness of racism and police brutality toward African-Americans.Photo But there has been friction.Some owners were upset with a comment by Lockhart a few days after President Trump criticized the league and its players over the kneeling during the anthem.Lockhart told reporters that talking about police brutality is what real locker room talk is.The statement was viewed as a flagrant jab at the president, who had dismissed as locker room banter comments he made about forcing himself on women, heard in a video leaked during the campaign.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a meeting at N.F.L.headquarters the next day, the Dallas Cowboys owner, Jerry Jones, and the Washington Redskins owner, Dan Snyder, confronted Lockhart to tell him that his remarks would inflame an already fiery issue.Lockhart confirmed the exchange, which was first reported by ESPN, but said his goal was to react quickly and forcefully, not to craft the perfect rejoinder.In interviews, several owners, team executives and league officials said that Lockhart had helped amplify the leagues message, even if they questioned whether more could have been done to anticipate problems before they turned into crises.The attacks by the president, though, were so unusual that you cant dump this at his feet, one team executive said of Lockhart.Lockhart said that he understood why the owners were frustrated, but that his job was to keep pushing the leagues view, and pushing back at those who opposed it.Thats why they allow me to sit up there and promote it and defend the narrative that football is a great game, brings great values and its a great business, he said.The owners criticism, he said, is just part of the job.Given the continuing heated debate inside the league on the issue, there is from time to time speculation on whether Lockhart is long for the job.But if there is a movement to oust him, it is a quiet one.At events like the Super Bowl, Lockhart is often within arms reach of the leagues commissioner, Roger Goodell, the pair a study in contrasts.Goodell is tall, athletic and prim.Lockhart is slumped, stocky and tousled.He was so used to the casual dress style in Silicon Valley that he reluctantly resumed wearing neckties when he joined the button-down N.F.L.Unlike his boss, who has worked more than four decades at the league office, Lockhart has thinner links to football.Growing up in Rockland County, northwest of New York City, he rooted for Joe Namath and the Jets, he said, but colleagues remember him more as a baseball fan, with a picture of the 1986 Mets hanging in his West Wing office.In high school, he played basketball, not football.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Sundays during the season, if Lockhart is not at a stadium, he typically watches games in his Manhattan apartment with his two young children, whom he had with his second wife, Giovanna Gray, a former aide to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York.(His first marriage, to the television journalist Laura Logan, ended in divorce.)His political genes developed early.Dinnertime conversation growing up was more likely to be about politics and journalism than sports.His parents worked in television, and his father was a longtime producer at NBC News.Every four years, the Lockhart family spent the summer wherever the presidential conventions were being held.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.His skills in choppy political waters have been put to the test in the month since Trump lashed out at players who did not stand for the national anthem.From the start of the crisis in late September, Lockhart used tactics he had honed in Washington.He has pushed the leagues case by reaching out to reporters with statements and near-daily conference calls.Through his bidding, the league has publicized positive things that the players are doing in their communities, promoted the idea that the players and owners are united (despite evidence on the field to the contrary), and tried to avoid addressing the presidents remarks directly.Some of the tone and messaging of the leagues statements, which Lockhart helped craft, have also been in line with a Democratic progressive, a point some owners, a group that includes several staunch supporters of the president, have not missed.They seemed to seek a third way, a famously Clintonian way of compromise.The leagues initial 87-word statement, issued the day after the president first attacked the league, came after Goodell, Lockhart and other league executives called owners to sound them out.Most N.F.L.statements are bland, but this one was notable for its directness as well as for what it left out.Goodells statement did not explicitly defend the players right to protest during the anthem, or even mention racism, the core issue that started the sitting and kneeling demonstrations last season, but it included an unusually strong rebuttal to the president.Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the N.F.L., our great game and all our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities, it said.Many owners, including several who are donors to Democratic causes, soon followed with similar statements of their own.But other owners issued statements lamenting the leagues getting pulled into political debates.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After weeks of back and forth, and owners flirting with requiring players to stand, fewer players are kneeling during the anthem.Lockhart has kept his assertive posture.In a talk with reporters, he was asked about the president, who said the N.F.L.should force all players to stand for the anthem.Hes exercising his freedom to speak, and Im exercising my freedom not to react, Lockhart replied dryly.As the N.F.L.and social media have grown, the league has become a lightning rod for a host of social issues, including bullying and domestic violence, that stretch its capacity to control the narrative.Lockhart began advising the league as a consultant in 2014, after video surfaced showing the former running back Ray Rice knocking out his fiance in an elevator.When Lockharts predecessor, Paul Hicks, left the N.F.L.at the end of 2015, he was a logical replacement.Lockhart was interested in returning to New York and, he said, taking on a complex challenge to make the N.F.L.more fleet-footed and assured in responding to controversy.(It is unclear what he is paid, but according to N.F.L.tax filings, Hicks earned $1.5 million in his last year at the league.)Lockhart, who worked on political campaigns dating to Jimmy Carters re-election bid in 1980, has quickly changed the metabolism in the leagues communications office.When The New York Times published an article last year that compared the N.F.L.s approach to the concussion crisis to tactics used by the tobacco industry, Lockhart issued a long and detailed rebuttal, and said the league would consider taking legal action.(None has been taken.)Some reporters are not buying what it is being pushed.Jim Trotter, the president of the Pro Football Writers of America, took exception to Lockharts assertion that the league had tried to become more transparent.Lockharts conference calls were initially not open to all writers, and Goodell and other top executives have not been made available, Trotter said.Theres no question they have been more proactive, and thats part of Joe Lockharts approach to it, Trotter said.They will respond to things quicker than in the past.Does that mean its accurate?No, but its their opinion.Still, to a certain extent, he is still seen as a political animal, and a few owners, who by and large lean right, have questioned whether a lifelong Democrat like Lockhart (who sold his house in Washington to former President Barack Obama) is the best person to speak on behalf of the league.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Lockhart said his politics had little to do with his job.My work is about making sure that people understand what it is were doing, why that is and what impact it is having, he said.Thats devoid of a political agenda.It doesnt mean I dont have political views.But my overriding view when I come to work is, Whats good for the N.F.L.?

quarterback on one side from the Super Bowl winner on the other was difficult all game, but it was veteran Russell Wilson, not Deshaun Watson, who walked away with a win.In an entertaining shootout, the Seattle Seahawks beat the Houston Texans, 41-38.Watson set a tone for the game early with a soaring 59-yard touchdown pass to Will Fuller on the games opening drive in which the speedy young wide receiver simply outran the entire Seattle defense.He would continue to be aggressive throughout the game, not letting Seattles vaunted secondary, or his three interceptions, change his approach.But despite becoming the first quarterback to have 400 passing yards, 50 rushing yards, and four passing touchdowns in the same game, Watson found himself a hard-luck loser thanks to Wilsons late-game heroics and a few of his own mistakes.Wilson ended up completing 26 of 41 passes for 452 yards and four touchdowns, the last of which was an 18-yarder to Jimmy Graham with 21 seconds left that gave the Seahawks the victory.Seattle looked like it would lose when Wilson was intercepted with just under three minutes left in the game.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the end, it was a handful of rookie mistakes by Watson that provided the scoring difference, as he was intercepted three times, with Richard Sherman accounting for two and Earl Thomas taking his back 78 yards for a touchdown.But even in the loss, the rookie proved he belongs in the N.F.L.and that his prolific passing in the last few weeks was not a case of picking on bad teams.Seattle will have another tough test next week when the Washington Redskins come to town, but their 5-2 record has them tied with the Los Angeles Rams for the best record in the N.F.C.West.Cowboys feed Elliott the ball, and run away from Redskins.Ezekiel Elliott ran for 150 yards and two touchdowns and the Dallas Cowboys took advantage of a blocked field goal return and three turnovers to beat the Washington Redskins 33-19 Sunday and move into sole possession of second place in the N.F.C.East.Playing in a driving rainstorm that made it difficult to hold onto the ball, let alone throw it, Dak Prescott completed 14 of his 22 passes for 143 yards as Dallas (4-3) heeded the message on Elliotts cleats to Feed Zeke.With another hearing on his N.F.L.suspension coming Monday, Elliott carried the ball 33 times, scored twice for the second consecutive game and surpassed 100 yards for the third in a row.The game turned in the second quarter when Dallas Tyrone Crawford blocked Nick Roses field goal attempt and Orlando Scandrick returned it 86 yards to set up a 1-yard Elliott TD run two plays later.Instead of the Redskins (3-4) leading 16-7, the Cowboys went up 14-13 and never trailed again.Associated Press Photo Patriots take advantage of Chargers miscue.New Englands offense sputtered some on Sunday, but they got some help from the Chargers in a 21-13 victory.It was a day of stalled out drives and costly penalties for both teams, but the key play for the Patriots came early in the second quarter when Ryan Allens punt was muffed by Travis Benjamin of the Chargers inside Los Angeles 10-yard line.Hoping to get something started in a 7-7 game, Benjamin recovered the ball and tried to cut back through his own teams end zone to find room for a return, but he was tracked down by the Patriots gunners and crushed to the ground for a safety.The Patriots got a field goal after the free kick, and the five-point surge gave New England a lead they would never surrender.Advertisement Continue reading the main story

for four field goals and four punts.In a game where the Patriots offense could not finish drives, their much-maligned passing defense did a solid job of containing Philip Rivers and the Chargers.New England opened the season allowing 300 or more passing yards to each quarterback they faced in the first six weeks, but now have had their secondary play a big part in consecutive wins.Rivers completed 17 of 30 passes for 212 yards and one touchdown.The Chargers best play of the game came on an 87-yard touchdown run by Melvin Gordon early in the first quarter, which tied the Chargers

offense and crushed the San Francisco 49ers 33-10.The game was hardly competitive, as the Eagles, playing at home, improved to an N.F.L.-best 7-1 without a hint of a comeback from a 49ers team that fell to 0-8 for the first time in franchise history.In familiar fashion, Carson Wentz was efficient and occasionally electric, completing two touchdown passes, one of which went for 53 yards to Alshon Jeffrey.It was Wentzs fifth touchdown pass of 50 or more yards this season and he finished the day with a modest 211 yards thanks to the lopsided score.C.J.Beathard was not able to keep up, completing just 17 of 36 passes for 167 yards.He had one touchdown and two interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown, as he dealt with four sacks and 12 quarterback hits.Philadelphia will stay at

Next! Dodgers and Astros Are Quick to Pull Pitchers:::::The Astros Charlie Morton faced the minimum 15 batters through five innings, and allowed just three hits and a run in six and one-third innings.It was the only matchup in World Series history in which both starters allowed four or fewer base runners.Yet despite efficient pitch counts 84 for Wood, 76 for Morton both starters were gone by the seventh-inning stretch.Its always in your best interest to take the pitcher out a hitter too early rather than a hitter too late, and Ive always tried to give the reliever a little bit of a leash, Astros Manager A. J. Hinch said.I always try to give the starter a job well done when he walks off the mound.But the context of the game is always going to shift and change.Photo Since the Mets Matt Harvey faltered in the ninth inning of the final game of 2015, managers have refused to let starters go deep in the World Series.The starters in Game 3 of the Series last fall the Chicago Cubs Kyle Hendricks and the Cleveland Indians Josh Tomlin were both removed in the fifth inning of a scoreless tie.No starter recorded an out past the sixth inning of that World Series, and through four games of this one, the only starter to complete seven was the Dodgers Clayton Kershaw in Game 1.Kershaw, who threw just 83 pitches that night, was scheduled for a rematch with Dallas Keuchel in Game 5 here on Sunday.The idea, Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said, is to predict when trouble might happen and avoid it, upending the traditional notion of riding a starter until he gets tired.Baseballs very reactionary, Roberts said, explaining that he tries to be proactive and get ahead of something that potentially might happen and to go a direction that might increase your chances marginally.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Dodgers have done this all year.In the regular season, they had the fewest starts in the majors of at least 100 pitches, with their pitchers reaching that threshold just 24 times half by Kershaw.In the 12 games the Dodgers had played in this postseason entering Sunday, only Kershaw had thrown 85 pitches in a start.Were very into analytics here, and numbers say the third time through the order, things kind of fall apart sometimes, Morrow said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I dont think we necessarily anticipated that with Woody throwing the ball as well as he was.Even though he gave up a home run there, hes more than able to come back and throw two or three more innings, Im sure.Games like this, you make the decision.Robertss decisions guided the Dodgers to 104 victories in the regular season, the most in the franchises six decades in Los Angeles.They now have a chance to finish this World Series at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday or Wednesday, so they might be on to something.Yet, for Wood and his fellow starter Rich Hill who was pulled after four innings, one run and just 60 pitches in Game 2 the numbers do not spike drastically after the second time through the order.Photo In the regular season, Hill kept hitters to a .162 average when facing them for the third or fourth time in a game.Against Wood in such situations, the average was .222.Then again, Roberts and Hinch he of the similarly analytics-minded Astros have reams of proprietary data to prepare them for nearly every possible in-game decision.They work closely with their front offices in a manner that the Yankees, who dismissed Joe Girardi last week after 10 winning seasons, will seek from their next manager.Roberts invited scrutiny in Game 2 after pulling Hill so early.The game went into extra innings, and by the time it reached the top of the 11th, Roberts was down to one reliever, Brandon McCarthy, who had not pitched in the entire postseason.McCarthy faltered, and the Dodgers lost.But those circumstances arose only because Kenley Jansen, who is normally infallible, blew the save in Game 2 after being handed a two-run lead in the eighth inning by the four Dodgers relievers who preceded him.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When the other relievers hold a lead for Jansen, Roberts has essentially done his job, regardless of the final outcome.Even with meticulous planning, it is the players, not the manager, who control the results.So it was in Game 4 of the Series, when Morton left with a 1-0 lead in the seventh inning but the bullpen gave up six runs behind him.It was natural to wonder what might have been had Morton stayed in the game, and Hinch understood.You can draw it out perfectly and map it out, but you never know how the other outcome would have been, he said.Everybody in baseball thinks that the other way would have been perfectly good, and we dont know.We do know that bullpen usage is changing, and starters rarely determine the outcome on their own anymore.They have gotten to the World Series this way, and accept it.We havent really had to work too hard so far in the playoffs, Wood said, paying tribute to the Dodgers bullpen.Theyve been absolutely nails.
Texans Owner Bob McNair Apologizes Again and Meets With His Team:::::Players across the N.F.L.have reacted strongly to McNairs inmates remark, some of them suggesting they would never play for the Texans.The conflict came at a critical time for the N.F.L., which has been in talks with players to address some of the concerns that led them to abstain from standing for the anthem, including racial injustice and, more specifically, the treatment of African-Americans by the police and the criminal justice system.A handful of owners and players have met in recent weeks to see if the league can help support the players in their causes.Under withering criticism from President Trump and from many fans, the owners are also eager for the players to consistently stand during the anthem.The players and owners may meet again Monday or Tuesday, but there has been confusion about the location, the agenda and whether Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who last season started the practice of not standing for the anthem, will attend.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Kaepernicks lawyer said Saturday that Kaepernick had not received an invitation to the meeting.Its obvious that Colin is being invoked for purposes other than playing football, the lawyer, Mark Geragos, said in an interview.Everyone seems to have an agenda other than putting Colin on the football field.Officials at the N.F.L.said it was up to the players to invite him.Earlier this week the players union, which is helping coordinate the meeting, did not appear to be sure it would take place and had not firmed up a guest list.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Saturday, Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Malcolm Jenkins, who has been active in the talks, invited McNair, Commissioner Roger Goodell and Kaepernick to meet in Philadelphia, according to ESPN.Eric Reid, a safety on the 49ers who knelt with Kaepernick during the anthem last season, and has also participated in talks with the league, was also confused by Jenkinss invitation because he, too, was unaware of any meeting in Philadelphia.Im not sure why a press release was sent out saying theres a meeting when theres no confirmation the N.F.L.would attend the meeting, Reid said.There needs to be better communication.Kaepernicks attendance would be noteworthy.Now a free agent, he has been unable to secure a new contract from another team.This month, he filed a grievance in which he claimed the owners had colluded to keep him out of the league.
In Third Retirement, Martina Hingis Cedes Her Doubles Kingdom:::::But there is still a caveat.Since her unexpected return in the second half of 2013, she has essentially been a big fish in a small pond: excelling only at doubles while a select few of her former rivals have continued to thrive on the grander singles stages.Hingis, already in the International Tennis Hall of Fame, remained a star but was no longer a superstar not unlike Lleyton Hewitt, the feisty Australian who was a precocious No.1 at age 20 and a two-time major singles champion before being eclipsed by the relentless brilliance of the Big Four (Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal).Doubles is a parallel universe at WTA events and Grand Slam tournaments.Finals are often played in front of sparse crowds and rarely get mainstream television coverage.Hingis, with her court craft and phenomenal reflexes, was able to rule over this much smaller kingdom, winning 20 Grand Slam doubles titles in all.But it was still inescapable that, not long after Hingis gave her latest retirement speech on Sunday, Venus Williams, also 37, went out and pushed Caroline Wozniacki, 27, before losing in the singles final to cap a resurgent season that just might rank as the most remarkable of Williamss long career.In singles, Hingis peaked early.She began playing at 2 and was one of the true wunderkinds in a sport whose history is rich in child prodigies.At 12, Hingis won the French Open girls tournament, which was open to players as old as 18.Shes like a young Bobby Fischer playing chess, said Roy Sjgren, Switzerlands national womens coach, before Hingis turned professional at age 14.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She proceeded to outthink and outmaneuver her elders on a regular basis with her versatility and cryptic grin: one that could express delight or disdain (and sometimes disdainful delight).Photo At 15, she became the youngest Grand Slam champion by teaming with Helena Sukova to win the Wimbledon womens doubles title.At 16, she won the Australian Open to become the youngest person to win a major singles title in the 20th century and the youngest No.1.She had game and she also had attitude.Before playing Lindsay Davenport in Manhattan Beach, Calif., in 1997, Hingis and Davenport met for the coin toss to determine who would serve first.Hingis said to Davenport: O.K., do you want to get broken first or do you want to let me hold?She and Davenport ended up laughing at the net, but there were other cheeky comments from the sharp-tongued Hingis that seemed less lighthearted, like her assessment of the young French player Amlie Mauresmo, who had come out as a lesbian, as half a man at the 1999 Australian Open.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.That was the same year Hingis turned petulant during a dramatic French Open final loss to Steffi Graf, angering the volatile Paris crowd and Graf by violating tennis protocol and crossing the net to examine a ball mark in Grafs half of the court.Hingis ended up losing her composure and the match, in three sets, leaving the court in tears and only returning for the awards ceremony at the insistence of her mother and coach, Melanie Molitor, who steadied her as they re-emerged together from the tunnel.Hingis paradoxically never won the French Open in singles despite clay being one of her best surfaces.She did win the other three Grand Slam singles titles; all five titles came in a two-year stretch.She saved her best tennis for the Australian Open, where she won in 1997, 1998 and 1999, and then reached finals in 2000, 2001 and 2002.Named for Martina Navratilova, Hingis was clearly born to be a champion.Molitor, once a prominent player in Czechoslovakia, made sure that her daughter understood all the angles and that she did sports and activities other than tennis, including horseback riding, in an attempt to avoid burnout and injury.But there was no planning for the Williams sisters, a tennis success story even more improbable than Hingiss.Serena and Venus were not named for any prior tennis greats, but their father and coach, Richard Williams, was every bit as committed to his bold project even if he lacked Molitors playing experience and reticence to commandeer the spotlight.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It took the sisters time to end the Hingis era, with ample help from two other Americans, Jennifer Capriati and Davenport.Photo When Hingis stopped playing singles, she still held an 11-10 edge over Venus Williams and trailed Serena Williams only by 6-7.But it was the strength of their games and their personalities that ultimately convinced Hingis that she should be a doubles specialist.The willpower of Serena, nobody can beat that, Hingis once told me.There has not been another player who has the same hunger.Hingis surely possessed plenty of her own to keep returning to the game she played so artfully, to be satisfied in the small pond after all that time navigating larger bodies of water.
Astros Yuli Gurriel Escapes World Series Ban, but Will Miss 5 Games in 2018:::::Photo HOUSTON Yuli Gurriel, the Houston Astros first baseman who was seen making a racist gesture in the dugout during Game 3 of the World Series on Friday night, has been given a five-game suspension without pay that will begin at the start of the 2018 season.The suspension, which was handed down by Rob Manfred, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, is the largest levied against a player for a public act of intolerance during a baseball game, exceeding by two games the suspension of Yunel Escobar, who was penalized for gay slurs written on his eye black strips in 2012.Manfreds decision, which he announced in a Saturday afternoon news conference, means that Gurriel will not have to sit out any of the remaining games of the World Series.The Los Angeles Dodgers tied the Series at two games apiece with a 6-2 victory on Saturday night.Gurriel is scheduled to earn $12 million in 2018 and will lose roughly $320,855 because of the suspension.He will also have to undergo sensitivity training.Photo There is no excuse or explanation that makes that type of behavior acceptable, Manfred said.During Game 3 of the Series on Friday, Gurriel, who defected from Cuba in 2016, hit a home run off Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish in the bottom of the second inning.After Gurriel returned to the dugout, he was captured on camera smiling and then raising his hands as if to stretch the sides of his eyes.It seemed to be a clear, and pointedly insensitive, reference to Darvish, who is from Japan.After Game 3 ended in a Houston victory, Gurriel was besieged by reporters, and he told them through an interpreter that he did not intend to offend Darvish.He maintained that he was telling teammates that maybe Darvish thought he was Japanese and that is why he gave him a good pitch to hit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Darvish issued a statement Friday night forgiving Gurriel and asking people to learn from the incident.
Cody Bellinger Breaks Through, Leading the Dodgers Past the Astros:::::The Dodgers battered the Astros bullpen in the ninth inning on Saturday night, with Bellinger delivering a double off closer Ken Giles to put Los Angeles ahead, 2-1.And after a sacrifice fly by Austin Barnes made it 3-1, Joc Pederson blasted a three-run homer off Joe Musgrove to end any suspense.The Astros managed only two hits all night solo homers by George Springer with two outs in the sixth and by Alex Bregman with two outs in the ninth.Photo The late Dodgers outburst came after an unlikely pitchers duel between the teams No.4 starters, Alex Wood of the Dodgers and Charlie Morton of the Astros.Wood carried a no-hitter into the sixth on Saturday, when Springer produced the games first run with his homer.Morton was only slightly less flawless, facing the minimum number of batters through five innings.Thus far, each game has delivered an unexpected element.Game 1 came with extreme 103-degree heat.Game 2 brought a rare blown save by Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen and late, no-quit, home run-fueled comebacks by both teams.And Game 3 was marred by a racist gesture by Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel.Gurriels act, in which he stretched the side of his eyes after hitting a home run off the Dodgers Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish, provided the backdrop for Game 4.On Saturday afternoon, Commissioner Rob Manfred suspended Gurriel for five games at the start of the 2018 season, but chose not to discipline him for this Series, in part because he did not want to penalize the rest of the Astros.His decision drew support from Roberts, whose mother is Japanese.I think that it gives us all some closure in the sense that it was something that happened, Roberts said.The way that it was dealt with, I support.Gurriel, who received modest cheers from Astros fans when he came to the plate for his first at-bat on Saturday, was not a factor as Game 4 proceeded.But Bellinger was.Photo Bellinger, who made his Dodgers debut when veteran Adrian Gonzalez was injured this season, generally carries himself well beyond his years, owing to a reserved personality and the preparation provided by his father, Clay, who won two World Series rings with the Yankees.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hes got no pulse; he really doesnt have a memory, either, said Dodgers shortstop Corey Seager, who is 23 and in his third postseason.He forgets things.Things go away.Thats what you have to do in baseball you have to forget the past, forget your last AB and move onto the next one.Thats what he did tonight.But Bellingers breakout night did come with a thought process on his part.He was hitless in 13 at-bats, including eight strikeouts four in Game 3 as he came to the plate with one out in the seventh inning against Morton, who was nursing a 1-0 lead.Earlier, an insight had came to Bellinger when he went out to take batting practice: His teammates Andre Ethier and Logan Forsythe regularly hit the ball the opposite way when taking their pregame swings.So why not do the same?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I was always told these really good hitters hit the ball the other way in B.P., and I had never done it and I wanted to try it, said the left-handed hitting Bellinger, who proceeded to hit every ball to left field during the practice session.The struggles Bellinger endured in the Series were not unlike those of another ballyhooed rookie the Yankees Aaron Judge who emerged from a postseason slump midway through the American League Championship Series against the same Astros team Bellinger was now facing.I watched and we were identical, striking out a lot, swinging at a lot of off-speed pitches that we dont normally swing at, Bellinger said of Judge.I think thats the pressure of the postseason sometimes.Photo The Astros had put Bellinger in a funk by throwing him back-foot breaking balls and fastballs away pitches that are difficult to pull.But when Morton threw a 3-2 curveball to him in the seventh, he left it over the plate and Bellinger drove it the opposite way.Left fielder Marwin Gonzalez gave chase, but could not track it down.As Bellinger coasted into second with a double, he raised his hands and gazed upward as if to give thanks for his first hit of the series.It was also enough to chase Morton.He had survived the top of the sixth after Astros third baseman Alex Bregman threw Barnes out at home to keep the game scoreless.It was almost identical to a pivotal play Bregman made in Game 7 of the A.L.C.S., when he gunned down the Yankees Greg Bird at home to preserve a 1-0 lead.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But after Bellingers double an inning later, Astros Manager A. J. Hinch had a brief conversation with Morton on the mound and then called on his rested bullpen.Will Harris came on to retire Yasiel Puig on a deep fly to right field, but Forsythe followed by lining a 2-0 fastball for a single that easily scored Bellinger.The Dodgers werent done.In the ninth, Giles who surrendered a two-run lead in Game 2 gave up a single to Seager and a walk to Justin Turner.Bellinger followed by driving a 1-0 fastball into the left-center gap for a double that scored Seager and sent Turner to third.The double he hit to left-center, he stayed on that curveball pretty good, Astros catcher Brian McCann said of the first double.And the one in the ninth, he cheated on the heater.They were not the swings of an overmatched youngster, or of someone weighed down by the moment.Instead, they were taken by someone who understood what to remember and what to forget, and the result was a World Series that might end up going the distance.
Another N.B.A. 7-Footer, Trying to Keep Up, Ventures Into 3-Point Land:::::Coach Kenny Atkinson did not question those limitations until the most powerful person in the organization suggested looking deeper.Atkinson recalled a conversation with Mikhail Prokhorov, the teams owner, not long after the Nets acquired Mozgov, who, like Prokhorov, is from Russia.Hey, Atkinson remembered Prokhorov telling him, Timmy can shoot 3s.The exchange carried some weight.Atkinson loves big men who are proficient from the 3-point line because they drag their defenders to the perimeter, which creates space for everyone else.He pointed out the challenges that players like Porzingis and the Boston Celtics Al Horford present in pick-and-rolls.Do you switch your big onto their super-quick guard?Its just not ideal, Atkinson said.And if you dont switch and play it soft, they throw it back to those guys for a wide-open shot.As the Nets surged to a surprising 3-2 start with their victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday, Mozgov has struggled to find a fit with his new team, averaging 4.6 points and 4.2 rebounds ahead of Fridays game against the Knicks.His biggest issue?A general inability to defend more mobile centers.Mozgov sees the future of his position every night, and it is a problem.Consider that 23 percent of all the field goals attempted by 7-footers through Wednesdays games were 3-pointers, an increase from 14.6 percent last season and 8.9 percent in 2015-16.Less than 1 percent of 7-footers shots were 3-pointers as recently as 2000-1, according to N.B.A.Advanced Stats.Enter Mozgov, who may need to develop a consistent deep jumper to stay in the Nets rotation.His shot is a work in progress.Through the first five games of the regular season, Mozgov has attempted three 3-pointers, sinking one in a loss to the Orlando Magic on Tuesday.Thats where the league is going, Nets forward Quincy Acy said.Mozgov understands that he does not have carte blanche to chuck 3-pointers.As he put it, Its not like Ill be on the 3-point line all game.But he will pick his spots.In the preseason, he made two of three attempts from 3-point range.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Nice, right?he said.Despite Prokhorovs assurances, there was little statistical evidence coming into the season that Mozgov could knock down 3-pointers.He had attempted 40 of them through his first seven seasons in the league and made just seven.But Atkinson noticed that Mozgov had a soft touch on a high release.And with the Lakers last season, he shot 44.6 percent on jumpers that ranged from 16 feet out to the 3-point line at 23 feet 9 inches, according to N.B.A.Advanced Stats.But in the age of analytics, midrange jumpers are about as popular as two-week road trips.Rather than have his players take long 2-pointers, Atkinson would prefer that they shoot from behind the 3-point arc and that now includes Mozgov.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Might as well, Atkinson said.Atkinson delivered this news to Mozgov on the day of his introductory news conference in June.The directive was coming from above.The owner told me to tell you that, Atkinson recalled telling him.Mozgov tends to be impassive.But Atkinson said he could sense that Mozgov was thrilled by this development.His teammates could, too.If youre a big guy like Timo, all most coaches want you to do is just score on the block, bang, get rebounds and set screens, the reserve guard Joe Harris said.So when the coach finally gives you some freedom, its like you have a whole new perspective.Atkinson also thinks of the 3-pointer as a motivational tool.I do think theres an element of that, Atkinson said.Like, Hey, Timmy, if you defend and rebound, well let you take a 3 once in a while.But hes really embraced it.There are limits.During a preseason game, Mozgov received a pass just in front of the 3-point line.He was open and wanted to shoot, but he realized he was in the midrange no-mans land.So he took a step-back dribble and fired a 3-point attempt.It was off the mark.Atkinson advised him not to do that again.Kennys like, Well, I give him the freedom to shoot 3s but not step-back 3s, Harris said.I dont think he wants anyone taking step-back 3s.In truth, Prokhorov hardly needed to sell Atkinson on the idea of letting another of his players drift behind the 3-point line.Last season, the Nets ranked fourth in the league in 3-point attempts, and Atkinson broadcast his affinity for the shot by giving the green light to the one player on the roster who seemed the least likely to take them: Lopez.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In his first eight seasons with the Nets, Lopez shot a total of 31 3-point attempts.But last season, Atkinson encouraged him to add the occasional 3-pointer to his repertoire.To suggest that Lopez was receptive would be an understatement.He took it and ran with it, Atkinson said.Lopez took a team-high 387 3-pointer attempts that season and made a respectable 34.6 percent of them.I think Timmy will be more measured, Atkinson said.Mozgov was asked if teammates had offered pointers.Just make it, he said.Simple.Mozgov often concludes a practice by taking dozens of 3-pointers with the help of assistant coaches who rebound for him.As he works his way around the arc, he forces himself to make 7 of 10 attempts before he moves on to the next spot.He can sense gradual improvement.His future may depend on it.

N.F.L. Scores: Houston Texans Kneel During Anthem in Protest:::::CBS, which was broadcasting a golf event until 4 p.m. Eastern, did not air the anthem.Pictures and video showed more than 40 members of the team kneeling, with only a few standing.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Friday, Texans offensive lineman Duane Brown told reporters the team would respond to McNairs words.I think it was ignorant, Brown said.I think it was embarrassing.I think it angered a lot of players, including myself.We put our bodies and minds on the line every time we step on that field, and to use an analogy of inmates in prison, thats disrespectful.Thats how I feel about it.On the opposite sideline Sunday, several members of the Seattle Seahawks sat on the bench during the anthem, including

journalists, delivered to your inbox once a week?Click here to receive our weekly Sports newsletter.- Photo Seahawks score last in back-and-forth battle with Texans.Distinguishing between the rookie quarterback on one side from the Super Bowl winner on the other was difficult all game, but it was veteran Russell Wilson, not Deshaun Watson, who walked away with a win.In an entertaining shootout, the Seattle Seahawks beat the Houston Texans, 41-38.Watson set a tone for the game early with a soaring 59-yard touchdown pass to Will Fuller on the games opening drive in which the speedy young wide receiver simply outran the entire Seattle defense.He would continue to be aggressive throughout the game, not letting Seattles vaunted secondary, or his three interceptions, change his approach.But despite becoming the first quarterback to have 400 passing yards, 50 rushing yards, and four passing touchdowns in the same game, Watson found himself a hard-luck loser thanks to Wilsons late-game heroics and a few of his own mistakes.Wilson ended up completing 26 of 41 passes for 452 yards and four touchdowns, the last of which was an 18-yarder to Jimmy Graham with 21 seconds left that gave the Seahawks the victory.Seattle looked like it would lose when Wilson was intercepted with just under three minutes left in the game.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the end, it was a handful of rookie mistakes by Watson that provided the scoring difference, as he was intercepted three times, with Richard Sherman accounting for two and Earl Thomas taking his back 78 yards for a touchdown.But even in the loss, the rookie proved he belongs in the N.F.L.and that his prolific passing in the last few weeks was not a case of picking on bad teams.Seattle will have another tough test next week when the Washington Redskins come to town, but their 5-2 record has them tied with the Los Angeles Rams for the best record in the N.F.C.West.Cowboys feed Elliott the ball, and run away from Redskins.Ezekiel Elliott ran for 150 yards and two touchdowns and the Dallas Cowboys took advantage of a blocked field goal return and three turnovers to beat the Washington Redskins 33-19 Sunday and move into sole possession of second place in the N.F.C.East.Playing in a driving rainstorm that made it difficult to hold onto the ball, let alone throw it, Dak Prescott completed 14 of his 22 passes for 143 yards as Dallas (4-3) heeded the message on Elliotts cleats to Feed Zeke.With another hearing on his N.F.L.suspension coming Monday, Elliott carried the ball 33 times, scored twice for the second consecutive game and surpassed 100 yards for the third in a row.The game turned in the second quarter when Dallas Tyrone Crawford blocked Nick Roses field goal attempt and Orlando Scandrick returned it 86 yards to set up a 1-yard Elliott TD run two plays later.Instead of the Redskins (3-4) leading 16-7, the Cowboys went up 14-13 and never trailed again.Associated Press Photo Patriots take advantage of Chargers miscue.New Englands offense sputtered some on Sunday, but they got some help from the Chargers in a 21-13 victory.It was a day of stalled out drives and costly penalties for both teams, but the key play for the Patriots came early in the second quarter when Ryan Allens punt was muffed by Travis Benjamin of the Chargers inside Los Angeles 10-yard line.Hoping to get something started in a 7-7 game, Benjamin recovered the ball and tried to cut back through his own teams end zone to find room for a return, but he was tracked down by the Patriots gunners and crushed to the ground for a safety.The Patriots got a field goal after the free kick, and the five-point surge gave New England a lead they would never surrender.Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Scripting the N.F.L.s Anthem Message.In the late 1990s, when the Clinton White House was under siege amid revelations of the presidents affair with Monica Lewinsky and efforts by Congress to impeach him, it fell on Joe Lockhart, then the White House spokesman, day after day to defend his boss.But unlike many of his predecessors, he did not just take his marching orders.In countless meetings with the president and his advisers, Lockhart helped shape the message he would convey, and he aggressively pressed it to reporters.Last year, Lockhart took his pugnacious style to another embattled institution, the National Football League.Read Ken Belsons story on Lockhart here.
The Battle-Scarred West Wing Veteran Scripting the N.F.L.s Anthem Message:::::It is a curious career moment for a man who cut his teeth on the campaign trail and spent part of his post-White House days working for corporate titans like Oracle and Facebook.But, as Sosnik and others who know him attest, Lockhart is a wartime general, not a peacetime general for institutions facing conflict.Thats not to say the troops are always in agreement.In interviews with about a dozen league and team executives all of whom refused to speak on the record several owners seemed pleased with his approach to addressing the anthem controversy, which was to strive for a way for the N.F.L.to appear patriotic while respectful of its players who were kneeling to raise awareness of racism and police brutality toward African-Americans.Photo But there has been friction.Some owners were upset with a comment by Lockhart a few days after President Trump criticized the league and its players over the kneeling during the anthem.Lockhart told reporters that talking about police brutality is what real locker room talk is.The statement was viewed as a flagrant jab at the president, who had dismissed as locker room banter comments he made about forcing himself on women, heard in a video leaked during the campaign.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a meeting at N.F.L.headquarters the next day, the Dallas Cowboys owner, Jerry Jones, and the Washington Redskins owner, Dan Snyder, confronted Lockhart to tell him that his remarks would inflame an already fiery issue.Lockhart confirmed the exchange, which was first reported by ESPN, but said his goal was to react quickly and forcefully, not to craft the perfect rejoinder.In interviews, several owners, team executives and league officials said that Lockhart had helped amplify the leagues message, even if they questioned whether more could have been done to anticipate problems before they turned into crises.The attacks by the president, though, were so unusual that you cant dump this at his feet, one team executive said of Lockhart.Lockhart said that he understood why the owners were frustrated, but that his job was to keep pushing the leagues view, and pushing back at those who opposed it.Thats why they allow me to sit up there and promote it and defend the narrative that football is a great game, brings great values and its a great business, he said.The owners criticism, he said, is just part of the job.Given the continuing heated debate inside the league on the issue, there is from time to time speculation on whether Lockhart is long for the job.But if there is a movement to oust him, it is a quiet one.At events like the Super Bowl, Lockhart is often within arms reach of the leagues commissioner, Roger Goodell, the pair a study in contrasts.Goodell is tall, athletic and prim.Lockhart is slumped, stocky and tousled.He was so used to the casual dress style in Silicon Valley that he reluctantly resumed wearing neckties when he joined the button-down N.F.L.Unlike his boss, who has worked more than four decades at the league office, Lockhart has thinner links to football.Growing up in Rockland County, northwest of New York City, he rooted for Joe Namath and the Jets, he said, but colleagues remember him more as a baseball fan, with a picture of the 1986 Mets hanging in his West Wing office.In high school, he played basketball, not football.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Sundays during the season, if Lockhart is not at a stadium, he typically watches games in his Manhattan apartment with his two young children, whom he had with his second wife, Giovanna Gray, a former aide to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York.(His first marriage, to the television journalist Laura Logan, ended in divorce.)His political genes developed early.Dinnertime conversation growing up was more likely to be about politics and journalism than sports.His parents worked in television, and his father was a longtime producer at NBC News.Every four years, the Lockhart family spent the summer wherever the presidential conventions were being held.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.His skills in choppy political waters have been put to the test in the month since Trump lashed out at players who did not stand for the national anthem.From the start of the crisis in late September, Lockhart used tactics he had honed in Washington.He has pushed the leagues case by reaching out to reporters with statements and near-daily conference calls.Through his bidding, the league has publicized positive things that the players are doing in their communities, promoted the idea that the players and owners are united (despite evidence on the field to the contrary), and tried to avoid addressing the presidents remarks directly.Some of the tone and messaging of the leagues statements, which Lockhart helped craft, have also been in line with a Democratic progressive, a point some owners, a group that includes several staunch supporters of the president, have not missed.They seemed to seek a third way, a famously Clintonian way of compromise.The leagues initial 87-word statement, issued the day after the president first attacked the league, came after Goodell, Lockhart and other league executives called owners to sound them out.Most N.F.L.statements are bland, but this one was notable for its directness as well as for what it left out.Goodells statement did not explicitly defend the players right to protest during the anthem, or even mention racism, the core issue that started the sitting and kneeling demonstrations last season, but it included an unusually strong rebuttal to the president.Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the N.F.L., our great game and all our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities, it said.Many owners, including several who are donors to Democratic causes, soon followed with similar statements of their own.But other owners issued statements lamenting the leagues getting pulled into political debates.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After weeks of back and forth, and owners flirting with requiring players to stand, fewer players are kneeling during the anthem.Lockhart has kept his assertive posture.In a talk with reporters, he was asked about the president, who said the N.F.L.should force all players to stand for the anthem.Hes exercising his freedom to speak, and Im exercising my freedom not to react, Lockhart replied dryly.As the N.F.L.and social media have grown, the league has become a lightning rod for a host of social issues, including bullying and domestic violence, that stretch its capacity to control the narrative.Lockhart began advising the league as a consultant in 2014, after video surfaced showing the former running back Ray Rice knocking out his fiance in an elevator.When Lockharts predecessor, Paul Hicks, left the N.F.L.at the end of 2015, he was a logical replacement.Lockhart was interested in returning to New York and, he said, taking on a complex challenge to make the N.F.L.more fleet-footed and assured in responding to controversy.(It is unclear what he is paid, but according to N.F.L.tax filings, Hicks earned $1.5 million in his last year at the league.)Lockhart, who worked on political campaigns dating to Jimmy Carters re-election bid in 1980, has quickly changed the metabolism in the leagues communications office.When The New York Times published an article last year that compared the N.F.L.s approach to the concussion crisis to tactics used by the tobacco industry, Lockhart issued a long and detailed rebuttal, and said the league would consider taking legal action.(None has been taken.)Some reporters are not buying what it is being pushed.Jim Trotter, the president of the Pro Football Writers of America, took exception to Lockharts assertion that the league had tried to become more transparent.Lockharts conference calls were initially not open to all writers, and Goodell and other top executives have not been made available, Trotter said.Theres no question they have been more proactive, and thats part of Joe Lockharts approach to it, Trotter said.They will respond to things quicker than in the past.Does that mean its accurate?No, but its their opinion.Still, to a certain extent, he is still seen as a political animal, and a few owners, who by and large lean right, have questioned whether a lifelong Democrat like Lockhart (who sold his house in Washington to former President Barack Obama) is the best person to speak on behalf of the league.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Lockhart said his politics had little to do with his job.My work is about making sure that people understand what it is were doing, why that is and what impact it is having, he said.Thats devoid of a political agenda.It doesnt mean I dont have political views.But my overriding view when I come to work is, Whats good for the N.F.L.?
Texans Owner Bob McNair Apologizes Again and Meets With His Team:::::Players across the N.F.L.have reacted strongly to McNairs inmates remark, some of them suggesting they would never play for the Texans.The conflict came at a critical time for the N.F.L., which has been in talks with players to address some of the concerns that led them to abstain from standing for the anthem, including racial injustice and, more specifically, the treatment of African-Americans by the police and the criminal justice system.A handful of owners and players have met in recent weeks to see if the league can help support the players in their causes.Under withering criticism from President Trump and from many fans, the owners are also eager for the players to consistently stand during the anthem.The players and owners may meet again Monday or Tuesday, but there has been confusion about the location, the agenda and whether Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who last season started the practice of not standing for the anthem, will attend.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Kaepernicks lawyer said Saturday that Kaepernick had not received an invitation to the meeting.Its obvious that Colin is being invoked for purposes other than playing football, the lawyer, Mark Geragos, said in an interview.Everyone seems to have an agenda other than putting Colin on the football field.Officials at the N.F.L.said it was up to the players to invite him.Earlier this week the players union, which is helping coordinate the meeting, did not appear to be sure it would take place and had not firmed up a guest list.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Saturday, Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Malcolm Jenkins, who has been active in the talks, invited McNair, Commissioner Roger Goodell and Kaepernick to meet in Philadelphia, according to ESPN.Eric Reid, a safety on the 49ers who knelt with Kaepernick during the anthem last season, and has also participated in talks with the league, was also confused by Jenkinss invitation because he, too, was unaware of any meeting in Philadelphia.Im not sure why a press release was sent out saying theres a meeting when theres no confirmation the N.F.L.would attend the meeting, Reid said.There needs to be better communication.Kaepernicks attendance would be noteworthy.Now a free agent, he has been unable to secure a new contract from another team.This month, he filed a grievance in which he claimed the owners had colluded to keep him out of the league.
Texans Owner Bob McNair Apologizes for Inmates Remark:::::Photo Houston Texans owner Bob McNair apologized on Friday for a remark he made last week about inmates running the prison if N.F.L.owners allowed players to continue to sit or kneel during the national anthem, but the apology appears to have done little to appease his own players.McNair made the comment among a handful of other owners who were together at a New York hotel after a meeting with about a dozen players, many of them African-Americans who have demonstrated during the anthem to highlight a lack of attention to racial oppression.The players and owners were seeking common ground on the issue when they met at the N.F.L.headquarters in Manhattan.When a group of owners later discussed whether the league ought to clamp down on the protests, McNair suggested it should, because we cant have the inmates running the prison.The comment, which ESPN reported, was taken as insensitive and demeaning to the players.I never meant to offend anyone, and I was not referring to our players, McNair said in a statement on Friday.I used a figure of speech that was never intended to be taken literally.I would never characterize our players or our league that way, and I apologize to anyone who was offended by it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some players on the Texans, though, were having a hard time accepting McNairs apology.They considered walking out of practice on Friday, and one player, DeAndre Hopkins, did not attend, according to The Houston Chronicle.
N.F.L. Predictions: Cowboys Should Beat the Redskins:::::Detroits defense is not nearly as crisp as Pittsburghs, but it can be just as opportunistic.If Roethlisberger is at all careless with his passes, Detroit will make him pay for it.Golden Tates being limited, or possibly inactive, with a sprained AC joint takes some jolt out of the Lions offense, but this should be a close game.Pick: Steelers 49ers at Eagles, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Eagles by 13 The 49ers (0-7) are very bad.The Eagles (6-1) are very good.It is not hard to predict that Philadelphia will take care of business at home against a winless opponent, but a spread of 13 points is demanding a blowout, and San Franciscos plucky young defense may be up to the task of preventing that from happening.As good as the Eagles have been, they have kept things close in four of their six wins, and they have little reason to try to run up the score against an overmatched opponent.Pick: 49ers Texans at Seahawks, 4:05 p.m., CBS Line: Seahawks by 5.5 Thanks to the emergence of Deshaun Watson, the Texans (3-3) have averaged 39.3 points a game over the last four weeks.The hype has been deafening, but in reality, he has yet to face a very challenging defense.That ends this week, as the Seahawks (4-2) are the type of team that has the combination of talent and veteran know-how to truly mess with a rookie quarterbacks mind.A victory might be too much to ask for, but Watson is talented enough to keep things close, making a 5.5-point spread a bit too generous.Pick: Texans Cowboys at Redskins, 4:25 p.m., Fox Line: Cowboys by 2 This game could be Ezekiel Elliotts last one for quite some time, as he has a court hearing on Monday that could determine the fate of his six-game suspension.Elliott seemed to be buckling under the weight of the looming punishment at the start of the season, but he has looked like his old self in the last two weeks, and it is no coincidence that the Cowboys (3-3) have righted the ship along the way.At a glance, the Redskins (3-3) seem to have a good run defense, but they have allowed so few yards because teams have chosen not to run against them, which wont be the case with Dallas in town.Pick: Cowboys Second-Tier Matchups Photo Bears at Saints, 1 p.m. Fox Line: Saints by 9 Relying on your teams defense to do all the scoring is not a sustainable strategy in the N.F.L., but that is what has been working for the Bears (3-4) in the Mitchell Trubisky era.The rookie quarterback has done almost nothing notable, averaging 116 passing yards per game, but has a 2-1 record despite having thrown just two touchdown passes in a three-game stretch in which his teams defense scored three.The Saints (4-2) are a tough team to play defense against, especially at home, but if Chicagos surge on that side of the ball has not been a mirage, it should be able to beat a 9-point spread.Pick: Bears Raiders at Bills, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Bills by 2.5 There is nothing like crushing a well-regarded division rival to lift the spirits of a flailing team, and the Raiders (3-4) did just that with a come-from-behind win against Kansas City.Derek Carr returned to his 2016 form just in time to lead a game-winning drive.Unfortunately for Carr, the Bills (4-2) have a habit of making opponents miserable, and they can likely gut out an ugly win.With Marshawn Lynch suspended, Oakland will have a hard time controlling the clock.Pick: Bills Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Chargers at Patriots, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Patriots by 7 This game will serve as an indication of whether the Patriots (5-2) fixed their problems in the secondary last week, or if Atlanta simply was not good enough to take advantage of New Englands biggest weakness.Philip Rivers does not have the same confidence problems that the Falcons have been dealing with, so he will probably challenge New England early and often.If this game were in Los Angeles, the Chargers (3-4) would stand a better chance, but the Patriots are incredibly tough to beat at home.Pick: Patriots Panthers at Buccaneers, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Buccaneers by 2.5 Cam Newton has had two brutal games in a row.He has completed just 57 percent of his passes, and his five interceptions matched his total from the first five games combined.But watching the Panthers (4-3), it is easy to feel sorry for Newton as he is brutalized on play after play.Even the successful plays many of which have come with Newton running rather than passing end with big hits.The big quarterback rarely has extended stretches of ineffectiveness, and an important division game against the equally-struggling Buccaneers (2-4) should bring out the best in him.Pick: Panthers Advertisement Continue reading the main story Bottom-Tier Games Photo Dolphins at Ravens, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday), CBS and NFL Network Line: Ravens by 3 Cameron Wake, a defensive end for the Dolphins (4-2), managed to sum up Thursday Night Football in one convenient quotation.He told reporters this week: To be very honest, nobody is going to be ready the way they like to be.Theyll be as ready as you can be on Thursday night.With Matt Moore expected to start for the injured Jay Cutler, Miamis offense will run through the teams running back, Jay Ajayi, and that spells trouble for the Ravens (3-4), as they are ranked last in rushing yards allowed per game.Pick: Dolphins Vikings vs. Browns at London, 9:30 a.m., NFL Network Line: Vikings by 9.5 The Browns (0-7) will play their first game without tackle Joe Thomas since 2006, so Spencer Drango, a second-year player out of Baylor, will be protecting DeShone Kizers blind side against a Minnesota defense that is tied for sixth in sacks, with 21.It is understandable for the Vikings (5-2) to be road favorites in the neutral site of Londons Twickenham Stadium, but a spread of nearly 10 points is a lot to ask for from an underwhelming Minnesota offense.Pick: Browns Falcons at Jets, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Falcons by 5 The Jets (3-4) followed a three-game winning streak with consecutive losses, but they played well in both games and lost them by a combined 10 points.They go into every game with a talent deficit, but Coach Todd Bowles has had them focused and prepared each week.There is no reason the Falcons (3-3) shouldnt mop the floor with them based on personnel, but the same thing was true in their recent losses to Miami and Buffalo.Unless the team has figured out what has been holding its offense back, this game could be close.Pick: Jets Colts at Bengals, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Bengals by 10.5 Jacoby Brissett endured a beating last week that few other quarterbacks have.He was sacked or hit on 31 of his teams 67 plays, and the Colts (2-5) spent the week arguing about whether it was appropriate for T. Y. Hilton, a wide receiver, to blame his teams offensive line for the blowout loss.The Bengals (2-4) do not have the players to replicate Jacksonvilles savagery, but they will try.A point spread of 10.5 points is enormous, but the Colts have lost by more than that in three of the last five weeks, with the other two games being wins against the two worst teams in the N.F.L.Pick: Bengals Mondays Matchup Broncos at Chiefs, 8:30 p.m., ESPN Line: Chiefs by 7 The Broncos (3-3) scored 42 points in Week 2, and in the four games since, they have also scored 42 points combined.The Chiefs (5-2) are a division rival that not only has more talent than Denver, and home-field advantage, but also the motivation of having lost two close games in a row after a 5-0 start.Denvers defense can probably limit Alex Smith and the Chiefs to a few touchdowns and a bunch of field goals, but that should be plenty to outscore Trevor Siemian and the Denver offense.Pick: Chiefs.

Week 8:::::Carson Wentz (PHI vs. 49ers) Few have ever doubted Wentzs potential, but even fewer expected him to be among the best fantasy quarterbacks so far this season.He has 11 passing touchdowns over his last three games, and only four interceptions on the season.His 21.7 F.P.P.G.is fourth best for his position, and this week he takes on the 49ers, who have yielded 24.0 F.P.P.G.to quarterbacks over the last five weeks and the second most total on the season.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Also consider: Andy Dalton (CIN vs. Colts) Running Back LeGarrette Blount (PHI vs. 49ers) It has not always been pretty for Blount this season, particularly last week, when it took him 14 carries to earn 29 rushing yards.But he has been a borderline RB2/Flex option when you look at his entire season, averaging 8.3 F.P.P.G., good for 25th among running backs.He should be a very solid RB2 this week against the 49ers, who are even worse against opposing running backs than they are against quarterbacks.Eight backs have topped 10 fantasy points against them in seven games, and theyve given up a shocking 26.4 F.P.P.G.to the position this season.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Melvin Gordon (LAC at Patriots) He has looked like the RB1 that fantasy owners drafted him as for most of this season: His total of 14.9 F.P.P.G.is sixth best among running backs.He had only two poor performances, including last weeks against the Broncos (4.4 fantasy points).He should get back on track in a big way against the Patriots, who have not only allowed the fourth most rushing yards, but also the second most receiving yards, to running backs, and 20.4 F.P.P.G.to the position.Also consider: Jay Ajayi (MIA vs.Jets) Wide Receiver Kelvin Benjamin (CAR at Buccaneers) After a rocky start, Benjamin has been the eighth best fantasy receiver over the last four weeks (9.7 F.P.P.G.), even with last weeks rough game against the Bears (three catches for 65 yards).The Buccaneers offer an excellent opportunity for Benjamin to right the ship, as six receivers have topped 10 fantasy points in their six games played.Over all, their 28.4 F.P.P.G.yielded to the receiver position is the second most.If youre still not convinced, Benjamin will line up opposite to cornerback Robert McClain, who is the lowest rated player of the teams entire starting defense, according to ProFootballFocus.com.Demaryius Thomas (DEN at Chiefs) If any player is due to score a touchdown this week, it is Thomas, who has gone 12 consecutive games without one, dating to last season.But he is still averaging 8.4 targets per game this season, and his teammate Emmanuel Sanders might miss a second game in a row with an ankle injury.The Chiefs, despite the presence of the star cornerback Marcus Peters, have allowed the most fantasy points to the position in 2017 (30.4 F.P.P.G.)Also consider: Keenan Allen (LAC at Patriots); Nelson Agholor (PHI vs. 49ers) Tight End Jason Witten (DAL vs. Redskins) With six teams on a bye this week, Witten makes for an excellent streaming option against the Redskins, who have allowed a touchdown to the position in three of the last four games and the second most F.P.P.G.(11.7) over all.Witten has quietly been one of the better fantasy tight ends this season, with his 7.4 F.P.P.G.the eighth best so far this season.Also consider: Kyle Rudolph (MIN at Browns) Defense/Special Teams MIN at Browns; NO vs. Bears Kicker Jake Elliott (PHI vs. 49ers); Steven Hauschka (BUF vs. OAK).

Showdown:::::In fact, the vast majority of N.F.L.players chose the Cowboys way when it came to the anthem on Sunday, suggesting enthusiasm for mixing football and politics is waning.Eleven owners met with players and officials from the league and the players union last week to find a graceful way out of the impasse.Notably absent was Jones.He holds close two statistics: How many players are protesting and what the demonstrations are doing to the bottom line.Through Week 6, the N.F.L.is down slightly in TV ratings, though that can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the continuing decline of cable television subscribers.Last month, after President Trump called for any son of a bitch who knelt during the anthem to be fired, several owners stood with their teams for the anthem.None was as calculating as Jones.He linked arms with his team and knelt, then all rose before the anthem played.No matter.Jones said that the team office was inundated with calls, emails and letters objecting to the gesture.Photo Jones may have been in an ebullient mood after the game Sunday, giving atta-boys to his players for the rout that brought the Cowboys to 3-3.He was expansive on the three-touchdown performance of running back Ezekiel Elliott, who won a temporary injunction to hold off his six-game suspension by the N.F.L.for his role in a domestic-violence case.Still, the anthem controversy was on his mind.There is no question the league is suffering negative effects from this protest, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Trump on Monday tried to keep the fires burning, sending out a tweet that said, Two dozen N.F.L.players continue to kneel during the National Anthem, showing total disrespect to our Flag & Country.No leadership in NFL!What he overlooks is that over the past year, N.F.L.players have sustained a national dialogue about social justice that often only briefly pops up after police shootings or society-rending riots.Whether you like it or not, the N.F.L is among the most watched pieces of entertainment on the planet, with a massive platform.Many players have used it to provide poignant moments.The Seahawks Michael Bennett brought a military wife to tears of understanding as he exchanged views with veterans outside the gates of the teams practice complex.His teammate Doug Baldwin Jr. joined N.F.L.Commissioner Roger Goodell in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman in support of the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2017.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Steelers Alejandro Villanueva, a West Point graduate with a Bronze Star for valor as a platoon leader in Afghanistan, memorably stood by himself with his hand over his heart during the anthem as his team waited off field.He then movingly explained why he could not turn his back on the flag and apologized to his teammates for botching the teams plans and making them look bad.None of it has done much good for Kaepernick or the team that he once took to the Super Bowl.Last week, he filed a complaint against the N.F.L., accusing all 32 teams of colluding to keep him out of the league.He is an activist now and has more than likely kissed away whatever slim chance he had to play in the N.F.L again.On Sunday, there were plenty of empty seats here and about half the filled ones were inhabited by fans wearing the blue and white of the Cowboys.Levis Stadium hasnt been a popular home for the 49ers since opening in 2014.Fans complain that the tickets are too expensive and the commute is too far from San Francisco.Still, it was a jarring sight on an afternoon that San Francisco legend Joe Montana and more than 30 members of the 49ers Super Bowl winning teams were here at halftime to honor another icon, Dwight Clark, who is battling the neurological disease A.L.S.It was Montana and Clark who teamed up for The Catch in 1982, one of the most famous plays in N.F.L history, a 6-yard pass in the back of the end zone in the final minute to beat the Cowboys and advance to the Super Bowl.Those glory days seem like ancient history.In the locker room after the game, Kaepernick and social awareness meant little to a winless and beaten up team.C. J. Beathard, the rookie quarterback who was sacked five times, summed up the 49ers season like a 10-year veteran.Sure, it was a massacre, but hardly a last stand.Yeah, we are 0-7.Theres only one way to go, and thats up, he told reporters.And weve got a lot of season left ahead of us to get better, turn the season around and make something out of it.
Throw 7 Passes. Complete 4. Win Game.:::::Photo The Chicago Bears beat the Panthers on Sunday, 17-3, and they did it with an unconventional game plan.The rookie quarterback Mitchell Trubiskys final line was eyebrow-raising: 7 passes attempted, 4 completed.It was the fewest passes attempted in a winning effort in the N.F.L.since 2006, when the Panthers Chris Weinke also was 4 for 7, in a 10-3 win over the Falcons.It was the fewest completions in a win since 2011, when Tim Tebow was completed 2 of 8 passes in a 17-10 Broncos win over the Chiefs.What do all three games have in common?The head coach of the winning team was John Fox.Fox is not totally averse to the forward pass: He also coached Peyton Manning for three years in Denver.But there have been many not-quite-ready quarterbacks thrust into starting roles over the years, and only Fox steered them away from passing to such an extreme.And successfully.In Weinkes first game filling in for an injured Jake Delhomme in 2006, Fox let him throw 61 passes.In his next start he threw 28.After those games, both losses, Fox dialed all the way back for the seven-pass game.It resulted in Weinkes second career win, and first in five years.Delhomme returned the next week, and Weinke never won another game in the league.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Tebow, who replaced the Denver starter Kyle Orton in 2011, was never a prolific passer, averaging 24 passes a start that season.But he never had a game quite like that 2-for-8 effort.It worked though, and was the second game in a six-game winning streak that helped the Broncos into the playoffs
The Seahawks Are a Little Dysfunctional. Theyre O.K. With That.:::::For much of the first half Sunday, Seattles offense was inept and bungling.And, of course, that led to a scuffle on the sideline.What would a Seahawks football game be without at least a little chaos on the bench?With Seahawks down by 4 points in the second quarter, a meeting of players from the sputtering offensive unit became heated, with receiver Doug Baldwin shoving the teams offensive line coach, Tom Cable, who had been addressing the players.Baldwin was shouting in the direction of his teammates not so much Cable and Pete Carroll, the head coach, came over in the middle of the episode, although no one appeared unnerved by the incident.Cable continued to talk to the players and Baldwin remained near his side.Apparently, the Seahawks are simply used to such displays.Doug is always fired up, Seattle wide receiver Paul Richardson said with a smile.He might have had an outburst but he went out and made plays.It was all to get us going, and it worked.Indeed, Baldwin caught a 22-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter that gave the Seahawks a lead they never relinquished.And Richardson was in the middle of a critical fourth-quarter sequence, wrestling for possession of the ball with the Pro Bowl safety Landon Collins after a pass into the Giants end zone.Collins and Richardson had something akin to simultaneous possession, which the game officials ruled to be a Seattle touchdown.The score and extra point put the Seahawks ahead by 17-7, which, given the current state of the Giants offense, amounted to an insurmountable lead.Photo The Giants gained just 177 yards Sunday and converted on only 2 of 12 third-down opportunities.A Seahawks turnover led to the Giants only touchdown.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Seattle receivers also dropped three passes, and quarterback Russell Wilson overthrew multiple targets on plays that could have resulted in touchdowns.The Seahawks also committed a staggering 15 penalties.It is failures like these that have many wondering, justifiably, what is wrong with the Seahawks.Yes, they have had some bad luck with injuries.But are they truly a championship contender if they struggled, even briefly, to overwhelm the immensely hobbled and downtrodden Giants?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.And is the sideline strife, however benign it might ultimately have been, a good thing?Seattle defensive lineman Michael Bennett conceded his team might confuse some fans.I dont know how to grade us right now, myself, Bennett said.But I dont have to.We take it week to week and we just won one more this week.Not surprisingly, Sherman is not worried.He saw a defense especially a deep, talented secondary that toyed with the Giants inexperienced wide receiving corps.Early in the game, Giants quarterback Eli Manning heaved a long, mighty pass toward Tavarres King, who was streaking down the right sideline.The football, spinning in a perfect, tight spiral, appeared destined for a touchdown, and King stretched out his arms within a few steps of the end zone.And then, in a flash, Sherman caught up with the descending football and flicked it away with one hand.Shermans play was almost a dismissive act, knocking down a deft pass inches from Kings hands.Just letting Eli know Im here, Sherman said.I was just saying that we werent going to let anything be caught deep.Not today.The Giants very rarely threw in Shermans direction again.Everybody should know the Seahawks are O.K., Sherman said.Of Baldwins eruption in the bench area, Sherman said it hardly raised an eyebrow on the team.To the outside world, its misunderstood, Sherman said.But we all look at the coaches as peers.Were in this together.Dougs not yelling at him, hes trying to be encouraging and trying to motivate everyone.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Sherman grinned.It gave a spark, he said.Its all good.
Justin Timberlake Will Perform in Super Bowl Halftime Show:::::Photo The N.F.L.will revisit its most controversial Super Bowl halftime show by having Justin Timberlake, the singer who participated in the infamous wardrobe malfunction of 2004, perform during Super Bowl LII.Timberlake, a Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter, became famous with the boy band N Sync before going on to solo success with hits like SexyBack, Cry Me a River and Rock Your Body.While he has largely transitioned to acting, Timberlake recently had another hit with Cant Stop the Feeling on the soundtrack for the animated movie Trolls.He also voiced the character Branch in the movie.Before his acting turn, Timberlake was part of the halftime shows for Super Bowls XXXV, in 2001, and XXXVIII, in 2004.At the performance for Super Bowl XXXVIII, which was held in Houston, he was on stage with Janet Jackson, and at the end of the performance he tore away part of Jacksons top.The incident, which was later described as a wardrobe malfunction, led to numerous complaints and a hefty fine by the F.C.C.The fine was eventually vacated by an appeals court.During an interview televised during NBCs Sunday Night Football broadcast, Mike Tirico asked Timberlake about whether the N.F.L.had addressed the incident with him.Timberlake smiled and said That wont happen this time.Timberlake continues the N.F.L.s trend toward courting a younger audience rather than going with older, safer performers.Other recent performers have included Lady Gaga, Beyonc, Bruno Mars and Katy Perry.
Astros Make a Routine of the Extraordinary Out at the Plate:::::Gonzalez got credit for the throws from the outfield that nabbed Bostons Mitch Moreland in Game 4 of the division series and Greg Bird of the Yankees in Game 1 of the A.L.C.S.Bregman was the one who threw from third to cut down Bird in Game 7 of the A.L.C.S.and the Dodgers Austin Barnes on Saturday.In both of the plays involving Bregman, there were runners on first and third with one out.Each time, Bregman fielded a grounder and threw quickly to McCann to beat the runner.Photo Two first-and-third plays, McCann said, marveling after the play on Barnes.You dont see that but a couple of times a year.For it to happen twice in the postseason is just phenomenal.The Dodgers went on to win Game 4, 6-2, to even the World Series at two games apiece.But at the time that Bregman and McCann made the play, it was a scoreless game in the top of the sixth inning.With Charlie Morton pitching for the Astros, Chris Taylor hit a slow bouncer toward third and Bregman charged it, short-hopped the ball with his glove, exchanged it quickly into his throwing hand and threw to McCann while on the run.His throw arrived so quickly that Barnes stopped in the base path and tried to turn back toward third, but he fell and had no chance as McCann tagged him out.Bregman then hit a home run in the bottom of the inning to give Houston a 1-0 lead that wound up being temporary.Bregman said the foundation of the play on Saturday night was the same as the one in Game 7 of the A.L.C.S., when he gunned down Bird of the Yankees with a remarkable throw that met McCanns glove at the exact point where Bird was sliding into the plate.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In that game, the Yankees Todd Frazier was at the plate with Houston leading, 1-0, in the top of the fifth inning in a decisive Game 7.Bregman looked into the Astros dugout at the infield coach Alex Cora, who will become the Red Sox manager after the World Series.Cora put his finger to his head, signaling that Bregman should think before the play about what he would do if the ball was hit to him.If the ball was hit hard, he could gamble and go for an inning-ending double play while the runner at third raced home.But if the ball was hit more slowly, leaving no chance for a double play, Bregman would throw home and let McCann try to tag the runner.Which is what he did.Frazier hit a chopper, Bregman grabbed it and threw, and Bird was out.The Astros went on to widen their lead and clinch the American League pennant.Photo In Saturdays game, Bregman said, he knew there was a good chance that he would see another slow ground ball off Mortons pitches, so he cheated a bit by moving a few steps toward the plate.But the communication with Cora was the same.Exact same thing, Bregman said.I looked into the dugout and Cora said, Think.The thought process is, Hey, if its not absolutely rocketed at you, lets take the out at the plate and keep the game 0-0.McCann said his role in those plays was simply to catch the ball and lay down the tag, but it is more than that.The sequences occur rapidly: With a player on the other team bearing down on him at full speed, he must look for a baseball being thrown to him while also making sure he is allowing the runner a path to the plate.Something can easily go wrong.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.After all, the Yankees, who traded McCann to the Astros after last season, had considerable difficulty making these same kinds of plays in the postseason because their catcher, Gary Sanchez, could not hold on to the ball.I was lucky to hold on to the one with Bird, McCann said of the play during Game 7 of the A.L.C.S.Those guys just put it on the money and all I have to do is tag the runner out.Marwin has a great arm and he charges the ball really well.Alex, he doesnt hesitate even for an instant.Beltran agreed that what had impressed him the most about Bregman on the two throws he made to McCann was his unwavering commitment to the play his guts as Beltran put it.Making quality throws in intense moments is not always easy.Just ask the Mets, who lost the final game of the 2015 World Series in part because their first baseman, Lucas Duda, made a poor throw to the plate that allowed Eric Hosmer to score the trying run in the top of the ninth inning.Advertisement Continue reading the main story And making quality tags at the plate in huge moments is tough, too.But McCann, Gonzalez and Bregman are pulling it off, creating an unusual subtext to the postseason with more games still to go.
World Series 2017: Dodgers vs. Astros Game 5 Live Updates:::::Top 2nd: Keuchel finds the strike zone again.The real Dallas Keuchel showed up for the second inning, as he needed just 13 pitches to deal with the bottom of the Dodgers order.Keuchel ran the count full against Austin Barnes but eventually got the catcher to fly out to right.Charlie Culberson grounded out to short, and Chris Taylor grounded out to third to end the inning.Bottom 1st: Kershaw takes over with a 3-0 lead.Clayton Kershaw answered Dallas Keuchels hectic first inning with an incredibly quiet one on his end.He needed just two pitches to retire George Springer on a grounder to third.Alex Bregman popped out to center and then Jose Altuve struck out on a slider that went through the heart of the strike zone to end the inning.As reported on the broadcast, Kershaws career record in games in which he is spotted a three-run lead is 124-19.Waldstein: The Astros have some work to do offensively after an uncharacteristically sloppy top of the first.Two walks and two hits given up by Keuchel, a muffed ball by left fielder Marwin Gonzalez and a terrible throw to second base by Yuli Gurriel combined to hand the Dodgers three runs.Is this really the Astros?This team can catch it and throw it, as old-timey baseball folks like to say, and Keuchels lack of command was puzzling, too.Tall order to have to score three runs against Kershaw, but the sliver lining of falling behind early is that they have nine innings to work with ... make that eight.Astros go down in order in the first.Top 1st: Dodgers get to Keuchel early ... again.Dallas Keuchel spotted Clayton Kershaw three runs in a matchup of aces.Houstons top starter gave up a leadoff single to Chris Taylor and then with one out, he issued back-to-back walks to Justin Turner and Kike Hernandez.He struck out Cody Bellinger, but Logan Forsythe laced a two-out single to left that brought in two runs.An inning where the control artist Keuchel could not find the strike zone got even weirder when Forsythe left too soon on a stolen base attempt and Keuchel threw to first to try to pick him off.Forsythe was caught between bases and Yulieski Gurriel threw wildly to Jose Altuve at second.As Altuve struggled to get the ball and then get back to the bag to tag Forsythe, Hernandez raced in from third to score, increasing Houstons lead to 3-0.The call was challenged by Houston but was upheld.Keuchel got out of the inning when Yasiel Puig hit a dribbler in front of the plate and was thrown out at first by Brian McCann, but at that point he had already spotted baseballs best pitcher a three-run lead and had thrown 32 pitches.Advertisement Continue reading the main story George W.

Next! Dodgers and Astros Are Quick to Pull Pitchers:::::The Astros Charlie Morton faced the minimum 15 batters through five innings, and allowed just three hits and a run in six and one-third innings.It was the only matchup in World Series history in which both starters allowed four or fewer base runners.Yet despite efficient pitch counts 84 for Wood, 76 for Morton both starters were gone by the seventh-inning stretch.Its always in your best interest to take the pitcher out a hitter too early rather than a hitter too late, and Ive always tried to give the reliever a little bit of a leash, Astros Manager A. J. Hinch said.I always try to give the starter a job well done when he walks off the mound.But the context of the game is always going to shift and change.Photo Since the Mets Matt Harvey faltered in the ninth inning of the final game of 2015, managers have refused to let starters go deep in the World Series.The starters in Game 3 of the Series last fall the Chicago Cubs Kyle Hendricks and the Cleveland Indians Josh Tomlin were both removed in the fifth inning of a scoreless tie.No starter recorded an out past the sixth inning of that World Series, and through four games of this one, the only starter to complete seven was the Dodgers Clayton Kershaw in Game 1.Kershaw, who threw just 83 pitches that night, was scheduled for a rematch with Dallas Keuchel in Game 5 here on Sunday.The idea, Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said, is to predict when trouble might happen and avoid it, upending the traditional notion of riding a starter until he gets tired.Baseballs very reactionary, Roberts said, explaining that he tries to be proactive and get ahead of something that potentially might happen and to go a direction that might increase your chances marginally.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Dodgers have done this all year.In the regular season, they had the fewest starts in the majors of at least 100 pitches, with their pitchers reaching that threshold just 24 times half by Kershaw.In the 12 games the Dodgers had played in this postseason entering Sunday, only Kershaw had thrown 85 pitches in a start.Were very into analytics here, and numbers say the third time through the order, things kind of fall apart sometimes, Morrow said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I dont think we necessarily anticipated that with Woody throwing the ball as well as he was.Even though he gave up a home run there, hes more than able to come back and throw two or three more innings, Im sure.Games like this, you make the decision.Robertss decisions guided the Dodgers to 104 victories in the regular season, the most in the franchises six decades in Los Angeles.They now have a chance to finish this World Series at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday or Wednesday, so they might be on to something.Yet, for Wood and his fellow starter Rich Hill who was pulled after four innings, one run and just 60 pitches in Game 2 the numbers do not spike drastically after the second time through the order.Photo In the regular season, Hill kept hitters to a .162 average when facing them for the third or fourth time in a game.Against Wood in such situations, the average was .222.Then again, Roberts and Hinch he of the similarly analytics-minded Astros have reams of proprietary data to prepare them for nearly every possible in-game decision.They work closely with their front offices in a manner that the Yankees, who dismissed Joe Girardi last week after 10 winning seasons, will seek from their next manager.Roberts invited scrutiny in Game 2 after pulling Hill so early.The game went into extra innings, and by the time it reached the top of the 11th, Roberts was down to one reliever, Brandon McCarthy, who had not pitched in the entire postseason.McCarthy faltered, and the Dodgers lost.But those circumstances arose only because Kenley Jansen, who is normally infallible, blew the save in Game 2 after being handed a two-run lead in the eighth inning by the four Dodgers relievers who preceded him.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When the other relievers hold a lead for Jansen, Roberts has essentially done his job, regardless of the final outcome.Even with meticulous planning, it is the players, not the manager, who control the results.So it was in Game 4 of the Series, when Morton left with a 1-0 lead in the seventh inning but the bullpen gave up six runs behind him.It was natural to wonder what might have been had Morton stayed in the game, and Hinch understood.You can draw it out perfectly and map it out, but you never know how the other outcome would have been, he said.Everybody in baseball thinks that the other way would have been perfectly good, and we dont know.We do know that bullpen usage is changing, and starters rarely determine the outcome on their own anymore.They have gotten to the World Series this way, and accept it.We havent really had to work too hard so far in the playoffs, Wood said, paying tribute to the Dodgers bullpen.Theyve been absolutely nails.
Cody Bellinger Breaks Through, Leading the Dodgers Past the Astros:::::The Dodgers battered the Astros bullpen in the ninth inning on Saturday night, with Bellinger delivering a double off closer Ken Giles to put Los Angeles ahead, 2-1.And after a sacrifice fly by Austin Barnes made it 3-1, Joc Pederson blasted a three-run homer off Joe Musgrove to end any suspense.The Astros managed only two hits all night solo homers by George Springer with two outs in the sixth and by Alex Bregman with two outs in the ninth.Photo The late Dodgers outburst came after an unlikely pitchers duel between the teams No.4 starters, Alex Wood of the Dodgers and Charlie Morton of the Astros.Wood carried a no-hitter into the sixth on Saturday, when Springer produced the games first run with his homer.Morton was only slightly less flawless, facing the minimum number of batters through five innings.Thus far, each game has delivered an unexpected element.Game 1 came with extreme 103-degree heat.Game 2 brought a rare blown save by Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen and late, no-quit, home run-fueled comebacks by both teams.And Game 3 was marred by a racist gesture by Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel.Gurriels act, in which he stretched the side of his eyes after hitting a home run off the Dodgers Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish, provided the backdrop for Game 4.On Saturday afternoon, Commissioner Rob Manfred suspended Gurriel for five games at the start of the 2018 season, but chose not to discipline him for this Series, in part because he did not want to penalize the rest of the Astros.His decision drew support from Roberts, whose mother is Japanese.I think that it gives us all some closure in the sense that it was something that happened, Roberts said.The way that it was dealt with, I support.Gurriel, who received modest cheers from Astros fans when he came to the plate for his first at-bat on Saturday, was not a factor as Game 4 proceeded.But Bellinger was.Photo Bellinger, who made his Dodgers debut when veteran Adrian Gonzalez was injured this season, generally carries himself well beyond his years, owing to a reserved personality and the preparation provided by his father, Clay, who won two World Series rings with the Yankees.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hes got no pulse; he really doesnt have a memory, either, said Dodgers shortstop Corey Seager, who is 23 and in his third postseason.He forgets things.Things go away.Thats what you have to do in baseball you have to forget the past, forget your last AB and move onto the next one.Thats what he did tonight.But Bellingers breakout night did come with a thought process on his part.He was hitless in 13 at-bats, including eight strikeouts four in Game 3 as he came to the plate with one out in the seventh inning against Morton, who was nursing a 1-0 lead.Earlier, an insight had came to Bellinger when he went out to take batting practice: His teammates Andre Ethier and Logan Forsythe regularly hit the ball the opposite way when taking their pregame swings.So why not do the same?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I was always told these really good hitters hit the ball the other way in B.P., and I had never done it and I wanted to try it, said the left-handed hitting Bellinger, who proceeded to hit every ball to left field during the practice session.The struggles Bellinger endured in the Series were not unlike those of another ballyhooed rookie the Yankees Aaron Judge who emerged from a postseason slump midway through the American League Championship Series against the same Astros team Bellinger was now facing.I watched and we were identical, striking out a lot, swinging at a lot of off-speed pitches that we dont normally swing at, Bellinger said of Judge.I think thats the pressure of the postseason sometimes.Photo The Astros had put Bellinger in a funk by throwing him back-foot breaking balls and fastballs away pitches that are difficult to pull.But when Morton threw a 3-2 curveball to him in the seventh, he left it over the plate and Bellinger drove it the opposite way.Left fielder Marwin Gonzalez gave chase, but could not track it down.As Bellinger coasted into second with a double, he raised his hands and gazed upward as if to give thanks for his first hit of the series.It was also enough to chase Morton.He had survived the top of the sixth after Astros third baseman Alex Bregman threw Barnes out at home to keep the game scoreless.It was almost identical to a pivotal play Bregman made in Game 7 of the A.L.C.S., when he gunned down the Yankees Greg Bird at home to preserve a 1-0 lead.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But after Bellingers double an inning later, Astros Manager A.

Hinch had a brief conversation with Morton on the mound and then called on his rested bullpen.Will Harris came on to retire Yasiel Puig on a deep fly to right field, but Forsythe followed by lining a 2-0 fastball for a single that easily scored Bellinger.The Dodgers werent done.In the ninth, Giles who surrendered a two-run lead in Game 2 gave up a single to Seager and a walk to Justin Turner.Bellinger followed by driving a 1-0 fastball into the left-center gap for a double that scored Seager and sent Turner to third.The double he hit to left-center, he stayed on that curveball pretty good, Astros catcher Brian McCann said of the first double.And the one in the ninth, he cheated on the heater.They were not the swings of an overmatched youngster, or of someone weighed down by the moment.Instead, they were taken by someone who understood what to remember and what to forget, and the result was a World Series that might end up going the distance.
Manfred Makes His Choice: Punish Gurriel, but Leave the World Series Alone:::::Obviously, Manfred said, World Series games are different than regular-season games.Among the other reasons Manfred cited for delaying the suspension, this stands out: I felt it was unfair to punish the other 24 players on the Astros roster, he said.I wanted the burden of this discipline to fall primarily on the wrongdoer.Denying Gurriel a chance to help his team in the World Series would have severely affected him.It would also have allowed a fleeting gesture an ugly one, for sure, but one that was done in the dugout, not on the field, and that did not appear to be premeditated to unduly influence the World Series.And yet, given that reasoning by Manfred, these tough words from him on Saturday There is no place in our game for the behavior or any behavior like the behavior we witnessed last night seem somewhat contradictory.Gurriel, after all, is still playing.But Manfred was right in saying that World Series games are far more significant than a midseason game for the Oakland As or the Toronto Blue Jays.Maybe that sounds crass, but there is no disputing it.And while Manfred would not declare five games as the new standard price for intolerant words or actions during a game he said he would deal with each situation on its own merits the penalty for Gurriel does exceed all recent punishments, including the three-game ban given to Yunel Escobar, then of Toronto, for wearing eye black inscribed with an anti-gay slur in 2012.Gurriel, for his part, said after Fridays game that he was surprised by the furor over his gesture.He mentioned his experiences in Japan he played for the Yokohama BayStars in 2014 and said that he respected Japanese people.I did not want to offend anybody, he said through an interpreter.As for his characterization of Darvish as a chinito, a word that can be demeaning to Asians, Gurriel said that in Cuba, the term applies to anyone who is Asian, not just to Japanese people, although that did not amount to much of an excuse.Photo In any case, he added that he understood he was wrong.In a statement on Saturday, Gurriel apologized to Darvish and called his gesture indefensible.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Not surprisingly, both managers in the Series were asked to comment on Gurriel and his punishment.We support everything thats right about this game, and well move forward, if everyone will allow us to, Astros Manager A. J. Hinch said.Knowing Yuli, knowing what he will do to convince everyone that this incident was not in his heart, will be key.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts, who was born in Japan and whose mother is Japanese, said he approved of the way Manfred had handled the incident.Gurriel, who was batting .340 in the postseason and was in the starting lineup for Game 4, has delivered on his promise since the Astros signed him for five years and $47.5 million after he defected last year.He made a smooth transition from third base to first while batting .299 with 18 homers, 75 runs batted in and 43 doubles this season.Hes a great hitter, said Jose Altuve, the Astros star second baseman, one of the best Ive ever seen, to be honest with you.It was, officially, Gurriels rookie season.But at 33 years old, after playing professionally for 15 seasons in Cuba and Japan, Gurriel is a rookie in name only.He comes from a prominent baseball family in Cuba, and spent most of his prime years there.I could have left at 22 or something like other players and spent their entire careers here and maybe that would have been better, Gurriel said in Spanish at a workout in Los Angeles on Monday.But no, I dont regret it.I had the chance to play my entire life in Cuba and enjoy those great moments, and the chance to play in Japan.God wanted me to be here in this moment now, and Im enjoying this.The Astros have such a deep offense that their leader in runs batted in, Marwin Gonzalez, batted eighth in Game 3.That suits Gurriel, who said he felt pressure to carry his Cuban teams but does not have the same feeling here.In Cuba, if I didnt hit, I lost, he said.If I did hit, it was normal and what I was supposed to do.So it was really hard to please people.Its been different here in this lineup.At the same group interview in which he made those comments, Gurriel was asked a question by a Japanese reporter.He answered with a few words in Japanese before continuing in Spanish.I identified a lot with the Japanese public, Gurriel said.It was a really great experience.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yet with one gesture on Friday, Gurriel turned what should have been an experience to celebrate into something much different.And left Manfred to untangle it.
Astros Yuli Gurriel Escapes World Series Ban, but Will Miss 5 Games in 2018:::::Photo HOUSTON Yuli Gurriel, the Houston Astros first baseman who was seen making a racist gesture in the dugout during Game 3 of the World Series on Friday night, has been given a five-game suspension without pay that will begin at the start of the 2018 season.The suspension, which was handed down by Rob Manfred, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, is the largest levied against a player for a public act of intolerance during a baseball game, exceeding by two games the suspension of Yunel Escobar, who was penalized for gay slurs written on his eye black strips in 2012.Manfreds decision, which he announced in a Saturday afternoon news conference, means that Gurriel will not have to sit out any of the remaining games of the World Series.The Los Angeles Dodgers tied the Series at two games apiece with a 6-2 victory on Saturday night.Gurriel is scheduled to earn $12 million in 2018 and will lose roughly $320,855 because of the suspension.He will also have to undergo sensitivity training.Photo There is no excuse or explanation that makes that type of behavior acceptable, Manfred said.During Game 3 of the Series on Friday, Gurriel, who defected from Cuba in 2016, hit a home run off Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish in the bottom of the second inning.After Gurriel returned to the dugout, he was captured on camera smiling and then raising his hands as if to stretch the sides of his eyes.It seemed to be a clear, and pointedly insensitive, reference to Darvish, who is from Japan.After Game 3 ended in a Houston victory, Gurriel was besieged by reporters, and he told them through an interpreter that he did not intend to offend Darvish.He maintained that he was telling teammates that maybe Darvish thought he was Japanese and that is why he gave him a good pitch to hit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Darvish issued a statement Friday night forgiving Gurriel and asking people to learn from the incident.
Astros Rout Yu Darvish and Hold On to Beat the Dodgers in Game 3:::::HOUSTON The list of stellar pitchers that the Houston Astros lineup has toppled this postseason is impressive: Chris Sale, Craig Kimbrel, Luis Severino, Aroldis Chapman and Kenley Jansen all among the best at their craft.And by the second inning of Game 3 of the World Series on Friday night, the Astros had struck again, this time getting the best of another prestigious pitcher the Los Angeles Dodgers Yu Darvish.They shelled him for four runs and forced him to make him an unceremonious exit after getting only five outs.The end result was a 5-3 victory that gave the Astros a lead of two games to one in the Series, with Game 4 scheduled for Saturday night at Minute Maid Park.The Astros are now 7-0 in their ballpark this postseason, and the Dodgers trail for the first time in a 2017 postseason series.The victory displayed the dynamism of the Astros offense.After being limited to one run in Game 1, the Astros scored 12 over the next two games.The win also underscored the versatility of pitcher Brad Peacock.Used mainly as a starter this season, Peacock took over for Lance McCullers Jr. in the sixth and fired three and two-thirds hitless innings to complete the game, earning the first save of his career and ensuring that the work of the Astros lineup would hold up.Photo When I was out there, a couple of times I got the chills from them screaming so loud, Peacock said of the Astros fans.
A World Series Twist: First Loves Become the Enemy:::::His parents were from New York and rooted for the Yankees, as did Luhnows older brother, Chris, who told him they could not root for the same team.Luhnow picked the Dodgers, one of the more successful teams of the 1970s.I watched them on TV sunshine, L.A., the beach, a likable team, I liked the colors, all that, he said.So they became my team.Photo When Luhnow was 14, in 1981, Fernando Valenzuela profoundly jolted the franchise.Valenzuela, a pudgy prodigy from Navojoa, Mexico, opened the season by going 8-0 in eight starts and working nine innings every time.He ended that year with nine more innings against the Yankees to win Game 3 of the World Series, helping the Dodgers to a championship.Luhnow had found his favorite player.He just didnt look like a prototypical athlete, he said.He physically didnt look like he was in that great shape, his delivery was so unusual, and he looked like a guy that grew up in rural Mexico and was suddenly on the largest stage in the world and dominating in an unusual way that no one could figure out the screwball, the eyes rolling back and all the things that he did.He was a lovable player.Decades later, Luhnow would also defy convention to make it in baseball, using a business background and a strong belief in analytics to grow a thriving farm system for the St. Louis Cardinals and, since December 2011, to patiently build the Astros into winners.When he moved to California for high school, though, that was too far-off to imagine.Luhnow just wanted to go to Dodger Stadium.I came to a ton of games, he said.My English teacher had season tickets, right up there in the loge level.I would come every time he would invite me, which was quite a bit.Luhnow was there for the first two games of the 1983 National League Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies a loss in the opener and a victory by Valenzuela in Game 2.The Phillies won the best-of-five series in four and the Dodgers would not reach the World Series until 1988, after Luhnow had left California to continue his education, eventually earning an M.B.A. from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Friedman could relate to the World Series near miss.In 1986, just before he turned 10 (and before the Astros changed leagues), he attended the N.L.C.S.at the Astrodome.Friedman saw the Mets beat the Astros Nolan Ryan in Game 2, but the game that haunts him came a few days later.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That was the infamous or celebrated Game 6, which the Mets tied with three runs in the ninth.The Mets scored again in the 14th before the Astros, who were facing elimination, tied it on a Billy Hatcher homer.The Mets scored three in the 16th, gave up two in the bottom of the inning, but finally won the pennant and avoided facing the unhittable Mike Scott in Game 7.I was heartbroken I swore off baseball, said Friedman, who had witnessed Scotts division-clinching no-hitter that September.He added that 86 scarred me some I remember watching the World Series with the Mets and Red Sox, and it was painful.Photo Of course, Friedman did not really give up the game.As the years went on, he would visit the Astrodome so frequently about 30 times a summer, he guessed that he befriended the stadium workers and could roam almost anywhere he pleased.Long before clubs stamped game-used items with holograms and sold them at the team store, Friedman would often go home with broken bats or discarded equipment.He once scored an artifact from the early career of a future Hall of Famer.Probably a Craig Biggio helmet from when he was catching, Friedman said, when asked for the prize of his collection.It had a crack in it, and I dont really remember how I got it but probably someone that wasnt him just saw me there hanging out.Friedman would play baseball at Tulane and, like Luhnow, work in business before joining a major league front office.He built the Tampa Bay Rays into pennant winners in 2008, and has been the Dodgers president of baseball operations for three years.In their jobs now, Luhnow and Friedman regularly meet their old heroes.Friedman said he had put his fandom long behind, and was not awe-struck when he met Biggio a few years ago.Luhnow, though, has never quite summoned the courage to have a conversation with Valenzuela, who now broadcasts Dodgers games in Spanish and tossed the ceremonial first pitch before Game 2.Luhnow said he got chills watching that ceremony.He has said hello to his baseball idol, but only casually.Yet Valenzuela is well aware of his work.I havent had the pleasure of meeting him, but I would congratulate him on where his team has gotten, Valenzuela said in Spanish.His team has reached the World Series, which is what you want.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Actually, both of Luhnows teams his employer and his first love have reached the World Series.Both of Friedmans, too.
Want to Play in the World Series? Just Get the Yankees to Trade You:::::After all, since the Yankees began jettisoning veterans from their 25-man roster, in 2016, almost everyone they have traded has gone on to the Series.So why not Ellsbury and Headley?Advertisement Continue reading the main story Consider that Aroldis Chapman was traded to the Chicago Cubs in July of last year (he is a Yankee again) and played a key role in the 2016 Series.So did his fellow reliever Andrew Miller, who was traded by the Yankees to the Cleveland Indians in midseason and also ended up a major figure in the 2016 Series.Another Yankee who was dealt at the nonwaiver trade deadline last year was Carlos Beltran.He was sent to the Texas Rangers, but signed as a free agent with the Houston Astros before this season.Now he is in the World Series, too, along with another former Yankee catcher Brian McCann, who was traded by New York to the Astros in the off-season.Then there is reliever Tyler Clippard, who was a Yankee this year and is now an Astro, although he is not on the postseason roster.Still, if the Astros win the Series, he is in line to get a ring.Photo Clippard was sent to the Chicago White Sox this season to help offset some of the salary the Yankees were taking on when they acquired relievers Tommy Kahnle and David Robertson and third baseman Todd Frazier.Several weeks later, the White Sox sent Clippard to the Astros.The only two players the Yankees have dealt from their major league roster in the past 16 months who have not reached a World Series are starting pitcher Ivan Nova, who was sent to Pittsburgh at the 2016 nonwaiver trade deadline and has remained there, and reliever Tyler Webb, who was dealt to Milwaukee this past summer.Beltran, who grounded out as a pinch-hitter on Tuesday night in Game 1 of the Series, was relegated to the bench for the two World Series games at Dodger Stadium earlier this week because there is no designated hitter in National League parks.But McCann could play a central role as this Series continues, just as he did in the American League Championship Series against the Yankees, when he hit a pair of run-scoring doubles that sparked the Astros to victories in Games 6 and 7.McCann signed a five-year, $85 million deal with the Yankees in November 2013 but realized his role as the teams regular catcher was in peril once the Yankees called up Gary Sanchez from the minor leagues in August 2016 and thrust him into the lineup.From that point on, McCann played regularly as a designated hitter but caught only sporadically.Meanwhile, Sanchez was slugging one home run after another.Photo When the season ended, I kind of assessed where I was and what I wanted to do going forward, and I just wasnt ready to catch once a week and I wasnt ready to just D.H. against right-handed pitching, McCann said recently.Advertisement Continue reading the main story While McCann had a no-trade clause in his deal with the Yankees, he also had another incentive to waive it the $15 million in his contract for 2019.It vests only if he has 1,000 plate appearances in 2017 and 2018 and he must also catch at least 90 games next year and not end the season on the disabled list.In conversations with Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman after last season, it became apparent to McCann that there were two realistic landing spots for him the Astros and the Atlanta Braves.Atlanta is McCanns hometown and the Braves are the club with whom he began his career.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But in the end, it was Houston that wanted to make the deal, with the Yankees picking up $11 million of McCanns contract over this season and next.I looked around and this was the first team that came to mind because I knew they needed a catcher, I knew the talent they had in the clubhouse playing against them, and it was just a perfect fit, said McCann, who is playing in his first World Series.I talked to Cash quite a bit during that process and it was really between coming here or going to Atlanta.Im very thankful this all worked out the way it did.Well, not all of it.Because McCann had only 399 plate appearances this season he batted .241 with 18 home runs it is unlikely the 2019 option will kick in.Still, he is in the World Series, one more recently traded Yankee enjoying baseballs most prestigious competition.Perhaps there will be still others in 2018.
World Series 2017: How the Astros Won Game 3, Inning by Inning:::::- Want exclusive sports news, highlights and analysis from a rotating cast of New York Times journalists, delivered to your inbox once a week?Click here to receive our weekly Sports newsletter.- Heres how the Astros beat the Dodgers in Game 3, inning by inning: Photo Top 1st: McCullers gets three quick outs.Game 3 began at 8:21 p.m. Eastern with Lance McCullers of the Astros throwing a 95 mile-per-hour fastball low and outside for ball one to Chris Taylor of the Dodgers.McCullers eventually got Taylor to pop out to second and retired Corey Seager when Jose Altuve made a great diving play in shallow-right to knock the ball down before throwing Seager out at first.The inning ended with Justin Turner flying out to deep center.Waldstein: Yu Darvish takes the mound in the bottom of the first for the Dodgers as the first Japanese starting pitcher in the World Series in 10 years.The last one was Daisuke Matsuzaka for the Boston Red Sox in their four-game sweep of the Colorado Rockies in 2007.Matsuzaka also started Game 3.Darvish has plenty of experience pitching at Minute Maid Park from his days with the Texas Rangers.He comes into the game with a 4-1 record and a 2.16 earned run average, so the Dodgers are pinning a lot of their hopes on him replicating that success here.Bottom 1st: Darvish gets out of jam.George Springer worked a 3-1 count against Yu Darvish and then pounced on a fastball in the zone, hitting a hard liner to center for a double.Alex Bregman made Darvish work, fouling off five pitches in an eight-pitch at-bat, but ultimately grounded out to third, which kept Springer at second.Jose Altuve flew out to deep center, which sent Springer to third, but Darvish got ahead in the count and Carlos Correa grounded out to short to end the inning.Top 2nd: Dodgers make some noise, but no runs.Lance McCullers threw half of his 12 pitches in the inning to one batter, but worked around a single to keep the game scoreless.He needed just three pitches to strike out Cody Bellinger, as the rookie infielder almost fell down as he swung wildly at a knuckle-curve.One pitch to Yasiel Puig and McCullers had a second out on a grounder to second, but Logan Forsythe got the Dodgers first hit on a single to right.Forsythe was able to steal second as Austin Barnes worked a six-pitch at-bat, but the half-inning ended when Barnes grounded out to third.Photo Bottom 2nd: Astros jump all over Darvish and score 4 runs.Yu Darvish struggled to put pitches where he wanted them and that led to a great inning for struggling Astros batters.Only six outs into the game, Dave Roberts had seen enough and removed his No.3 starter with the Dodgers already down 4-0.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yulieski Gurriel, who was 1 for 7 in Games 1 and 2, led things off by unloading on a fastball for a solo home run.Josh Reddick, whose bat had been almost entirely silent, doubled to left for his first extra-base hit of the postseason.Evan Gattis walked and Marwin Gonzalez, who had been in a horrible funk leading up to his game-tying home run in Game 2, singled off the wall in left, scoring Reddick.With runners on first and second with no outs, Brian McCann, who was hitless in the first two games of the series, looped a ball into right-center that brought home Gattis and sent Gonzalez to third.Photo Darvish finally got his first out when George Springer, the sixth batter of the half-inning, lined out to second, but Alex Bregman hit a fly ball deep enough to center to give Gonzalez enough time to tag up and score, making the score 4-0.Jose Altuve doubled to left, sending McCann over to third, and that brought out Roberts, who replaced Darvish with Kenta Maeda.Maeda needed just two pitches to end the inning, getting Carlos Correa to fly out to right.Darvishs final line was one and two-thirds innings, six hits and four runs.He walked one and had no strikeouts in the shortest start of his career.Waldstein: Darvish did not have it tonight.Even the outs were on balls that were hit hard.Gurriel started it by ripping a line-drive home run into the left field bleachers, which can be home to some of the cheapest home runs in baseball.Not to say that it was cheap, because he hammered the ball.But the distance is 315 feet, only 5 feet deeper than Fenway Park in Boston.But the wall here is about half the height of the 37-foot Green Monster, so it is one of the most tantalizing targets in baseball for a right-handed pull hitter, as Gurriel showed.It was the sixth home run hit in the last four innings of this World Series, going back to the extra innings of Game 2.Photo Top 3rd: Dodgers get one back.Given a fairly sizable lead, Lance McCullers walked the bases loaded to start the third, but managed to get out of the half-inning having only allowed one run.It was a rough start, as he engaged in a battle with Joc Pederson.The boom-or-bust hitter fought off several good pitches in what proved to be a nine-pitch walk.Undoubtedly frustrated by putting Pederson on base, McCullers responded with walks to Kike Hernandez and Chris Taylor.He got some help when his defense turned a double-play on a grounder from Corey Seager, and ended the inning by getting Justin Turner to ground out to short.The inning couldve gone far worse for McCullers, who should be happy with a 4-1 score.Waldstein: You want to make a pitching coach crazy?Get handed a 4-0 lead and then go to the mound and walk the No.8, No.9 and No.1 hitters to load the bases with nobody out.Thats what Lance McCullers, Jr. just did.But thanks to some terrific defense, including by McCullers, himself, the Astros avoided big damage.The big play was getting Corey Seager to ground into a double play that required some exceptional synchronized movement and pinpoint throws from the Astros to complete.First baseman Yuli Gurriel threw a strike off the wrong foot to Carlos Correa coming across the second base bag and he, while in stride, delivered the ball to a moving target in McCullers covering first.That kind of cohesion begins in spring training.Photo Bottom 3rd: Maeda cools down Astros batters.After a pair of lengthy half-innings for both teams, Kenta Maeda made quick work of the Astros in the third.He started by getting a pair of matching pop-outs to third from Yulieski Gurriel and Josh Reddick.A walk to Evan Gattis was a mild speed bump, but Maeda finished things off by getting Marwin Gonzalez to ground out to first to end the inning.Photo Top 4th: Puigs gamble backfires.A bang-bang play went Houstons way, sending the Dodgers down in order.With one out, Yasiel Puig hit a grounder down the third-base line that Alex Bregman could not quite reach.The ball skipped into foul territory, but Puig took some time before realizing he should round first and Carlos Correa was able to corral the ball and throw him out at second.Stoked to have two outs despite the hard hit by Puig, Lance McCullers ended things by getting Logan Forsythe to fly out to right.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Waldstein: Yasiel Puig has been caught admiring balls before, but this time he suffered from putting his head down and hustling to first base.After hitting a sharp bouncer down the third base line, Puig ran so hard that he did not see the ball had skipped past third baseman Alex Bregman.Puig overran first, slowed down and only then realized he should have been headed to second.By the time he restarted and slid into second, the ball was in Jose Altuves glove and Puig was tagged out.Bottom 4th: Maedas relief appearance gives Dodgers hope.Kenta Maeda has done a terrific job of settling things down after Yu Darvishs disastrous start.Brian McCann led off fourth against him by looping a ball just out of Corey Seagers reach in shallow left field for a single.But Maeda was unfazed and went on to strike out George Springer on four pitches and Alex Bregman on five.He got out of the inning when Jose Altuve grounded out to short.Maeda is up to 38 pitches in two and one-thirds innings of relief as the Dodgers try to get as much as they can from one of the teams three best relievers.Photo Top 5th: McCullers gets out of trouble again.Lance McCullers worked around some tremendous hustle from Joc Pederson to pitch another scoreless inning, with some help from George Springer.With one out, Pederson hit what looked like a single to center.But the young outfielder ran hard right out of the box and managed to stretch the soft hit into a double.Kike Hernandez sent him to third on a groundout to second, but McCullers got out of the inning when Chris Taylor hit a shallow fly to center that a diving Springer was able to snare for the third out.
The Astros Alex Bregman Keeps Working at Hitting, Fielding and Spanish:::::Across from Gurriel at the other corner of the infield is Bregman, a 23-year-old third baseman and a first-round draft pick in 2015 who moves seamlessly between the teams contingents of Latino and American players because he has a working knowledge of Spanish and a desire to get better at it.He makes the effort, and he values the guys who dont speak English, which is important in this game, said Carlos Beltran, the Astros designated hitter, who is from Puerto Rico.When I see an American player really making the effort with the Latinos, its something really special, added Beltran, 40, who was shy as a teenage prospect because he did not understand English but over the years has become confident in publicly addressing issues.He was one of the players most instrumental in getting Major League Baseball to require that every team have Spanish-English interpreters.More than a quarter of major league players are Latino, and most of those were born overseas.After arriving in the United States, those players are expected to learn English, and they often take language classes in baseball academies and in the minor leagues.In contrast, American-born players without any Latino background do not receive similar instruction in Spanish, even though it is the first language of numerous teammates.Instead, they usually learn bits of Spanish from playing alongside Latinos in both the minor and major leagues.What frequently happens as a result is that the foreign-born Latino players, especially those whose English is limited, end up spending most of their time in and away from the clubhouse with their fellow Spanish-speaking teammates.It becomes a question of comfort and familiarity.Photo But in the Astros clubhouse, the high-energy, Spanish-speaking Bregman bounces around everywhere.He hangs with the American players, the Latinos, everyone, Correa said.Hes a great teammate.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Monday, the day before Game 1 of the World Series, the Astros infielders finished fielding drills and headed to the batting cage together.Altuve, Correa, Gurriel, Bregman and the utility player Marwin Gonzalez, who is from Venezuela, walked as a group with Gonzalezs arm over Bregmans shoulder.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Growing up in New Mexico and in a baseball family, Bregman was perhaps destined for this.His father, Sam, who is a lawyer, and an uncle played baseball at the University of New Mexico.His grandfather Stan was the general counsel for the second version of the Washington Senators, and helped negotiate the teams sale.At age 5, Alex Bregman said, he began receiving Spanish instruction in school.Throughout his baseball travels, including time while on developmental rosters for Team U.S.A., he said, he played in Colombia, Mexico and Cuba.That helped with his Spanish, too.Bregman was selected by the Astros with the second overall pick in 2015, and within a year he was in the major leagues because of his strong fielding and hitting ability.He hit .284 with 19 home runs and 71 R.B.I.this season and was 3 for 10 with a home run through the first two games of the World Series.Meanwhile, Bregman said, his Spanish skills continued to improve because he had so many Latino teammates once he turned professional.Im basically almost fluent now, he said, perhaps overstating his proficiency.I understand it all and speak probably 90 percent of it.You can ask them, but theyll tell you Im fluent.Photo His teammates verdict?He speaks it pretty well, at least better than you think, said Altuve, who speaks English well, just like Correa and Gonzalez.When I first met him, he didnt speak much.But hes learning more every day, so be careful what you say in front of him.Francisco Liriano, a veteran Astros pitcher who is from the Dominican Republic, grinned when asked about Bregmans Spanish.He sounds like an American, but he knows a good amount, he said.Beltran lauded Bregmans confidence and desire to learn a new language, a trait Beltran said would help Bregman not only with Spanish but throughout his career on the baseball field.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The most important thing is that he tries, said Beltran, who spoke in Spanish for this article, as did the other Latino players who were interviewed.Hes not afraid to express himself.He makes me laugh a few times because its funny the words he uses, good and bad words.Words you hear and you think, Oh, wow, how cool that he knows this word.Bregman is so enthusiastic about his language endeavor that he has done conducted brief interviews in Spanish with Francisco Romero, a Spanish-language radio broadcaster for Astros games.In an interview two weeks ago with Romero during the postseason, Bregman called a home run against the Boston Red Sox a dream for me and my family in Spanish, then mixed in some English when he could not remember how to say a blessing.The sentences were not complete, and there were a few mistakes, but he tried and he smiled.Earlier in the season, Romero recorded Bregman singing along in Spanish to Ginza, a popular reggaeton song by the Colombian artist J. Balvin.Because Altuve is well known in the Astros clubhouse for singing along to music, Bregman wanted to do it, too.Hanging out with his Latino teammates, Bregman said, has given him an appreciation for reggaeton (we all listen to it in the clubhouse all the time) and for carne asada, a staple of Latin American cuisines.Its all part of his learning process.
Fans Love Extra Innings and Late-Game Twists. Reporters, Less So.:::::As if it had fallen from the sky, a fruitful theme emerged in the sixth inning: Corey Seager, the Dodgers All-Star shortstop who missed the previous round of the playoffs with a bad back smashed a go-ahead, two-run home run.(Hitting a baseball is hard enough; imagine bashing it into the stands when it is thrown at 97 miles per hour and you have barely played the past two weeks.)Even when standout Dodgers relievers Brandon Morrow and Kenley Jansen gave up a run in the eighth inning, the Dodgers still held a 3-2 lead, and I thought the 950 words of a story framed around Seager would still work.I even liked how I had written it.But in the top of the ninth inning, something unlikely happened: Astros left fielder Marwin Gonzalez, who had been struggling in the playoffs, clobbered a game-tying home run off Jansen, who had never blown a save in his playoff career.It was 11:18 p.m. Eastern.While the most dramatic, mind-bending games are fun to watch on the couch or at the bar or in the stands, trying to capture the many late-game twists and turns as the final print edition deadline nears can be nerve-racking.So, goodbye Corey Seager story.I copied it all into a separate document and started rewriting.Then, in the top of the 10th inning, Astros stars Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa gave Houston a 5-3 lead with two solo home runs.As a reporter, I have no rooting interest.But this gave me a little bit of a cushion from deadline pressure: The Dodgers still had to bat in the bottom of the inning.I reframed the story around Houstons improbable comeback against a Dodgers bullpen that had not allowed a run in 25 consecutive innings entering the game, focusing on the blasts by Gonzalez, Correa and Altuve.Photo At 11:50 p.m., the night sports editor, Joel Petterson, emailed to remind me that they would need the story immediately when the game ended to get it into the final edition.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dont worry if its sloppy, well clean up whatever, said Petterson, who has saved me on deadline before.Within 10 minutes of his email, the Dodgers tied the score, at 5-5, with a home run by Yasiel Puig and a single by Enrique Hernandez.I wrote back to Petterson: Ive added like 50 white hairs the past three innings alone.I had not gotten up from my seat since the fifth inning.By now, I knew that I needed to come up with a way to capture the mayhem of the game, no matter the outcome.I wrote a broad introduction or lede, as we call it in journalism and worked backward through the wildest moments of the game.(The teams set a World Series record with eight home runs in total, including five in extra innings.)I left a few sentences with blanks, knowing I would fill in the final details the time of the game, the last out, the winning hit.As soon as the game ended, I sent in my story.After talking to the managers and players, I filed an updated version for the web, since the print deadline had long passed.Once I was done, I looked over at the secondary document I had open on my computer.There is probably a funny compilation to be made of all the drafts of historic game stories that never saw the light of day.If anyone ever gets around to pulling one together, I have 2,360 words to add.
The Yankees Had a Steady Winner in Girardi. Now They Want More.:::::It is clear, though, that the Yankees viewed this moment as something of a pivot point.After coming so close to the World Series, they now expect to get there, and win, within the term of the next managers contract.Girardi took this group to the edge of a title, and now his successor they hope will haul it over the top.For all the niceties in the five-sentence statement from General Manager Brian Cashman announcing the move he praised Girardis work ethic and heart, and wished him well he gave no explanation for the move.Everything this organization does is done with careful and thorough consideration, the statement said, leaving open the question of what Cashman considered to be lacking in Girardi.After a decade of working with him, Cashman knew precisely what he had in Girardi.He is said not to have held Girardis tactical blunder in the division series against him (Girardi failed to ask for a video review that could have prevented a Cleveland Indians grand slam), but he knows what kind of team he has built, and he decided not to have Girardi lead it.Photo To Cashman, Girardis style might not mesh well with a team of players in their 20s.The veterans Girardi managed for most of his tenure, essentially, were fully formed major leaguers before they played for him.A younger group may respond better to a manager who projects less tension and more outward calm.In the A.L.C.S., the Yankees got a close look at a manager who does that, one with renowned communication skills: A. J. Hinch of the Astros, who recovered from three losses at Yankee Stadium to take the final two games in Houston.Hinchs Astros also eliminated the Yankees in the 2015 A.L.wild card game, the Yankees only other playoff appearance in the last five years.He just believes in every single one of us, and he shows you that, Alex Bregman, the Astros 23-year-old third baseman, said on Thursday.He shows that he has confidence in everybody on our roster.Hes a motivator and a guy that you want to play for a guy that you want to run through a wall for.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Girardi speaks often of believing in his guys.But he showed no faith in Dellin Betances, a four-time All-Star reliever, when he yanked him after he had faced two batters in his final appearance of the regular season with a four-run lead in the ninth inning.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Betances had seemed to be turning around an inconsistent season, but after that outing he became a playoff afterthought.Twice Girardi pulled him after two batters in the postseason when the Yankees held a big lead, and by the fateful Game 7 of the A.L.C.S.after burning Chad Green for two and a third innings in Game 6 Girardi was left with limited options.Of course, the Yankees did not score in Game 7, so their pitching options made little difference.And bullpen management, in general, has always seemed to be a strength of Girardis, along with his meticulous preparation.Yet over Girardis tenure, managers increasingly became extensions of the front office, and the Yankees, with their increasing emphasis on analytics, were no different.If Girardi and Cashman were still in lock step on overall philosophy, game management or both their partnership would most likely still be intact.Instead, Cashman severed it, as the Washington Nationals did with Dusty Baker and the Boston Red Sox with John Farrell, both after having made the playoffs two years in a row.In one of his final acts on the job, Girardi made a point to seek out Hinch in the home clubhouse in Houston after Game 7 to congratulate him and wish him well.Hes a real class act, Hinch said on Thursday, adding later, I dont think anyone goes through what Joe goes through in New York.Girardi went through it all as a winner 10 seasons, 10 winning records and a somewhat puzzling departure.Fans once wondered how anyone could adequately replace Joe Torre, who won four championships.Now we could ask the same question about replacing Girardi, who won just one title but kept a stable, successful atmosphere for a decade.
After a Decade, Joe Girardi Is Out as Manager of the Yankees:::::It will now be up to Cashman to find a new manager, although Cashman himself still has to sign a new contract with the club.The most likely internal candidate is Joe Espada, who worked as a special assistant to Cashman for one season before becoming the Yankees third-base coach in 2015.Espada, who is 42, has a strong relationship with several of the young, Spanish-speaking Yankee players.Cashman was developing a list of candidates on Thursday, according to the baseball executive, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly.And that list will almost certainly include candidates from outside the Yankees organization as Cashman tries to figure out who is best suited to managing a young team brimming with talent while dealing with the media scrutiny that the Yankees attract.The decision to part with Girardi comes after a postseason run that was both exhilarating and painfully disappointing for the Yankees, ending with a loss in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series.Two other managers the Washington Nationals Dusty Baker and the Boston Red Sox John Farrell lost their jobs this month after their teams were ousted from the postseason.Girardi now becomes the third.In his decade in the Bronx, Girardi compiled a 910-710 record and was the third-longest-tenured active manager in the major leagues before he was let go, behind the Los Angeles Angels Mike Scioscia and the San Francisco Giants Bruce Bochy.Photo In recent years, he was able to get aging Yankee teams to at least stay in the hunt for a postseason berth.And then came the 2017 campaign, in which Girardi found himself presiding over a younger and, at times, dynamic roster that began to exceed just about everyones expectations as the season progressed.It was a club that chased the Red Sox to the penultimate day of the regular season for the division title before ending up with a wild-card berth.And it was a club that then embarked on a postseason run that did not end until last weekend.Girardis unyielding manner be it his rigorous preparation or his sometimes-contentious back and forth with the news media was reflected in that run, in which the Yankees twice rallied from two-games-to-none deficits in postseason series only to ultimately fall short.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But it was during the postseason run that Girardi also came under fierce criticism for his managing.It grew out of the Yankees Game 2 loss in the division series against the Cleveland Indians, a game in which Girardi declined to ask for a replay review of a hit-by-pitch call a decision that opened the door for an Indians comeback.Girardi, who made a rare admission the next day I screwed up, he said repeatedly at a news conference was afforded a reprieve when the Yankees rallied to win the next three games to advance to the A.L.C.S.against the Houston Astros.Still, the withering criticism that was directed at him after the Game 2 blunder seemed to affect him deeply and, for the first time, raised the notion that his decade in the Bronx had worn on him.And Saturday night, after the Yankees were eliminated by the Astros, Girardi had an almost fatalistic tone as he discussed his baseball future.Ive had 10 great years here, he said.I feel extremely blessed.God has been good to me, and well see what the future holds.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.That same night, Cashman was vague in his assessment of Girardi and did not single him out for praise.I think everybody did everything they possibly could to get where we wanted to go, to be the last team standing, and we fell short, Cashman said.Though Cashman and Girardi have divergent personalities and far different interests, they had generally enjoyed a strong working relationship.I think he knows that he can speak his mind in a constructive way with me, and I can speak my mind in a constructive way with him, Cashman said at the start of the 2016 season.Theres an openness that is encouraged here.I acquire the talent, and Joe deploys the talent, and sometimes youll have disagreements on players capabilities that Ive acquired or strategies that hes employing.Photo Youve got to be able to work through those in a healthy manner to have a successful manager-general-manager relationship, and Im proud to say we have that, Cashman added.But at a time when the ability to relate to players is becoming more valued, Girardi may have had some difficulties on that front.He became so frustrated this season over catcher Gary Sanchezs inattentiveness in blocking pitches that he publicly called him out, a rarity for Girardi.Advertisement Continue reading the main story And in the wake of Girardis botched replay decision, closer Aroldis Chapman liked a social media post that urged the Yankees not to bring Girardi back.Chapman later said he had done it inadvertently.Girardi, who was chosen over Don Mattingly to replace Torre, as manager, had a rocky first season in 2008, when the Yankees missed the playoffs for the first time since the strike-aborted season of 1994.But the Yankees made an immediate turnaround and won the 2009 World Series the 27th in franchise history in a new stadium.That championship also meant a change of uniform for Girardi.He switched to No.28 from No.27 because he wanted a visible reminder of the number of championships the Yankees had accumulated, along with the inference that another one would surely come soon enough.But it did not.In an interview before the start of the 2017 season, Hal Steinbrenner largely absolved Girardi for the disappointments the Yankees had encountered, including a failure to make the playoffs in 2013, 2014 and 2016.Was any of what was going on the fault of Joe Girardi?, Steinbrenner said.Was Joe Girardi the fact we hadnt made the playoffs in two to three years?Had he lost control of the team?Did the players no longer respect him?Is it a serious situation in that regard?And the answer to that in my opinion was no.There have been plenty of owners that have fired managers left and right and still arent winning, Steinbrenner added.So how well does that work?Girardi, who has three children, has long touted the importance of family.He skipped a game this season in Tampa to attend the high school graduation of his oldest daughter, and he made it comfortable for players and coaches to leave the team for significant events in their lives.And Girardi said last week that he would meet with his family after the season to gauge how they felt about him returning.Im not living my kids lives; Im not living my wifes life, he said.Im living, in a sense, my life, so I dont know what changes for them.Now, however, much has changed for Girardi.He is no longer the Yankees manager.
After Barrage of Home Runs in the World Series, Juicy Theories as to Why:::::That was basically the story of Game 2, when the Astros and the Dodgers combined for five home runs in extra innings something that had never been done in major league history, even in the regular season.Major leaguers combined for a record 6,105 homers in 2017, and the postseason has been no different.The very first batter, Minnesotas Brian Dozier, went deep to start the first wild-card game.In their National League Championship Series loss to the Dodgers, the Chicago Cubs scored eight runs on homers, and no runs any other way.Of the 17 runs scored in this World Series, 14 have come on homers.Everybodys swinging for the fences, said a weary Ken Giles, the Astros closer, who served up Yasiel Puigs 10th-inning blast in Game 2.Home runs this series have been the big play so far.We need to figure out a way to prevent it.On Friday, the series shifts to Minute Maid Park, where the Astros are 6-0 this postseason.Jose Altuve began the Astros playoff run with three homers there in the division series opener.The Dodgers also got a three-homer game in the playoffs, by Enrique Hernandez in the N.L.C.S.clincher.Teams generally must slug to win.The top eight teams in slugging percentage all reached the playoffs this season; the Astros were first, at .478, and the Dodgers were tied for seventh with the Cubs, at .437.If this World Series becomes one big home run derby, the Astros like their chances.If it comes down to a slugfest, my moneys on us, third baseman Alex Bregman said.We bang.Were the best-hitting team in baseball.Well step in that box ready to go every time.Its fun to be a part of an offense like this.Bregman homered off Clayton Kershaw in Game 1, the only blemish across Kershaws seven dazzling innings.It was typical of the way opponents have tried to handle Kershaw this month: With little chance of bunching hits together, they simply try to swing big.Photo The strategy is failing; while Kershaw has allowed all eight of his runs on homers this postseason, he is 3-0 with a 2.96 earned run average.He is scheduled to face Keuchel in Game 5 on Sunday.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As for Keuchels assertion widely shared by other pitchers around the league that the balls have been altered, Commissioner Rob Manfred has consistently denied it.He reiterated that stance before the American League wild-card game this month.Were using two different labs that have been looking at the ball on a continuous basis all year, Manfred said.Balls are within specs; theres been no movement even within the range of the specifications in terms of the baseball.Ive said before I think theres other issues causing the home runs other than the baseball principally, the way the games being played, the tolerance for strikeouts, power pitching, guys changing their swing.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Manfred added that fans like home runs, a point that is hard to argue.Excitement surged through Dodger Stadium with each home run on Wednesday night, and the hitters reacted memorably: The Dodgers Joc Pederson joyously gestured to the crowd; Carlos Correa gleefully flipped his bat toward the Astros dugout; Puig gently placed his bat on the dirt; Charlie Culberson cavorted as if he were Joe Carter.Guys have been superaggressive, trying to get a fastball or attack a first pitch thats what Ive been seeing, said the Astros Chris Devenski, who gave up Culbersons two-out homer in the 11th but struck out Puig with a changeup to end it.Its baseball.It goes in streaks; it goes in spurts at times.The last time the World Series came to Southern California, in 2002, home runs were also the big story.The Angels beat the San Francisco Giants in Game 2 in Anaheim, 11-10, with the teams combining for six home runs, out of a record 21 for the Series.Players openly guessed that the ball was juiced then, too.Al Levine, a nonroster pitcher for the Angels, actually took a Ginsu knife and sliced open a World Series ball and a regular-season ball in the clubhouse during that game.He concluded that the World Series ball was wound tighter.When I cut them open, one was easier, definitely, Levine said then.The World Series ball was a lot tougher to get through.Troy Percival, the Angels closer who had given up a towering homer to Barry Bonds, put it this way: Its like throwing a smooth rock.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Predictably, baseball denied any shenanigans.By then, though, the owners and the players had agreed to implement steroid testing the next season.The program has gradually gotten tougher since then, including a provision that players suspended during the regular season cannot take part in the postseason.We have been fooled before, of course, but this generation of players seems to want a clean game.A widespread, coordinated cheating epidemic that consistently beats baseballs testing program seems a little hard to fathom.In any case, this World Series has so far reflected the game in 2017: dinger after dinger after dinger, breaking records and turning most players into awe-struck fans.I dont know what to tell you, man, Correa said.It was so much fun.
Astros Even World Series With Dodgers in a Home Run Derby:::::Because no lead was safe on Wednesday, many fans were undoubtedly holding their breath in the bottom of the 11th.It was merited: Charlie Culberson hit a solo home run off Astros reliever Chris Devenski, trimming Houstons lead to one run.Photo But Devenski struck out Puig to complete the victory after 4 hours 19 minutes, handing the Dodgers just their second loss of this postseason.It was probably as nerve-racking as it was in the stands as for everybody else, Springer said.When the last out is made you finally breathe.Two games may be a small sample size, yet one conclusion can be drawn in this series: These are two well-matched teams that have the potential to play more dramatic games like Game 2.Even the calmest of fans would have had trouble watching Wednesdays game without fraying some nerves.Two teams that competed for 27 outs, Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said.An emotional roller coaster.The teams will now fly to Houston with the best-of-seven series tied at one game apiece.They will return to action on Friday, with Houstons Lance McCullers Jr., a hero of Game 7 of the A.L.C.S.against the Yankees, slated to start Game 3 opposite Yu Darvish of the Dodgers.The unseasonably warm weather in Los Angeles it was 93 degrees at first pitch should have been a clue that no margin would be comfortable.Balls that might have normally died at the warning track turned into game-changing hits.Photo Dodger Stadium is pretty famous for, at night, the ball not carrying, said Verlander, who had pitched brilliantly this postseason.Doesnt seem like the case the last couple of nights.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Verlander, staked to a 1-0 lead thanks to Alex Bregmans single in the third inning, was mowing through the Dodgers lineup with ease early on.But with two out in the fifth inning, Verlander gave up his first hit to Dodgers left fielder Joc Pederson, who tied the score at 1-1 with his first major league home run since July 26.Seager provided what felt a decisive blow an inning later.Seager, last years National League Rookie of the Year, hurt his back in the Dodgers division series against the Arizona Diamondbacks and missed the entire N.L.C.S.With two outs in the sixth, Dodgers center fielder Chris Taylor drew a walk, and then Seager smashed a go-ahead, two-run home run and screamed in delight.Then the Astros proceeded to slowly chip away.Facing the Dodgers stout reliever Brandon Morrow in the eighth inning, Bregman smacked a ball down the right-field line that hit the edge of Puigs glove as he dived for the ball.Puig, a strong defender, flung his glove into the ground in annoyance after the play.Nursing a two-run lead, Roberts called for Jansen, his closer, for the kind of two-inning save Jansen has handled well.Photo This time was different.The second hitter Jansen faced, Correa, smacked an outside cutter up the middle for a run-scoring single that trimmed the Astros deficit to 3-2, snapping a streak of 28 consecutive scoreless innings by the Dodgers bullpen.Ill take Kenley any day of the week with a one-run lead going into the ninth inning, Roberts said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The next inning spelled more trouble for the Dodgers.Gonzalez was a key cog in the Astros season, yet he had not driven in a run since the first game of the division series.But he drilled a 94 m.p.h.cutter, Jansens trademark pitch, over the center-field wall for a game-tying blast.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.It was the first earned run Jansen, the best closer in baseball, had allowed in the postseason since Game 3 of a division series in 2016.It was just flat, Jansen said.Give credit to Marwin Gonzalez.He didnt miss the one pitch that was flat the whole night.In the top of the 10th, Altuve and Correa provided a 5-3 lead by feasting off Dodgers reliever Josh Fields, who had been used sparingly this postseason.Altuve brought chants of M.V.P.when he blasted a solo home run to left-center field to lead off the 10th inning.Photo Correa followed with his own shot, flipping his bat far into the air before he began his home run trot.The Astros dugout bounced up and down as the home crowd sat stunned.I loved it, said Puig, who is well known for his own home run celebrations.He threw it higher than I normally do, and thats the way you should play in the World Series.Puig replaced the Astros euphoria with anxiety when he hit a solo home run off Giles in the bottom of the 10th.Normally emphatic on the field, Puig simply placed his bat on the ground before running the bases.With blood pressure high everywhere, Logan Forsythe drew a two-out walk and advanced to second base on a wild pitch.Hernandez then tied the game with a single, Forsythe beating Josh Reddicks throw to home plate.As if that were not enough drama, Hinch brought in Devenski.And before he threw a pitch, Devenski fired a pickoff attempt to second base, hoping to nab Hernandez.It was wide, and if it had not hit the umpire Laz Diaz, there might have been another play at the plate.Instead, it was a dead ball.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Laz was perfectly positioned right where we wanted him, Hinch said with a smirk after the game.This all set the stage for a delirious 11th inning.McCarthy had not pitched since Oct. 1, and was making his postseason debut.He coughed up a single to Astros outfielder Cameron Maybin.Up came Springer, who struck out four times in Game 1 but was determined to slow his heart rate down in this moment.He did, slamming a ball to right-center field for a two-run lead, and the Astros held on to win a game for the ages.
The Dodgers Unsung Weapon: A Shutdown Bullpen:::::Seven have featured so far.Kenley Jansen is the closer, with four saves in the postseason.His WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched) is a miserly 0.33, his earned run average a perfect 0.00.Jansen, 30, from Curacao, is an intimidating presence at 6 feet 5 inches and 275 pounds, and he has been an elite closer for the Dodgers for six seasons.But like many of his teammates, he is only now getting to throw in his first World Series.He and his setup man, Brandon Morrow, led the way with eight appearances each in the Dodgers nine games.Morrows nine and a third innings leads the team.He and Tony Watson are the hold men; Morrow has four and Watson three so far.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Kenta Maeda, signed last year from the Hiroshima Carp, has been shifted to the bullpen for the playoffs.He has not given up a hit in five innings and has been credited with two wins.Tony Cingrani, Josh Fields and Ross Stripling round out the group.The Dodgers were a comfortable 14 games up in the N.L.West at the end of July but did not stand pat, bolstering their relief by landing Cingrani from the Reds and Watson from the Pirates.Though the relievers have been impressive, it cannot be too surprising to those who paid attention during the regular season.The bullpens E.R.A.was 3.38, the best in the N.L.Jansen finished tied for second in saves behind Tampa Bays Alex Colome.His win probability added, a stat that tries to determine how much players contribute to victories, was 5.7, the best of any pitcher in the game.Houstons relievers were also effective in Game 1 of the Series: Brad Peacock and Chris Devenski did not give up a run.But over all, the Astros bullpen has not been as dominant, surrendering nine runs, for example, in the seven-game A.L.C.S.Plenty of fans will tell you that pitching plays an outsize role in the postseason.And ask any Yankee fan about Mariano Rivera to understand just how important a good bullpen can be.With the kind of numbers their relievers are putting up, the Dodgers are holding a big edge as the Series continues.
With a Crowd of Diverse Faces, Dodger Stadium Stands Out:::::Latino attendance can be seen in other ballparks, including Minute Maid Park in Houston, but the scene at Dodger Stadium seems to stand apart.Photo The diversity is fantastic, said Jaime Jarrin, the Dodgers longtime Spanish-language radio announcer.When I first started in this job, the Latinos coming to the ballpark were about 8 to 10 percent.Now, he said, he believes the figure to be around 45 percent.It is the most of any park, he added.Oh, by far.But we have also seen many Japanese people and Korean people here, too.Jarrin, who is originally from Ecuador, has been broadcasting Dodgers games since 1959.He said he has seen a steady uptick in fans at Dodger Stadium who come from various backgrounds.Assumptions about someones ethnic identity can prove false, and much of the available evidence about the diversity at Dodger Stadium is anecdotal.Stan Kasten, the Dodgers president, said he had no statistical data regarding the ethnic composition of the fans at Dodger Stadium.Still, he said the team cherished that its fan base was noticeably diverse.We are very proud of it, Kasten said.This is the organization of Jackie Robinson.The Dodgers were at the forefront, not only of breaking the color barrier, but we historically scoured the globe to find players.The Dodgers were the first to build an academy in the Dominican Republic.Were a global team, and that is something thats reflected in the stadium, too.When the Dodgers brought Robinson to the major leagues in 1947, he became the first African-American to break through baseballs wall of segregation, and many African-American fans were drawn to the team.In 1980, the Dodgers introduced Valenzuela, a charismatic left-handed pitcher from Navojoa, Mexico, who energized fans on both sides of the border with his unorthodox windup and stellar pitching.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Valenzuela, who now does commentary on Dodgers games alongside Jarrin, left the Dodgers after the 1990 season.But the legacy of Fernandomania is still felt today.Photo People who were into soccer and boxing, they became big baseball fans because of Fernando, Jarrin said.Many of them still love the Dodgers.And more players would come along and attract fans from various communities to Dodger Stadium.In 1994, the right-handed pitcher Chan Ho Park became the first player from South Korea to join the major leagues, and he tapped into the large Korean-American community in the Los Angeles area.The next year, the remnants of Fernandomania gave way to Nomomania, named for Hideo Nomo, the whirlwind Japanese pitcher who became such an instant sensation that fans from Japan would fly to Los Angeles for a weekend just to see him pitch.The Dodgers currently have two Japanese players on their playoff roster, the pitchers Kenta Maeda and Yu Darvish.There are also two players from Cuba (Yasiel Puig and Yasmani Grandal); one from Puerto Rico (Enrique Hernandez); and a pitcher, Hyun-jin Ryu, from Incheon, South Korea.When Ryu was pitching this summer, I was sitting with like 20 Korean fans, said the 55-year-old Varela, who works for a health care firm in Los Angeles.We were all together and we had so much fun.In recent years, the team has acquired popular Mexican-American players like Nomar Garciaparra, who delighted many fans by walking to his at-bats to the song Low Rider, by War, and Adrian Gonzalez, who is on the team but not on the playoff roster.There is also building excitement for Julio Urias, a 21-year-old left-handed pitcher from Culiacn, Mexico, who is injured.Photo When fans arrive at Dodger Stadium they are greeted by signs written in English and Spanish.Along the top of the visitors dugout the word Welcome is painted in English, Japanese, Spanish and Korean, and some fans wear blue shirts that read, Doyers, an affectionate reference to the way first-generation immigrants in Los Angeles sometimes pronounced the Dodgers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the Dodgers early relationship with Angelenos of Mexican descent was fraught with animosity and distrust after some residents of Chavez Ravine, where Dodger Stadium now sits, were forcibly evicted first to make room for a public-housing development that was never built and then, in 1958, for the stadium.Some of those evictions were captured on television news programs.But over time, that episode was mostly forgiven as fans jumped aboard the Dodgers wagon.For many Mexican-Americans, it was another example of how they were uprooted and pushed around, said Eric Avila, a professor of history at U.C.L.A.and the chairman of the Csar E. Chvez Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies.The Dodgers got off to a really bad start in Southern California.But in the end, people just loved baseball, and they eventually adopted the Dodgers.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Avila called Valenzuelas electrifying rookie season in 1981 a tipping point.From that point forward, the Dodgers actually became an expression of Mexican-American identity in Southern California.The Mexican-American community went nuts for Fernando, he said.They claimed him and the Dodgers as their own.The Dodgers are also still popular among a segment of African-American supporters, especially older fans who were initially drawn to the team that Robinson played for.But as with the rest of baseball, the Dodgers have struggled to attract a substantial number of African-American fans to games.Curtis Granderson, a Dodgers outfielder who is African-American and has also played in Detroit and New York, said he noticed the fan diversity at Dodgers games to a certain extent.I know theres a heavy Hispanic population and a white population here, Granderson said.I havent noticed a heavy black population.That doesnt mean it doesnt exist.But those two have definitely stood out the most to me.It is definitely a diverse group, and it should be.This is the second-largest city in the U.S., and you hope everyone is supporting the Dodgers.Photo Despite the early resentment created by the evictions at Chavez Ravine, Walter OMalley, who owned the Dodgers, made sure to broadcast games on Spanish radio to spread the gospel of the team among the local Spanish-speaking population, and the broadcasts helped create more Latino fans.One of them was Juan Arrieta, who grew up in the Los Angeles area listening to Jarrin describe Dodgers games in Spanish because Arrietas father, a mechanic from Peru, did not understand English well at the time.It was only recently that Arrieta discovered that Jarrin is actually from Ecuador, just north of Peru.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I always just assumed he was Mexican, Arrieta said, acknowledging how people can mislabel others.Isnt that awful?Now a 45-year-old bartender living in San Diego, Arrieta and his wife, Diane, who is of Mexican descent, attend a handful of Dodgers games each year, and were sitting in the bleachers at Game 2 of the National League Championship Series.I think the big difference nowadays is that you see people spread around the stadium, Arrieta said about Dodger Stadiums diversity.It used to be that we would sit in the upper deck or out in the pavilion.Now its not segregated like that anymore.And its not just Latino.When Maeda or Ryu pitch, you see a lot of Asian fans at the game, too.Its a real melting pot.After Game 1 of the World Series ended and happy Dodgers fans were congregating in the parking lot waiting to leave, Varela came upon an older white man who said he was originally from Brooklyn and had been a Dodgers fan since then.He was sharing stories with a younger Mexican-American fan from Los Angeles, and the two men snapped photos of themselves together.It doesnt matter what color you are or where you come from or what religion you are, she said.What matters is we all love baseball, and that unites us.
World Series 2017: How the Astros Won Game 2, Inning by Inning:::::Bottom 6th: Seager goes deep on Verlander.Justin Verlander needed just four pitches to retire Chase Utley and pinch-hitter Andre Ethier on a pair of fly-outs to center to start the inning, but that is when the trouble started.He walked Chris Taylor his second walk of the game, both of which were drawn by Taylor and got ahead, 0-2, on Corey Seager, but a 97 mile-per-hour fastball was right down the middle and Seager wasted no time hitting it out of the park to give his team the lead.Justin Turner popped out to end the inning, but the mighty Dodgers bullpen now has a lead to work with, which could be a big problem for Houston.Waldstein: Did that seem like a familiar script?A two-out walk to Chris Taylor and then a two-run homer to left by the next batter?In Game 1 it was Justin Turner with the smash.In Game 2 it was Corey Seager, who went opposite field with a pitch that Verlander left up in the zone.And Seager knew it was gone or at least had a good chance right away because he was screaming as the ball left the bat.All of the Dodgers runs so far in the series have come on four home runs.Now L.A. is 12 outs away from taking a 2-0 lead in the series by beating the Astros two best pitchers, and the Dodgers have a favorable pitching matchup in Game 3.Top 7th: Dodgers bullpen stays strong.Ross Stripling was the fourth Dodgers pitcher of the game and he lasted just four pitches, each of which was a ball.The walk to the struggling Marwin Gonzalez resulted in yet another pitching change, with Brandon Morrow coming in to face Josh Reddick, and the right-hander came through in a big way by getting Reddick to ground into a double play.He allowed a single to Evan Gattis, who was pinch-hitting for Justin Verlander, but finished off the inning by inducing a grounder to short from George Springer.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With Verlander now out of the game, his final line was six innings, two hits and three earned runs.He struck out five and walked two.Bottom 7th: Harris Keeps it close for Astros.With Will Harris on in relief for Houston, Cody Bellinger led off the inning and reached on a throwing error.He advanced to second on a curveball in the dirt that was ruled a wild pitch and went to third on a groundout by Yasiel Puig.But with the infield in to try to prevent a run, Joc Pederson struck out on five pitches.The infield returned to their normal positioning with two outs and Harris struck out Austin Barnes to end the inning.Photo Top 8th: Astros cut into Dodgers lead.Dave Roberts continued to be aggressive with pitching changes, but for the first time in the series he did not quite have the magic touch as the Astros narrowed the Dodgers lead to 3-2.After Alex Bregman led off the inning with a ground-rule double off Brandon Morrow, Roberts turned to his closer, Kenley Jansen, hoping for a six-out save.Jansen was able to get a groundout from Jose Altuve, but Bregman advanced to third on that play and then scored on a single by Carlos Correa.Jansen recovered to get a pop-out from Yulieski Gurriel and then ended the inning by striking out Brian McCann.Unless the Dodgers can extend the lead in the bottom of the 8th, Jansen will have just one run to work with in the ninth.Waldstein: The Astros finally break through against the Dodgers bullpen, which had not surrendered a run in 28 consecutive innings in the postseason.Jansen, who is being asked to get a 6-out save, was 41 for 42 in save opportunities in the regular season.He had one five-out save this year and earned a win in a two-inning performance in extra innings.He has a five-out save and a four-out save this postseason.Bottom 8th: Dodgers riding Jansen for six-out save.It was a quick inning for the Dodgers offense.Chase Utley flew out to left, pinch-hitter Kike Hernandez grounded out to short, and Chris Taylor flew out to left to end the inning.The Dodgers are three outs away from a 2-0 lead in the series with their dominant closer, Kenley Jansen, trying to finish a six-out save.Photo Top 9th: Gonzalez breaks out of slump to tie game.Kenley Jansen only had one six-out save in his career coming into todays game, and he will leave with only one after he allowed a game-tying solo homer to Marwin Gonzalez to start the ninth inning.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After the home run, Jansen got a quick out from Josh Reddick, who popped out to second, and retired pinch-hitter Carlos Beltran on a fly ball to center, but he allowed a two-out double to George Springer.With the go-ahead run on base, Jansen was able to stop the bleeding by retiring Alex Bregman on a grounder to short.With the Dodgers already having used five relievers, including their three best, they could run into manpower issues if this tie game stretches on for a while.Waldstein: It was only Jansens second blown save of the year.His first was July 23 in Atlanta when he gave up a game-tying, three-run home run to Matt Adams.But the Dodgers came back to win that game, 5-4, and are 98-0 when leading after 8 innings this year, including the postseason.Bottom 9th: Bellingers blast ends at warning track.Houston turned to their closer in the ninth and Ken Giles started things off by striking out Corey Seager.He retired Justin Turner on a grounder to short and narrowly escaped a walk-off home run when Cody Bellingers deep blast to right was caught at the warning track by Josh Reddick.This game is headed to extra innings.Photo Photo Top 10th: Back-to-back homers give Astros a lead.Houston badly needed its best hitters to start delivering, and Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa did that in a big way by starting the 10th inning with back-to-back home runs to give the Astros a 5-3 lead.The Dodgers ran out of top-shelf relievers, thanks to the aggressiveness of Dave Roberts in trying to protect a narrow lead earlier in the game, so Josh Fields came in for the 10th.Robertss aggressiveness had paid off throughout the postseason, but it backfired in Game 2, with Fields giving up the two home runs, and a double to Yulieski Gurriel, before being replaced by Tony Cingrani.Cingrani made quick work of the Astros, allowing just an intentional walk.Houston is now three outs away from victory.Waldstein: That was Altuves sixth postseason home run.Not too shabby.And Carlos Correa follows it up with another blast, the third by the Astros in the last two innings.Correa with an epic bat flip, too.This game, and the series, has pivoted in a hurry, and Dodger Stadium is very quiet.Photo Bottom 10th: Dodgers storm back to tie game.The Astros went ahead 5-3 in the top of the 10th, and sent their closer, Ken Giles, out for a second inning in hopes of finishing off the victory.The Dodgers had other plans.Yasiel Puig led off the inning with a home run, and after Giles struck out two batters, Los Angeles tied things up on a walk to Logan Forsythe and a single by Kike Hernandez.Chris Devenski relieved Giles, and with the winning run at second base, he got Chris Taylor to fly out to center to end the inning.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Waldstein: I have been at some great World Series games, and this one now joins the list.Leads have been erased, home runs all over the place, blown saves, classic bat flips, and to top it all off, the second base umpire, Laz Diaz, gets hit in the upper leg with a pickoff attempt.Had it not hit him, Kike Hernandez certainly would have been on third base, and that might have changed how Dvensky would have pitched to Taylor.When Forsythe slid home for the tying run, the upper decks of Dodger Stadium were swaying slightly.I remember that from Shea Stadium in 1999 and 2000.A bit unsettling.Photo Top 11th: Springer goes deep to put Astros on top.Brandon McCarthy was not on the N.L.C.S.roster for the Dodgers, but he was added as an extra arm for the World Series.Because the team was officially out of relievers, he was on the mound to try to keep Los Angeles in the game in the 11th.Cameron Maybin led off the inning with a single and stole second before George Springer, who had been ice-cold coming into the game, hit a monster blast to right-center that once again put the Astros on top.McCarthy ended the damage there, getting three quick outs, but the Dodgers now have three outs to stay alive in what has become a wild game.Bottom 11th: One more home run, but not enough for Dodgers.Chris Devenski was back out for a second inning of work and he started things off by getting Corey Seager to line out to center.That brought up Justin Turner, and the postseason hero for the Dodgers hit a liner that looked like it might sneak through the infield before Alex Bregman ranged to his left and was able to snare it for the second out.That brought up Charlie Culberson, and the last man on the Dodgers bench hit a two-out solo homer to center to narrow Houstons lead to one run, but that was as close as Los Angeles would get, as Yasiel Puig struck out to end the game.
On the Mound, the Dodgers Rich Hill Is Part Curveball, Part Crazy:::::Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts agreed: Hes absolutely crazy.He sees red.Hes bordering on psychotic, but in the best possible way.General Manager Farhan Zaidi did, too: Rich Hill is as much a Jekyll and Hyde personality as Ive seen on and off the field.The Dodgers have reached their first World Series in 29 years with a well-rounded roster, a deep farm system, the largest payroll in the sport and shrewd moves by the front office.The one unit that ranked first in all of baseball this season was their starting rotation, which posted a 3.39 earned run average.Photo That would not have been possible without the rotations depth, beginning with Clayton Kershaw, the best pitcher of this generation.Then there is Alex Wood, who was an All-Star this season; the formidable Yu Darvish, who was acquired in a midseason trade; and Hill, a left-hander whom the Dodgers traded for last season and, after being duly impressed by how he pitched, gave him a three-year, $48 million contract over the winter.Since the Cubs drafted Hill in 2002, he has been with 10 major league organizations, including two where he only pitched in the minors.While he has always had that competitive fire, Hill admitted it may have grown with the Dodgers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I really believe that effort and passion will beat talent every single time, he said.The 6-foot 5-inch Hill thrives on a funky delivery with his long limbs, a deceptive fastball that averages only 89 miles per hour and frequent use of one of the sports best curveballs.In 31 starts over a year and a half with the Dodgers, he has posted a 3.02 E.R.A.Hills controlled rage, as teammates call it, adds an extra wrinkle.People pay good money to come and watch a baseball game, and when I go out there Im giving everything I got every single time, Hill said.Whatever the results are, the results are going to be.If you come to watch a game where Im pitching, youre going to get that intense passion and understanding that the effort doesnt compromise.During a game, his facial expressions are something to behold.He scowls.He looks disturbed after rough innings, hands on his head, visibly frustrated.He rightfully looked distraught after losing a no-hit bid on a game-ending home run by the Pirates in the 10th inning of a game last August.After giving up a solo home run to Addison Russell of the Chicago Cubs in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series last week, Hill violently threw a cup of water onto the dugout floor and screamed.It was the only run he gave up in five innings, and the Dodgers later won the game, but his reaction was standard fare for Hill at least.If hes had a couple first innings where hes given up a run or two, then nothings safe, said Chris Taylor, the Dodgers leadoff hitter.Coolers arent safe.The gum tray, whatevers in there, you just kind of stay out of his way.But he does a great job of releasing that, and then he always seems to come back out there and give a quality outing.Photo Kenley Jansen, the Dodgers All-Star closer, said Hill was the nicest guy Ive ever met in baseball, period.He said he could sense that Hills competitiveness is derived from the setbacks he endured to get to where he is now.Jansen said that before heading out to the bullpen, he spends the first part of the game in the Dodgers clubhouse, where he can hear Hill screaming.Added Zaidi: If you happen to be hanging out in the clubhouse on days that he starts, you may hear noise rattling in the distance, and theres a good chance its Rich rearranging some equipment.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Zaidi said Hills intensity was actually reassuring and can rub off on teammates during the game because you know the guy going out there taking the ball feels that passionately about the game and nobody else is going to let up when they see that.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hill plays down his wild intensity when asked about it, perhaps because he is so easygoing off the mound.I cant really explain it unless Im standing in between the lines, he said.Its that boxers mentality of, when you get in the ring the other guy is trying to beat you.His on-field alter ego is so different than his off-field persona that his family will occasionally ask him about it.He just shrugs.Its a very difficult game, and its extremely hard to master, he said.But with the effort, intensity and passion, it makes it a heck of a lot easier to go home at night and know you gave everything that you could, rather then think back and regret.
Dodgers Overcome Heat, and Astros, in World Series Game 1:::::Over seven innings, Kershaw allowed three hits, did not walk a batter and racked up 11 strikeouts the most by one pitcher this season against the Astros, who had the fewest strikeouts of any team during the regular season.Houstons only run came on a fourth-inning home run by third baseman Alex Bregman, which soared into the left-field seats.Photo When Kershaw was done, Brandon Morrow retired the Astros in order in the eighth inning, and closer Kenley Jansen did the same in the ninth as the Dodgers seized a one-game-to-none lead in the Series.The record temperatures are not expected to abate for Game 2 on Wednesday, when the Dodgers left-hander Rich Hill will face the Astros right-hander Justin Verlander.If pitchers were forced to work in sauna-like conditions that were far different than the typically frigid World Series games played in the Midwest and Northeast, hitters did not mind.We treated it like a summer game in Cincinnati, Dodgers first baseman Cody Bellinger said.When its hot, the ball flies and we like that.The blistering heat, which shattered the previous World Series first-pitch record of 94 degrees set in 2001 in Phoenix when the Yankees played the Arizona Diamondbacks, did not dim the enthusiasm of the crowd, which relished the Dodgers first World Series appearance in 29 years.The visitors from Houston were relative newcomers to this stage, too.The Astros had been here only once before, in 2005, and they had the worst record in baseball as recently as 2013.To get to this Series, both franchises leaned heavily on analytics.The heads of baseball operations for each team the Dodgers Andrew Friedman and the Astros Jeff Luhnow had worked in the business world and arrived from other organizations where they had success through extensive use of data.Friedman constructed a perennial contender that reached the World Series as the general manager of the Tampa Bay Rays despite having one of baseballs smallest payrolls, while Luhnow helped feed talent to World Series teams as the St. Louis Cardinals head of scouting and player development.Photo After Luhnow was hired by the Astros after the 2011 season, the team endured several losing seasons to secure high draft picks to complement some of the young talent in the system, and it continued to make shrewd trades and free-agent signings.Friedman, who was hired after the 2014 season, took over a team that had won back-to-back division titles but had bigger ambitions under the Guggenheim Group, which had purchased the team for a record $2 billion two years earlier.Advertisement Continue reading the main story While Friedman set about drastically turning over the roster, the Dodgers continued to win.Only five players Turner, Kershaw, Jansen, and outfielders Yasiel Puig and Andre Ethier were on the major-league roster when Friedman arrived.The Dodgers now boast what is arguably the most versatile roster in baseball, allowing them to pick favorable matchups at their will.One of Friedmans most valuable finds has been Taylor, the utility player he plucked from the Seattle Mariners, who has reconfigured his swing and become a vital spark for the Dodgers offense, hitting 21 home runs in the regular season while playing center field and shortstop.Taylors home run, his third of the postseason, was the fourth leadoff homer in a World Series, the most recent one being Alcides Escobars inside-the-park home run for the Kansas City Royals two years ago against the Mets.I didnt overthink it, said Taylor, who modestly flipped his bat after he made contact.I was just going up there trying to get the barrel to the ball, thinking about being aggressive, and be ready to hit the first one.Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts hoped the weather would help his hitters if they could get the ball up in the air against Keuchel.But he conceded before the game it would be a difficult chore against a pitcher whose late movement and pinpoint control had allowed him to have the highest ground-ball-to-fly-ball rate (2.12) among starting American League pitchers.Photo It just comes down to discipline, trying to get a ball up, out, over use the big part of the field like everyone talks about, Roberts said.Light air today its going to be hot so I think for us to try to get underneath it and try to put the ball in the air.With him obviously, its a tall task.If Keuchel, who had not allowed a leadoff home run in more than five years, was stunned by Taylors thunderbolt, he did not come unglued.He allowed only four more hits two singles to Corey Seager and one each to Enrique Hernandez and Austin Barnes and all but one were erased by a double play.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Keuchel did appear to be spooked by Taylor, who lined into a double play in his second at-bat and walked on five pitches with two out in the sixth.That brought up Turner, whose bushy, unkempt red beard, matches Keuchels distinctive facial hair that runs to the collar of his jersey.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Keuchel worked the count to 1-2 and came inside with a cut fastball that was belt high.Turner pulled his hands in and lifted a high, fly ball to left field.Astros outfielder Marwin Gonzalez drifted back on the ball as if he had a play on it, but after he reached the warning track and then the wall, he looked up helplessly as it landed in the pavilion.I didnt think it was going out by any means, Keuchel said.It wasnt an easy pitch to hit.I was trying to get in on him and I thought it did.He didnt square it up by any means.Turner acknowledged that he had gotten a helping hand from the weather.If its 10 degrees cooler, thats probably a routine fly ball, Turner said.Photo The home run upped Turners career postseason R.B.I.total to 26, tying the franchise record set by Duke Snider.Fourteen of those have come this season for Turner, the former Mets castoff.The two home runs were enough for Kershaw, who has won three Cy Young Awards but has had a spotty October rsum.He had been good but not dominant since his return in early September from a five-week stint on the disabled list with a sore back.On Tuesday, though, he was at his best, complementing his two best pitches a fastball and a knee-buckling curve with a sharp slider.His fellow Dodgers pitcher Brandon McCarthy said Kershaw had been close but not all the way there.Tonight, McCarthy added, that looked like that was the genuine article.Kershaw allowed only three hits the homer to Bregman, a third-inning single to Josh Reddick and a seventh-inning single to Jose Altuve.And besides the hits, Kershaw allowed just three balls to be hit out of the infield.On a night when the air was as thin as it was hot, that proved to be the difference.
The Lakers? Who Are They? L.A. Is a Dodgers Town These Days:::::It takes quite a performance to rally the populace in a city where more stars are visible on the streets than in the sky and where entertainment is a profession for so many of its citizenry.But this years Dodgers have galvanized Los Angeles with their 104 regular-season victories; their relievers who have combined for 23 scoreless innings in the postseason; their presumptive rookie of the year, Cody Bellinger; their possible Cy Young winner, Clayton Kershaw; their tongue-wagging, bat-licking, hit-scorching man-child, Yasiel Puig; and their Mr. Red October, Justin Turner.For the first time in 29 years, the Dodgers are the last National League team standing in the postseason.For a proud franchise that won six championships in a 33-year span, the wait to return to the World Series has seemed biblical in its length.The end of the drought has made die-hard fans delirious and more casual followers of the team pretty fanatical, too.Photo And so minutes after Culberson caught a line drive off the bat of the Chicago Cubs Willson Contreras last Thursday night for the final out that clinched the pennant for the Dodgers, Cecilia Geers went on the StubHub ticket site on her computer in search of Series tickets.She found single tickets for sale in the top deck in left field for $750, which struck her as a bargain for a once-in-a-lifetime experience.Geers, a Los Angeles native, was born 30 days after the Dodgers final game of the 1989 season, when they finished 77-83, a far cry from the title they had won the year before.Throughout her childhood, Geers accompanied her father to a few games every season.It was almost always at his suggestion, and he sweetened the invitation by letting her eat whatever she wanted at the concession stands.And so she gorged on soft-serve ice cream in a miniature helmet, pizza, frozen lemonade and chocolate malts, even as team after team left her hungry for something more substantial.As she grew older, her tastes matured.For the past few years, Geers has appreciated the mastery of Kershaw and the mischievousness of the Cuban-born Puig, whom she follows on social media because hes hilarious, she said.In Geerss lifetime, the Dodgers havent exactly been a joke; before this year they had advanced to the postseason 10 times, including four trips to the National League Championship Series.But close didnt cut it when, in the same period, the Lakers were winning five N.B.A.titles, the Kings were winning two N.H.L.titles, and the Anaheim-based Angels and Ducks were each winning a championship.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There was a reason that in January of last year, a headline in HuffPost read, Los Angeles is a Lakers Town.Of course, 21 months later that reads like fake news.The Lakers, seven years removed from their last championship season, are rebuilding, and Rachelle Tachiquin, who drives a black Honda sedan with a California vanity license plate that reads DGRFN81 gets thumbs-up and honks from fellow drivers with whom she shares the overcrowded roads.I have a lot of people stop and compliment me, said Tachiquin, who was indeed born in 1981, when the Dodgers beat the Yankees in the Series.This time around, she will get to see every Series game in her capacity as an usher along the third-base side of Dodger Stadium.Photo Geers, however, wont be there.She reached out to her parents and asked if they would buy her a ticket to one of the first two Series games as a gift for her birthday, which falls on Halloween.They found the $750 price that she quoted frightful, and so, along with likely millions of other Southern Californians, Geers will have to settle for watching the telecast.But just being able to watch the games on television is a treat; because of a continuing cable dispute much of the Southern California market does not have access to telecasts of Dodgers games during the regular season.Seeing a team you rooted for all your life finally make it, even though it wasnt as long a drought as the Cubs had, it was still my lifetime so its a really big deal, Geers said.So how much has Los Angeles changed since the Dodgers last World Series appearance?Theres less smog and more traffic, Mike Scioscia said with a laugh.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Scioscia was a member of the upstart 1988 Dodgers team that won the World Series in five games over the Oakland Athletics for the franchises second title of the decade.Since 2000, he has managed the Los Angeles Angels, whom he led to their first World Series crown in 2002 in the franchises 42nd season.Some of my friends are saying 29 years is long enough, Scioscia said Monday by telephone.I had to remind them that the Angels had to wait longer.But Scioscia understands.The Dodgers have always been a captivating force out here because of their history and tradition, he said.When they came here from Brooklyn they already had a national audience and the expectations are high because of that history and tradition.The franchise also arrived in Los Angeles with Vin Scully, who began broadcasting Dodgers games in 1950 and didnt stop until his retirement at the end of last season.The last time the Dodgers were in the World Series, Scully called the games for NBC.His voice was the cord that braided together generations of Dodgers fans.For many, this postseason has been akin to that first holiday meal without a beloved family member.Photo Not having Vin doing the games makes this postseason bittersweet, said Valerie Medina, who was waiting in line Saturday to enter the team store.She had made the trip the day before only to discover that the pennants and caps she sought had sold out.If he could come and do one game, that would be awesome.But Im glad for him that he gets to watch the games as a fan with his family.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Online petitions to bring Scully back for the World Series collected thousands of signatures, but Scully has been adamant about remaining outside the spotlight, declining through the Dodgers an interview request.He has attended a few of this seasons playoff games as a fan, and during one such visit to Dodger Stadium, Scully stopped in the broadcast booth of his longtime friend, Jaime Jarrin, who is concluding his 59th season as the teams Spanish-language broadcaster.Jarrin, who is from Ecuador and who from 1962 to 1984 put together a Cal Ripken-esque string of consecutive game broadcasts, described Scully as my teacher, my idol, my mentor and my friend.He said he told Scully, Even though you wont be here, youll be in my booth spiritually.Still around, too, is Tommy Lasorda, who is 90 and who managed the Dodgers to their two championships in the 1980s.Back then, he sometimes held court in a booth at the Pacific Dining Car, an old-time, downtown, 24-hour eating establishment where the waiters wear pressed jackets, the walls are paneled and the tables are covered in white linen.The owner of the restaurant is Wes Idol III, whose great-grandfather opened it in 1921.Idol has a personal tie to this years Dodgers.In the summer of 1995, he headed to Massachusetts with a friend named John Beaton Hill to interview baseball players for a screenplay.On that trip, Idol met his friends 15-year-old brother.That brother, Rich Hill, would grow up to be a major league pitcher who went through a great deal of adversity on the field before becoming a crucial member of the Dodgers starting rotation.And once in Los Angeles, Rich Hill was also reunited with his brother, who is now a filmmaker.Its the quintessential L.A. story; a man moves to the city in pursuit of his creative dreams.Years later, his brother joins him after an arduous baseball journey finally leads somewhere.And now the Dodgers could soon be champions.Yes, Rich Hill acknowledged.Its fun.A lot of other people in Los Angeles would seem to agree.
To Measure Jose Altuve, Just Watch Him Soar:::::Altuves all-around skills have made him, in the words of Astros Manager A. J. Hinch, the games perfect player.This season, he led the majors in hitting at .346 while delivering 24 homers, 32 stolen bases and his usual stellar defense at second base.Teammates and opponents marvel at his uncanny ability to strike any pitch, anywhere, with the barrel of the bat.He hit .500 for a whole month this year, Astros catcher Brian McCann said, referring accurately to Altuves torrid stretch from June 27 through July 27.Hes playing a different game.I did that in high school.As for the Hall of Fame, McCullers was not overstating things.Altuve, 27, has 1,250 hits in his career.Only three players in the top 10 list Pete Rose, Ty Cobb and Hank Aaron had more hits through their age-27 season.Photo Dallas Keuchel, the Astros Game 1 starter on Tuesday, said Altuve had the best hand-eye coordination he had ever seen.They were teammates on the Tri-City ValleyCats, the Astros affiliate in Troy, N.Y., in 2009.Altuve was 19 then and in his third pro season after signing from Venezuela for just $15,000 (no other teams had shown interest).Keuchel remembers hearing Altuves nonstop chatter in the back of the bus and thinking it sounded as if he had not yet hit puberty.He sounded like he shouldnt even have been playing baseball, Keuchel said, but the more they played together, with the Lancaster JetHawks and the Corpus Christi Hooks, the more those hand-eye skills signaled stardom.I didnt know that he was going to actually be this good, Keuchel said.I thought he was going to be an All-Star, but to win the M.V.P., which he should and honestly, he should have been in the race the last three or four years and I couldnt be happier for the guy, because he is an all-American dude.An All-American dude, you could say, who represents the essence of the All-American game.Walk past an N.F.L.or N.B.A.star on the street, and chances are you could guess his profession.With most of the best baseball players, you would never know.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Chris Sale, the strikeout king of the Boston Red Sox, is a string bean: 6-6 and 180 pounds.Dustin Pedroia, the longtime Boston second baseman whom Altuve called an inspiration, is easily shorter than his listed height of 5-9.The greatest pure hitters of modern times Tony Gwynn and Ichiro Suzuki could not have looked more different: Gwynn lumbering (in later years), Suzuki forever lithe.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.When physical outliers play with Altuves verve, their appeal can be irresistible.I bet kids disproportionately love Jose Altuve, like kids disproportionately loved Kirby Puckett and Ozzie Smith, said the broadcaster Bob Costas, citing undersized but spirited Hall of Famers.Their size makes them stand out, and their energy and joy transmits easily.If youre 9 years old, youre not deeply into analytics but you can deeply appreciate those guys.Naturally, Altuve grades high analytically: According to Baseball Reference, , only Mike Trout and Josh Donaldson have compiled more wins above replacement among position players over the last four seasons.This year Altuve ranked first, just ahead of Aaron Judge, the hulking Yankees slugger.Size can help, clearly, but for such highly specialized skills, it doesnt always matter.Not in baseball, if you have the ability, said Dave Hudgens, the Astros hitting coach.And the thing about Jose, too, is that pound for pound, he might be the strongest guy in the league.Incredibly strong.He squats 400 pounds, his core is really strong, and hes developed the knee-cock, which has enabled him to hit for more power.Photo Marwin Gonzalez, the utility player who led the Astros in runs batted in this season with 90, has known Altuve since they played in the Venezuelan winter league at 17.He remembers Altuve adding that power-hitting technique after already winning the first of his three major league batting titles, with a .341 average in 2014.Altuve hit seven homers that season, and 24 in each of the last two.Its never enough for him, Gonzalez said.He says that theres always room to get better, and I believe it.That first batting title heralded so much to come.Altuve clinched it on the final day of the season the very last day before the Astros made their move from 92-loss also-rans to a wild-card winner and a perennial contender.Of the 13 players the Astros used that afternoon against the Mets, only Altuve is on the World Series roster.Gonzalez was on the bench that day and remembers how teammates urged Altuve to sit out.He was hitting .340, three points better than Detroits Victor Martinez, who could not have closed the gap without a big day.He didnt want to win it that easy, Gonzalez said.He worked a lot for that.Everybody was telling him in the clubhouse, Just sit down, it wasnt necessary, you dont know when youre going to have that opportunity.Some players just win one batting title, and thats it.But he didnt listen to us.He went out there and competed, and thats what he does every day.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Three years earlier at Citi Field, the Mets Jose Reyes had left the season finale after a first-inning bunt single ensured him the batting title.Altuve played the full game in 2014, went 2 for 4 and said he never considered asking out.I played 150-something games; I dont think the last one would have made the difference, he said.If you want to win something, I dont think it would be very honest if I would have sat down that day.If I sat down, it would have been automatic.I dont think Victor had any chance of catching me.Thats why I was like, We got to play fair.I have to go out there and play, because hes playing that day.As valiant final-day performances go, it does not quite rank with Ted Williams in 1941, when he risked losing a .400 average and instead rapped six hits in a doubleheader to finish at .406.But it symbolized something powerful in its simplicity: a desire just to play, for the sake of the game and the integrity of the competition.The baseball gods must have looked on approvingly.Altuves career has ascended ever since, and now he has reached another peak.
How the Dodgers Won World Series Game 1, Inning by Inning:::::Baseball has worked to improve pace over the last several years, and Game 1 could serve as the blueprint for speeding things up.In the two hour and 28 minute game the shortest World Series game since 1992 the teams combined to throw just 211 pitches.There were only two walks and nine hits, and beyond the three home runs nothing went for extra-bases.Perhaps most important to the pace, there was only one mid-inning pitching change.It helps to have two Cy Young Award-winning pitchers on the mound.- Want exclusive sports news, highlights and analysis from a rotating cast of New York Times journalists, delivered to your inbox once a week?Click here to receive our weekly Sports newsletter.- Heres how the Dodgers won Game 1 of the World Series: Photo Top 1st: Clayton Kershaw delivers ...The 2017 World Series is underway.The first pitch of Game 1 was thrown by Clayton Kershaw at 8:11 p.m. Eastern.The 94 mile-per-hour fastball was fouled off by George Springer.Kershaw finished Springer off in four pitches, striking him out on a slider that dove toward the center fielders feet.Alex Bregman flew out to left, and Jose Altuve grounded out to shortstop, giving Kershaw a perfect inning on just nine pitches.Seven of his nine pitches were strikes.Waldstein: Clayton Kershaw looking sharp at the outset.As colleague Tyler Kepner pointed out, he recorded three outs on his three pitches: Fastball, slider, curve.Kepner, who is sitting beside me and will have fascinating insight all game, also noted that as much as people laud Kershaws curveball, his slider is really his most devastating pitch.Photo Bottom 1st: Taylor puts Dodgers on the board.Chris Taylor got the Dodgers on the board first, hitting Dallas Keuchels first pitch of the World Series well over the left field wall for a 1-0 lead.The breakout performer for the Dodgers, who has firmly established himself as the teams leadoff batter, was sitting on a fastball and got one right down the middle.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Keuchel settled down to strike out Justin Turner on seven pitches.Cody Bellinger was retired on a groundout to second, and Yasiel Puig grounded out to short to end the inning.For 10 of Keuchels 11 pitches he looked dominant, but he cant get back that first offering to Taylor.Top 2nd: Kershaw cruises through middle of order.Staked to a lead, Clayton Kershaw started off the inning by retiring Carlos Correa on a fly ball to center field.He caught Yulieski Gurriel sleeping on a 94 mile-per-hour fastball that sailed right through the zone for strike three.And then he induced a ground ball from Brian McCann which second baseman Logan Forsythe fielded in shallow right field before throwing him out to end the inning.Kepner: The Dodgers ballpark organist played a few bars of Paint It Black by the Rolling Stones after Kershaw painted the black (hit the corner) to strike out Yuli Gurriel in the top of the second.Pretty sharp.Photo Bottom 2nd: Keuchel settles in after early disaster.Dallas Keuchel has continued to look strong since his first pitch of the game went for a home run.Kike Hernandez got things started in the half-inning by singling to left but Corey Seager, making his return to the team after missing the N.L.C.S.with back trouble, grounded into an easy double-play to erase the threat.Logan Forsythe was nearly out on a foul pop to right field that a diving Josh Reddick couldnt handle, but on the next pitch he ended the inning by popping out to center.Top 3rd: Astros get a base runner, but thats it.The Astros got their first hit of the game, but they were not able to do anything with the base runner.Clayton Kershaw started the inning by getting another called strike three, this time to Marwin Gonzalez, but Josh Reddick, the former Dodger, followed that up with a hard grounder to right that scooted just past Cody Bellingers glove for Houstons first hit.Dallas Keuchel, who seemed lost trying to bunt Reddick over to second, ended up striking out on a foul bunt attempt, and then George Springer flailed at strike three to end the inning.Kershaw now has five strikeouts.Photo Kepner: Josh Reddick went 0 for 22 before his first hit in the ALCS.So, naturally, he gets a left-on-left single against Kershaw in his first at-bat of the World Series.The fans here have been booing Reddick every chance they get, as he predicted.They didnt like him when he played here last year, and the feeling apparently is mutual.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Thats 5 strikeouts in 10 batters for Kershaw: two on sliders, two on fastballs, and one on a curveball.Even more impressive considering that the Astros had the fewest strikeouts in the majors this season.Bottom 3rd: Taylor hits it hard again.Too hard.The leadoff batter for the Dodgers reached for the third consecutive inning, as Austin Barnes hit a grounder through the infield into shallow left for a single.Clayton Kershaw, who has considerably more experience as a batter than Dallas Keuchel, showed him how the National League does things with a bunt that sent Barnes to second.But Chris Taylor, who started the game with a home run on the first pitch he saw, ended the inning by hitting a rope to shortstop Carlos Correa, who easily doubled Barnes off second base to end the inning.Kepner: It hardly seemed likely at the time, but the Dodgers got two Game 1 World Series starters in the same deal in Dec. 2014: Enrique Hernandez and Austin Barnes.The Dodgers got those two, plus pitchers Chris Hatcher and Andrew Heaney, from the Marlins for Dee Gordon, Dan Haren and Miguel Rojas.Photo Top 4th: Bregman takes Kershaw deep.The game is tied.Alex Bregman took Clayton Kershaws third pitch of the inning over the wall in left-center for a home run, evening the score at 1-1.It was the seventh home run that Kershaw has allowed this postseason.Going back to the regular season, he has now allowed at least one homer in nine consecutive games.After allowing Bregmans blast, Kershaw got consecutive called strike threes on Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa, with home plate umpire Phil Cuzzi giving him some help on a low slider that retired Altuve.Yulieski Gurriel swung helplessly at a slider to end the half-inning, and Kershaw is up to eight strikeouts.Waldstein: I spoke to Carlos Beltran yesterday and he was raving about Bregman.Beltran said Bregman just has an unquenchable thirst for the game and always wants to talk baseball.They often go over video of pitchers and Beltran said sometimes they do their video scouting back at the hotel.Bregman picked a really good guy to learn from.Bregman, at 23 years and 208 days, became the youngest American League player to hit a home run in the World Series since Manny Ramirez for Cleveland against Atlanta in 1995.Ramirez was 60 days younger.Bottom 4th: Dodgers struggle to hit Keuchel hard.It was a remarkably quiet half-inning for the Dodgers.Justin Turner popped out to first, Cody Bellinger grounded out to first, and Yasiel Puig grounded out to short.Dallas Keuchel continues to induce soft contact to great effect.Kepner: Hes one section out of view from the center field cameras, but Scott Boras, the powerful agent who sits directly behind home plate in Anaheim, is here in the front row just to the third-base side of the plate.Boras represents both teams No.3 hitters Jose Altuve and Cody Bellinger.Neither has hit free agency yet; Bellinger is a rookie, and the Astros control Altuves rights on a bargain deal (signed with a different agent) through 2019.Here are Altuves salaries: 2014: $1.25M, 15: $2.5M, 16: $3.5M, 17: $4.5M, 18: $6M club option, 19: $6.5M club option.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Top 5th: Kershaw and Keuchel are dueling.This game has settled into a solid pitchers duel (minus the two solo homers) and it continued with Clayton Kershaw having yet another perfect inning.Brian McCann grounded right into the shift to start things off, and then Kershaw got some help from his defense when Justin Turner handled an awkward bounce on a grounder from Marwin Gonzalez, throwing out Gonzalez easily at first.Kershaw then ended the half-inning by freezing Josh Reddick with a 95 mile-per-hour fastball for strike three.Waldstein: With two good pitchers doing their thing minus one home run each this game is moving along at a rapid pace.Kershaw is getting strikeouts and Keuchel inducing ground balls.Kershaw has nine strikeouts already against the team that struck out the least in baseball.His stuff is very crisp.Photo Bottom 5th: Double play gets Keuchel out of inning.Dallas Keuchel got his second strikeout of the game on a changeup to Kike Hernandez.Corey Seager followed that up by looping a single into shallow center, but Keuchel was able to get out of trouble quickly thanks to Logan Forsythe grounding into a double play to end the inning.Keuchel has been efficient all game, and has thrown just 55 pitches in five innings.Kershaw is at 66.Waldstein: Alex Bregman starts another double play, the third for the Astros through five innings, two of which were initiated by Bregman.I am sure most fans can guess why he wears No.2.Like most players today, it is because of Derek Jeter.Bregman said his mother was a Yankees fan, and even though he rooted against the Yankees, he always rooted for Jeter.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Top 6th: Kershaw records 11th strikeout.Dallas Keuchels misadventures at the plate continued, with the American League hurler waving at one strike, and then watching two more before sitting down as Clayton Kershaws 10th strikeout victim.In a moral victory, he drew two balls before being retired.George Springer was strikeout No.11 on a changeup that was nearly in the dirt, and Alex Bregman ended the half-inning with a groundout to short.Kershaw is the first Dodgers pitcher to have double-digit strikeouts in a World Series game since Sandy Koufax had 10 in Game 7 of the 1965 Series.Waldstein: As if Kershaw was not already dominating with his curve, slider and fastball, he drops a rare changeup on Springer for his 11th strikeout.He has retired nine in a row since the Alex Bregman home run.He is averaging an extremely efficient 11 pitches per inning, especially impressive considering all the strikeouts.Photo Bottom 6th: Turners shot gives Kershaw a cushion.Justin Turner hit a two-run home run to left field, giving the Dodgers a 3-1 lead.Dallas Keuchel needed just one pitch to get the first out of the half-inning, retiring Austin Barnes on a grounder to short.Clayton Kershaw also grounded out to short, but then Chris Taylor walked on five pitches.Turner made Keuchel pay for the base runner by crushing an 87 mile-per-hour cutter over the wall, with the crowd in Dodger Stadium exploding in cheers for the popular player.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Keuchel was able to get out of the inning without any further trouble by striking out Cody Bellinger, but with the way Kershaw has been pitching, a two-run lead feels gigantic.Waldstein: Turner picks up where he left off.The last game here was Game 2 of the N.L.C.S.and Turner hit a walk-off, three-run home run to win Game 2 of that series.Tonight he blasts a two-run shot after Keuchel made the big mistake of walking Chris Taylor ahead of him with two outs.Turner has 4 home runs in the postseason, tied for second-most by a Dodger.Davey Lopes had the most, 5, in 1978.I think Turner is going to tie Lopess record.He also has 26 career postseason R.B.I.for the Dodgers.That ties Duke Snider, who collected all of his in the World Series.For Turner, 14 of his postseason R.B.I.have come this year, establishing a new Dodgers single-season postseason record.And yes, the Mets let him go for nothing.
How the Astros Became an American League Team:::::The Astros joined the A.L.in 2013 to balance the leagues with three divisions of five teams each.Since 1998, when Arizona and Tampa Bay joined the league as expansion teams and the Milwaukee Brewers moved to the National League, there had been a four-team division in the A.L.and a six-team division in the N.L.Photo The Astros were chosen as the team to switch in part as an effort to create a rivalry with the Texas Rangers in the A.L.West.Because the National League had, on balance, bigger cities, the move to the A.L.was considered a negative by many fans, so much so that the teams new owners were compensated $70 million to offset possible reduced television money.The Astros are the first team to make the World Series with each league.The only other team to switch leagues in modern times, the Brewers, has only one playoff series win since joining the N.L.The Astros N.L.high point was a World Series trip in 2005; they wound up being swept by the Chicago White Sox.Outside of that year, the Astros playoff record was poor in the N.L.: one series win in nine tries.Since moving to the A.L., their playoff series record is 3-1.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.A division or conference switch in other North American sports is unlikely to cause a huge commotion.But baseball for many years kept a clean separation of its two leagues, making such a switch more disruptive.Most notably, teams from different leagues did not play one another in the regular season, adding a frisson to the rare times they did, like the All-Star Game and the World Series.Leagues also maintained distinct identities.They had separate league offices, and their umpires dressed differently (A.L.umps wore their chest protectors outside their uniforms).There were rules, large and small, that differed.Fans of the National League, founded in 1876, dismissed the American League, which became a major league in 1901, as the junior circuit.In recent times, rules have become standardized.The debut of interleague play in 1997 took away the most unusual quirk of the leagues.The only significant distinction left is the designated hitter rule, still controversial enough to start a barroom argument.As time moves on, the memories of the Astros as a National League team will fade, and any future trips to the World Series will probably not cause many double takes.
World Series Preview: A Matchup With No Underdog:::::The engine of each teams offense has a look all his own.Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner revels in his long, red hair and shaggy beard and hit .322 with a robust .945 on-base plus slugging percentage this season.Astros second baseman Jose Altuve is the shortest everyday player in the majors at 5 feet 6 inches but this season hes probably the best player, too.Altuve led the majors in batting average, at .346, and hit .400 in the A.L.playoffs.Jose Altuve is a perfect player, Astros Manager A.J.Hinch said this month, and who could argue?Other notables dot the lineups the newcomer Cody Bellinger and the old pro Chase Utley for the Dodgers; the homegrown sensations Carlos Correa and George Springer for the Astros and both pitching staffs include an ace yearning for a championship.The Dodgers Clayton Kershaw, 29, and the Astros Justin Verlander, 34, have won the Most Valuable Player Award, and will probably spend their golden years gathering on a stage in Cooperstown every July.But neither has a World Series title to his name.Kershaw, who will start Game 1 against another top left-hander, Dallas Keuchel, went 18-4 and led the National League in earned run average for the fifth time, with a 2.31 mark.He reached 200 strikeouts for the seventh time, and despite middling postseason numbers over all (6-7, 4.40 E.R.A.), the Dodgers have now won eight of his last nine playoff appearances.His desire to be great is relentless, said Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers president of baseball operations, after the N.L.C.S was over.You watch how he prepares, you watch how he goes about his work every fifth day, and for all that he has put into this game, knowing how badly he wants to pitch in a World Series, Im overcome with joy for him that he gets to experience this.Kershaw has spent his entire 10-year career with the Dodgers, while the Astros are just getting to know Verlander, who joined them in a trade from Detroit on Aug. 31, moments before his eligibility for the postseason would have run out.Verlander has taken the mound nine times for Houston, postseason included and gone 9-0 with a 1.23 E.R.A.He brings elite pitching and star power to the World Series; his fiance, the supermodel Kate Upton, wore a 1980s-vintage Astros warm-up jacket, with the old rainbow design, to the on-field celebration after the final game of the A.L.C.S.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I just congratulated him, and told him I was proud of him and what he had done, said Nolan Ryan, an Astros executive and Hall of Fame pitcher, after Verlander was named the most valuable player of the series.He stepped up and hes a big part of this ball club.I enjoy power pitchers, and he was a real pleasure to watch.Verlander will start Game 2 of the World Series on Wednesday, probably against the Dodgers Rich Hill.The series starters should also feature the All-Stars Yu Darvish (in his final performance or two before free agency) and Alex Wood for the Dodgers, and the Astros shutout duo from Game 7 against the Yankees, Charlie Morton and McCullers.Teams driven by stats or by names, they dont do anything, they dont get anywhere, Morton said in the raucous clubhouse after Game 7 of the A.L.C.S.Teams with grit, a tight-knit bond, those teams outperform expectations.That may be true, but both of these teams were expected to contend, and both fulfilled their promise all year long.Photo Leading Off With a Bang The Astros use their best power hitter, George Springer, in the leadoff spot.He went just 3 for 26 in the A.L.C.S., but bashed 34 homers in the regular season with a strong .367 on-base percentage.Hes an incredible tone-setter his presence, his energy, his knowledge of the strike zone, his threat to do exactly what he did tonight, Hinch said after Springer homered in a victory this summer.Hes a middle-of-the-order bat whos leading off the game, and once it rolls back around, you can see how productive he can be getting the most at-bats of the night.Dangerous Curves As fastball velocity rises in the majors, use of the curveball with its greater speed variation than the slider is also up.No two starters throw more curves than the Astros McCullers and the Dodgers Hill.McCullers, who silenced the Yankees with a flurry of curveballs to close out Game 7 of the A.L.C.S., threw curveballs on 47.4 percent of his pitches in the regular season, by far the most for any major leaguer with at least 100 innings.Hill ranked second, with 37.5 percent curveballs.McCullers throws the pitch much harder than Hill, with an average velocity near 86 miles an hour, compared to about 74 m.p.h.for Hill.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Unassuming Champions Besides Bellinger, no Dodger hit 30 homers or drove in 80 runs this season.But if their offense seems underwhelming, consider the lineup for their last World Series game, in 1988: Steve Sax, Franklin Stubbs, Mickey Hatcher, Mike Marshall, John Shelby, Mike Davis, Rick Dempsey, Jeff Hamilton, Alfredo Griffin.Nobody on that Dodger team had more than 25 homers or 82 runs batted in, but with stellar pitching (including two complete games from Orel Hershiser) and the timeliest of all timely hitting (Kirk Gibsons iconic homer to end Game 1), the Dodgers upset the Oakland As in five games.A Complete Player.Almost.Few players have ever matched the all-around skills and longevity of the Astros Carlos Beltran.He is one of five players with at least 2,700

Series.Beltran lost in his previous appearance, with St. Louis in 2013.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Catching On While Houstons catcher is the seven-time All-Star Brian McCann, the Dodgers Austin Barnes keeps a lower profile.A backup to Yasmani Grandal for most of the season, Barnes emerged to start six of the Dodgers eight games in the playoffs.The team acquired him with Enrique Hernandez from Miami in a seven-player deal in December 2014 that sent second baseman Dee Gordon to the Marlins.Barnes, who by then had played part of just one season above Class A, supports the theory that minor league numbers translate to the majors: his on-base percentage in the minors, .388, matches his on-base percentage for the Dodgers, and his slugging percentage (.439 in the minors, .430 for the Dodgers) is nearly identical.Reminder of Home Jansen wears No.74, a number worn by only nine other players in major league history.For Jansen, it was not simply a high number assigned randomly one spring training.He chose it to honor the street address of his boyhood home in Willemstad, Curacao.His parents had struggled to keep the house after Jansens father suffered a stroke when Jansen was 12.Baseball success has taken care of the mortgage.The short story is I helped my parents save the house, Jansen said a few years ago.We had good times, good memories over there, and also we went through a lot of tough times with the 74.Thats why Im wearing it.Photo Name That Team Neither team began with its current nickname.For their first three seasons, the Astros were known as the Colt .45s, after a suggestion from a fan named William Neder, who wrote in a contest entry, The Colt .45 won the West and will win the National League.In the team logo, smoke rose from a pistol to form the C in Colts.In December 1964, with the Colt firearms company considering a lawsuit over merchandising rights, the team owner Roy Hofheinz changed the name to Astros to capitalize on the space race.The name and insignia will help dispel the image of Texas as a land of cowboys and Indians, Hofheinz said.The Dodgers went through several names in their early years in Brooklyn Atlantics, Grays, Bridegrooms, Superbas, Robins.In the 1930s, the name Dodgers for folks who dodged trolley cars on their way across busy Brooklyn streets finally stuck.Name That Tune Visitors to Minute Maid Park know the word coyotes has only two syllables: those are ky-oats who wail along the trail in the clap-along seventh-inning stretch anthem Deep in the Heart of Texas.Likewise, fans at Dodger Stadium from the South Bay to the Valley, from the West Side to the East Side groove along to Randy Newmans I Love L.A. after every win.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Two No.32s Both teams have 10 retired numbers, including No.32 for a pitcher.The Dodgers 32 honors the Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax, but the Astros honoree is far less known.In April 1964, before the Dodgers or most teams had retired any numbers, the Astros then still known as the Colt .45s retired 32 for Jim Umbricht, a top reliever in their first two seasons as an expansion team.After posting a 2.01 E.R.A.in 1962, Umbricht was found to have a malignant tumor in his leg.He returned after surgery and pitched well again, but died of lymphoma the next spring at age 33.Photo Familiar Faces If you miss seeing Mary Hart on Entertainment Tonight, for which she was a host from 1982 to 2011, you can still find her on TV, on the far right of your screen behind the home plate for games at Dodger Stadium with her husband, Burt Sugarman.In roughly the same seating location for the games at Houstons Minute Maid Park, youll see Nolan Ryan with his wife, Ruth.And youll almost surely see the ubiquitous Marlins Man a Miami lawyer and sports superfan named Laurence Levy in his trademark orange jersey and visor somewhere close by.An Orbit All His Own The Dodgers are one of just three teams without a mascot, joining the Yankees and the Los Angeles Angels on the no-fun list.Luckily, the Astros have Orbit, a fat and furry green prankster with little baseballs affixed to his antennas.Orbit, who likes to shed his shirt and streak across the field to celebrate winning streaks (get it?), is known for playfully teasing the players; he held a sign reading Im Not Touching You while hovering inches from the head of the notoriously twitchy Adrian Beltre.Orbit is a rival of the Tampa Bay Rays Chris Archer, who presented him with a formal Declaration of Unfriendliness after a series of madcap antics this summer.Common Alumni The Dodgers Hernandez and Josh Fields are former Astros, and Houstons Josh Reddick has played for Los Angeles.Outfielder Jimmy Wynn, known as the Toy Cannon, ranks fourth on the Astros career home run list and played for the Dodgers in the 1974 World Series.Don Sutton, the Dodgers career leader in wins, losses, shutouts and strikeouts, left the team as a free agent to join the Astros in 1981.He fractured a kneecap in his final start of that season and missed the playoffs, but several others have played in the postseason for both teams, including Fields, Reddick, Enos Cabell, Danny Heep, Jose Lima, Davey Lopes, Jeff Kent and Rafael Landestoy.Playoff History A meeting of former National League West rivals, this World Series feels a bit like the 2014 Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and the Denver Broncos; for decades, the matchup occurred multiple times every regular season.But the Astros, who moved to the A.L.in 2013, did face the Dodgers in a playoff series after the strike-shortened 1981 season, when baseball staged a best-of-five series between the first- and second-half winners of each division.The Astros who had beaten the Dodgers in a one-game playoff to win the West the year before took the first two games in Houston but dropped the last three at Dodger Stadium.Nolan Ryan had no-hit the Dodgers two weeks before, but he lost the finale to Jerry Reuss, who spun a five-hitter against his former team to send Los Angeles on its way to a championship.
Mets Have a Clear Goal for Mickey Callaway: Fix Their Pitching:::::I think youre always taking a gamble, Alderson said.Youre always taking a risk on somebody.Nobody is the perfect candidate or the perfect interview, either.Theres always risk in choosing 1 out of 6 or 1 out of 36.But we feel very good.Callaway, who was Clevelands pitching coach for the past four seasons, directed a group that in 2017 posted the lowest combined E.R.A.in the majors (3.30), led the league in strikeouts (1,614) and issued the fewest walks (406).The won-loss record and E.R.A.of Clevelands starting staff (81-38, 3.52) was the best in baseball, and the teams ace, Corey Kluber, is a leading candidate to win the American League Cy Young Award, which he won in 2014.Callaway is also credited with the development of Trevor Bauer, who went from a sub-.500 pitcher in his first four seasons to having a 17-9 record in 2017.Clearly, the Mets are hoping Callaway can work similar wonders with their own pitching staff, which was decimated by injuries in 2017 and posted a 5.01 E.R.A., third-worst in the majors.People are reluctant to name pitching coaches as managers or former pitchers as managers, but in our situation, short-term, pitching is everything, Alderson said.I think it was a positive factor in this case.We evaluated the candidates and looked at Mickey and tried to look at the short term and long term, and we definitely think Mickey long-term has potential as a manager.And short-term, maybe there will be some growing pains, who knows?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But short-term, Alderson added, what is most critical for our success is the pitching, and I think that he has had so much success recently with a pitching staff definitely was a factor for us.Callaway emerged as the winner after a first round of interviews involving five other candidates a list that included Kevin Long, the Mets hitting coach for the past three seasons.Alderson said Long was disappointed not to be chosen, and it was unclear if he would return to the club in 2018.There may be another managerial opportunity out there that comes his way, so well just have to see what happens over the next few days, Alderson said.Hes been given permission to speak to one other team, but I dont want to disclose any of that because I dont know what theyre disclosing.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But so impressed were Alderson and Fred Wilpon, the Mets owner, after a lunch meeting with Callaway that they canceled a second round of interviews to concentrate on him.The thing I want to emphasize is we werent only looking for a manager, we were looking for a leader, Alderson said.There seemed to be a real consistency between Mickeys approach and our approach and what he was looking for in the way of managing, and what we were looking for in the way of a leader in the clubhouse.Thats a visceral reaction, not one that you can put down on a checklist, but to me that said everything.Callaway acknowledged being somewhat unfamiliar with the Mets and their personnel while being fully aware of their troubled 2017 season.Im looking forward to getting to know everyone here and digging in deep to everything and everybody to see how I can assist them, he said.And for sure, the Mets need help.
For Game 1 of the World Series, Mother Nature Will Bring the Heat:::::All of this represents a drastic swing from recent World Series weather, especially considering that Game 2 of last years Series between the Indians and Chicago Cubs had a game-time temperature of 43 degrees in Cleveland.The unusual heat in Los Angeles also comes amid a period of extreme weather events around the country, such as the devastating hurricanes that have hit Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida; temperatures of over 100 degrees in Portland in August and San Francisco last month; and the wildfires that have raged through parts of California.For Angelinos, October is Santa Ana season, said William Patzert, a climatologist with NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is about 10 miles northeast of Dodger Stadium.Santa Ana winds blow toward the Pacific Ocean when a high-pressure system builds over the Great Basin desert in Nevada.That pushes winds through the high desert and three mountain passes Cajon, Banning and Santa Clarita River at speeds ranging from 30 to 50 miles per hour.As they drop down into the basin where Dodger Stadium is, they tend to heat up and dry out, Patzert said.What were expecting in the next couple days is record-breaking heat.This could be not-so-welcome news for the starting pitchers in Game 1, Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers and Dallas Keuchel of the Astros.Photo Dodger Stadium, which sits in Chavez Ravine in the hills just above downtown Los Angeles, is one of baseballs more pitcher-friendly ballparks especially at night.This is due to not only the stadiums dimensions, with its ample 385-foot power alleys, but also Los Angeless weather patterns.Normally, mornings bring an offshore flow, as warm air is carried out toward the ocean.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the afternoon, the winds often shift, bringing in a moist, heavier marine layer that benefits pitchers, weighing down long drives that might normally leave the ballpark.If that marine air is absent, replaced by warm, dry and thin air from the Santa Ana winds, it could be a boon for lineups with plenty of pop.The Astros were second in the American League with 238 home runs, while the Dodgers were fourth in the National League with 221.Keuchel, though, did not seem to mind.This weather is always beautiful, he said Monday.Its that dry heat.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Asked if it was hot enough to make him consider shaving his bushy, chest-length beard, Keuchel laughed.Well, if its hot enough for four wins, Ill shave it for sure, he said.For a long time, weather was less of an issue in the World Series.Until the postseason was expanded in 1969, the World Series wrapped up much earlier in October.And until 1971, when Commissioner Bowie Kuhn persuaded NBC to begin broadcasting some World Series games at night, postseason games were played exclusively during the day.Kuhn, sensitive to criticism over the move away from traditional day baseball, sat in the stands without an overcoat during Game 2 of the 1976 World Series, even though others around him shivered as they watched the Yankees play the Reds in Cincinnati.In 1979, Kuhn prohibited the Baltimore Orioles and Pittsburgh Pirates from wearing ski caps during warm-ups or in the dugout, even though it was 41 degrees at the start of Game 1.After Kuhn was long gone, the postseason calendar kept expanding.Division series were added in 1995 to supplement the league championship series that had begun 26 years before.And then a wild-card game was added for each league in 2012.The extended postseason action has created the opportunity for more bone-chilling nights when the Series takes place in cities like Boston, New York, Denver, Detroit, Chicago or Philadelphia.After a frigid 2006 World Series, when the St. Louis Cardinals and the Detroit Tigers improvised to keep warm when the temperature dipped below 40 degrees, the New Era apparel company persuaded Major League Baseball to allow it to develop three types of cold-weather accouterments: knit ski caps, balaclavas and fleece-lined baseball caps with ear flaps, which drew comparison to cartoon character Elmer Fudds hunting cap.The gear came in handy in 2008, when the Phillies and Tampa Bay Rays had to play in wet, windy and cold conditions in Philadelphia.Dodgers outfielder Curtis Granderson pondered the weathers effects on the postseason in 2006, when he played for the Tigers.Since spring training, outside of maybe the first few weeks in April, its been nice weather all season, he recalled thinking that year.Now were trying to determine the best teams in baseball and its anywhere from 20 to 50 degrees colder than youve been playing all season long?Has anyone thought about this?Advertisement Continue reading the main story Such considerations will not be necessary on Tuesday.Neither will the balaclavas, scarves and wool coats.The fans who fill Dodger Stadium are far more likely to be wearing tank tops and flip flops while they watch the Astros and Dodgers trying to beat each other and the heat.

Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton wins fourth Formula One world championship to become most successful British driver of all time:::::Lewis Hamilton has been crowned Formula One world champion for a fourth time despite a stunning opening-lap collision with rival Sebastian Vettel at the Mexican Grand Prix.Hamilton finished only ninth following the explosive turn-three incident, after which the British driver asked if Vettel had deliberately crashed into him.The championship rivals both sustained damage in the collision as Hamilton's Mercedes limped back to the pit lane with a right-rear puncture while Vettel stopped for repairs to his Ferrari's broken front wing.And although a determined Vettel fought back through the field to cross the line in fourth place, he fell well short of the victory he required to prevent Hamilton from winning the title with two rounds to spare.Max Verstappen, who also banged wheels with Vettel in a frenetic start to Sunday's race, took advantage of the first-lap mayhem to win from Valtteri Bottas with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen completing the podium places.Hamilton, 32, has now surpassed Sir Jackie Stewart by becoming the first British driver to win more than three titles.He had vowed to seal his fourth championship in style.After qualifying only third, Hamilton knew that the 800-metre charge to the first corner - the longest on the calendar - represented his best chance of writing his name into the record books with his 10th victory of the year.Pole-sitter Vettel, Verstappen and Hamilton charged three abreast at 220mph into the left-handed opening turn.Verstappen then made his move around the outside of Vettel at the right-handed second corner before the pair banged wheels.Vettel then clumsily tapped the back of Verstappen's Red Bull before Hamilton sensed his opportunity.He roared around the outside of Vettel at the ensuing turn, and the Ferrari driver - now down to third - made contact with Hamilton's right-rear rubber.The German - whose hero Michael Schumacher famously took Jacques Villeneuve out of the concluding race in Jerez 20 years ago in a do-or-die attempt to win the championship - appeared at fault.Hamilton led the inquisition as he asked over the team radio whether it was indeed an act of desperation from his title rival."Did he hit me deliberately?"Hamilton asked."Not sure, Lewis," came the reply from the Briton's race engineer Pete Bonnington.The stewards looked at the dramatic incident, but took just seven minutes to make up their mind by taking the course of pursuing no further action.Vettel, who had led this year's championship battle by 25 points in May but had been cast 66 points adrift of Hamilton prior to Sunday's dramatic race in Mexico City, emerged from the pits 35 seconds adrift of leader Verstappen with Hamilton one minute behind the Red Bull man.Vettel was soon on a charge and almost came unstuck for a third time when he was forced off the road by Felipe Massa, but the four-time champion emerged unscathed, and by half-distance he was into the points, albeit the best part of 60 seconds adrift of second-placed Bottas.Hamilton's progress through the pack was not as swift, and he was soon a lap down.He fought past Fernando Alonso in the closing stages, but it was inconsequential.Despite Vettel reducing the points deficit to 56, with just two races remaining Hamilton heads to Brazil for the year's penultimate grand prix with an unassailable lead.As such, Hamilton follows up his title triumphs in 2008, 2014 and 2015, to join Schumacher, Juan Manuel Fangio, Alain Prost and Vettel as only the fifth driver to have won motor racing's biggest prize on more than three occasions.Hamilton crossed the line with his head in his hands before holding aloft a Union Flag aloft as he celebrated his remarkable achievement.
'We are where we are' - David Unsworth admits struggling Everton are in a relegation battle:::::Everton caretaker manager David Unsworth admitted the struggling Toffees are in a relegation battle.The Blues travelled to the King Power Stadium on Sunday but succumbed to a 2-0 defeat against the Foxes, who were managed by new boss Claude Puel for the first time.Jamie Vardy scored the opening goal in the first half before Demarai Gray grabbed the second courtesy of a miskick from Everton right-back Jonjoe Kenny.The Blues should have had a penalty, after Aaron Lennon was fouled by Christian Fuchs, but Unsworth admitted the Toffees, who remain third bottom, are in a relegation battle.He said: "We have to be honest, we are where we are.The answer to that is yes.But at the same time, (it's) nothing a couple of back-to-back wins wouldn't put right, to settle everyone down."The job isn't bigger than I expected.Any manager who comes in wants to get quick results to get confidence rolling but you need time on the grass to get your opinions over."Meanwhile, former Burnley midfielder and talkSPORT pundit Joey Barton, an Everton fan, was critical after the game - hitting out at Unsworth's appearance.Barton said: "I saw him getting onto the coach as Everton manager the other day, he doesn't look right.He's waddling onto the coach."I was reading a British Army service manual the other day and one of the things it says is 'you've got to be fit to lead your troops into battle'.Now I'm not saying you can't manage Everton if you're overweight but it certainly doesn't look right."He's standing in his suit on the touchline, he doesn't look like a manager for me."But Unsworth dismissed Barton's comments immediately afterwards."I've not seen that.It's not a problem what Joey Barton says, I couldn't care less," he said.

Leicester 2-0 Everton: Claude Puel begins Foxes tenure with comfortable win over struggling Toffees:::::New boss Claude Puel began his Leicester reign with a routine win over managerless Everton as the Foxes eased away from trouble.Jamie Vardy and Demarai Gray clinched successive wins for the hosts and sealed a 2-0 victory over the struggling Toffees.Puel was only appointed as Leicester manager on Wednesday but his new side made light work of powderpuff Everton, who remain in the Premier League relegation zone, to move up to 11th.The Toffees' troubles grew when they were denied a penalty after Aaron Lennon was fouled and they are in desperate need of direction with caretaker manager David Unsworth unable to inspire a change.Everton were the visitors on the final day of the season in May 2016, less than 18 months ago, after which Leicester lifted the Premier League trophy.Since then the pair have changed managers twice and have both gone backwards - with the Toffees still to permanently replace the sacked Ronald Koeman after spending around 150million in the summer.With Leicester a step ahead, having appointed Puel as Craig Shakespeare's replacement, they took the early initiative.The recalled Gray drilled wide before skipper Wes Morgan's blast was deflected over and Chilwell scooped off target during a lightning start by the Foxes.Everton, with just two league wins this season, struggled to respond and found themselves behind after 18 minutes.Leighton Baines' free-kick was cleared to Gray and the winger put on the afterburners to leave Idrissa Gueye and Tom Davies trailing during a barnstorming 60-yard run.He found Mahrez who, in turn, crossed for Vardy to bury his sixth goal of the season from five yards.Tails up, the Foxes went for more and Jordan Pickford saved Ashley Williams' blushes by claiming Mahrez's effort after Williams lost the ball.The pace of Gray, Mahrez and Vardy terrorised the ageing Everton defence but it was one of their young guns who inadvertently helped double Leicester's lead after 29 minutes.There seemed little danger from Gray's routine cross but Kenny, starting just his second league game for the Toffees, horribly sliced his clearance past the stunned Pickford.The goal was given to Gray - his first Premier League strike in over a year.But Everton should have been awarded a penalty after 31 minutes when Aaron Lennon was fouled by Christian Fuchs yet referee Andre Marriner denied them a lifeline.The visitors regrouped and began the second half brightly after the introduction of Beni Baningime and Oumar Niasse for Lennon and Kevin Mirallas.But they still failed to test Kasper Schmeichel despite bossing possession, with Leicester happy to sit back, and the ineffective Wayne Rooney looked unhappy at being replaced by Gylfi Sigurdsson.The Foxes remained comfortable, enough to substitute Mahrez, with a more physical second half and Vicente Iborra should have added a third late on but poked wide.

Manchester United news: Mourinho not impressed by some fans' treatment of Lukaku:::::Jose Mourinho has expressed his unhappiness with Manchester United fans over what he regards as unfair treatment of Romelu Lukaku.Saturday's 1-0 home victory over Tottenham saw striker Lukaku fail to score for a fifth successive game but he did set up substitute Anthony Martial's 81st-minute winner, moments after hitting the post with a header.Speaking about his striker, who has scored 11 goals for the club this season, Old Trafford boss Mourinho told MUTV: "I would like the supporters to explain to me why they don't support him so much because he gives everything."I think it is not fair when scoring the goal or not scoring the goal makes the whole difference."I don't think it is fair at all.So, I'm a bit disappointed - but not with him.With him (I am) very pleased."When the final whistle sounded at Old Trafford on Saturday, Mourinho, whose decision to replace Marcus Rashford with Martial in the 70th minute prompted some jeers around the ground, held a finger to his lips as he looked directly into a television camera.He subsequently said when asked about the gesture: "Some people speak too much...calm down, relax."Mourinho was full of praise for his team after a return to winning ways in the Premier League for United following the 0-0 draw at Liverpool and last weekend's shock 2-1 loss at Huddersfield.Having been critical of his players after the defeat at the John Smith's Stadium, the Portuguese said of the Tottenham game: "If the result is 0-0 or 1-1, my feelings with the players would be the same."They gave everything, every ball was like the most important ball of their career.The focus and concentration was there against a quality team."We played well.To play well against a very good team feels even better."
Bath 21-22 Gloucester: Owen Williams kicks visitors to dramatic win:::::Owen Williams kicked Gloucester to a tense and dramatic Aviva Premiership victory over west country rivals Bath at the Recreation Ground.Wales international Williams converted Ed Slater's try five minutes into stoppage-time as Gloucester triumphed 22-21 and claimed a first away win of the season.Bath wing Semesa Rokoduguni looked to have done enough for Bath when he crossed four minutes from the end of normal time for his second touchdown, but Gloucester were not to be denied.Fly-half Rhys Priestland added three penalties and a conversion for Bath after scrum-half and captain Willi Heinz scored two tries to build foundations for what ended up being only Gloucester's second win from their last 11 Recreation Ground visits in the Premiership.Williams chipped in with a penalty and two conversions as Bath struggled to build on an impressive European Champions Cup success against the Scarlets nine days ago.Rokoduguni, who has been overlooked by England head coach Eddie Jones for this season's autumn Tests, claimed a quality first-half try for Bath, yet the home side offered little in attack apart from centre Jonathan Joseph's dancing feet and an occasional Anthony Watson break.Gloucester, who had not won on their travels since a European Challenge Cup semi-final victory over La Rochelle last season, stunned Bath by taking a fifth-minute lead.Bath had made all the early tactical probing, but Gloucester cut loose through a superb break by centre Henry Trinder that caused panic in the opposition defence, and Heinz applied a high-class finish to put the visitors 5-0 ahead.Bath, though, showcased their attacking flair nine minutes later, securing quality set-piece possession before Joseph broke free inside his own half, found England colleague Watson in support, and Watson's pass freed Rokoduguni, who collected a sixth Premiership try this term.Gloucester continued to find themselves under pressure territory-wise, yet they restricted Bath to a Priestland penalty before Watson went off for what appeared to be a head injury assessment.He was on the receiving end of a questionable tackle by Gloucester wing David Halaifonua, although it went unpunished by referee Tom Foley, and as Watson departed, Priestland sent a long-range penalty wide when the visiting forwards infringed.Bath trooped off at half-time with a three-point advantage, but it should have been much more of a lead, given their dominant field position and superior possession statistics.While Watson then returned for the second period, Bath's England squad flanker Sam Underhill did not appear and was replaced by Matt Garvey.Williams kicked a 46th-minute penalty to draw Gloucester level, and after Priestland landed a long-range strike, the visitors claimed a second try to regain the lead.Prop John Afoa played the key build-up role, powering into the heart of Bath defensive territory before delivering a quality one-handed pass that Heinz gathered before surging clear and completing his double.Williams' conversion made it 15-11 to Gloucester, only for Priestland to complete his penalty hat-trick after Ben Morgan was punished for a high-tackle on Bath flanker Zach Mercer.It meant that an otherwise unconvincing game was at least set for a tense finish.Rokoduguni looked to have seen Bath home following a barnstorming Taulupe Faletau charge, with Priestland converting, but then came the late drama.
Girona beat Real Madrid 2-1 in LaLiga - match report:::::Girona claimed a stunning 2-1 victory against Real Madrid to deal a major blow to the Liga champions' hopes of retaining their title.Although it is still early in the season, Zinedine Zidane's side already have eight points to make up on rivals Barcelona.Few would have seen a hiccup coming at Barcelona's Catalan neighbours Girona, who are playing in the top flight for the first time.This is by far the biggest result in the minnows' history and will no doubt be celebrated wildly across Catalonia given the political backdrop.This was no smash-and-grab raid either, with Girona twice hitting the post in the first half and unlucky to be behind to an Isco breakaway goal.They turned the tables with two goals in four minutes early in the second half from Cristhian Stuani and Portu and withstood the inevitable Real salvo with relative comfort.Girona attacked from the off.Kiko Casilla did just enough to put off Portu at the near post when a clever free-kick picked out the striker but the Real keeper was beaten three minutes later by Pablo Maffeo's cross-shot, which hit the far post.To make matters worse for Girona, Real promptly broke away and scored the opening goal.Karim Benzema drove forward through the middle and played in Cristiano Ronaldo.He cut inside and sent a dipping right-footed shot from 20 yards, which Bono pushed out straight to Isco, who knocked the ball inside the post.Ronaldo has only scored once in the league this season and set about trying to add to his tally, first pulling a deflected shot just wide and then sending a crisp half-volley straight at Bono.Benzema should have at least tested Bono as Real piled on the pressure but, having been played through by Ronaldo, he shot wastefully over the bar.Girona were certainly not content simply to sit back and came agonisingly close to an equaliser in the 35th minute when Aday's cross was met by a superb flick from Portu that hit the inside of the post.Real were forced into a change for the second half when Raphael Varane, who denied Pere Pons with an inch-perfect tackle just before the break, was replaced by Nacho.Bono again looked unsure as a Benzema flick sailed over his head but Aday was alert to clear the ball off the line.In the 54th minute, the hosts stunned Real with an equaliser they fully merited.The impressive Pons was the architect with a driving run to the edge of the box.He got a stroke of fortune when his pass was deflected into the path of Stuani, who showed excellent feet and then a cool head to slot past Casilla.If the home fans thought they were dreaming, they were positively stunned four minutes later when Girona took the lead.Stuani's shot was kept out by Casilla but Maffeo followed up with a cross-shot that was flicked in by Portu.The striker looked offside but Real's protests were in vain.Girona nearly made it three as Portu played Stuani clean through but, although the striker beat Casilla, his shot went wide of the far post.Real pushed forward with a hint of desperation as they sought an equaliser but they struggled to create clear-cut opportunities while Lucaz Vazquez had the ball in the net but was correctly flagged offside.
Leicester Tigers triumph 30-13 against Newcastle Falcons in Aviva Premiership:::::Three second-half penalties from George Ford and a late Jonny May try finally ended Newcastle's resistance as Leicester Tigers beat the Falcons 30-13 in front of a sell-out 10,100 crowd at Kingston Park.Ford clocked up 15 points, converting all three of the Tigers tries by Telusa Veainu, Ben Youngs and May and also kicked three penalties after the Falcons had battled their way back into the game.The Tigers looked set for a comfortable half-time lead after scoring two tries in the space of seven minutes with Veainu scoring a cracker and making it easy for Youngs to add the second and Ford converting both to make it 14-3.But Newcastle hit back right on half-time through a Vereniki Goneva try and with Toby Flood converting and kicking a penalty it was 14-10 at the break.Both sides showed early intent Flood kicking a penalty to the corner to set up an attacking line-out and Ford doing the same for Leicester.But Newcastle made a mess of their line-out while the Tigers ruthlessly did not with slick passing setting up Veainu to score a quite breathtaking try standing up a bewildered Falcons defence with a weaving run.Ford converted and despite a 14th-minute penalty from Flood the Falcons slipped further behind when Veainu stepped inside the tackle again and popped the ball up for the simplest of tries for Ben Youngs, converted by Ford in the 18th minute and the Tigers led 14-3.Newcastle were struggling with the pace of the game but their real problem was the number of high-tackle penalties they were conceding while their first-up tackling was also suspect.The Tigers were clearly in control with Newcastle unable to retain the ball for any length of time, but they finally got it right with less than a minute from half-time with the ball moved along the line and back inside for Mathew Tait to swap passes with Goneva and the big winger scored easily, Flood converting for 14-10 at the break.A Flood penalty two minutes into the second half made it 14-13 and it was anybody's game with a ferocious battle raging over the ball at the breakdown.Ironically, it was a simple offside behind the scrum that led to a 50-metre penalty from Ford to edge the Tigers 17-13 ahead in the 52nd minute and the England fly-half was on target again in 65th and 69th minutes when Newcastle folded at the scrum and transgressed with another high tackle.At 23-13 it looked enough for a Tigers victory and May charged over in the corner with Ford converting to wrap it up.
Russell Wilson, Deshaun Watson Seahawks Win Over Texans:::::Reacting and overreacting to everything that happened on Sunday afternoon.Get the full Sunday breakdown from Andy Benoit and Gary Gramling on The MMQB: 10 Things Podcast.Subscribe now and it will be in your feed first thing Monday morning Things That Made Me Giddy Russell Wilson, Three Plays In Seattle: He got a little help from what seemed to be a badly blown defensive assignment on the winning touchdown (how do you miss Jimmy Graham, he's eight-feet tall!), but the two preceding throws were otherworldly: a 48-yarder to Paul Richardson then a 19-yarder to Tyler Lockett.This was Wilson at his best, and Wilson at his best is special.Deshaun Watson Toasts Earl Thomas, Earl Thomas Toasts Watson: This game was a ton of fun, right from the start.The deep TD pass to Will Fuller was an emotionally moving experience.Fullers speed and Watsons throw were an unbeatable combination.And the next series Watson stares down DeAndre Hopkins and Thomas takes advantage, then jukes Watson (weve seen he can tackle) en route to a 78-yard pick-six.Welcome Back Luke Kuechly: The offense was up-and-down again, but it didnt matter.Kuechly cant be run on, and he added a pick on a little Cameron Brate stick route.With Kuechly (and Kurt Coleman) back, this defense is capable of carrying Carolina in plenty of weeks.Jerick McKinnon: Swift and crafty with more explosiveness than youd expect once he heads upfield.Hes not Dalvin Cook, but hes not that far behind.Tyler Lockett and Paul Richardson: Nice to see guys on the perimeter making plays in Seattle, especially as the run game fails to get going and Jimmy Graham often appears on a milk carton.Another Blocked Kick for the Patriots: Bill Belichick loves special teams!Everythings Coming Up Buffalo: This was the exact blueprint of a Bills win: +4 in turnover margin, more than 35 minutes of possession, 167 rushing yards.And as an added bonus, they managed to get something while getting out from under Marcell Dareuss contract.Thats a good week.Akiem Hicks: Is the greatest player that no one realizes is a great player.Dont Worry About the Patriots Secondary: Malcolm Butler was caught off-guard by the snap when he was beat over the top by Travis Benjamin, but that was about all they allowed.(Though with no Donta Hightower, the run defense is what to keep an eye on in Foxboro.)Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs: You do not appreciate them enough!Everson Griffen: Sack streak extends to eight games!Hes really good, but the image of him sitting on the field holding his foot as the game ended was disturbing.We need some closure on that, NFL Network!Ricardo Louis Beats Xavier Rhodes: A Buster Douglas-sized upset; the 37-yard play down the left sideline was the key play on the Browns late-first half TD drive.Bizarro!Regrets Kirk Cousins as a Punching Bag: Washington was down three starters then lost a fourth, left guard Shawn Lauvao, to a stinger.So, shruggy shoulder emoji guy.Im not sure the Cowboys pass rush was great on Sunday, but Cousins had no hope.Jordan Reed, Ryan Kerrigan and Other People In Maroon Also Go Down: Because a plague has beset Washington.Kerrigan ended up returning to the field, but was not anywhere near his usual self playing through a groin injury.Reed left with a hamstring, Niles Paul with a scary concussion after a helmet-to-helmet collision with Sean Lee (so those two-tight end sets went out the window for Jay Gruden).In the end, we move that much closer to Dan Snyder just having to suit up and take the field himself.Seahawks Run Game: Was and is terrible.Eddie Lacy and Thomas Rawls combined to go 12 carries for -1 yards.And theyre screwing up even when theyre supposed to just be a decoy; on a second-and-goal, Rawls committed a blatant chop-block on the backside of a play-action bootleg, erasing a touchdown and backing them up to the 22.(He was bailed out by defensive pass interference in the end zone on the next play.)Matt Ryan and Alex Mack Cant Get It Together: In the inclement weather, four botched center-QB exchanges, resulting in two lost fumbles and a missed two-point conversion.As the old saying goes, when it rains it pours and you should have done more of those wet-ball drills Peyton Manning always talks about after hes had a few beers which is why no one wants to hang out with Peyton Manning at parties.Raiders Turnovers: O.K., so you thought you were going to come into Ralph Wilson Stadium, give it away three times (plus one more in garbage time) and win?No, no you are not.Two unforgivable fumbles lost by the mini-backs (Jalen Richard and DeAndre Washington, playing expanded roles with Marshawn Lynch suspended) and one of those trademark deflected INTs in Buffalo.Flops: Save it for Duke basketball walk-on tryouts, McKissic.Vikings Have Nothing But Time at End of First Half: You always have to leave some extra time on the clock, just in case you get a penalty that resets the downs.But theres no reason, when both teams have all their timeouts, to call one before third down with 42 seconds left on the clock.Instead of giving the Vikings a 15% chance of driving for a field goal (which they did), give them a 0% chance.Though I suppose this is just how 0-8 teams roll.Missing Dan Bailey: Mike Nugents first attempt as a Cowboy is a miss from 49.Cmon Nuge!(He did hit his next four.)Eagles Sans Jason Peters: Things got a bit hairy for Carson Wentz (at a glance the pressure was coming from across the line, not just at Halapoulivaati Vaitai.It didnt make a big difference against an overmatched 49ers team, but jangled nerves of Eagles fans were not soothed.Isaiah Crowell and Ball Security: The Browns enter the second half with a lead for the first time all season, so to start the second halfs opening drive they just need to ...aw, crap.More Muffed Punts: Bryce Treggs in London, Jeremy Kerley in East Rutherford.Its a league-wide epidemic!Tyron Smith and Flags: Three of them on Sunday (two holds and a false start).A weird day for the best offensive lineman in football.Mike Remmers Concussed: For Vikings fans, flashbacks to 2016 when Rashod Hill came in at right tackle and had his butt handed to him early.Vikings were fine in the long run though, thanks in large part to some nifty pocket movement by Case Keenum.Learning to Winnable Games: One of many problems with the Browns rebuild.You cant win games youre in a position to win if you dont know how.Cleveland was outscored 18-0 over the final 17 minutes of this game.Moments Well Tell Our Grandkids About Everything That Happened in Seahawks-Texans This Travis Benjamin Punt Return: You could convene 1,000 of the worlds greatest fiction writers and lock them in a room for 1,000 days with a single task: Conjure the most bone-headed American football play imaginable.They would not top this: Also, great choreography by the officials on the call: Will Fuller Is Very, Very Fast: And Earl Thomas found out the hard way.Deshaun Watson threw this pass 61 yards in the air ON A DIME to Will Fuller.So, about his deep ball accuracy ...pic.twitter.com/WkUGr7Gmbz Jason McIntyre (@jasonrmcintyre) October 29, 2017 Carlos Dunlap Saves Cin City: This would have been a disaster for Marvin Lewiss squad, as they looked thoroughly unprepared on both sides of the ball (how you can have a 67-yard screen pass and still not cross the 300-yard threshold against what is basically the Colts practice squad D is upsetting to say the least).But then Dunlap comes along and makes a play that saves everyones collective orange butts.Deshaun Watson Spin-O-Rama: Awesome.And classy (I assume it was an homage to recently unretired pass rusher Dwight Freeney, making his season debut in Seattle.)Zach Miller TD Catch: Sometimes in this column, I write something like you might not want to look at this dudes ...psyche lol totally radical!Or something along those lines.But really, I strongly urge you to avoid replays of the Miller TD catch.A beautiful throw by Mitchell Trubisky, Miller hauled it in with one hand and, upon landing, snapped his leg.And it was a TDI cant for the life of me figure out how it was overturned, apparently the ruling was he didnt complete the catch because after turning over he set the ball down before reaching for his knee.Go!DeAndre Hopkins!Go!: Great new kids show.DeAndre Hopkins ROASTED the Legion of Boom on this 72-yard TD.pic.twitter.com/opoyId1Vnm CBS Sports (@CBSSports) October 29, 2017 Malcolm Butler Races Melvin Gordon: Supposedly Butler ran a 4.6 at his pro day, while Gordon ran a 4.52 at the combine.But here, Butler ran the 40 as fast as Gordon ran the 35.(But Gordon because he had to do a lot more running before the straightaway, and because he scored the touchdown.)A Very Alshon Jeffery Christmas: Catch.A Very Alshon Jeffery Catch.What Well Be Talking About This Week Can a Couple Breaks Get the Falcons Back on Track: They were lucky to escape East Rutherford with a sloppy, mistake-filled win sealed by a couple of special teams plays.Their offense showed signs of life; a little more involvement from the tight ends early, and if you take away a couple of wet-weather drops this would have been a much more comfortable win.The problems were more execution than scheme, and they still had nearly 400 yards in a road game.The Falcons still have plenty of rough edges to smooth out, but getting a win when youre not at your best helps.Russell Wilson Can Carry These Seahawks: With no running game, a surprisingly horrific day for the defense and (as usual) no protection, Wilson kept the Seahawks in it by extending plays and hitting chunk play after chunk play.If Tom Brady was never born, we might be talking MVP trajectory.I Demand Re-Alignment to Put the Seahawks and Texans in the Same Division: It is a crime to limit the viewing public to one Russell Wilson vs. Deshaun Watson matchup every four years.Vikings QB Situation: Minnesotas O-line wasnt great on Sunday, but Case Keenum consistently moved well enough (not just designed rollouts, but avoiding pressure within the pocket as well) to cover up the protection issues.That will be a big part of the conversation with Teddy Bridgewater just about ready to return.Bridgewater is the better talent, but can he, on a surgically repaired knee, move well enough to survive like Keenum did?Question or comment?Email us at talkback@themmqb.com.
Matt Forte questions Jets offensive coordinator:::::Matt Forte vocally questioned some of the odd coaching decisions that led to the Jets' latest collapse against the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday afternoon at MetLife Stadium.Rain fell for the entire game and the Jets, mainly offensive coordinator John Morton, decided to go with 13 passes and two runs in the fourth quarter."I only had four carries this game, so I don't really think we ran the ball enough with the weather being the way it was," Forte told reporters after the game."I think that kind of hurt us.""I'm definitely surprised by that, because we knew the weather was going to be like that," Forte added, according to the New York Daily New."It continued to rain the entire game.I think we only ran the ball 20 times.(There) should have been at least one person getting 20 carries -- something like that -- with the way the weather was.I thought we were going to grind them out on the ground like that, but it ended up not turning out that way."The Jets are now 35 on the season.The Jets running backs finished the day with 42 yards on 20 carries.
Cowboys-Redskins: Ezekiel Elliott With Another Stellar Run Game:::::Three thoughts off the Cowboys 33-19 win against Washington on Sunday.1.Welcome back, football.It feels as though this game (and Houston at Seattle, the other afternoon game) could be a turning point for an otherwise mediocre NFL season so far.We are halfway through the 2017 season and, though there have been a handful of great games, this was the first game pitting two classic rivals that was played in football weather.The temperature for kickoff at FedEx Field was 60 degrees and dropped steadily throughout the night, and the light-to-medium rain throughout the game forced both teams to strategize for weather conditions for the first time all season.Ezekiel Elliott and Kirk Cousins both put the ball on the deck.Washington mishandled two field goals (and had one of them blocked), and Chris Thompson coughed up a kick return.Washington wore its throwbacks, the leaves are changing colors and two NFC East rivals took a late afternoon game into the final minutes.The Seahawks 4138 victory over the Texans was a much better contest, but put the two together and it feels like its finally football season again.2.How can the Cowboys win without Zeke?By the time the Cowboys went up by 13 in the fourth quarter, Elliott had 126 yards on 27 carries and two touchdowns (he finished with 150 yards).Dallas is now 93 in all games when Elliott rushes for at least 100 yards.Elliott continues to face a six-game suspension, and a district judge will rule on a preliminary injunction tomorrow.If he wins, hell likely play out the season.If the injunction is not granted, Elliott will likely face immediate suspension for the next six games.That means the Cowboys will face the Chiefs, Falcons, Eagles, Chargers, Washington and the Giants in the next six weeks without their best rusher.Thats a gauntlet that, without Elliott, makes playoff hopes difficult to forecast.3.Plenty was (rightfully) made of Washington going into Sundays game without three of its starting offensive linemen.Had they been healthy along the line, perhaps Kirk Cousins wouldnt have been hassled all night and sacked four times for minus-27 yards.But even if Cousins had more time in the pocket, to whom is he expected to throw the ball?When Washington let Pierre Garcon and Desean Jackson walk, it was assumed it was rolling with Jordan Reed, Josh Doctson and Terrelle Pryor as its top pass-catchers.That trio combined for two catches on five targets for 6 yards and a touchdown on Sunday.Reed and Doctson have had an injury history, but theres not much of an excuse for Pryor, who publicly apologized to his teammates and fans last week.After his 1,000-yard season in 2016, Pryor has tremendously underwhelmed on his one-year, $6 million deal.Pryor had no catches with one target in his worst game of an already disappointing season.
FC Barcelona: Marc-Andr ter Stegen rettet schwache Katalanen in Bilbao:::::Am Samstagabend lieferten sich Athletic Bilbao und der FC Barcelona einen offenen Schlagabtausch, bei dem sich die Gste aus Katalonien mit 2:0 durchsetzen konnten.Groen Anteil an diesem Erfolg hatte Torhter Marc-Andr ter Stegen, der mit zahlreichen Paraden Gegentreffer verhinderte.Mit dem neunten Sieg im zehnten Ligaspiel untermauerte der FCB die Tabellenfhrung.In den ersten 20 Spielminuten musste der deutsche Nationalspieler gleich zweimal sein ganzes Knnen aufbieten, um einen Rckstand zu verhindern.Bilbaos Angreifer Aritz Aduriz scheiterte zunchst mit einem gefhrlichen Kopfball am 25-jhrigen Schlussmann.Nur wenige Augenblicke spter tauchte der Mittelstrmer frei vor ter Stegen auf, hatte allerdings erneut das Nachsehen.Lionel Messi brachte die Katalanen nach 36 Spielminuten in Front.Im zweiten Spielabschnitt war Bilbao um eine Antwort bemht und spielte druckvoll nach vorne.Nach einer knappen Stunde hatte Bara Glck, dass Raul Garcia mit einem Kopfball nur die Latte traf.In der Schlussphase der Partie wurde das Privatduell zwischen ter Stegen und Aduriz fortgefhrt.Der Angreifer konnte den Schlussmann der Katalanen weder per Schuss noch per Kopfball berwinden.In der Nachspielzeit sorgte Paulinho mit einem Abstauber zum 2:0 fr die Entscheidung.We won 3 important points against a very strong Bilbao team.One for all - all for one!#DesireToWin #ForaBara pic.twitter.com/Ubt9VBZGh6 Marc ter Stegen (@mterstegen1) October 28, 2017 "Wir haben drei wichtige Punkte gegen ein sehr starkes Bilbao gewonnen.Einer fr alle - alle fr einen!", twitterte der Ex-Gladbacher."Fr mich ist es wichtig, immer 100 Prozent zu geben und das habe ich heute gemacht", erklrte der Nationalspieler nach der Partie."Wir mssen uns verbessern.Andernfalls werden wir es in den nchsten Wochen sehr schwer haben."Ein Sonderlob erhielt der Torhter von Sergio Busquets."Er hat heute alles gehalten und wir haben wegen ihm gewonnen", betonte der defensive Mittelfeldspieler.Ter Stegen stellte am Samstagabend zudem einen neuen Rekord auf.An den ersten zehn Spieltagen musste der 25-Jhrige nur drei Gegentreffer hinnehmen.Noch nie zuvor hatte Bara zu diesem Zeitpunkt so wenige Gegentore auf dem Konto.

Fan-rger in Gladbach: Geschmackloses Plakat gegen Hopp sorgt fr Diskussion:::::Beim Auswrtsspiel in Hoffenheim sorgten einige Teile der mitgereisten Fans von Borussia Mnchengladbach mit einem aufgehngten Banner fr Emprung.Nach dem Spiel zeigten sich die Verantwortlichen der Borussia verrgert ber das Verhalten der eigenen Anhnger und entschuldigten sich bei 1899 Hoffenheim.Seit dem Aufstieg in die erste Fuball-Bundesliga ist die TSG 1899 Hoffenheim immer wieder Opfer von Anfeindungen gegnerischer Mannschaften.Besonders Klub-Mzen und SAP-Mitbegrnder Dietmar Hopp steht oftmals im Zentrum der Kritik.Grund dafr ist das langjhrige Engagement Hopps, der der TSG in der Vergangenheit immer wieder Geld zur Verfgung stellte und seit 2015 die Mehrheit im Verein besitzt.Auch beim gestrigen Heimspiel von 1899 Hoffenheim gegen Borussia Mnchengladbach (1:3) wurden der Verein und Dietmar Hopp mit einem Banner der mitgereisten Gstefans beleidigt.Der Schriftzug "Und ihr?Huren eines Fuballmrders!"verunglimpfte die in den Augen von Borussia Trainer Dieter Hecking "schne" Choreo.Die Verantwortlichen beider Vereine zeigten sich nach dem Spiel ob des geschmacklosen Banners emprt."Wir distanzieren uns als Verein ganz klar von diesem Verhalten", sagte Stephan Schippers, Geschftsfhrer von Borussia Mnchengladbach, laut Welt.Bei 1899 Hoffenheim habe man sich am Tag nach dem Spiel entschuldigt.Geschftsfhrer Stephan Schippers uert sich zum beleidigenden Banner im VfL-Fanblock in Hoffenheim.#TSGBMG pic.twitter.com/Ezqot7rdtm Borussia (@borussia) October 29, 2017 Max Eberl schloss sich Schippers Worten an.Man wolle "nichts mit Leuten zu tun haben, die Hass schren", so der Sportdirektor.Borussia Mnchengladbach sei "ein Verein, der Toleranz lebt und einfordert."Es sei schade, dass man sich fr Teile der Fans entschuldigen msse.Sportdirektor Max Eberl zum beleidigenden Banner im Gladbacher Fanblock in Hoffenheim.#TSGBMG pic.twitter.com/JUEWXIH35h Borussia (@borussia) October 29, 2017 Auf Seiten der TSG Hoffenheim machte sich vor allem Ratlosigkeit breit."Ich berleg ja auch oft: Was ist die richtige Herangehensweise?", fragte sich Sportdirektor Alexander Rosen.Schriftzge wie diese seien "nicht zu ertragen" und "verabscheuungswrdig".Allerdings rumte der 38-Jhrige ein, nicht zu wissen "was der Ansatz ist".Hansi Flick, seit diesem Jahr Geschftsfhrer in Hoffenheim, hoffe darauf, dass "der DFB und die DFL alles unternehmen", um solche Aktionen "zu unterbinden und drastisch zu sanktionieren".Beistand erhielt der Verein auch von Joachim Lw.Der Bundestrainer bezeichnete das Banner als "absolut beschmend und unwrdig".Hopp sei "mit ganzem Herzen" fr 1899 Hoffenheim da und habe "viele Dinge in sozialen Bereichen getan".Simon Hofmann/GettyImages In der Vergangenheit war Dietmar Hopp immer wieder Opfer verbaler Attacken Es war nicht das erste Banner, das gegen Dietmar Hopp gerichtet war.Vor gut einem halben Jahr richteten Fans des 1.FC Kln mit einem Banner ebenfalls beleidigende Worte in Richtung des Mzen, zustzlich wurden Schmhgesnge gegen den 77-Jhrigen laut.Auch in der Aufstiegssaison 2008 sorgte ein Plakat gegen den Unternehmer fr Aufsehen.Anhnger von Borussia Dortmund skizzierten damals das Gesicht Hopps in einem Fadenkreuz.Darunter war die Aufschrift "Hasta la vista, Hopp" zu lesen.

Review | Nach frhem Platzverweis -Stuttgart bezwingt Freiburg mit 3:0:::::Zum Abschluss des zehnten Bundesligaspieltages trafen sich am Sonntagabend der VfB Stuttgart und der SC Freiburg.Nach einem frhen Platzverweis fr die Breisgauer hatten die Schwaben vor allem in der ersten Halbzeit leichtes Spiel und fuhren letztendlich einen souvernen 3:0-Heimsieg gegen dezimierte Gste ein.Der VfB Stuttgart schaffte den Sprung ins sichere Tabellenmittelfeld, whrend die Breisgauer weiterhin mit 8 Punkten auf dem 15.Platz rangieren.VfB Stuttgart - SC Freiburg Tore: 1:0 Ginczek (38.), 2:0 Pavard (45.+4), 3:0 Terodde (82.)Zuschauer: 58.872 Mit einem 3:0-Erfolg konnte die Elf von Hannes Wolf auch ihr zweites Pflichtspiel in Folge erfolgreich bestreiten.Der SC Freiburg ist nach der Schlappe nun in einer kleinen Krise und kommt im Tableau nicht von der Stelle.Sync wird in den frhzeitigen Feierabend geschickt Nach einem anfnglichen ruhigen Abtasten der beiden Mannschaften kam es in der 10.Spielminute zum ersten und wohl auch spielentscheidenden Platzverweis, als Schiedsrichter Tobias Stieler den Video-Assistenten bentigte.Freiburgs Caglar Sync spielte drei Meter vor dem Strafraum der Breisburger als letzter Mann den Ball mit der Hand und sah folgerichtig den roten Karton.Der anschlieende Freisto brachte jedoch nichts ein.Rund um die 22.Spielminute kam es dann innerhalb kurzer Zeit zweimal zum Duell zwischen Stuttgarts Akolo und dem Freiburger Schlussmann Schwolow, das der Keeper fr sich entscheiden konnte.Zunchst lenkte Schwolow nmlich einen Gewaltschuss von Akolo an die Latte und entschrfte zwei Minuten spter einen gefhrlichen Kopfballaufsetzer.Ginczek erlst Stuttgart Stuttgart bestimmte in der Folge das Spiel und kam immer hufiger zu gefhrlichen Torraum-Szenen.So wartete man bis zur 38.Minute, bis die Fans der Schwaben das erste Mal jubeln durften.Eine zcan-Flanke aus linker Position vollendete Daniel Ginczek zum 1:0-Fhrungstreffer.Kurz vor der Pause dann der nchste Nackenschlag fr die Streich-Elf, als Benjamin Pavard, wie einst Uwe Seeler, einen Freisto aus halblinker Positon per Kopfball in die rechte Torwartecke verlngerte (45.+4).Ideenloser VfB spielt die Uhr runter Der VfB Stuttgart lie es im Vergleich zum ersten Durchgang man hatte phasenweise 75 Prozent Ballbesitz nach dem Pausentee deutlich ruhiger angehen.So kam man selber nicht vors Freiburger Tor, musste sich hinten jedoch weiterhin nicht frchten, weil die Breisgauer in Unterzahl kein Mittel fanden Torgefahr zu erzeugen.Das Spiel pltscherte ohne nennenswerte Torraum-Szenen in der Folge vor sich her und so dauerte es bis in die 74.Minute, bis der Freiburger Ryan Kent die beste Mglichkeit seiner Mannschaft vergab, als er das Leder aus spitzem Winkel ber den Kasten von Zieler jagte.Terodde besiegelt Freiburger Niederlage In der 82.Minute setzte dann Simon Terodde den Schlusspunkt der Partie, als man dem Sportclub an diesem Abend zum dritten Mal einschenkte.Einen Stuttgarter Angriff der im zweiten Durchgang Seltenheitswert hatte vollendete der Strmer, als er Schwolow per Beinschuss bezwang.Am kommenden Samstagnachmittag (15:30 Uhr) muss der VfB Stuttgart in Hamburg ran, whrend die Elf von Chefcoach Christian Streich zur selben Zeit Schalke 04 empfngt.
Acht Punkte Rckstand auf Barca: Real Madrid bangt nach der Girona-Blamage um die Meisterschaft:::::Es ist der vielleicht grte Erfolg in der Vereinsgeschichte des FC Girona: Der LaLiga-Aufsteiger gewann am Sonntagnachmittag mit 2:1 gegen den amtierenden Meister und Champions-League-Sieger Real Madrid.Die Startruppe von Trainer Zinedine Zidane bot ber 90 Minuten eine uninspirierte Vorstellung und hat nun bereits auch Punkte Rckstand auf den Tabellenfhrer und groen Rivalen FC Barcelona.Dennoch glaubt der Coach im Anschluss an die Blamage gegen den katalanischen Klub auch weiterhin an den mglichen Titelgewinn.Fr Titelverteidiger Real Madrid war die 1:2-Niederlage beim FC Girona nach zehn Spieltagen bereits die vierte nicht gewonnene Partie.In der laufenden Saison stehen die "Kniglichen" nun bereits acht Zhler hinter Tabellenfhrer FC Barcelona, der sein Spiel gegen Athletic Bilbao mit 2:0 gewann.Trotz der peinlichen Pleite gegen den Katalonien-Klub zeigte sich Chefcoach Zinedine Zidane laut Real Total nach Abpfiff kmpferisch und betonte, dass auch weiterhin alles drin sei im Kampf um den Meistertitel."Wir haben hier drei Punkte verloren und sind jetzt acht Punkte in Rckstand.Es wird sich dadurch aber nichts verndern.Wir wissen, dass wir bessere Tage haben und die Rivalen ebenfalls Punkte verlieren werden.Wir knnen das aufholen.Was mich besorgt, sind nur diese drei verlorenen Punkten.Oder, dass wir die Partie nicht entschieden haben.Wir hatten die Mglichkeiten dazu.Die Liga ist noch sehr lang", so der Franzose.JOSEP LAGO/GettyImages Real-Strmer Karim Benzema konnte gegen den Aufsteiger kein Tor erzielen Als Grund fr die historische Pleite beim Aufsteiger nannte der ehemalige Weltfuballer vor allem die fehlende Konzentration seiner Mannschaft."Dass wir schlecht gespielt haben, finde ich nicht.Die Anstrengung war bei allen Spielern vorhanden.Es geht mehr um die Konzentration, das rgert mich. Wir haben es nicht geschafft, die drei Punkte zu holen und nicht gut verteidigt.Wenn man zur Halbzeit 1:0 fhrt, muss man wissen, dass der Gegner dir in der zweiten Halbzeit Schaden anrichten kann.Man muss konzentriert sein.Wenn du das bist, ist es fr den Gegner schwerer.Das hat uns etwas gefehlt."Kein Blatt vor den Mund nahm derweil Reals Mittelfeld-Abrume Casemiro, der von einem schlechten Auftritt sprach."In der zweiten Halbzeit haben wir nicht gut gespielt.Wir haben keine Chancen mehr kreiert und sehr gelitten.So sind uns die drei Punkte entglitten.Es gibt keine Entschuldigung.Wir brauchen jetzt auch berhaupt nicht danach zu suchen.Sie haben einfach ein Tor mehr erzielt und besser gespielt als wir.Wir mssen ihnen dazu gratulieren und uns an unsere eigene Nase greifen, weil wir nicht so viele Chancen herausgespielt haben wie normalerweise."Alex Caparros/GettyImages Glaubt trotz Niederlage weiter an den Titel: Real-Coach Zinedine Zidane Fr Mittelfeldstar Isco sei die Meisterschaft trotz der Niederlage und dem bereits groen Rckstand auf die Tabellenspitze noch lngst nicht verloren - dennoch forderte er eine klare Leistungssteigerung von sich und der Mannschaft."Die Saison ist noch lang.Man sollte Real Madrid niemals abschreiben oder fr tot erklren.Es ist aber klar, dass wir keine Punkte mehr liegen lassen drfen.Wir mssen jetzt zeigen, dass wir eine Mannschaft sind, die dazu fhig ist, wieder gemeinsam aufzustehen und den Spie umzudrehen.Wir knnen nicht so weitermachen wie bisher."hnlich uerte sich auch Real-Urgestein Nacho Fernandez, der an die eigene Ehre appellierte."Acht Punkte sind natrlich sehr viel.Wir sind beunruhigt.Aber wir haben Ehre und Stolz und wissen, dass wir Real Madrid sind.Wir drfen nicht den Glauben an uns verlieren.Die Saison ist noch lang."Real Madrid steht nach dem 1:2 beim FC Girona nach zehn Spieltagen nur auf einem enttuschenden dritten Tabellenplatz und hat bereits acht Zhler Rckstand auf Spitzenreiter FC Barcelona.Auf den Tabellenzweiten FC Valencia betrgt der Rckstand ebenfalls bereits vier Punkte.
"Der Schmarn muss weg": Freiburg wettert gegen Videobeweis und Sync-Rot:::::Der SC Freiburg verliert auch dank einer hchst diskutablen frhen roten Karte fr Innenverteidiger Caglar Sync mit 3:0 beim VfB Stuttgart und ist mit acht Punkten und Tabellenplatz 15 sptestens jetzt im Abstiegskampf der Bundesliga angekommen.Nach Abpfiff der Partie beklagten und echauffierten sich die Freiburger vor allem ber die Entscheidung zur roten Karte durch den Videobeweis, die nach Ansicht der Breisgauer in keinem Fall gerechtfertigt war.Es war zweifelsohne die vorentscheidende Szene des Spiels: Schon in der zwlften Spielminute entschied Schiedsrichter Tobias Stieler unter Mithilfe des Videobeweises auf Rot fr Freiburgs Innenverteidiger Caglar Sync, nachdem dieser im Laufduell mit VfB-Strmer Daniel Ginzcek als letzter Mann den Ball mit der Hand gespielt hatte.Durchaus eine diskutable Entscheidung, da zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch keine klare Torchance fr die Stuttgarter vorlag.Alex Grimm/GettyImages Die Szene des Spiels: Freiburg-Verteidiger Caglar Sync im Laufduell mit VfB-Strmer Daniel Ginczek Die Freiburger Verantwortlichen zeigten sich im Anschluss an die Partie erbost ber die aus ihrer Sicht in negativem Sinne spielentscheidende Entscheidung und erhoben schwere Vorwrfe gegen Referee und Videobeweis."Die rote Karte ist ein Witz.So kann es nicht weiter gehen.Der Schmarrn muss weg", wetterte Strmer Florian Niederlechner laut BILD.Auch der Trainer des SC Freiburg Christian Streich uerte sich auf der Pressekonferenz nach dem Spiel mehr als eindeutig und zeigte kein Verstndnis fr den Platzverweis seines trkischen Abwehrmannes."Ich dachte, der Videobeweis bringt Gerechtigkeit.Ich bin sprachlos.Ich verstehe nicht, was mit uns gemacht wird.Uns steht das Wasser bis zum Hals und man gibt in so einer Szene unserem Innenverteidiger die rote Karte.Es fehlt nur noch einer, der sagt, dass die Entscheidung richtig war", so der 52-Jhrige.Alex Grimm/GettyImages Hatte kein Verstndnis fr die rote Karte gegen seinen Innenverteidiger Sync: Freiburg-Coach Christian Streich Fr den Sportklub verlief die Partie in der Folge wenig erfreulich: Mit Toren von Daniel Ginczek und Benjamin Pavard stellte die Mannschaft von Trainer Hannes Wolf noch vor der Pause auf 2:0.In der zweiten Halbzeit lieen es die Schwaben dann etwas ruhiger angehen, lediglich Simon Terodde trug sich mit seinem 3:0 noch in die Torschtzenliste ein.Der VfB Stuttgart steht mit dem Sieg und zwlf Punkten vorerst im gesicherten Mittelfeld der Tabelle.Der SC Freiburg hingegen sieht sich durch die Pleite mit acht Zhlern nun auch tabellarisch im Abstiegskampf angekommen und belegt den 15.Tabellenplatz.

Florida coach search: Chip Kelly, Dan Mullen among names to watch:::::After a bizarre week, Jim McElwain is out at Florida, meaning one of the top 10 jobs in college football is open.The move means there could be as many as a half-dozen new head coaches in the SEC in 2018.Let's examine 10 candidates UF may consider.I think the Gators' options fit into three categories: the connected guys, the upstarts and the big names they might be able to woo.The Connected Guys with UF ties or local roots Dan Mullen, Mississippi State: He's an obvious choice.First-year Florida AD Scott Stricklin was his boss in Starkville.Mullen is a terrific offensive coach and that's something that should play well at a place that has been dreadful pretty much since Mullen left Gainesville almost a decade ago.He's 6744 at a program that is the toughest to win at in the SEC West, and the Bulldogs are 62 this year.It's hard to think he can do much better in Starkville than he already has, and that includes two top-20 finishes in his eight previous seasons.On two different occasions he tried to get the Miami job, but was unable.It's hard to think he'd pass if Florida came within reach.Word is former Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley wasn't a big fan of Mullen's, but would he try and stand in the way of him getting this job or still have the juice to do that?Willie Taggart, Oregon: A South Florida native who is like the third Harbaugh brother, Taggart won at Western Kentucky and then won at USF, leaving Charlie Strong a stocked program, and he's done a very nice job pumping life back into the Ducks in his first year in Eugene.He and his staff are recruiting exceptionally well.Would he actually be tempted to come back home after moving his young family across the country for just one year?I'm not sure he could say no.Scott Frost, UCF: A Chip Kelly protg, he's tearing it up in year two at UCF, which at 70 is the Group of Fives last unbeaten team.His name has come up often as a possible answer if his alma mater Nebraska pulls the plug on Mike Riley (I suspect it will).I'm told Frost might be more intrigued by a program with a stronger, much more fertile recruiting base than Nebraskasomewhere he can get tons of speed to fuel his system.A place like Florida would make a lot of sense.A question among some UF folks is whether the 42-year-old Frost is ready for this big stage.In retrospect, many realized, McElwain wasn't cut out for the job temperament-wise, and that figures to be something Florida will be mindful of in its search process.Charlie Strong, USF: Another former Urban Meyer assistant, Strong fizzled at Texas after three tumultuous seasons.He's doing well again in his first season at USF and is very well-connected around the state.He played a vital role in Meyer building a powerhouse at Florida, and Gator brass knows how well-respected he was inside the program.That should count for something.Does UF want someone more drawn to the spotlight than Strong?It just got rid of a guy who was not very comfortable under constant media scrutiny.Would it bring in another to replace him?The Big Names Justin Fuente, Virginia Tech: He's 175 with the Hokies after turning a downtrodden Memphis football program into a winner.That was impressive.Fuente is also not paid a fortune by FBS coaching standards, but has a very good situation in Blacksburg working for a well-regarded AD in Whit Babcock.He's got a good job now, but UF is an even better job.If you're the Gators, you've gotta kick the tires on this one.Gary Patterson, TCU: One of the best defensive coaches in football, Patterson has the Horned Frogs rolling.He's done wonders there and they've upgraded the facilities dramatically for him.They've even built him a statue.Still, it's no secret that he'd listen if it's a program that he felt gave him a much better chance at winning national titles.Kevin Sumlin, Texas A&M: His rsum and experience is better than most of the guys on this list.He's likely to be looking for another job this winter.He's proven he can recruit very well in the SEC against anyone.He's 4924, has never done worse than 85 at A&M and did lead the Aggies to their first top-five finish in over 50 years.Chip Kelly: The biggest free-agent name in coaching.Kelly is as sharp and innovative as any offensive mind in football.His offense would be scary with access to the speed you can recruit at Florida.At Oregon, he went 467 in four seasons and won three Pac-12 titles before leaving for the NFL.Would he want it?The hunch here is he'd be tempted.As for the fit, UF under Foley balked at pursuing Rich Rodriguez a few years ago due to him having some NCAA issues in his past, and Kelly had a show-cause.Will that matter to the new Gators regime?We'll see.The Upstarts Matt Campbell, Iowa State: He's making a big run at national coach of the year honors, as the Cyclones are 20 against top-five teams this year.The Ohio native is longer on substance than style.He comes from the Mount Union tree and figures to also get consideration from Tennessee, among others.Mike Norvell, Memphis: A Todd Graham disciple, Norvell is 156 in two seasons after taking over for Fuente.He's a rising star, but at 36 he's still very young, and there probably will be some concern about whether he's ready to make such a big jump now.
Jets vs Falcons: Kid in Batman costume runs on the field:::::The Jets got some help from an unexpected source during Sunday's game against the Falcons at MetLife Stadium.During the second quarter, with New York leading 17-10, a young fan in a Batman costume stormed the field.It's unclear whether Bane had warned the caped crusader about a potential plan to destroy the stadium and hold the city hostage with a bomb, but it seems like the young Bruce Wayne kept everyone safe from any potential danger.If it wasn't a ploy from Bane, it's possible the Dark Knight was searching for Rachel considering how he was running around.[h/t NESN]
Eric Reid and Malcolm Jenkins on Kaepernick, Proposed NFL Meeting:::::PHILADELPHIA Organizing a coalition of players who are lobbying the NFL to aid them in social justice reform and hear their personal experiences about race in America has not been easy.In a quiet moment on Sunday after the Eagles defeated the 49ers 33-10, Philadelphia safety Malcolm Jenkins did his best to explain the weight of those expectations.The biggest thing is trying to make sure guys feel like theyre a part of it; peoples voices are being heard, Jenkins told The MMQB.Theres a lot of moving parts obviously, but I think players have done a good job of communicating.I think weve done a good job keeping our messaging the same, and thats been over the course of a year and a half.Jenkins, who again raised his fist during the anthem, was speaking hours after the posting of a Slate story suggesting that he was keeping former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick out of a proposed meeting with ownership and league officials that was supposed to take place here on Monday.Jenkins said the league declined or postponed the Monday meeting and would not comment to reporters specifically on the allegations in the Slate story.The piece features emails from Kaepernicks legal team asking Jenkins to confirm that Kaepernick was formally invited to the event.The NFL, when reached for comment, said the meeting wasnt going to work out logistically, but that the league is looking forward to another opportunity to speak with players.Asked if the goal is to ultimately get the player who started these protests last year into a meeting with team owners and the commissioner, Jenkins told me: Yeah, I mean, thats never been off the agenda.Jenkins and another key figure in the coalition, 49ers safety Eric Reid, maintained a unified front on Sunday, though their comments reflected just how complex the situation has become.Jenkins feels that the players are more organized than ever before, texting on off days, working in the community and staying on message.Reid simply wants that progress to include Kaepernick.I think theres some frustration on Colins end because he wasnt invited to the meeting, Reid told me.I think its just a lack of communication, and I think that theres people in the NFL who dont want him there.I dont think there are any players who dont want him thereI think its just the NFL that doesnt want him there.Reid, who added that he thought Jenkins was doing an amazing job, said the lines of communication, both player-to-player and player-to-league, need to get better.The way this has been established, Malcolm has been the point of contact with the NFL as it relates to these meetings, Reid said.I dont know how that came to be, but thats what it is so far.Ive been trying to get in touch with people from the NFL, cant do it.Colins been trying to get in touch with people from the NFL, cant do it.For some reason they only want to talk to Malcolm.Thats not a problem, but Colin and I started this protest, and we feel we should be the point or, if not, more heavily involved in the communication.Kaepernick, who first spoke publicly about sitting for the national anthem in August 2016, has been silent since his exit from the NFL in March.He started this protest, so all of us are passionate about what were doing but Colin has to have a voice in this, said Reid, who knelt during the anthem on Sunday, as he has done since last season.I dont think theres anybody who doesnt want him to be there.In front of assembled reporters Sunday, Reid didnt flinch at a question about potential discord among the players.He pointed a finger back at the NFL and sounded more confident than ever that Kaepernick would eventually be heard.I think, to keep it frank, the NFL wants the protests to end.Its bad for their business.But I think its ridiculous that they dont want Colin being there, being as hes the first one to start protesting, so if we have to force him into that room thats what well do.But it has to be under the right circumstances, Reid said.We have to set a meeting, and the right people have to be here.I dont think hes going to fly to Philadelphia if no one is going to be at the meeting.Reid doubled down on that comment as he was walking toward the bus.I dont know if theyre intimidated by Colin or if they just feel like this would be easier to get done if Colin wasnt present, Reid told The MMQB.But like I said, were going to make sure Colin is there.The next official meeting we have, were going to make sure Colin is in the room.Both Reid and Jenkins left Lincoln Financial Field on Sunday with the best of intentions.Jenkins said he was hoping to speak with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell Sunday nighthe says he has a line of communication directly to the commissionerand that another sit-down would be coming soon.Both were informed by reporters that, while they were getting changed and conducting post-game interviews, a majority of the Houston Texans knelt before Sundays game against the Seahawks in protest of recent comments made by owner Bob McNair.In both of their minds, it was tangible progress.Well, hopefully they continue that, Jenkins said.Hopefully that pushes the pace a little bit.Thats awesome, Reid said.That is awesome.SUBSCRIBE TO THE MMQB NEWSLETTER.Get The Morning Huddle delivered to your inbox first thing each

Jim McElwain out at Florida: Why Gators, coach parted ways:::::GAINESVILLE, Fla.They hadnt even signed the buyout agreement yet, but Florida officials and Jim McElwain had gone far enough down a bad road by Sunday afternoon that they agreed McElwain wouldnt spend another day as the Gators head coach.A day after a 427 loss to Georgia that probably came after the real final straw, the only coach in SEC history to win division titles in his first two seasons would not finish his third at Florida.So how did this happen?It wasnt only because the Gators lost their last three games.It wasnt only because a coach hired to fix a struggling offense couldnt develop a reliable starting quarterback by year three.It wasnt only because of blowout losses to Florida State and Alabama to end McElwains first two seasons.It wasnt only because of an odd press conference last week.It was an amalgam of factors that all swirled into one giant ball of mess in the past six days, and suddenly there was only one plausible move: Fire McElwain and make defensive coordinator Randy Shannon the interim coach for the remainder of the season.On a day when everything should have been sunshine and lollipops, one of the first major cracks in the relationship between McElwain and Floridas administration formed.McElwains Florida team had just whipped Iowa 303 in the Outback Bowl on Jan. 2, and Orlando Sentinel columnist Mike Bianchi served up an easy question about how much positivity the win might inject into the program.The answer started off fine Weve got a lot of really good recruits that are excited to be Gators, and thats a good thing, McElwain said.We had a heck of a year.Two straight SEC East championships, new facilities.Then came the statement that, had it been uttered on a sitcom in the 80s, would have been followed by a record scratch Well look for the commitment that we get from the administration moving forward, see where thats at, McElwain said.When McElwain said this, Florida athletic director Scott Stricklinwho had been on the job about two months at the timewas already working on a contract extension for the coach that would be announced a few months later.This is how some people high in the Florida athletic department viewed McElwains sentiment.Heres a guy who has heard the word Yes more than Steve Spurrier, Ron Zook, Urban Meyer and Will Muschamp combined, who is about to get more money despite a second year with an offense ranked in the 100s, and hes questioning the administrations commitment?Do not be fooled into thinking that one bizarre week turned McElwain from two-time SEC East champion into fired two-time SEC East champion.The implosion at Florida was at least a year in the making.The above incident is one of several that erased the kind of benefit of the doubt the Gators exercised when retaining Will Muschamp after he went 48 in 2013.But make no mistake, last week hastened an exit that might not have happened until next year.This was more than just wins and losses, Stricklin said Sunday night, and I'll leave it at that."The timeline accelerated last Monday when McElwain claimed to have received death threats and then declined to elaborate when asked by Florida officials for more information.This caused Florida administrators to release a statement saying that McElwain refused to provide additional details.They did not have to release that nugget to the public, and they did not do it lightly.That put the beef out in the open.No longer could the sides hide behind coded quotes and words left unsaid.The statement also boxed in both parties.Once it went out into the ether, the relationship was basically unsalvageable.All that remained was a 427 loss to Georgia on Saturday in Jacksonville to seal the deal.At the end of the day, we were brought here to win.And we havent done it, McElwain said at a postgame press conference that sounded more like a post-firing press conference.My concern isnt about my job.My concern is about these players and our staff.Ultimately, McElwain was let go for (mostly) football reasons.But he was let go this quickly because he failed to endear himself to the people he worked with and for.Florida coaches who win SEC and national titles dont have to endear themselves to their co-workers.Coaches who claim their dog could run the offense and then fail to score an offensive touchdown in two tries against a hated rival (Florida State) do need to curry some favor.McElwain elected not to.I know what I was brought here to do.We havent been good on offense.I get it.Weve won a few games, but we havent won enough.We havent won a championship.Thats real.Thats life.That is this business.And I take full responsibility for all of it.The Georgia loss encapsulated McElwains issues on the football side and also offered another hint as to why the Gators accelerated this process.Feleipe Franks, the highest-rated quarterback McElwain recruited, completed 7 of 19 passes for 30 yards.Thats 1.6 yards per attempt.Unless Franks blossoms this offseason under a new coach, Gators still dont have a quarterback of the future.Floridas defense, which kept the Gators afloat for the bulk of 2015 and 16 while still loaded with Muschamp recruits, got bulldozed by the Bulldogs.DBU is DB-useless when the opponent averages 8.3 yards a carry.Florida State and Alabama exposed Floridas talent deficit in McElwains first year.In year three, the Gators looked just as far behind when playing a team with championship talent.It looks even worse for Florida that Georgia coach Kirby Smart, hired a year later than McElwain and a defensive coach rather than an offensive guru, identified and landed his quarterback of the future immediately.Smart, like McElwain a former Alabama coordinator, flipped Jake Fromm, a Warner Robins, Ga., native who had been committed to Alabama, a few months after getting the job.Fromm took over after former five-star recruit Jacob Eason hurt his knee in Georgias season opener.Eason is back, but the job is Fromms.Georgia has at least two quarterbacks who could start at Florida now, and top-ranked recruit Justin Fields is on the way.McElwain and company were excited to welcome Californian Matt Corral for next year, but the timing of Corrals commitment this summer was telling.It came just after Fields crossed Florida off his list.Smart already was drinking McElwains milkshake on the recruiting trail.Now hes also doing it on the field.And since Smart appears to be building a monster in Athens, Floridaand Tennessee, for that mattermust move to upgrade before they get left in the dust by the program that could take over as king of the SEC after Alabamas Nick Saban retires.* *Saban turns 66 on Tuesday.He looks like hes in his 40s.Its quite possible he coaches 15 more years and this predicted Georgia ascension never happens.But Saban might tire of beating everyone else in the league eventually.McElwain was surprised when he got to Florida that the Gators lagged so far behind in facilities.They didnt have an indoor practice facility.(They got one last year.)Unlike most of their peers, their day-to-day locker room facilities are under an end zone in the stadium rather than in a separate football operations building.Stricklin has created a master plan to build such a facility, but that will take time and money and the construction of a new baseball stadiumbecause the new football building will have to go where the reigning College World Series champs currently play.This shouldnt matter that much.Floridas weight room and locker room are perfectly nice, but everyone else spent the money they werent allowed to give to the players and Florida saved it.The following jobs could be open by the end of next month: Florida Nebraska Tennessee Texas A&M Of that group, Floridas facilities would rank last.But Floridas access to nearby talent is better than Nebraska and Tennessee and as good or better than Texas A&M.Thats the equalizer to the facilities issue.Despite not having the most palatial digs, the Gators should still be able to sign quality players because theyre closer to the homes of those players.Meyer complained about the facilities, but he also upgraded the roster and won two national titles.McElwain might have coasted for another year based on the goodwill the two SEC East titles bought him.But Floridas fan base realized even before Floridas administration that those two titles were the result of a weak division.The end-of-season meetings with Florida State and Alabama showed exactly how far the Gators really were from competing with the kind of programs Florida fans believe should be the Gators peers.Florida State is down this year, and there will be no end-of-season meeting with Alabama, but the Georgia loss served the same purpose.The Gators arent good enough.Had McElwain handled things differently, he might have gotten another year to try to make them better.Instead, someone else will try.The next coach will face the same expectations that so rankled McElwain.But that is life at a program less than 10 years removed from its last national title that sits in the middle of the state that has produced more current NFL players than any other.The next coach had better embrace those expectations, or theyll also swallow him whole.
Fantasy Football Week 9 Waiver Wire:::::Weve now gone two straight weeks without any major injuries to fantasy football stars.Sure, one can argue that all of the good players are already injured.But thats not much fun, so were going to celebrate the lack of serious injuries by giving you three players to target on waiver wires this week.Robby Anderson, WR, Jets Anderson had the best game of his young career in Week 8, catching all six of his targets for 104 yards and a touchdown.Anderson has now turned in three straight useful games, pulling down 13 of 23 targets for 215 yards and two scores, amounting to 11.17 points per game in standard-scoring leagues, and 15.5 points per game in PPR formats.Anderson had an 80% snap rate coming into the week, and is going to be a top option in the Jets passing game all season.That passing game has been surprisingly effective this season, with Josh McCown playing his usual brand of low-ceiling, competent quarterback.Anderson is a field-stretcher who, at 6' 3", can be a real problem for defenses in the red zone.The Jets dont have their bye until Week 11, and that means Anderson will be on the WR3 radar the next two weeks.If youre looking at thin roster with six more teams going on bye next week, Anderson can help.The Jets host the Bills on Thursday night in Week 9.The matchup isnt great, but Anderson has done enough to warrant a waiver claim, with an eye on the rest of the season as much as on his short-term value.Alex Collins, RB, Ravens Collins was back in command of the Baltimore backfield in Week 8, running for 113 yards on 18 carries.This is an impossible backfield to project from week to week, but at some point the Ravens coaching staff is going to have to acknowledge the fact that Collins has been the teams most effective runner.He has rushed for at least 4.6 yards per carry in three of his last four games.The only game in which he came short of that number was also the lone contest over the last four weeks where Javorius Allen led the backfield.Despite Collinss exploits, he got just two more touches than Allen, and he was certainly helped along by the game script.The Ravens led by multiple scores the entire second half, and took a 200 lead into the fourth quarter.That brand of game is always going to play into Collinss hands, whereas one in which they trail will likely feature more Allen on the field.Still, with Collins giving the Ravens a real jolt on the ground, he needs to be owned in all fantasy formats.The Ravens will be on a long week in Week 9, taking on a Titans defense thats no better than average against the run.Juju Smith-Schuster, WR, Steelers Martavis Bryant is playing, talking and seemingly sulking his way out of Pittsburgh.Smith-Schuster is taking advantage, earning himself a bigger role in the offense in advance of the teams Week 9 game with the Lions.The rookie out of USC has 17 catches on 27 targets for 231 yards and three touchdowns on the season.He barely had a presence in the offense in the teams first two games, though he did manage to find the end zone in Week 2.He has averaged nearly five targets per game since then, and could be in line for more work outside the numbers with Bryant in the doghouse.If thats the case, hell likely have more opportunity to show what he can do deep down the field.The Steelers are on bye in Week 9, but Smith-Schuster will be back on the WR3 radar when they return to action in Week 10.
The Texans Kneel in Protest of McNairs Comments:::::SEATTLE As kickoff at CenturyLink Field drew closer, photographers staked out space on the visitors sideline, jockeying for the right angle and best position.This was not because a 3-3 football team was about to take the field.This was because this particular 3-3 football team was embroiled in a controversy of their owners making.And they were about to take the field.There was more interest in what the Texans players might do before kickoff than in the actual game on Sunday.A game that, its worth noting, featured two playoff-caliber teams, the Seahawks star-laden roster and the potential offensive rookie of the year in Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson.Even Michael Bennett, the Seahawks defensive end and chief political activist, wondered on Saturday what his opposition had planned.I want to know, he told The MMQB.There will probably be a lot more guys on that team protesting.It had been an odd week, even by the standards of the most political year in sports in decades.First there was the ESPN story that detailed the tension in meetings between owners and the NFL office over players sitting or kneeling for the anthem.Texans owner Bob McNair was quoted in that story as saying in one meeting that he didnt want the inmates running the prison.All hell predictably broke loose.McNair issued one of those sorry-to-anyone-I-offended non-apologies on Friday, then met with his team and released a second apology Saturday that attempted to clarify that by inmates he actually meant the league office and not the players.If anyone believed him, they remained silent.By then, star receiver DeAndre Hopkins and rookie running back DOnta Foreman had skipped Fridays practice, reportedly in response to what their owner said.Im not surprised, Bennett said.I think a lot of guys wanted to walk out, but [they] were the only ones brave enough to do it.On our team, definitely a lot more guys would have walked out and not showed up.Im actually surprised more [Texans] didnt [walk out].All Sunday morning, speculation swirled on Twitter as to what the Texans players would do.Some suggested they might rip the decals off their helmets.Others said they planned to kneel as a team, or not come out of the locker room altogether.There were even more extreme rumors that maybe they wouldnt play.Its one thing to say that Bennett said, trailing off.As 1 p.m. local time drew closer, the usual pregame machinations unfolded without incident.A drum troupe took the field, then the Seahawks cheerleaders went through their routine.Seattles punter, Jon Ryan, boomed practice punts between gyrating dancers.It was cold, gray and mistya typical Sunday in Seattleas photographers turned the Texans sideline into a mosh pit.At 12:53 p.m., Houstons players stood in the visitors tunnel near the south end zone.They bounced up and down and waited to be released onto the field.Most jogged onto the sideline, past the photographers bundled altogether, with tight end Ryan Griffin sprinting to the opposite end zone, where several service members stood, waiting to unfurl one of those field-width-sized American flags.The players knelt in the end zone, as if in prayer, and then ran back to the sideline, where they slapped fives, bumped fists and jumped up and down.At 12:56 p.m., the Seahawks ran from their own tunnel, as fireworks shot skyward from columns and the teams mascot, Blitz, looked for players he could chest bump.This was the rare instance where the home crowd focused more on the other sideline.Almost every seat was filled.The defense was introduced, and Bennett ran first out of the tunnel for the starters.He waved a white towel and stood near the entrance, hyping up his teammates, before taking his usual place on the bench for the anthem.He, too, looked across the field.Two minutes later, all the cameras pointed toward the Texans bench.The flag was unfurled on the north side of the field.Service men and women marched and the first notes of the anthem played.At that moment, the majority of the Texans, at least 40 players, knelt on their sideline.I counted 10 members of the team, mostly white players, who stood.Many of those who stood rested hands on kneeling teammates.The rest knelt together while cameras trained in on their faces and a national television audience looked on.Then the anthem ended and the game started and the Texans, no matter what kind of anger they felt for their owner, opened up with a dazzling 59-yard touchdown pass from Watson to wideout Will Fuller.By halftime the game was tied at 21 and living up to its purely football billing.The afternoon had returned to normal in this season that has been anything but typical.It was back to football, and yet football and everything around the game feels different now.It felt that way before McNair was quoted in that ESPN story, and it felt even more that way after his comments and apologies became international news.Bennett declined to say how many owners might feel the same way.I hope none, he said.But he knew that wasnt true.He knew that in the same ESPN story Redskins owner Dan Snyder was quoted as saying 96 percent of America wanted NFL players to stand for the anthem.Maybe 96 percent of Snyders America, Bennett said.He laughed, then turned serious.I was surprised [by the inmates comment], but then I wasnt surprised, he said.Some people think like that.They look at us like that.Its like you live in a world where people are in denial of racial tension.I just feel like its time to put that in context.This time were living in has a lot of people on edge right now.Theres racial tension going up and down.Question or comment?Email us at talkback@themmqb.com.

Motor racing - Hamilton takes fourth title despite collision:::::MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - An ecstatic Lewis Hamilton became Britains first four-times Formula One world champion on Sunday after fighting back from last place following an opening-lap collision with arch-rival Sebastian Vettel at the Mexican Grand Prix.F1 - Formula 1 - Mexican Grand Prix 2017 - Mexico City, Mexico - October 29, 2017 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton celebrates after winning the World Championship REUTERS/Edgard Garrido In a race won by 20-year-old Dutch prodigy Max Verstappen, in a Red Bull, the 32-year-old Mercedes driver finished ninth to cement his place as his countrys most successful driver of all time.Vettel, the only man who could have delayed the seemingly inevitable, ended up fourth after starting on pole position and then dropping to 19th following a pitstop to replace a broken front wing.Hamilton has an unassailable lead of 56 points with two races, worth a total of 50, remaining in Brazil and Abu Dhabi.It doesnt feel real.Thats not the kind of race that you want but I never gave up.I kept going right to the end, said a jubilant Hamilton, the British flag proudly draped over his shoulders.He had raised both hands to his helmet as he took the chequered flag, with the crowd rising to applaud.Lewis has done a superb job all year and deserves to win the title, said Vettel.Congratulations to him.It is his day.Sundays race was both the best and worst of afternoons for the sports biggest star, who ended up sprinting down the pitlane chased by fans.A winner nine times this season, including five of the six before Mexico, ninth was his lowest placing of the campaign and he did it despite having a badly damaged car at a track where overtaking is difficult enough anyway.Hamiltons team mate Valtteri Bottas finished second at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez with Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen third.AGGRESSIVE MOVE Vettel had needed to be in the top two to have any chance of taking the title fight down to Brazil in two weeks time but his already slim hopes seemed to have disappeared within seconds of the start.Verstappen, with nothing to lose and everything to gain from his front row position, seized the lead with an aggressive move through the opening right-left-right corners and the Red Bull bumping wheels with Vettel as he went through.Hamilton, starting in third place, tried to follow Verstappen but the Ferraris front wing sliced Hamiltons rear right tyre as they made contact at turn three.F1 - Formula 1 - Mexican Grand Prix 2017 - Mexico City, Mexico - October 29, 2017 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton celebrates after winning the World Championship REUTERS/Edgard Garrido Did he hit me deliberately?asked Hamilton over the radio, limping back to the pits and fully aware that Vettels only real hope of getting back into the reckoning would be if the Briton went out.Not sure, Lewis, his race engineer Peter Bonnington said in reply.It looked far from deliberate and stewards swiftly decided that no further investigation of the incident was necessary.Vettel pitted while Hamilton, who had started the day 66 points clear of his rival, had a longer stop while mechanics inspected his car for further damage.The incident robbed the crowd of the prospect of a real duel between the two contenders, who will both be four-times champions when next season starts, but they still provided thrills as they fought back.Slideshow (13 Images) HIGH FIVE Hamilton, who had a thrilling wheel-to-wheel tussle with former McLaren team mate Fernando Alonso in the latter stages that could have cost him dear, had hoped to celebrate by spraying the winners champagne from the top of the podium.Instead, there was the considerable consolation of being one of only five men -- Germanys Michael Schumacher, Argentinas Juan Manuel Fangio, Frances Alain Prost and Vettel -- to win four titles or more since the championship started in 1950.Prost and Vettel both have four, with the late Fangio on five and Schumacher seven.Hamiltons tally of titles took him above fellow-Briton Jackie Stewart and also his late Brazilian idol Ayrton Senna in the all-time lists.An unusual way to be world champion but you are world champion very simple.Nobody cares how you do it, said Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, himself a triple champion.Who cares?Its about the result, said team boss Toto Wolff, when asked how it had felt to see Hamilton lapped by Verstappen.He was lapped because he was crashed into.The victory was the third of Verstappens career and second of the season, cementing the youngsters position as the rising star of the sport.Frances Esteban Ocon was fifth for Force India, with his Mexican team mate Sergio Perez seventh and behind the Williams of Canadian rookie Lance Stroll.Danish driver Kevin Magnussen was eighth for Haas with Alonso taking the final point.
Leicester hand Puel winning start as Everton's woes continue:::::(Reuters) - Claude Puel made a winning start to his tenure as Leicester City manager after his side defeated Everton 2-0 at home in the Premier League on Sunday.Soccer Football - Premier League - Leicester City vs Everton - King Power Stadium, Leicester, Britain - October 29, 2017 Leicester City's Kasper Schmeichel makes a save Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff The hosts opened the scoring in the 18th minute when Jamie Vardy smashed in Riyad Mahrezs right wing cross.Their lead was doubled 11 minutes later when Everton defender Jonjoe Kenny sliced Demarai Grays left wing cross into his own net.The result compounded a miserable week for Everton, who had caretaker manager David Unsworth in charge following the sacking of Ronald Koeman last Monday.Everton remain 18th in the standings, having lost six of their 10 matches this season, while Leicester are up to 11th.I was impressed with my players, Puel said.It was a very good first half and there were good combinations between the players for the first goal.Puel made two changes to the Leicester team that beat Swansea City last weekend, replacing Shinji Okazaki and Marc Albrighton with Ben Chilwell and Gray, and the promotion of the latter in particular proved instrumental.Soccer Football - Premier League - Leicester City vs Everton - King Power Stadium, Leicester, Britain - October 29, 2017 Everton caretaker manager David Unsworth with Jonjoe Kenny at the end of the match REUTERS/Darren Staples The 21-year-old winger was largely to thank for the opening goal.He carried the ball out of defence and through midfield in a brilliant solo run before feeding Mahrez, whose cross landed perfectly at the feet of the on-rushing Vardy.Gray then switched to the left wing for the second goal, tormenting the Everton defence with his slick footwork and then swinging in a cross that Kenny badly miscued.Slideshow (4 Images) Everton could have been given a route back into the game when Christian Fuchs collided with Aaron Lennon inside the box three minutes later, but referee Andre Marriner did not award a penalty.Kevin Mirallas went close for Everton with two strikes from outside the box in quick succession just before half-time, and Unsworths side continued to improve and put pressure on Leicester after the break.But while they had 16 shots to Leicesters nine and 59 per cent of possession, they were unable to create clear-cut chances and fell to their third defeat of the week.Unsworth said: The second half was much better.We gave them a two-goal start - in the first half we didnt perform.Our display was much better after the break.
Federer outlasts Del Potro for eighth Basel title:::::BASEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - Roger Federer displayed some rare flashes of temper as he battled past Argentinas Juan Martin del Potro 6-7(5) 6-4 6-3 for an eighth Swiss Indoors title in front of a partisan Basel crowd on Sunday.Tennis - ATP 500 - Swiss Indoors Basel - Final - St. Jakobshalle, Basel, Switzerland - October 29, 2017 - Roger Federer of Switzerland celebrates with the cup after defeating Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina.REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann The 36-year-old local favourite, beaten by Del Potro in consecutive Basel finals in 2012 and 2013, was ragged at times and looked in danger of an unwanted hat-trick, but showed all his fighting qualities to turn the match around.Fourth seed Del Potro, making a late run to try and qualify for next months ATP World Tour Finals in London, broke serve in the first game of the decider but wilted as Federer stormed back to the delight of a raucous crowd inside the St Jakobshalle.World number two Federer charged into a 5-2 lead and while Del Potro delayed the end by holding serve, Federer would not be denied and racked up his 95th career title as Del Potro fired a backhand long under pressure.In edging past Ivan Lendls 94 Federer is now alone in second place on the all-time titles list which American great Jimmy Connors leads with 109.However, his chances of snatching the world number one ranking from Rafael Nadal before the end of the season are all but over as the Swiss pulled out of next weeks Paris Masters citing a back injury.Federer, who trails Nadal by 1,460 points in the rankings, has taken regular breaks during the season to rest his body and no doubt opted to skip the Paris tournament to prepare for next months ATP Finals in London.Tennis - ATP 500 - Swiss Indoors Basel - Final - St. Jakobshalle, Basel, Switzerland - October 29, 2017 - Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina and Roger Federer of Switzerland pose with the trophies after the final match.REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann Del Potro would have moved into the eighth and final qualifying spot for London had he claimed a third Basel title, but now must reach the semi-finals at least in the French capital to make it to the season-ending tournament.All the best for Paris and then Ill hopefully maybe see you in London, too, Federer said after an intense battle with the 29-year-old Argentine who fell just short of claiming a second successive title after winning in Stockholm.Slideshow (7 Images) Federer broke serve in the opening game but Del Potro hit back immediately when Federer netted a backhand.Del Potro struggled to hold serve and cracked at 4-4 under a flurry of Federer winners.Federer could not serve out the set though and was broken as Del Potro took it to a tiebreak.Federer went 3-0 up but lost six successive points.He saved two set points but Del Potro took the opener on his third chance -- leaving Federer flustered.The 19-times grand slam champion smashed his racket into the net at one point during the opening set, but it was Del Potros turn to lose his cool when he dropped serve at 4-5 in the second as the crowd roared Federer on.Del Potro took the opening game of the decider but looked fatigued as Federer found another gear to surge back.
Real suffer shock defeat to Liga minnows Girona in Catalonia:::::GIRONA (Reuters) - La Liga champions Real Madrid suffered a shock 2-1 defeat in their first ever league visit to Catalan side Girona on Sunday, conceding two goals in quick succession and falling eight points behind leaders Barcelona.Soccer Football - Liga Santander - Girona vs Real Madrid - Estadi Montilivi, Girona, Spain - October 29, 2017 Real Madrids Sergio Ramos looks dejected REUTERS/Juan Medina Spain midfielder Isco tapped in a rebounded shot from Cristiano Ronaldo to open the scoring in the 12th minute in Real Madrids first visit to Catalonia this season amid the worst political crisis in Spains 39 years of democracy.The home side struck the woodwork twice before the break but rallied in the second half and Uruguay international Christian Stuani fired them level in the 54th minute.Forward Portu then turned in the winning goal four minutes later to the delight of the 13,500 fans crammed into the Montilivi stadium.Stuani came within inches of scoring again midway through the second half but a one-goal advantage was enough to give Girona their third win in their first campaign in the top flight and inflict a second league defeat on Zinedine Zidanes side.Real are third in the standings on 20 points, four behind second-placed Valencia while unbeaten leaders Barca have 28.Real coach Zidane blamed his sides lack of concentration for both of the goals they conceded.We did well in the first half but football is about details and the first goal was from a throw in and we werent focused, he told a news conference.I dont think we played badly, we didnt lack intensity or effort, we just lost focused at the most important moments and thats why Im annoyed.Were eight points behind but it wont change anything, we can pick ourselves up, well have better days than this and our rivals are going to drop points.Soccer Football - Liga Santander - Girona vs Real Madrid - Estadi Montilivi, Girona, Spain - October 29, 2017 Real Madrids Cristiano Ronaldo looks dejected REUTERS/Albert Gea Although Real Madrid have many supporters in Catalonia, they are viewed as the club that is most representative of Spain and the arrival of the team bus at Montilivi was greeted with a smattering of boos and pro-Catalan independence flags.POLITICAL HEAT The political heat intensified two days before their visit when the regions ruling party declared independence from Spain and the central government responded by dissolving the Catalan parliament.Deposed Catalan president Carles Puigdemont is from Girona province and a Girona supporter.He was not present at the game but showed his delight at the result with a post on Twitter.Slideshow (10 Images) Gironas victory over one of the best teams in the world can be an example and a reference for many situations, he said.Despite the political undertones, the atmosphere was no more intimidating for Madrid than any other Liga ground and they were cheered on by hundreds of supporters who mixed with the home fans without any trouble.Pablo Maffeo, the Manchester City loanee who gained fame for his man-marking job on Lionel Messi, provided the first flash point of the game when his searching cross from the right wing pinged off the far post.The ball remained in play and Madrid surged up the other end where Ronaldo fired at Girona goalkeeper Yassine Bounou and Isco was ideally placed to tap in the rebound.Gironas fighting spirit could not be crushed, however, and they staged an incredible turnaround to record arguably the most significant win in their 87-year history.We fully deserved it, said Girona coach Pablo Machin.The fans have been behind us a long time, we promised wed let them enjoy La Liga and today was the best atmosphere.If youd said to me three years ago the fans would leave singing after beating Real Madrid Id have said you were crazy.

Wozniacki stands firm to claim WTA Finals title:::::SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Caroline Wozniackis cruise to the biggest win of her career turned into a desperate struggle before the Dane finally subdued Venus Williams 6-4 6-4 in the WTA Finals title showdown at an enthralled Singapore Indoor Stadium on Sunday.Tennis - WTA Tour Finals - Singapore Indoor Stadium, Singapore - October 29, 2017 Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki celebrates with the trophy after winning the final against USA's Venus Williams REUTERS/Edgar Su The 27-year-old former world number one entered the contest having lost to the evergreen Williams seven times in as many matches but the resilient Dane served and retrieved brilliantly to emerge with a deserved victory after 88 minutes.Wozniacki was flawless for an hour as she raced to a set and 5-0 lead but Williams is renowned for an insatiable desire to win and the 37-year-old reeled off four games in a row before her increasingly anxious opponent finally closed out the match.I felt like it was a little bit of an uphill battle, to be honest.I knew she was stepping it up, she had nothing to lose at that point, and she really went for it.Things were going in for her, Wozniacki told reporters.I just had to keep reminding myself that Im still up and Im the one who is leading here, and Im the one who can close out this match right now.The first three games were dominated by the server until the Dane began to find the corners of the court with her powerful backhand, fashioning the first break of the match with back-to-back winners off both flanks.Williams was trying to get to the net at every opportunity and came forward to good effect in the next game, with a vicious cross-court backhand enabling her to break back immediately on her way to levelling the score at 3-3.The American continued to be the aggressor but the Dane held on in the face of some brutal hitting and somehow forged her second break of the set with some exquisite deep groundstrokes to move within a game of taking the opener.Tennis - WTA Tour Finals - Singapore Indoor Stadium, Singapore - October 29, 2017 Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki and USA's Venus Williams celebrate with the trophy and runners up shield after the final REUTERS/Edgar Su GIFTED SET The American came roaring back once more, however, leaving the Dane looking on as a helpless spectator at a barrage of winners that put the high-class contest back on serve.After working so hard to stay in touch, Williams would have been deeply frustrated to gift her opponent the set when the Dane was handed the third break in a row as the wayward American sent a string of forehands wide, long and into the net.Slideshow (17 Images) Wozniacki had seized the momentum and with her variation, depth of shot and complete lack of errors preventing Williams from grabbing any sort of foothold in the contest, the flying Dane raced into a 5-0 lead in 11 second-set minutes.Needing to hold serve just to stay in the contest, Williams found her rhythm to prevent a dreaded bagel and then secured her first break of the second set with some solid play against an opponent who was showing the first signs of getting tight.Williams, meanwhile, now appeared relaxed and free, holding easily to heap more pressure on the Dane before stretching every muscle and sinew in her body to break once more in a thrilling ninth game to make it 5-4.The crowd wanted more but Wozniacki was not prepared to comply with their demands, breaking again to seal victory on her second match point with a backhand winner down the line and tossing her racket in the air as she celebrated a stunning win.Yeah, you know, she played really well the whole match.You know, I played well parts of the match and tried my best, Williams, who won the event in 2008, said.Wozniackis triumph was her second of the season in eight finals after she successfully defended her Pan Pacific Open title in Tokyo last month.The Dane will rise three places to world number three in Mondays rankings.
Liverpool back on the right path ahead of Maribor clash, says Mignolet:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Simon Mignolet has said Liverpool will go into their Champions League match at home to Maribor on Wednesday with their confidence restored thanks to Saturdays 3-0 win over Huddersfield Town in the Premier League.Soccer Football - Premier League - Liverpool vs Huddersfield Town - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - October 28, 2017 Liverpool's Simon Mignolet celebrates their second goal Action Images via Reuters/Craig Brough Goals from Daniel Sturridge, Roberto Firmino and Georginio Wijnaldum lifted Juergen Klopps team up to sixth in the standings, just six days after they suffered a 4-1 defeat away to Tottenham Hotspur.Goalkeeper Mignolet admitted morale had been damaged by the result at Wembley and said it was a relief to have bounced back against a Huddersfield team that had defeated Manchester United in their previous league game.Its good for the boys and I think today will give everybody a lift in confidence, which is what we needed after last week, Mignolet told the clubs official website (www.liverpoolfc.com).Everybody knew it wasnt good enough and we had to change and respond in the right manner, and I think weve done that.Liverpool are level on five points with Spartak Moscow in Group E in the Champions League, just one ahead of third-placed Sevilla.The Reds thrashed Slovenian minnows Maribor 7-0 in their previous encounter and are expected to dominate once again at Anfield.Their week will then be completed by a trip to West Ham United in the Premier League on Saturday, another match they will start as favourites.Wijnaldum, however, was reluctant to place unnecessary expectation on the two fixtures.I dont want to speak about big weeks because every week is a big week, the Dutch midfielder said.Every week you have to collect points and win games and deliver so for me every week is a big week, especially when you play for Liverpool.
Alli eager to make amends on Champions League return:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Dele Alli was a spectator when Tottenham Hotspur earned a 1-1 draw at Real Madrid earlier this month but after a frustrating wait he will get his first taste of Champions League action this season in Wednesdays return at Wembley.Soccer Football - Premier League - Manchester United vs Tottenham Hotspur - Old Trafford, Manchester, Britain - October 28, 2017 Tottenham's Dele Alli reacts REUTERS/Andrew Yates The attacking midfielders red card for a dreadful tackle in last seasons Europa League exit at the hands of Belgian side Gent made him ineligible for Tottenhams first three Champions League games this season.The north London club have done well without him, taking seven points from their first three Group H games and victory over Zinedine Zidanes Madrid on Wednesday would guarantee a last-16 spot with two games to spare.Alli will be desperate to make an impression after he appeared in all six of Tottenhams group games last season when they failed to emerge from the group after home defeats by Bayer Leverkusen and Monaco.His return will be a boost as Tottenham try to beat Madrid for the first time at the sixth attempt, although he said that they must learn quickly after a 1-0 Premier League defeat by Manchester United at the weekend stopped their recent momentum in its tracks.We dont just want to compete, we want to win and as a team, were frustrated, Alli, who wasted a golden chance against United shortly before the hosts grabbed a late winner, said.Weve got a huge game coming up in Real Madrid.Its important we learn from this, work on whats gone wrong and keep building as a team because were still in a fantastic position and weve been in good form.We cant let (the United defeat) knock us back.Tottenham are still sweating on the fitness of striker Harry Kane ahead of Wednesdays clash after a hamstring tweak meant he was unable to feature at Old Trafford.Kane has five goals already in the Champions League this season and his absence would be a bitter blow for Mauricio Pochettino as he seeks a first victory over Real as a manager, having lost all seven when he was in charge of Espanyol in La Liga.

French Open Winner Kidambi Srikanth Not Chasing World No.1 Ranking:::::Kidambi Srikanth might well be on course towards elusive World No.1 ranking but does not want to lose sleep over it.The eighth-seeded Indian defeated Japan's Kenta Nishimoto 21-14 21-13 in the finals to become the first Indian to clinch four titles in a season.His performance will see him jump higher in the ranking when the BWF ranking is released next week.When asked about the numero uno status, he said:"I don't know (if I will be number 1).Definitely, I will go up higher in the rankings but I am not sure where I will be.I haven't been pursuing it."Before Denmark and French titles, Srikanth had won back-to-back titles in Indonesia and Australia in June.Srikanth said that world No 1 Viktor Axelsen of Denmark is still way ahead of him in terms of points."I think there is a lot of difference between me and Viktor (Axelsen) for sure before Denmark Open.I don't think I will be number one, I might improve a rank or two.""It is good to be there definitely but I am not thinking about it now.I don't really have any tournament to defend anywhere, so I don't want to push myself for the ranking and just want to enjoy playing, that's it," he added.Talking about the last couple of weeks, Srikanth said: "I am just happy with the way I performed in the last couple of weeks.There were some close matches.I feel I was little lucky to pull out those matches, otherwise I am pleased how it went for me."With back-to-back titles at Denmark and France, Srikanth has sealed his place at the top of Destination Dubai rankings and would be a prime contender for the Super Series Final title in December.Srikanth said he has not yet given it a though how he will plan his schedule."Not really sure how I will go about the next tournaments, I have to go back and talk to my coach and decide what tournaments I will play before the Super Series finals," said the Indian, who had reached the finals at Singapore Open as well.Asked about his preparation for the match against his Japanese opponent, Srikanth said: "I think he (Nishimoto) has been playing really well throughout this week.He beat Lee Chong Wei, he came from qualifiers and he has beaten Andersen."He played really well against him, so I was expecting a tough match, so I am just satisfied the way I played.In the quarters and semi-final, I felt I really started off really slow, so I wanted to make a good start, start off a little better than what I did before."He is an attacking and aggressive player, so I didn't want to give him any chance and it worked out for me."The 25-year-old from Guntur played a long semi-final match against compatriot H S Prannoy and was a tad concerned how he would recover for the summit clash.Asked if he is happy with his fitness, Srikanth said: "I am surprised myself a little but yeah the way we have been training last 9-10 months, it is really playing its part now.So I have to just keep working hard now."
Roger Federer Downs Juan Martin del Potro For Eighth Swiss Indoors Crown:::::Home favourite Roger Federer claimed his eighth Swiss Indoors title on Sunday with a 6-7 (5/7), 6-4, 6-3 final defeat of Juan Martin del Potro.The 36-year-old fought back from a set down to win the 95th ATP title of his career, taking him clear above Ivan Lendl into second on the all-time list behind Jimmy Connors' mark of 109.It was Federer's first success against the Argentine in a Basel final, after the South American beat him in both 2012 and 2013.Federer's victory boosts his hopes of taking the world number one spot from Rafael Nadal, with the regular season ending next week at the Paris Masters, followed by the year-ending ATP Finals in London.The 19-time Grand Slam champion has now won a Tour-leading seven titles this season after beating Nadal in the Shanghai Masters final a fortnight ago."Congratulations to Juan Martin," Federer said."You've had a great run since the US Open (when he beat Federer in the quarter-finals) and before."I wish that I was able to play every week like you have, it's going to be difficult for me in the future to do that."Del Potro will be playing for a fourth successive week in Paris after coming back earlier in the season from wrist problems, as he looks to snatch a late place for the eight-man event in London.The 29-year-old reached the Shanghai semi-finals and won in Stockholm earlier this month before his run in Basel.Federer lost only two sets during the week as he improved his head-to-head record to 17-6 over del Potro, with a third win in four matches against the former US Open champion in 2017."It's unbelievable how well Roger is playing," said del Potro."I hope to be in such shape when I'm his age.But I doubt I will be."Federer now stands 49-4 overall this season.He will make a late decision whether to play the Paris Masters next week, depending on his fitness.The pair traded breaks in the opening two games, with an epic first set finally finding its way to a tie-break.Federer took a 3-0 lead but had no answer as del Potro won six straight points.The top seed saved two set points but went down on the third.The world number two battled hard in the second set, breaking in the final game to level the match as del Potro returned long.Federer broke for 3-1 in the decider and five games later put a forehand winner into the corner to bring up three match points.Del Potro saved the first but returned long as Federer wrapped up victory after two and a half hours of play."Roger was there playing high-level tennis for two and a half hours," said del Potro."He was better in key moments and he won."He returned well and broke me playing good tennis.I have little things to improve and I can learn from this match."Physically I was 100 percent today, I was close to winning, my body did not affect me in the final.I was running for all three sets and I fought until the last point."
Pakistan Mark Sri Lanka Return With Twenty20 Win:::::Pakistan marked the return of Sri Lanka with a 3-0 Twenty20 series whitewash on Sunday, as officials hoped the match will help reestablish the country's reputation for hosting international cricket.The third and final Twenty20 match, which Pakistan comfortably won by 36 runs at Gaddafi stadium in Lahore, was Sri Lanka's first since their team bus was attacked near the same venue in March 2009.Those attacks, which left eight people dead and seven Sri Lanka players and their staff injured, suspended international cricket in Pakistan and forced them to play at neutral venues of United Arab Emirates (UAE).The first two matches, which Pakistan won by seven and two wickets respectively, were played in Abu Dhabi before Sri Lanka flew to Lahore in a 24-hour fly in, fly out arrangement.The match was the fourth international since the attack, with Zimbabwe playing a five-match limited overs series in 2015 followed by the final of Pakistan Super League and a three-match Twenty20 series with the World XI comprising of players from seven countries -- both this year.Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Najam Sethi dubbed the match "historic"."This is historic because it marks the beginning of a new era of international cricket in Pakistan," said Sethi."This sends a big signal to the rest of the cricketing nations that Pakistan is ready to host international cricket."Sri Lanka Cricket President Thilanag Sumathipala vowed his board will not leave Pakistan in isolation."We are happy and privileged to be here to support Pakistan cricket," said Sumathipala."It's a wonderful cricketing nation.Pakistan has done so much for world cricket and to sports in general so we cannot leave them in isolation."However, a rampaging Pakistan side did not show any mercy to their opponents as they piled up 180-3 in their 20 overs.Shoaib Malik, the only player from both the sides to have also featured in the fateful 2009 Lahore Test, smashed a 24-ball 51 with five boundaries and two sixes.He added 75 for the third wicket with Babar Azam (34 not out) in just 45 balls.Openers Umar Amin (37-ball 45 with a six and three boundaries) and Fakhar Zaman (27-ball 31 with three fours) were the other contributors.Pace bowler Mohammad Amir, playing his first international match before the home crowd after making his debut soon after the terrorists' attacks, finished with a career-best 4-13 as Sri Lanka managed 144-9 in 20 overs.Only Dasun Shanaka batted with aggression during a 36-ball 54 with five boundaries and three sixes before he became one of Faheem Ashraf's two wickets.This becomes Pakistan's second 3-0 whitewash in a Twenty20 series, having previously beaten the West Indies in UAE last year.- Exhilarating scenes - Thousands of fans filled Gaddafi Stadium under intense security, as the countries' respective national anthems were played before a capacity 23,000 crowd.The city was adorned with pictures of the Sri Lankan cricketers as fans converged on the stadium hours before the start of the match.Fans applauded both the teams before the start of the match and beat drums in an exhilarating atmosphere.Sethi hoped Sri Lanka's return will be followed by a three-match Twenty20 series with the world champions, West Indies, next month, which is due to be finalised in the next few days.Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed thanked the Sri Lankan team and the crowd."I thank Sri Lankan team for coming to Pakistan as it was a great gesture," said Ahmed."It was lovely to play before home crowds and win."Sri Lankan skipper Thisara Perera said his players were honoured."We want to thanks the Pakistan fans for inviting us," said Perera."We love you and it was an honour to lead this young side."

Caroline Wozniacki Ends Venus Williams Jinx To Win WTA Finals:::::Former world number one Caroline Wozniacki ended her career-long jinx against Venus Williams in spectacular style to lift the WTA Finals trophy for the first time on Sunday.The Dane had won just one set from seven harrowing defeats to Williams but she turned the tables with a 6-4, 6-4 victory in 89 minutes at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.Wozniacki had some nervy moments after 37-year-old Williams, the tournament's oldest ever finalist, clawed her way back from 0-5 down in the second set.But she kept her cool to seal victory with a backhand down the line, throwing her racquet into the air and holding her hands to her face in disbelief."I am so happy I managed to win in the end," Wozniacki said."Eight is my lucky number.If I was going to beat her (Williams) once in my career, it had to be today."It is really sweet, I couldn't be happier right now."Wozniacki has been in brilliant, aggressive form in Singapore, beating Elina Svitolina and Simona Halep at the group stage and Karolina Pliskova in the semi-finals.After an even start, she seized control of the final by breaking four straight times across the sets to lead 5-0 in the second set.But with the title in her sights, Wozniacki was unable to serve it out in the seventh game and the ninth, when Williams produced an astounding crosscourt winner to win her fourth straight game.But Wozniacki finally triumphed in the 10th game with her backhand winner to celebrate in style.Williams, 37, looked increasingly weary as the match wore on after playing a gruelling, three-set semi-final against Caroline Garcia on Saturday.In a contrast of styles, counter-puncher Wozniacki tried to extend the rallies while her big-hitting opponent attempted to shorten points through sheer power and rushes to the net.Wozniacki broke three times in the first set and took a one-set lead when Williams played a loose service game at 4-5 down -- just she second set she had ever conceded to the Dane.Wozniacki, in her first WTA Finals since 2014, flourished in Singapore, with a tough three-set defeat to Caroline Garcia her only slip-up.It completed a stellar comeback season for the two-time Grand Slam finalist, who endured an injury-marred 2016 and finished ranked number 19, her lowest position since 2007.Williams was denied a 50th career triumph and first for the year, having finished runner-up at the Australian Open and Wimbledon.She will remain the world number five after playing in her first WTA Finals since 2009.Earlier, world number three pairing Timea Babos and Andrea Hlavackova won the WTA Finals doubles title on debut with a 4-6, 6-4, 10-5 comeback victory over Kiki Bertens and Johanna Larsson.

Joe Root Says England Ready For Australia Sledging War:::::Joe Root said his team were ready to deal with any heat that comes their way.Joe Root said his team were ready to deal with any heat that comes their way.AFP England is steeled for a sledging war in the Ashes series with suspended Ben Stokes the expected focus of Australia's barbs, captain Joe Root said on the team's arrival in Perth on Sunday.Stokes, the vice-captain and star all-rounder, is not among the touring party.He remains under investigation after being arrested on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm following an incident outside a Bristol nightclub in September.The England and Wales Cricket Board has not yet ruled the 26-year-old Stokes, who has a broken finger, out of the series which starts with the first Test in Brisbane on November 23.Root, who made it clear before departure that they must be prepared for Stokes's possible absence for the entire five-Test series, said his team were ready to deal with any heat that comes their way."Potentially they might (sledge us about Stokes)," Root told reporters."But Ashes cricket -- there's always an edge of psychological banter."Once you've played in a few, you sort of know what to expect and you know how it goes leading up to the games."I'm sure there will be plenty of banter flying around on and off the field."That's something you've got to cherish and relish and be able to look back on at the end of your career and say, 'I gave it my best shot, and I enjoyed it'."Former Australia Test captains Steve Waugh and Ian Chappell are among those who believe England can't retain the Ashes without the influential Stokes.The controversy surrounding him has given Australia plenty of sledging ammunition, according to their feisty opening batsman David Warner.Warner has already voiced his desire to ramp up his trademark on-field aggression in the coming series."The history, the pride that is at stake.As soon as you step on that line it's war," Warner told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation this month, when asked what the Ashes meant to him."You try and get into a battle as quick as you can.I try and look in the opposition's eye and work out how can I dislike this player, how can I get on top of him."Root said he is determined to show Australia just how good he is during the Ashes series as he seeks to atone for a miserable first tour 'Down Under'.Root is now one of the world's leading batsmen, having scored more than 5,000 runs in 60 Tests at an average of 53.76 including 13 hundreds.But his previous Ashes tour, in 2013/14, ended with him being dropped for the Sydney finale after he managed a meagre 192 runs in four previous Tests at a lowly average of 27.42.England lost that series 5-0 under Alastair Cook.England will begin their Ashes preparations with a two-day tour match against a Western Australia XI at Perth's WACA Ground starting on Saturday.They then play a Cricket Australia XI in Adelaide (November 8-11) and Townsville (November 15-18) before the first Test at the Gabba.
Imran Khan, Javed Miandad Say Sri Lanka Tour A Good Sign For Pakistan Cricket:::::Legendary Imran Khan and Javed Miandad have described Sri Lankan team's visit to Lahore to play a T20 international on Sunday as a good sign for the return of international cricket to Pakistan."I am very happy to see that the Sri Lankan team is in Lahore and will play today at the Gaddafi stadium.Their visit is very important for our cricket and hopefully it will now lead to more teams coming to Pakistan," Imran told a television channel.Sri Lanka became the first top international cricket team to tour Pakistan in eight years when they reached Lahore last night from Abu Dhabi.It was an attack on the Sri Lankan team by militants in March 2009 that led to Pakistan being isolated as an international cricket venue for eight long years.Former captain and 1992 World Cup hero Imran, who is now a leading politician, normally does not see eye to eye with Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Najam Sethi and has been critical of him.But Imran said the cricket board deserved appreciation for getting the Sri Lankans to play in Lahore."What happened in 2009 was very sad and bad for Pakistan cricket.It hurt our cricket and young players a lot.But now things seem to be moving in the right direction and today our people can show everyone they are a peace-loving nation who enjoys cricket," the former captain said.Another former captain Javed Miandad also appreciated the efforts of the PCB to bring a top test team to Lahore."This visit by the Sri Lankans will do a lot of good for Pakistan cricket.I think the doors to international cricket in Pakistan will now open up soon," Miandad said.He said that the Sri Lankan government, their cricket board (SLC) and players had shown they were true friends of Pakistan by agreeing to play the match in Lahore."I know it must not have been easy for them after what happened eight years back with them.I can understand if some of their players have pulled out.But the important thing is Sri Lanka is here," Miandad told PTI.Former Pakistan captain and fast bowling great Wasim Akram said he was very happy for the young players of the country."We were fortunate we played a lot of cricket in front of our people but I always felt bad for a current lot of players many of whom never got a chance to play on their own grounds before their own crowds.Thankfully that is now changing," he said.

Sri Lankan Team Arrives In Lahore Amid Tight Security:::::The Sri Lankan cricket team arrived here, eight years after they suffered a gun and grenade attack, under heavy security to play the final Twenty20 International of a three-match series against Pakistan.International cricket was suspended in Pakistan after the 2009 gun attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore, which left eight people killed and seven visiting players and their staff members injured.Upon their arrival here on Saturday, the Sri Lankan players and the officials were straightaway taken to a five-star hotel in a bomb-proof bus with hundreds of elite police commandos and the paramilitary rangers providing high level security.Several Lankan players and officials, including the survivors who came under gunfire in 2009 and their head coach, had opted out of the Twenty20 fixture after some voiced concern about security.The 24-member strong Sri Lankan contingent became the first major international team to visit the country since the incident.In the last eight years, Pakistan have only managed to get minnows Zimbabwe to tour Lahore in 2015, besides hosting the final of Pakistan Super League and a three-match Twenty20 series against a World XI -- comprised of players from seven countries -- earlier this year.The attack on the Sri Lankan team led to international teams refusing to tour Pakistan and the ICC also relocated all matches of the 2011 World Cup, which were to be held in Pakistan, because no one was willing to play in the country.Sri Lanka have played two Tests, five One-day Internationals and the first two Twenty20 matches of the series in the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan's neutral venue since 2009.But Sri Lanka agreed to travel to Pakistan for the third and final T20 match.An hour before the Sri Lankans arrived from Abu Dhabi, the Pakistan team had also reached the city from Dubai.Besides the team and officials, Sri Lanka's sports minister Dayasiri Jayasekera and Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) President Thilanga Sumathipala are also on the tour.They were all greeted by fully armed elite commandos, Inspector-General of Punjab police, the Lahore Mayor, top ranking Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials and other government dignitaries on the runaway and within no time were whisked away in bullet proof vehicles to their hotel from the terminal.All the roads from the airport to the hotel were sealed off and one hour before the Sri Lankan team was due to land, the security forces had cordoned off all entrances and exit points at the airport.Mobile phone services were also temporarily suspended in the area, where the hotel is located.

India and New Zealand at Green Park stadium in Kanpur.Rohit Sharma is due for a big score after making 7 and 20 in the earlier games.Just like the home team, the Black Caps would look to get back to winning ways as they remain within touching distance of winning a rare series in India.For starters, they would have to put up a much better batting effort than what they managed in the previous game.Ross Taylor and Latham had bailed them out in Mumbai with a match-winning 200-run stand after New Zealand had lost their top three for 80 runs.The top three did not do much either in Pune but with Taylor and Latham also not firing on that occasion, they ended up with a below par 230.There can't be a better time for captain Kane Willamson to lead from the front after a couple of failures.
Football Goalkeeper Max Crocombe Urinates On The Field During Match, Gets Red Card:::::Australia cricketer Matt Renshaw became the talking point in February earlier this year in the first Test of the series against India, after he was forced to take a 'toilet break' just after his partner David Warner was dismissed in the first innings.It was an act of desperation that certainly didn't amuse his skipper Steven Smith and he was not allowed to come back again to bat at that time, though later he went on to make gritty 68 for his team.Another incident was witnessed on Saturday, this time in a football match.During a national league north game in England, Salford City Goalkeeper Max Crocombe was shown red card in the 87th minute of the match against Bradford Park Avenue for urinating near the goal post.His desperate desire to answer the call of nature on the field was spotted by eagle-eyed officials and the referee duly wielded the red card.Initial bemusement as to the reason for his sudden departure turned to amazement when Bradford Park Avenue tweeted: "We can confirm that Crocombe has been sent off for urinating during the game.We are not joking."87' - We can confirm that Crocombe has been sent off for urinating during the game.We are not joking.#greenarmy (1-2) Bradford Park Avenue (@BPAFCOfficial) October 28, 2017 Twitterati went berserk and posted witty comments after hearing this funny news.Urine denial.Sean Mullan (@SDMullan) October 28, 2017 Surely that's taking the piss...

Formula One: Sebastian Vettel Keeps Hopes Alive With Mexico Pole, Lewis Hamilton Third:::::Sebastian Vettel boosted his slim hopes of keeping alive his world championship challenge on Saturday when he claimed the 50th pole of his career for this weekend's Mexican Grand Prix.The four-time champion German, who needs to win and hope championship leading Briton Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes fails to finish in the top five, or worse, produced a dazzling lap in the final seconds.Hamilton, who can capture a fourth world title on Sunday, was third in qualifying, edged out by Red Bull's Max Verstappen who was on course for pole until Vettel's sensational late charge."I am so happy," said Vettel, who took pole with a record lap in one minute and 16.488 seconds."We will attack all the way and see what we can do."It's difficult and slippy and difficult to get everything in one lap.I had a moment in turn six, I nearly lost it there, but I knew if i could keep it clean in the last sector it would be enough."Yesterday wasn't that good for us, but we improved overnight.I'm really happy but the race pace should be good."Hamilton was subdued, but not downcast."We're still on for the win and we'll see what happens with Max.I hope to have a battle with at least one of them," said the Mercedes man."Those guys did a great job.I gave it everything in the last lap.I could've been a couple of tenths of a second quicker, but it wouldn't be enough to match these guys.We're still in for the win -- I hope to have a battle with at least one of them."Verstappen was second fastest ahead of Hamilton and his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas, Kimi Raikkonen in the second Ferrari and Esteban Ocon of Force India."I gave it all I could today and I really wanted that pole position," said Verstappen."It just wasn't enough."- Verstappen sees stewards - Australian Daniel Ricciardo qualified seventh in the second Red Bull ahead of Nico Hulkenberg and his Renault team-mate Carlos Sainz with local hero Sergio Perez 10th in the second Force India.On a very warm, dry afternoon, with a track temperature of 47 degrees Celsius, Hamilton topped the times in the Q1 session ahead of Bottas, with Vettel fourth and Fernando Alonso, remarkably, fifth in a Mclaren.Out went Marcus Ericsson and his Sauber team-mate Pascal Wehrlein, together with the two Haas cars of Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean.Frenchman Pierre Gasley was also eliminated as he was unable to run in his Toro Rosso following an engine change.His team-mate rookie New Zealander Brendon Hartley then also suffered an engine failure in Q2 and was unable to return to the pits.His car lost all power after a cloud of smoke spilled forth and he abandoned the car, taking a scooter ride to return to the paddock.This condemned him to elimination along with the two Williams men, Felipe Massa and Canadian rookie Lance Stroll as well as Alonso and his McLaren Honda team-mate Stoffel Vandoorne.The last two faced major grid penalties.Verstappen raised the bar in the Q2 session with a lap in 1:16.524, a full half a second faster everyone else -- a lap that suggested Red Bull might be the team to beat.On their first runs in Q3, both Bottas and Verstappen backed off while Hamilton, with 1:16.934, went top initially only to be overhauled by Vettel and then Verstappen, who was three-tenths clear."What are your thoughts?"his Red Bull team asked the Dutchman."Yeah, this is good," ge replied.Almost immediately, the stewards announced they were to investigate Verstappen for impeding Bottas, reviving immediate memories of his brushes with the authorities in Texas last weekend.Verstappen was called to see the stewards after the session but he was cleared of any wrongdoing and will retain his front row spot.
India vs New Zealand: Rohit Sharma Reveals The Name Of His On And Off The Field Partner:::::Rohit Sharma has accumulated 27 runs in the first two matches against New Zealand Rohit Sharma has accumulated 27 runs in the first two matches against New Zealand Twitter When we talk about India's opening partnerships in limited-overs cricket, the names Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid and Gautam Gambhir come to mind.The legends dominated the sport for more than a decade.The legacy is now being taken forward by the young guns very well.New batting stars Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma, with their solid batting performances, have been laying the foundation for the Men In Blue.Not just on the field, the duo share a good relationship off the cricket field too.Rohit took to Twitter and shared a photo with Dhawan and captioned it: "Partners on and off the field #BrothersInArms @SDhawan25,".The prolific openers have opened the innings for Team India on 65 occasions in ODIs, scoring 3,019 runs at an average of 47.17.The overall partnership includes 11 century and 9 fifty plus stands between the two.Tendulkar and Ganguly are considered as the best opening pair in the world.They have scored 6,609 runs in 136 innings at an average of 49.32.The pair of Sehwag and Tendulkar are fourth in the all-time list (opening partnerships).They have opened the innings on 93 occasions and scored 3,919 runs at an average of 42.13.Sehwag and Tendulkar have 12 century and 18 fifty plus stands to their name.Australia's Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden are second in the list.West Indies' Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes are third in the all-time opening partnership list.Sehwag and Gambhir have opened India innings 38 times, scoring 1,870 runs at an average of 50.54.They have 5 century and 7 fifty plus partnerships to their name.
India v New Zealand: India beat New Zealand by six runs in a thriller, clinch ODI series 2-1:::::KANPUR: India came up trumps in a battle of nerves against a gutsy New Zealand to win the all-important third ODI by six runs and clinch their seventh successive bilateral series by 2-1 margin on Sunday.Rohit Sharma (147 off 138) and Virat Kohli (113 off 106) conjured up classy hundreds to fire India to a record 337 for six after being put into bat.The target was imposing but New Zealand fought gamely through Colin Munro (75 off 62), Kane Williamson (64 off 84) and Tom Latham (65 off 52) before being restricted to 331 for 7 in the wake of some fine death bowling by Jasprit Bumrah.For the better part of the match, Indian bowlers dished out an ordinary bowling performance but bounced back when it mattered the most -- in the final three overs.Required to defend 15 runs in the final over, 'King of Death' Bumrah (3/47 in 10 overs) delivered yet again and conceded only eight runs in the 50th over.More importantly, he bowled an astounding 32 dot balls in his 10-over spell.It seemed it was game on with the flying start provided left-hand opener Munro.He set the tone for the daunting task on the very first ball he face, flicking Bhuvneshwar Kumar for a monstrous six over midwicket.Three more fours including the one from overthrow was to follow in the first over of the innings that went for 19 runs.The in-form Kumar had an off day as he leaked 92 runs from his 10 overs.While his opening partner Martin Guptill (10) fell cheaply again, Munro and Kane Williamson (64) kept the visitors very much in the hunt with a 109-stand off 105 balls.The pair batted with supreme confidence on a flat surface, especially Munro who was not afraid to switch hit and charge down against the spinners.It was also a knock of substance from Williamson, who had not fired in the series until tonight.The two had taken New Zealand to 152 for one in 24 overs before under pressure India bounced back in the match with Yuzvendra Chahal removing the set batsmen.Their fall stopped the run flow and the required run rate per over went beyond eight, leaving the heroes of Mumbai Ross Taylor and Latham a lot to do.They batted well, completing a 79-run partnership off 69 balls with their team needing 91 off the last 10 overs.Latham carried on and played flawless to take his team on the brink of victory alongside Henry Nicholls before nerves got the better of them during the business end of the innings.Earlier, Sharma and Kohli, who became the first ever pairing to complete four double hundred partnerships in ODIs, were simply unstoppable against a New Zealand bowling attack that looked pretty ordinary on the day.Their spectacular showing also helped India comfortably beat the previous highest score at Green Park, 303 for five that South Africa made against them two years ago.The destructive duo was in complete control ever since Shikhar Dhawan (14) departed in the seventh over and ended up with a record breaking 230-run stand off 211 balls.While Kohli had already hit a fine hundred in the series opener, Sharma rose to the occasion after failing in the first two games after New Zealand put the home team in.The last time he played an ODI here, he made 150, and two years on, the stylish-right hander from Mumbai gave the packed crowd an evening to remember for a long time.There are not many prettier sights in cricket than seeing Sharma bat in full flow.And he did look in fine form right from the time he slashed a gentle loosener off Tim Southee over point in the first over of the match.The Kanpur pitch, usually slow and low, played well with the ball coming on to the bat nicely.The signs were ominous for the opposition when Sharma easily picked pacer Adam Milne for a huge six over midwicket.He gave the same treatment to left-arm spinner Santner in his first over, collecting two boundaries with a cut and sweep before getting to his 50 off 52 balls.Kohli, on his part, began with two crisp boundaries off Southee, one through the covers and the next one a whip over midwicket.Without taking much risk, the star pair managed to get an odd boundary in the middle overs and by the time Sharma got to his 15th ODI hundred in 33rd over, India were cruising at 183 for one.Sharma was finding the fence more frequently than Kohli as he hammered 18 fours to go with two maximums.The two batsmen changed gears in the 36th over and the bowler at the receiving end this time was pacer Trent Boult, who leaked 17 runs in that over including four fours.The next over saw them picking three fours off Grandhomme with the last one getting Kohli past the 9000-run mark in ODIs, making him the sixth Indian to do so and fastest to get there overall.After Sharma fell to a tired shot in the 42nd over, Kohli breezed to his 32nd hundred and his second in the series, with a single off Santner.
French Open Badminton 2017: Kidambi Srikanth beats Kenta Nishimoto to win French Open Super Series title:::::HYDERABAD: Riding the crest of his sparkling form Kidambi Srikanth dished out a blemish less performance to collect his fourth Super Series title of the year.The 25-year-old dazzled in the 'City of Love' to become the first Indian French Open champion on Sunday.Srikanth took just 34 minutes to ease past Japanese qualifier Kento Nishimoto in the Super Series final 21-14, 21-13 at the Stade Pierre De Coubertin.In the process Srikanth surpassed Saina Nehwal as the only Indian to win four Super Series titles in a year.Saina won three in 2010."I feel good winning two titles in two weeks.I am lucky to pull off some close matches this week.I thank everyone who helped me doing this," an elated Srikanth said after the win.With his outstanding feats in 2017, Srikanth has entered the league of Indian legends like Prakash Padukone and Pullela Gopichand.The Guntur-lad is also the only Indian to win back-to-back titles i.e two titles in two consecutive weeks in a season.He is the fourth in the world behind legends like Lin Dan, Lee Chong Wei and Chen Long to four men's singles titles.Such an outstanding feat came with an easy effort in the final.The title clash on Sunday resembled last week's demolition act, where he mowed down Lee Hyun Il of Korea for the Denmark Open title.The world No.4 crushed the Japanese qualifier with an aggressive power play.Trailing 5-9 in the first game, Srikanth suddenly changed gears by finishing off the rallies with ferocious overhead smashes.A couple pierced the rival's court with breakneck speed of 392 and 377 km/h.The firecracker shots made holes in Nishimoto's defence.Unable to return them or even reach them, Nishimoto lost momentum and with that confidence as Srikanth raced ahead to 11-9 and then to 15-11 in no time.The Hyderabadi shuttler, who switched from doubles to singles at the behest of his coach Gopichand, was on a different altitude from then on.Relying entirely on his attacking prowess Srikanth closed out the first game at 21-14 in just 16 minutes.The Indian was even more dominant in the second as he started off with a 4-0 lead and was up 11-5 at the break.Thereafter, he controlled the game and stumped his opponent.Gopichand was delighted with Srikanth's show."It's a phenomenal achievement.Some fine badminton .Very very attacking, overall I think he really played a perfect game.Today's match he kept the rallies short and his attacking shots made him finish.The fact is that he started to be relaxed and paced himself much better," he said and added that Srikanth missed winning the World championship this year."He is in such fine form for the last few months that I expected him to win the World title.I always said that if he plays to his potential he has the ability to win many more titles," he added.
Roger Federer: Federer outlasts Del Potro for eighth Basel title:::::BASEL (Switzerland): Roger Federer claimed an eighth Swiss Indoor title when he outlasted Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro 6-7(5), 6-4, 6-3 in front of a partisan Basel crowd on Sunday.The 36-year-old local favourite, beaten by Del Potro in consecutive Basel finals in 2012 and 2013, was ragged at times and looked in danger of an unwanted hat-trick, but showed all his battling qualities to turn the match around.Fourth seed Del Potro, making a late run to try and qualify for next month's ATP World Tour Finals in London, broke serve in the first game of the decider but wilted as Federer stormed back to the delight of a raucous crowd inside the St Jakobshalle.World number two Federer charged into a 5-2 lead and while Del Potro delayed the end by holding serve, Federer would not be denied and racked up his 95th career title as Del Potro fired a backhand long under pressure.Victory means Federer trails world number one Rafael Nadal by 1,460 points going into the Paris Masters where 1,000 points are on offer for the champion.Del Potro would have moved into the eighth and final qualifying spot for London had he claimed a third Basel title, but now must reach the semi-finals at least in the French capital to make it to the season-ending tournament.
India v New Zealand: Boys showed their character in a knock-out game: Kohli:::::KANPUR: India captain Virat Kohli lauded his bowlers after their series winning performance in the high-scoring third ODI on Sunday.Jasprit Bumrah 's (3/47 in 10 overs) fantastic bowling at the death ensured that India restricted New Zealand to 331 for 7 after scoring 337 in the final ODI, winning the series 2-1."To be fair to the bowlers: the wicket eased out nicely.The ball was coming onto the bat beautifully.But glad the bowlers came out on top: it was like a knock out game for us, and the boys showed their character," Kohli said at the post-match presentation.However the Indian captain was gracious in praising New Zealand's performance in all three games."Credit to New Zealand.They challenged us in all three games and forced us to play our best in every game.Credit to the skill and character they possess."Kohli was seen fielding at the boundary and during the end overs wasn't as animated as one has seen him during all these years."I decided that I would let the bowlers do what they want do and that's why I was calm.There was dew too, just glad the boys pulled through."The skipper was modest about his own stellar role that fetched him another Man of the Series award with 263 runs to his credit."My aim is for the team to win the game and the series, and if I personally do well, then it's an added bonus."On reaching the fastest 9000 runs in history of ODIs, Kohli said: "These things are hard to ignore since we keep hearing these, but the aim is to always make the team win from any situation."Man of the match Rohit Sharma said that he did work on certain adjustment in his technique which paid dividends."I was watching the pre-match analysis where they said my head was falling off, so I worked slightly on it.That helped.My head was falling a bit and wasn't coming into the line of the ball.The quickly you rectify, the better it is.""Every hundred is special, but what I was working on came off well, and that's why I am happy.Sanjay Bangar (batting coach) helped my work on some of these things and that's when results are more pleasing."Rival skipper Kane Williamson was also happy that his team put up a great fight."It was a fantastic series, some great cricket played and in good series.Credit to Kohli and team, they were the better team, although by just a little bit.""Losing from this close is frustrating, but there are good signs," Williamson sounded positive."The surface was good throughout, and the team that played better on that day won the games in this series.But against these guys, you have to be at your best to cross the line."Williamson was all praise for his middle-order."Our middle order stood out.Tom Latham batted with such clarity, adapted and did the role so well.Henry Nicholls too, Ross batted well.Our seamers did well under difficult conditions.India played better cricket, and they deserve the win.""Santner's a pretty good spinner, so it's a tough decision taking two specialist spinners."
Kidambi Srikanth: Training hard has helped me stay fit: Srikanth:::::HYDERABAD: Kidambi Srikanth is in the form of his life.After winning the second consecutive title in two weeks, Srikanth said that he is lucky to pull off close matches.He also credited his success to the supreme fitness that helped him stay agile throughout the last two weeks.I am just happy with the way it went for me in the last couple of weeks.I also consider myself lucky to pull out a couple of close matches but otherwise I am quite happy with my performance.He played really well this week.He beat Lee Chong Wei in the first round after coming through the qualifiers.He beat Sai (Praneeth), Antonsen in the semi-finals.So, I really felt it will be a tough match but in the end I am very happy and satisfied.I think in the semi-final and quarter-final, I felt I really started slowly.So, in the final I wanted to start off really better than what I did before.I know he is a kind of attacking, aggressive player so I did not want to give him the chance to attack.That really worked for me today.I am surprised a bit too.But I think the way we have been training in the last eight nine months is doing its part now.I just want to continue training hard.I am not really sure, I have to go back and talk to my coach and decide on what tournaments I will play before the Super Series Finals.It's his decision now.I think there's a lot of difference between me and Viktor (Axelsen; World No.1) for sure.Before the Denmark Open there's a lot of difference.I don't think I will be No.1.Definitely, it is good to be there.But I am not really thinking of it now.I don't really have any tournaments to defend so I don't want to push myself.I just want to enjoy playing.
Pakistan v Sri Lanka: Pakistan mark Sri Lanka return with Twenty20 win:::::LAHORE (Pakistan): Pakistan marked the return of Sri Lanka with a 3-0 Twenty20 series whitewash on Sunday, as officials hoped it will help re-establish the country's reputation for hosting international cricket.The third and final Twenty20 match, which Pakistan comfortably won by 36 runs at Gaddafi stadium in Lahore, was Sri Lanka's first since their team bus was attacked near the same venue in March 2009.Those attacks, which left eight people dead and seven Sri Lanka players and their staff injured, suspended international cricket in Pakistan and forced them to play at neutral venues of United Arab Emirates (UAE).The first two matches, which Pakistan won by seven and two wickets respectively, were played in Abu Dhabi before Sri Lanka flew to Lahore in a 24-hour fly in, fly out arrangement.The match was the fourth international since the attack, with Zimbabwe playing a five-match limited over series in 2015 followed by the final of Pakistan Super League and a three-match Twenty20 series with World XI comprising of players from seven countries -- both this year.Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Najam Sethi dubbed the match "historic"."This is historic because it marks the beginning of a new era of international cricket in Pakistan," said Sethi."This sends a big signal to the rest of the cricketing nations that Pakistan is ready to host international cricket."Sri Lanka Cricket President Thilanag Sumathipala vowed his board will not leave Pakistan in isolation."We are happy and privileged to be here to support Pakistan cricket," said Sumathipala."It's a wonderful cricketing nation.Pakistan has done so much for world cricket and to sports in general so we cannot leave them in isolation."However, a rampaging Pakistan side did not show any mercy to their opponents as they piled up 180-3 in their 20 overs.Shoaib Malik , the only player from both the sides to have also featured in the fateful 2009 Lahore Test, smashed a 24-ball 51 with five boundaries and two sixes.He added 75 for the third wicket with Babar Azam (34 not out) in just 45 balls.Openers Umar Amin (37-ball 45 with a six and three boundaries) and Fakhar Zaman (27-ball 31 with three fours) were the other contributors.Pace bowler Mohammad Amir , playing his first international match before the home crowd after making his debut soon after the terrorists' attacks, finished with a career best 4-13 as Sri Lanka managed 144-9 in 20 overs.Only Dasun Shanaka batted with aggression during a 36-ball 54 with five boundaries and three sixes before he became one of Faheem Ashraf's two wickets.This becomes Pakistan's second 3-0 whitewash in a Twenty20 series, having previously beaten the West Indies in UAE last year.Thousands of fans filled Gaddafi Stadium under intense security, as the countries' respective national anthems were played before a capacity 23,000 crowd.The city was adorned with pictures of the Sri Lankan cricketers as fans converged on the stadium hours before the start of the match.Fans applauded both the teams before the start of the match and beat drums in an exhilarating atmosphere.Sethi hoped Sri Lanka's return will be followed by a three-match Twenty20 series with the world champions, West Indies, next month, which is due to be finalised in the next few days.
Virat Kohli: Aggression alone can't win the game, but let Kohli be himself: Dravid:::::BENGALURU: At a time when a section of fans attribute the recent successes of Indian cricket to the new found aggression on the field under the firebrand captaincy of Virat Kohli , legendary cricketer Rahul Dravid believes the game is all about performance.Speaking at the Bangalore Literature Festival here on Sunday, Dravid, whose impregnable batting technique had earned him the title 'The wall', said that matches can be won even by players who don't sport tattoo on their sleeves.And on-field macho, rock star image would be of little help to be on a winning streak, he said."Virat sometimes comes across as outrageous and I cringe on reading his statements before a series.But if he can bring the best out of himself by needling the opposition, so be it," Dravid said.He was in conversation with journalists Prem Panicker and Rajdeep Sardesai at the session titled 'Indian Democracy XI', an allusion to Sardesai's book on 11 legendary cricketers.Admitting he could never be like Virat with tattoos, Dravid though defended the young skipper by saying, "We want a little bit of lip on the field."His word of caution to the budding cricketers, however, was not to copy Virat blindly.The jam-packed session witnessed ticklish moments with Sardesai trying to put Dravid in a spot hurling his typical TV-moderator questions at one of the most technically sound batsmen the world has seen.Sardesai asked him how he would defend the likes of Virat and Dhoni becoming more powerful than the game and deciding on coaches and when to retire.While the query on the selection of coach cited the instance of Anil Kumble , who was sacked as the coach of Indian cricket team earlier this year, Dravid said, "It is unfortunate for a legend who was part of the highest number of winning Indian teams to see unceremonious departure.At the same time, it is quite common that coaches always get sacked.I also am the Under-19 Indian team coach.I may also be sacked."On Dhoni's retirement, he said: "People might have different opinions on when Dhoni should retire.But, if the selectors have selected him, he can play for India as long as he wants."Referring to the emergence of a new generation cricketers from smaller cities and towns, Dravid said it had to do with accessibility to facilities and knowledge thanks to commercialisation of the game and television broadcast."Although people may deride IPL and T20 format because of which they think cricket has been commercialised, thanks to the money in it, access to facilities are better," he said, citing the recent Ranji match between Karnataka and Hyderabad held in Shivamogga.He said youngsters were able to learn cricket by watching legends like Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri on television screens teaching skills.Three legendary cricketers from Karnataka - Syed Kirmani, EAS Prasanna, and B S Chandrashekhar- were part of the audience and the highlight of the session was when Sardesai called them on the stage and paid them glowing tributes.Referring to the classy cricketers from Bengaluru, Sardesai said: "Like the Bengaluru weather, these are the most decent people I have ever met."
Caroline Wozniacki: Wozniacki survives Venus fightback to claim WTA Finals title:::::SINGAPORE: Caroline Wozniacki claimed the biggest title of her career after the Dane staved off a ferocious Venus Williams fightback to take a 6-4, 6-4 triumph in the WTA Finals title showdown at a captivated Singapore Indoor Stadium on Sunday.The 27-year-old former world number one entered the contest having lost to the evergreen Williams seven times in as many matches but the resilient Dane served and retrieved brilliantly and emerged with a deserved victory after 89 minutes.Wozniacki was faultless for an hour as she raced to a one-set and 5-0 lead but Williams always plays to win and the 37-year-old American reeled off four games in a row before the Dane could finally lift the title at the elite, eight-woman event in her fifth appearance."It was all going well at 5-0 in the second set, then she went for her shots and I was just so happy to get it done in the end," Wozniacki, who will rise three places to third in the world rankings after the win, said in a courtside interview."Well eight is my lucky number and I figured if I was ever going to beat her it would be today... and I just went out there and did my best."The first three games were dominated by the server until the Dane started to find the corners with her powerful backhand and fashioned the first break of the match with back-to-back winners off both flanks.Williams was trying to get to the net at every opportunity and came forward to good effect after dropping her serve.A vicious cross-court backhand enabled the American to break back immediately on her way to levelling the score at 3-3.She continued to be the aggressor but the Dane held on in the face of some brutal hitting for her opponent and somehow forged her second break of the set with some exquisite deep hitting to move within one game of taking the opener.The American came roaring back once more, leaving the Dane looking on as a helpless spectator, with a barrage of winners to get the high-class contest back on serve.After working so hard to stay in touch, Williams would have been deeply frustrated to gift her opponent the set when the Dane did not have to work to seize the third break in a row, the wayward American sending forehands wide, long and into the net.Wozniacki had seized the momentum with her variation, depth of shot and complete lack of errors preventing Williams from grabbing any sort of foothold in the contest and the flying Dane raced into a 5-0 lead in 11 second-set minutes.Needing to hold serve just to stay in the contest, Williams found her rhythm to belatedly get on the scoreboard in the second set and then secured her first break of the second with some solid play against an increasingly anxious Wozniacki.Williams suddenly appeared relaxed and free, holding easily to heap more pressure on the Dane before stretching every muscle and sinew in an impressive ninth game to break once more and get it back to 5-4.The crowd wanted more but Wozniacki was not prepared to give them what they wanted, breaking again and sealing victory on her second match point with a backhand winner down the line, and tossing her racket in the air as she celebrated a stunning triumph.Wozniacki's victory is her second of the season in eight finals after she successfully defended her Pan Pacific Open title in Tokyo last month.
David Miller: Miller hits fastest T20I century as South Africa rout Bangladesh:::::POTCHEFSTROOM (South Africa): David Miller smashed the fastest century in Twenty20 international cricket as South Africa outclassed Bangladesh by 83 runs in the second and final Twenty20 international at Senwes Park on Sunday.Miller's 35-ball hundred propelled South Africa to 224 for four before Bangladesh were bowled out for 141, completing a clean-sweep for South Africa in two Tests, three one-day internationals and two T20 internationals.It was an extraordinary innings by Miller.Dropped on nought, he admitted: "I felt pretty scratchy to be honest.In the first ten balls I could have been out twice."He had only scored 18 runs off 14 balls, then came an assault which yielded 82 runs off 21 balls to get to his century."Once I hit one or two I decided to keep going," he said.The previous fastest T20 international century was made off 45 balls by fellow South African Richard Levi against New Zealand in Hamilton in 2011/12.Five of Miller's nine sixes came off the first five balls of the 19th over, bowled by promising all-rounder Mohammad Saifuddin , who had dismissed AB de Villiers and Hashim Amla and conceded only 22 runs in his first three overs.Miller said he felt the rare feat of six sixes in an over was possible."I got to the fourth one and thought I might as well go for it.The fifth one came out nicely."Saifuddin pushed the last ball of his over wide of the off stump and Miller mistimed it for a single."Looking back I probably could have hit six off six," said Miller.The left-hander's innings could have ended off the second ball he faced as he gloved an attempted pull off Rubel Hossain Bangladesh wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim dived to his right and appeared to have caught the ball but lost control as he landed on the ground.Miller shared a 79-run fourth wicket partnership off 41 balls with Hashim Amla, who made 85 off 51 balls with 11 fours and a six.Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan admitted it had been a poor tour for his team."Today was a reflection of the series.We need to learn a lot from this.We have been terrific for the last two years at home but now it is time to get better overseas."Bangladesh made a good start, restricting South Africa to 37 for two in the first five overs.Shakib opened the bowling and sent down all his four overs in one spell, taking two for 22.But his teammates could not sustain the pressure in the face of Miller's onslaught.Bangladesh scored 17 runs off the first over, bowled by Beuran Hendricks.But Imrul Kayes was run out in the second over and the tourists never threatened again.Miller was only the fourth South African to hit a century in 100 T20 internationals.
Virat Kohli: Virat Kohli becomes fastest batsman to score 9000 ODI runs:::::KANPUR: Virat Kohli became the sixth Indian and the fastest to complete 9000 ODI runs during the series-deciding third game against New Zealand on Sunday.Kohli got to the landmark in the 37th over when he guided one off Grandhomme towards the third man for a four.He went on to score his 32nd ODI century off 96 balls and eventually got out on 113.His 106-ball knock was studded with nine fours and a six.Mahendra Singh Dhoni had reached the milestone last year while other Indians who have done so are Sachin Tendulkar Sourav Ganguly and Mohammad Azharuddin Another milestone was reaching his 49th international century surpassing Rahul Dravid (48 tons).He is second among Indian batsmen in terms of international hundreds after Sachin Tendulkar (100 tons).Overall, Kohli, who played his 202nd match and 194th innings on Sunday, has become the 19th batsman to breach the 9000-run mark, making him the fastest to get there.Earlier in the series, the Indian captain had surpassed Australian great Ricky Ponting in the list of most ODI hundreds with his 31st ton.Tendulkar tops the list with 49 hundreds and he is also the leading run-getter in the format.Kohli had a quiet series against the Australians by his standards but he is back to his best against the Black Caps.
At my best, no girl can beat me in trials: Mary Kom:::::NEW DELHI: She is 34 years of age, a five-time boxing world champion, the first Indian boxer to win an Olympic medal and now a Rajya Sabha MP as well but you just can't keep MC Mary Kom away from the boxing ring.One of the legends of her sport, 'Magnificent Mary' is back in her 48kg weight category and ready to compete in the Asian Championships in Vietnam for the sixth time in her career.Mary had to go through a gruelling trial to ensure her berth in the Asian Championships, taking place in Ho Chi Minh City from November 2 to 11 and now she is confident of bring back her fifth gold from the event (after winning in 2003, 2005, 2010 and 2012)."Qualifying was very tough, competing in six back-to-back bouts.The girls in my weight category were quiet young though with Sarjubala Devi being the most experienced among them.When I went to the trials I knew that if I was competing at my best, these girls can't beat me, that much confidence I have in myself," Mary Kom told TOI on Sunday before leaving for Ho Chi Minh City.After failing to secure a wildcard to compete in the Rio Olympics, Mary Kom has been training hard to secure a spot in the 2018 Commonwealth Games squad and looking ahead to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics as well."Getting back to training was not hard work.I had not been fighting for the last few years but found it quite easy to get back into groove.I decided to go up in my weight category to 51kg because the last Asian Games didn't have the 48kg category.So returning to the 48kg class was a conscious decision keeping in mind the Asian Championships this year and 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia, next year," the 34-year-old mother of three said.Talking about her training regime these days, Mary said, "Right now I am training about four hours every day with sparring sessions couple of times a day.It also includes muscle strengthening sessions.Chief coach Gurbax Singh Sandhu has also provided good insights into my game."Mary is quite upbeat about winning a medal for the country in her first international appearance in many years."I am feeling very confident right now.I am 100 per cent fit and I am praying that there shouldn't be any injury during the competition there.I'll try to give at best in every bout and my first aim will be to bring back a gold for India," she said after a grueling national camp at the IG stadium in New Delhi.
India colts beat Malaysia to win bronze at Sultan of Johor Cup:::::JOHOR BAHRU (Malaysia): Indian junior men's hockey team thrashed hosts Malaysia 4-0 to claim the bronze medal at the seventh Sultan of Johor Cup , on Sunday.Goals from Vishal Antil (15th, 25th minutes), Vivek Prasad (11th) and Shilanand Lakra (21st) were enough for India to win the bronze at the Taman Daya Hockey Stadium.India had earlier finished third in the points table with nine points after winning three and losing two of their round robin matches.The team started the match on a bright note as they attacked the Malaysian defense in the initial stages of the first quarter.The Indian team seemed to have put aside the disappointment of failing to qualify for the final as they produced some marvellous skills to stamp their authority on the match.It was in the 11th minute when captain Vivek Prasad scored from Maninder Singh's assist from the right flank.India extended their lead four minutes later when a precise long pass from Dilpreet Singh was picked up by Shilanand Lakra inside the circle, and the forward made a turn and passed the ball to Vishal Antil who then scored with a cool finish.The second quarter had a similar story for the Indians as they dominated the possession and were rewarded for their spirited display when they scored a third goal through Shilanand Lakra, who tapped in a pass by captain Vivek Prasad in the 21st minute.India's attacking force was in prime form as they struck yet again in the 25th minute through Vishal Antil's strike.Malaysia had to step up in the last two quarters if they were to make a comeback into the match, but India's defence was resolute and did not allow the hosts to make any inroads.

SL tour a good sign for Pak cricket, say stalwarts:::::KARACHI: Legendary Imran Khan and Javed Miandad have described Sri Lankan team's visit to Lahore to play a T20 international as a good sign for the return of international cricket to Pakistan."I am very happy to see that the Sri Lankan team is in Lahore and will play today at the Gaddafi stadium .Their visit is very important for our cricket and hopefully it will now lead to more teams coming to Pakistan," Imran told a television channel.Sri Lanka became the first top international cricket team to tour Pakistan in eight years when they reached Lahore on Saturday night from Abu Dhabi.It was an attack on the Sri Lankan team by militants in March, 2009 that led to Pakistan being isolated as a international cricket venue for eight long years.Former captain and 1992 World Cup hero Imran, who is now a leading politician, normally does not see eye to eye with Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Najam Sethi and has been critical about him.But Imran said the cricket board deserved appreciation for getting the Sri Lankans to play in Lahore."What happened in 2009 was very sad and bad for Pakistan cricket.It hurt our cricket and young players a lot.But now things seem to be moving in the right direction and today our people can show everyone they are a peace loving nation who enjoys cricket," the former captain said.Another former captain Javed Miandad also appreciated the efforts of the PCB to bring a top test team to Lahore."This visit by the Sri Lankans will do a lot of good for Pakistan cricket.I think the doors to international cricket in Pakistan will now open up soon," Miandad said.He said that the Sri Lankan government, their cricket board (SLC) and players had shown they were true friends of Pakistan by agreeing to play the match in Lahore."I know it must have not been easy for them after what happened eight years back with them.I can understand if some of their players have pulled out.But the important thing is Sri Lanka is here," Miandad said.Former Pakistan captain and fast bowling great Wasim Akram said he was very happy for the young players of the country."We were fortunate we played a lot of cricket in front of our people but I always felt bad for the current lot of players many of whom never got a chance to play on their own grounds before their own crowds.Thankfully that is now changing," he said.
Shiva, Manoj enter finals of National Boxing Championships:::::VISAKHAPATNAM: There was no stopping the favourites as Shiva Thapa and Manoj Kumar stood just one win away from their second successive national boxing titles after advancing to the marquee domestic event's final, on Sunday.Shiva, a three-time Asian Championships medalist besides being a World Championships bronze-medalist, got the better of Delhi's Buntee Singh 5-0 in his lightweight (60kg) semi-final clash.He will next be up against Services Sports Control Board's (SSCB) Manish Kaushik, the man he had beaten in the previous edition's quarter-final.Manish defeated Punjab's Palwinder Singh 5-0 in his last-four stage bout.Former Commonwealth Games gold-medalist Manoj also continued his fine run as he beat Punjab's Shubaham in the welterweight (69kg) semis.Manoj's summit clash rival would be SSCB's Duryodhan Singh, who defeated Madhya Pradesh's Manish Uikey.Three-time King's Cup gold-medalist K Shyam Kumar , competing for the Railways Sports Promotion Board (RSPB), also advanced to his second successive Nationals' final after putting it past Chandigarh's Vipin Kumar 5-0.Shyam Kumar will square off against Mizoram's Nt Lalbiakkima in the final, aiming to better the silver medal he won in the last edition held in Guwahati.Also advancing to the final was Commonwealth Games silver-medallist Mandeep Jangra , competing in his maiden event in the middleweight (75kg) category.The RSPB boxer defeated Delhi's Parag Chauhan to make the final.
BCCI: BCCI unlikely to cave in to NADA pressure, meeting on November 3:::::NEW DELHI: The BCCI brass will soon have a meeting to chalk out a plan to deal with mounting pressure from the National Anti-Doping Agency NADA ) that wants Virat Kohli and Co under its ambit.There is a Committee of Administrators (CoA) meeting in Mumbai on November 3, where the issue will come up for discussion but, as of now, the Indian cricket's governing body is unlikely to budge from its current stand.The top leadership of BCCI believes that trying to get a Virat Kohli or Mahendra Singh Dhoni sign the 'whereabouts clause' is one of the main reasons behind NADA wanting BCCI to come under its wing.Whereabouts are information provided by a limited number of top elite athletes about their location to the International Sport Federation (IF) or National Anti-Doping Organization (NADA in this case), which include them in their respective registered testing pool as part of these top elite athletes' anti-doping responsibilities.The BCCI had hired Sweden's International Drug Testing Management (IDTM) for testing work and is likely to continue with it.With reports emerging that NADA is likely to send its Doping Control Officers (DCO) during the domestic tournaments and if BCCI doesn't co-operate, will take legal route, but senior board officials are wondering whether that would be as easy as top government officials are making it out to be.The top Indian cricketers, who are always in the spotlight, have time and again protested that signing the whereabouts clause would lead to infringement of privacy."BCCI is not a signatory to NADA code and therefore under no compulsion to release our cricketers for the dope test.We are under ICC, which is WADA compliant.At ICC events, our cricketers are tested by WADA.But since we are not a National Sports Federation (NSF), we are under no obligation to become NADA signatory," a senior BCCI official, privy to the development said.The official then said: "Testimony to our transparent process is the latest WADA report where 153 of our cricketers were tested 'In Competition' and 'Out of Competition' and there was only one dope positive result."Asked about the legal threat, the BCCI official sarcastically said: "BCCI, in any case, is fighting so many legal battles!But seriously, NADA officials think that they will just land up at IPL or Ranji Trophy and force a BCCI registered cricketer to undergo dope test.We didn't know it was this simple."
PM Modi lauds Srikanth, Hockey team; says U-17 WC was huge success:::::NEW DELHI: While addressing the nation via 'Mann ki Baat', Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded India's performance in sports this month that saw the Indian hockey team win the Asia Cup for the first time in 10 years and shuttler Kidambi Srikanth claim the Denmark Open Superseries - to make his third Superseries title this year.PM Modi also spoke about the recently concluded FIFA Under-17 World Cup and said that the event was a huge success."Young Indian players won hearts of fans during the FIFA Under-17 World Cup.Future of football is bright in India," said Modi and added, "After 10 years India won Asia Cup.I congratulate entire team and the support staff and in badminton Kidambi Srikanth won."Among the highlights this month was Srikanth's Denmark Open triumph and the men's hockey team's stellar show in Dhaka.Srikanth, who now has three titles under his belt this year, is aiming for his fourth after reaching the final of the French Open badminton after beating H S Prannoy yesterday in an all-Indian semifinal.While India remained a novice on the football field, it won the bragging rights of conducting a FIFA Under-17 World Cup for the first time, which was declared a "resounding success" by the world body's boss -- Gianni Infantino.It was hardly a surprise given that the hosts managed to break attendance records for an age group world cup.It was a very expected first-round exit from the under-17 World Cup but it was nonetheless made unforgettable for the nation by Jeakson Singh, a 16-year-old son of a street vendor in Manipur, who became the first Indian to score a goal in a FIFA World Cup.The strike against Colombia was certainly one for the history books and is unlikely to be forgotten.Then there were the shuttlers, a consistent bunch of performers, ensuring that almost every weekend had a title up for grabs for the country.The striking feature of the Indians' rising stature in international badminton has been their ability to regularly get the better of Chinese players, the most formidable in the world despite their recent slump.The cricketers, on the other hand, went about their business with usual elan.Kohli's men have been nearly unstoppable for a while now and being at home has made them just a shade more dominating and intimidating.The Australians were the most recent to be at the receiving end of this intensity and they hardly looked like world champions in what can only be described as a sound thrashing.( With PTI Inputs )
Matter of time before India play WC on their own: Rajyavardhan Rathore:::::KOLKATA: Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore on Sunday hoped that the stupendous success of FIFA Under-17 World Cup would motivate the country's budding footballers to improve their game and eye a World Cup qualification in near future."We have got the start.We should not stop here.I hope we get the U-20 World Cup, so that the start gets even bigger momentum.I believe if things go like this, it's not far when India will play in a World Cup on their own," Rathore said before leaving for the capital.Rathore, who was invited for the U-17 World Cup prize distribution ceremony, said all big sporting organisations like FIFA now have India on their radar and the country should make the best use of it."It's a matter of pride that the U-17 World Cup came to India.It has taken India's importance at the world level to greater heights.Now the big competitions and sports which were earlier non-existent in India are feeling the need to come to this country."The fans response has been fantastic, we broke all records of the most attended World Cup ever," said Rathore.The Olympics silver medallist said it was time that football became a pan-India thing."Football is popular only in a few regions like West Bengal, Goa and NorthEast.It's a nice opportunity to make the sport popular all over.We must make full use of this."We will take full responsibility from the Centre by bringing up more infrastructure and prepare elite athletes by looking after their funding and resources.You have seen the overall infrastructure and the modifications that have come in place have been very satisfying.We now need to be prepared for the upcoming competitions," he said.The former shooter had a special word of praise for the sports loving crowd of Kolkata."Kolkata has sports lovers.They understand the sport better.They waited for the ceremony to get over even after the match was over.They showed respect to both the teams.My heartfelt thanks to all the fans of Kolkata."Rathore urged the athletes to be more determined, saying only resources cannot guarantee medals."If you were to win an Olympic medal only because of the money and funding or resources, then the medals list would have the who's who of the society but that's not the case.There's something that is very important in each of us and that is the determination.That's the biggest strength in all of us," he said.Rathore refused to comment on whether the ministry has directed National Anti Doping Agency (NADA) to conduct random tests of the cricketers during domestic and international cricket matches, being played in India.Rahul Bhatnagar, secretary, ministry of youth affairs and sports, said they have received a letter from WADA complaining about non-compliance in cricket."I don't have anything to add to that."
FIFA U-17 World Cup 2017: England beat Spain 5-2 to claim maiden FIFA U-17 World Cup title:::::KOLKATA: Revenge is a dish best served cold.And if you have doubts, ask anyone from Steve Cooper 's pride of Young Lions to vouch for it.England defeated familiar foes Spain in a ruthless, magnificent manner at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.It was an under-17 World Cup final, and England fought and won in style, defying odds and decorating it with an incredible turnaround.It was a performance from Phil Foden and Co that had the record-breaking 66,684 crowd stand up and bow in admiration.England were 0-2 down after the first half an hour of play, but blew away Spain 5-2 in a sensational fightback and emerged the new under-17 World Cup champions.It was an exhibition of their pure class and character where they married their style with a lion-hearted spirit.And the outcome was simply devastating - pure joy to watch, too.It also signalled the birth of a new and young England, at least at the junior level, as they capped their already successful summer - following their under-20 World Cup and Euro under-19 triumphs this year - with another global trophy here.When Spain raced to a 2-0 lead thanks to a brace from Barcelona 'B' team star Sergio Gomez (in the 10th and 31st minutes), it looked to be a one-sided contest and Spain appeared to be on course for their destino perfecto.But from the depth of apparent defeat, England rose like a phoenix and turned the game on its head the way very few would have anticipated.Each time promise revealed itself, even amidst the enormity of the task, England swooped on it and made it count.Rhian Brewster started the turnaround jabbing home Steven Sessegnon's right-wing cross on the cusp of halftime on way to sealing the Golden Boot award for himself with eight goals.And when Morgan Gibbs White made it 2-2 in the 58th minute providing finish to another Sessegnon pass, the game had already started changing course and contour.From there on, Foden - who later received the Golden Ball award from FIFA president Gianni Infantino - took the game away from the Spaniards with a brilliant performance.When the Manchester City wunderkind turned in Callum Hudson-Odoi to make it 3-2 in the 70th minute, England sensed their chances and went about burying the ghost of their under-17 European championship, which they lost in penalty shootout.And when it happened, the noise at the stadium was incredible, almost dizzying.Spain tried their best, pressing and running but without troubling goalkeeper Curtis Anderson.They were simply irresistible for the first half an hour, shredding England's defence at will and showing why they are called the gold standard of passing football.But England overwhelmed them by guile, speed and quality.The intensity of their football was embodied by the magnificent Sessegnon, who played with pace and intelligence, challenging their side backs for oxygen, let alone the ball.And Foden added a touch of beauty to this never-say-die mentality.Centre-back Marc Guehi joined the party in the 84th minute, providing the finish to a beautiful training-ground drill following Hudson-Odoi's free-kick.The entire England bench, including coach Cooper, entered the ground to celebrate the goal.The contest was over and the pain of losing to Spain in Croatia was buried for good.But Foden still had time to inflict more ignominy on the Spaniards, turning Hudson Odoi's brilliant delivery across the face of the goal into the net.
Most of NFL's Houston Texans kneel during anthem after owner's 'inmates' remark:::::(Note: Strong language in pargraph 3) Oct 29, 2017; Seattle, WA, USA; Houston Texans linebacker Lamarr Houston (58) and cornerback Kevin Johnson (30) kneel during the national anthem before kickoff against the Seattle Seahawks at CenturyLink Field.Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports (Reuters) - Most of the National Football Leagues Houston Texans team knelt in protest as the national anthem was played for Sundays game in Seattle, an apparent rebuke of team owner Bob McNair for his remark about inmates running the prison.Backlash over the comment rekindled a national debate over NFL players, mostly African-Americans, who have broken with tradition by taking a knee or raising their fists during The Star-Spangled Banner to protest racial bias in the U.S. criminal justice system.U.S President Donald Trump escalated the controversy in September when he suggested owners should fire any son of a bitch who refused to stand for the anthem.The opening ceremonies of the Texans late-afternoon game against the Seattle Seahawks were not broadcast live on CBS.But the networks Post Game Show aired a brief clip of Houstons players collectively taking a knee with arms linked along the sideline during the national anthem.According to the Seattle Times, nine of the Texans stood for the anthem, but the rest were kneeling or seated.The New York Times said about 40 players in all refused to stand.The players were widely reported to have been planning an en masse demonstration against McNair over his choice of words.Oct 29, 2017; Seattle, WA, USA; Houston Texans defensive tackle Carlos Watkins (91) and teammates kneel during the national anthem before kickoff against the Seattle Seahawks at CenturyLink Field.Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports We cant have the inmates running the prison, McNair was quoted as saying during a recent meeting with league executives and owners, exhorting them to consider how the kneeling protests could hurt the NFLs bottom line.The comment, first disclosed in an article published online by ESPN The Magazine on Friday, sparked immediate outrage from players, fans and supporters of the anthem protests as the NFL sought to tamp down the issue.Oct 29, 2017; Seattle, WA, USA; Houston Texans inside linebacker Benardrick McKinney (55), linebacker Ben Heeney (50), strong safety Marcus Gilchrist (21) and teammates kneel during the national anthem before kickoff against the Seattle Seahawks at CenturyLink Field.Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports In a public apology after meeting on Saturday with the players, McNair, 79, a billionaire who like many NFL owners contributed to Trumps presidential campaign, insisted that his inmates metaphor had been misinterpreted.I was not referring to our players when I made a very regretful comment during the owners meeting last week, he said.I was referring to the relationship between the league office and team owners and how they have been making significant strategic decisions affecting our league without adequate input from ownership over the past few years.He added: I am truly sorry to the players for how this has impacted them and the perception that it has created for me which could not be further from the truth.The national anthem protests began in 2016 when Colin Kaepernick, then a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, began sitting and later kneeling during the anthem to call attention to police shootings of unarmed black men in the United States.Kaepernick was not signed by any team after becoming a free agent following the 2016 season.He has filed a claim of illegal collusion against the leagues owners.
Cubans get best look yet at World Series  a day late:::::HAVANA (Reuters) - Cubans are getting their best look in years at baseballs World Series, watching the games on state TV broadcasts a mere 24 hours after the actual event, despite each team featuring a star Cuban defector.Baseball fan Jose Hernandez (L) shows information he collected from the Internet to his friends as they watch a baseball match that took place the previous day in the U.S. and retransmitted by Cuban state-run television, in Havana, Cuba, October 28, 2017.REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini State television traditionally has shown pirated signals of the championship series of Major League Baseball a few days or even weeks after the event.Last year, it only showed the last game of the World Series.Baseball is the Communist-run islands most popular sport but fans have struggled to follow the World Series in the past because official broadcasts frequently avoided games with Cuban players who had defected.That had become more difficult in recent years with Cuban stars populating more U.S. teams.State TV would sometimes simply edit out their plate appearances.But, with Cuba increasingly connected to the web and open to the West, the World Series this year is being aired with relative swiftness.The door is opening, said Jose Antonio Perez, a chemical engineer, watching the game with friends and family at his home in Havana.We should be able to watch this live but this could be the beginning.The broadcast is just one way in which the island is seeking to show it wants to continue the normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations -- even if President Donald Trumps administration does not.Havana is embroiled in a diplomatic dispute with Washington over the source of what the U.S. considers sonic attacks against its embassy personnel here.DEFECTING BY SPEED BOAT A group of baseball fans meet to share information downloaded from the Internet and discuss about their teams and players at a park in Havana, Cuba, October 27, 2017.Picture taken on October 27, 2017.REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini Because of the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba, Major League Baseball (MLB) is banned from reaching a commercial agreement with Cubas baseball federation over the transfer of players, forcing the best players to defect, typically by speed boat or abandoning the national team when it is playing abroad.Two of those players, Yulieski Gurriel of the Houston Astros and Yasiel Puig of the Los Angeles Dodgers, are playing against each other in this years Fall Classic.This is the weapon that Houston was hoping for, said a commentator on state-run Cuban TV, after Gurriel, 33, hit a home run to put the Astros ahead of Los Angeles early in Fridays Game Three, that was re-broadcast on Saturday.Slideshow (4 Images) Cuban state commentators have also praised the aggressive playing style of Puig, which they said was typically Latin American.The Cuban slugger goes by the nickname, Crazy Horse.Cubas league has been hurting from a massive talent drain in recent years.There were a record 170 baseball defections in 2015, according to Cuban baseball journalist Francys Romero.When Puig left in 2012 as a relative unknown among Cuban fans, he was held captive by human traffickers in the Mexican Caribbean who threatened to cut off his arm over a payment dispute.Throughout much of the defection wave, Gurriel stayed loyal to Cubas national team and his Havana club, the Industriales.He finally left in 2016 at age 31, abandoning a Cuban team traveling in the Dominican Republic.A top MLB official said in 2015, in the wake of the historic U.S.-Cuban detente a year earlier, that it wanted to find a legal way for Cubans to reach the big leagues.Last week, Cuba criticized the United States in an article in the ruling Communist Party newspaper for failing to achieve that goal.The good will of back then seems to have fallen victim to a double play.The authorities dont talk about it and the presence of the relay in the White House does not augur a hit in the strike zone, read the article.
Hamilton takes fourth title despite collision:::::MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - An ecstatic Lewis Hamilton became Britains first four-times Formula One world champion on Sunday after fighting back from last place following an opening-lap collision with arch-rival Sebastian Vettel at the Mexican Grand Prix.F1 - Formula 1 - Mexican Grand Prix 2017 - Mexico City, Mexico - October 29, 2017 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton celebrates after winning the World Championship REUTERS/Edgard Garrido In a race won by 20-year-old Dutch prodigy Max Verstappen, in a Red Bull, the 32-year-old Mercedes driver finished ninth to cement his place as his countrys most successful driver of all time.Vettel, the only man who could have delayed the seemingly inevitable, ended up fourth after starting on pole position and then dropping to 19th following a pitstop to replace a broken front wing.Hamilton has an unassailable lead of 56 points with two races, worth a total of 50, remaining in Brazil and Abu Dhabi.It doesnt feel real.Thats not the kind of race that you want but I never gave up.I kept going right to the end, said a jubilant Hamilton, the British flag proudly draped over his shoulders.He had raised both hands to his helmet as he took the chequered flag, with the crowd rising to applaud.Lewis has done a superb job all year and deserves to win the title, said Vettel.Congratulations to him.It is his day.Sundays race was both the best and worst of afternoons for the sports biggest star, who ended up sprinting down the pitlane chased by fans.A winner nine times this season, including five of the six before Mexico, ninth was his lowest placing of the campaign and he did it despite having a badly damaged car at a track where overtaking is difficult enough anyway.Hamiltons team mate Valtteri Bottas finished second at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez with Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen third.AGGRESSIVE MOVE Vettel had needed to be in the top two to have any chance of taking the title fight down to Brazil in two weeks time but his already slim hopes seemed to have disappeared within seconds of the start.Verstappen, with nothing to lose and everything to gain from his front row position, seized the lead with an aggressive move through the opening right-left-right corners and the Red Bull bumping wheels with Vettel as he went through.Hamilton, starting in third place, tried to follow Verstappen but the Ferraris front wing sliced Hamiltons rear right tire as they made contact at turn three.F1 - Formula 1 - Mexican Grand Prix 2017 - Mexico City, Mexico - October 29, 2017 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton celebrates after winning the World Championship REUTERS/Edgard Garrido Did he hit me deliberately?asked Hamilton over the radio, limping back to the pits and fully aware that Vettels only real hope of getting back into the reckoning would be if the Briton went out.Not sure, Lewis, his race engineer Peter Bonnington said in reply.It looked far from deliberate and stewards swiftly decided that no further investigation of the incident was necessary.Vettel pitted while Hamilton, who had started the day 66 points clear of his rival, had a longer stop while mechanics inspected his car for further damage.The incident robbed the crowd of the prospect of a real duel between the two contenders, who will both be four-times champions when next season starts, but they still provided thrills as they fought back.Slideshow (13 Images) HIGH FIVE Hamilton, who had a thrilling wheel-to-wheel tussle with former McLaren team mate Fernando Alonso in the latter stages that could have cost him dear, had hoped to celebrate by spraying the winners champagne from the top of the podium.Instead, there was the considerable consolation of being one of only five men -- Germanys Michael Schumacher, Argentinas Juan Manuel Fangio, Frances Alain Prost and Vettel -- to win four titles or more since the championship started in 1950.Prost and Vettel both have four, with the late Fangio on five and Schumacher seven.Hamiltons tally of titles took him above fellow-Briton Jackie Stewart and also his late Brazilian idol Ayrton Senna in the all-time lists.An unusual way to be world champion but you are world champion very simple.Nobody cares how you do it, said Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, himself a triple champion.Who cares?Its about the result, said team boss Toto Wolff, when asked how it had felt to see Hamilton lapped by Verstappen.He was lapped because he was crashed into.The victory was the third of Verstappens career and second of the season, cementing the youngsters position as the rising star of the sport.Frances Esteban Ocon was fifth for Force India, with his Mexican team mate Sergio Perez seventh and behind the Williams of Canadian rookie Lance Stroll.Danish driver Kevin Magnussen was eighth for Haas with Alonso taking the final point.

Wozniacki stands firm to claim WTA Finals title:::::SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Caroline Wozniackis cruise to the biggest win of her career turned into a desperate struggle before the Dane finally subdued Venus Williams 6-4 6-4 in the WTA Finals title showdown at an enthralled Singapore Indoor Stadium on Sunday.Tennis - WTA Tour Finals - Singapore Indoor Stadium, Singapore - October 29, 2017 Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki celebrates with the trophy after winning the final against USA's Venus Williams REUTERS/Edgar Su The 27-year-old former world number one entered the contest having lost to the evergreen Williams seven times in as many matches but the resilient Dane served and retrieved brilliantly to emerge with a deserved victory after 88 minutes.Wozniacki was flawless for an hour as she raced to a set and 5-0 lead but Williams is renowned for an insatiable desire to win and the 37-year-old reeled off four games in a row before her increasingly anxious opponent finally closed out the match.I felt like it was a little bit of an uphill battle, to be honest.I knew she was stepping it up, she had nothing to lose at that point, and she really went for it.Things were going in for her, Wozniacki told reporters.I just had to keep reminding myself that Im still up and Im the one who is leading here, and Im the one who can close out this match right now.The first three games were dominated by the server until the Dane began to find the corners of the court with her powerful backhand, fashioning the first break of the match with back-to-back winners off both flanks.Williams was trying to get to the net at every opportunity and came forward to good effect in the next game, with a vicious cross-court backhand enabling her to break back immediately on her way to leveling the score at 3-3.The American continued to be the aggressor but the Dane held on in the face of some brutal hitting and somehow forged her second break of the set with some exquisite deep groundstrokes to move within a game of taking the opener.Tennis - WTA Tour Finals - Singapore Indoor Stadium, Singapore - October 29, 2017 Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki stands next to the trophy after winning the final against USA's Venus Williams REUTERS/Edgar Su GIFTED SET The American came roaring back once more, however, leaving the Dane looking on as a helpless spectator at a barrage of winners that put the high-class contest back on serve.After working so hard to stay in touch, Williams would have been deeply frustrated to gift her opponent the set when the Dane was handed the third break in a row as the wayward American sent a string of forehands wide, long and into the net.Slideshow (8 Images) Wozniacki had seized the momentum and with her variation, depth of shot and complete lack of errors preventing Williams from grabbing any sort of foothold in the contest, the flying Dane raced into a 5-0 lead in 11 second-set minutes.Needing to hold serve just to stay in the contest, Williams found her rhythm to prevent a dreaded bagel and then secured her first break of the second set with some solid play against an opponent who was showing the first signs of getting tight.Williams, meanwhile, now appeared relaxed and free, holding easily to heap more pressure on the Dane before stretching every muscle and sinew in her body to break once more in a thrilling ninth game to make it 5-4.The crowd wanted more but Wozniacki was not prepared to comply with their demands, breaking again to seal victory on her second match point with a backhand winner down the line and tossing her racket in the air as she celebrated a stunning win.Yeah, you know, she played really well the whole match.You know, I played well parts of the match and tried my best, Williams, who won the event in 2008, said.Wozniackis triumph was her second of the season in eight finals after she successfully defended her Pan Pacific Open title in Tokyo last month.The Dane will rise three places to world number three in Mondays rankings.
Halep gains consolation from year-end number one status:::::SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Simona Halep is still searching for her first grand slam title but the Romanian admits the consolation of ending the year as world number one will help to motivate her for another tilt at a major title breakthrough next season.Tennis - WTA Tour Finals - Singapore Indoor Stadium, Singapore - October 29, 2017 Simona Halep of Romania poses with her WTA Year-End World Number One trophy during a news conference.REUTERS/Jeremy Lee The 26-year-old suffered a crushing defeat to an inspired Jelena Ostapenko in the French Open final in June, her second title-match loss at Roland Garros, but a win over the Latvian in Beijing this month took her to the top of the rankings.Well, I can say that its a great feeling that I can finish the year number one, Halep told reporters at the WTA Finals in Singapore on Sunday after it was confirmed she would remain as number one until the start of 2018.Of course, the best moment was on court when I won against Ostapenko in Beijing.But also its more special to finish the year, as we can see that less players finished the year as number one in the world and I think its more difficult to do that.Halep, who failed to make it out of the round-robin phase in a Singapore tournament won by Caroline Wozniacki on Sunday, said she was relaxed now but expected the burden of the ranking to rise when the next campaign begins.Well, now I dont feel any pressure because the season is finished but I can imagine that its going to be a little bit more difficult, she added.I have to work harder to stay there but in my mind now is just to enjoy the moment and we will see.I touched everything I wanted about my dream in this way because I have many others.But I just want to be relaxed, to enjoy tennis more and to give my best every time I go on court.I think this is everything I can ask from myself.The Romanian enjoyed a frustrating campaign in terms of tournament wins, claiming just one title at the Madrid Open, but Halep was keen to stress that it was another season in which she was able to learn more about herself.I had many ups and downs but I was consistent, in my opinion, she added.It was a tough one.Of course every week I went back on court, working.Even when I lost in the first round at the U.S. Open, I went back on court and I tried to improve in my game, which I did.Im really happy that I could stay constant, which is the best thing, I think, for a player.And also that Im fit.I have no problems now, no injuries.So Im just trying to make the off-season better and to start the next year better.

Cap That Shielded Jackie Robinson From Racist Pitchers Fetches Record Amount at Auction:::::Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.The padded cap protected him from racist pitchers.A Brooklyn Dodgers cap worn by Jackie Robinson has been auctioned for a record amount.The blue cap sold for $590,000 Saturday after a monthlong online auction through the sports auctioneers Lelands.It's the most money ever exchanged for a hat at auction.Lelands says Robinson wore the hat when he broke baseball's color barrier in 1947.That year he joined the Dodgers and became the first black athlete to play in the segregated MLB in the 20th century.Robinson endured constant racist taunts during his rookie year, and pitchers frequently threw at his head.The specially-padded cap helped protect him from beanings by the pitchers.The padded cap came with a letter from Robinson's widow, Rachel, describing the three protective plates sewn inside the lining.The 95-year-old Rachel Robinson was in Los Angeles on Tuesday to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at Game 1 of the World Series between the Dodgers and the Houston Astros.Batting helmets didn't become mandatory in the Major Leagues until 1956.Top Tri-State News Photos
Opinion Shifting Toward Athletes' Anthem Protests: Poll:::::AP reporters counted more than 200 NFL players who did not stand during the national anthem before their games on Sunday.(Published Monday, Sept. 25, 2017) Americans are split in a new poll on rules that would require professional athletes to kneel for the national anthem, a real shift in favor of their right to protest, NBC News reported.Fifty-one percent of respondents to an HBO Real Sports/Marist poll said they opposed leagues requiring that players stand, while 47 percent supported such rules.The four-point difference is within the Oct. 15-17 poll's margin of error, which makes it a statistical tie.But when the poll was conducted a year ago, a clear majority supported rules requiring players to stand, by a mark of 52 to 43.Since then, President Donald Trump threw a spotlight on the athletes following the example of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who began kneeling for the anthem in August 2016.

Dodgers Advance to World Series for 1st Time Since 1988, After Routing Cubs, 11-1, in Game 5 of NLCS:::::Check out the behind the scenes footage including interviews with Cody Bellinger and Yasiel Puig as the Los Angeles Dodgers Advance to their first World Series since 1988.(Published Friday, Oct. 20, 2017) The iconic words of Vin Scully were first spoken 29 years ago, the last time the Los Angeles Dodgers were in the World Series: "In a year that has been so improbable, the impossible has happened."After nearly three decades, the wait is finally over the Dodgers are going back to the World Series.Enrique Hernandez hit three home runs, including a grand slam, as the Dodgers punched their ticket to the Fall Classic, defeating the Chicago Cubs, 11-1, in Game 5 of the NLCS on Thursday night at Wrigley Field.In 1988, the last time the Dodgers went to the World Series, Clayton Kershaw was just seven months old.Twenty-nine years later, he was on the mound when they won the pennant."We've heard 1988 for so long in L.A., it feels good to say that we're getting to go to the World Series in 2017," Kershaw said after the victory."With four more wins, hopefully we get to bring one home."Top Sports Photos: Lewis Hamilton Wins 4th F1 Championship Kershaw (2-0), threw six innings, allowing just one run on three hits with one walk and five strikeouts in the third potential-clinching start in his postseason career.In those games, the three-time NL Cy Young Award winner is a perfect 3-0 when he takes the mound with a chance to advance his team to the next round."To get to be on the mound tonight and get to be going to the World Series on the same night, it's a special thing," Kershaw said."Who knows how many times I'm going to get to go to the World Series.I know more than anybody how hard it is to get there.So, I'm definitely not taking this one for granted."Since 2013, Kershaw had only gotten one run of support in four total starts in the NLCS over the course of his career.In his only two starts in 2017, he got 16 runs of support."That's a testament to this team and what we stand for," Kershaw said of the support from the offense."As a starting pitcher, when you get seven runs, your job is to get them back in the dugout as fast as possible."In order to end the drought, the Dodgers needed to go through the Cubs, the reigning World Series Champions, a team that slayed their own demons only one year prior.Los Angeles wasted little time dispatching the champs.After a nine-pitch lead-off walk to Chris Taylor to start the game, Cody Bellinger roped a double down the right field line, giving the Dodgers a 1-0 lead."What [Taylor] has done for our lineup all year long, settling into the lead-off spot, getting on base, hitting balls over the fence.He's a dynamic player and table-setter," said teammate Justin Turner, who was named Co-MVP of the NLCS along with Taylor."When he goes, we usually go as a team.I think you guys saw that here in the postseason."One inning later, Hernandez started off the second inning swinging, as he jumped all over a first-pitch fastball from Cubs' starter Jose Quintana, hitting it to straightaway center for a solo home run.Hernandez wasn't finished.After an RBI single from Turner gave the Dodgers a 3-0 lead, Quintana loaded the bases before leaving the game for Hector Rondon.Once again, the Puerto Rican was swinging on the first pitch, and this time, Hernandez sent a slider into the basket in right-center for a grand slam home run."I blacked out," Hernandez said of the fourth grand slam ever hit in Dodgers' postseason history."I can't even describe it you know.I was thinking the entire game, 'Man, this is unbelievable.'"Hernandez not only sent the Dodgers to the World Series with his bat, he also became the first Dodger since Adrian Gonzalez in 2013 to hit multiple homers in a postseason game."I don't remember much of the game," Hernandez admitted."The whole game is a blur.I remember the first two, but I definitely don't remember the last one.It's awesome!"As Wrigley Field fell silent as the shrouded dead, one voice could be heard that of Hernandez's father, Enrique Hernandez Sr., one year removed from a life-threatening battle with cancer, fresh off an evacuation from his homeland because of Hurricane Maria.Despite it all, he stood and cheered.He just watched his son have the game of his life, in the biggest moment of his career."Honestly, I couldn't wait for this game to end so I could give my dad a big old hug," Hernandez said as he fought back tears."Everything that he's been through the last year or so, and everything he went through for me to be here on this stage right now means the world to me."Quintana (0-1) lasted only two innings, surrendering six runs on six hits with one walk and one strikeout in his fourth start of the postseason with the Cubs."Quintana was a great addition," said Cubs manager Joe Maddon after the game."[The Dodgers] know what it feels like coming off last year, we were celebrating versus them in this exact same spot."John Lackey entered the game in the fourth inning for the Cubs and served up a two-run double to Logan Forsythe that gave Los Angeles a 9-0 lead.The two innings of relief may have been the last ever seen of Lackey as the 38-year-old's contract is up at the end of the season.He could be leaning toward retirement at the end of the year."John and I go way back," Maddon said."John and I were together with the Angels in the 2002 World Series team.So it's really special for me with John.Hopefully it's not his last year, but if it is, having that chance to be with him in that moment is pretty special for me."Kris Bryant hit his first home run of the postseason in the bottom of the fourth, a laser beam off Kershaw over the scoreboard in left field, for the Cubs' only run of the game.The Cubs became the first team in Major League history to score all of their runs as home runs in a series that went at least five games."Every year is different," Maddon said on why his offense wasn't able to replicate the same success as last year."We have all these incredible numbers from last year, but every year is different."Just for good measure, Hernandez hit his third home run of the game off Mike Montgomery in the top of ninth, to put the exclamation point on his historical night."I may have had a great game, but this is not about me, this is about this team," Hernandez said, as his teammates celebrated around him in the winning locker room."Tonight it was me, but every night its someone different coming up big for us.Luckily enough, tonight it was me."Hernandez is just the ninth player in MLB history to have three homers in a postseason game, joining like the likes of Babe Ruth, Reggie Jackson, and Albert Pujols.Hernandez finished the game three-for-four with three home runs and a league championship record seven RBIs.To put that in perspective, the Cubs scored eight runs in the entire series."I blacked out and four hours later I had three homers and seven RBI," Hernandez said."There's a very big God up there that blessed me tonight, and grandpa, I appreciate it because I know you had something to do with it."Earlier in the season, Hernandez lost his grandfather and left the team to fly to Puerto Rico to be with his family."Kik told me before the game, 'Hey, I've got your back tonight,'" Kershaw said."He said that before I even went out and took the mound.Then he goes and hits three home runs."Kenta Maeda, Brandon Morrow and Kenley Jansen pitched the final three innings of the game as the Dodgers bullpen set an NLCS record with 17 scoreless innings of relief."We wanted the defending champs," Jansen said after the game."We know how much it sucks to lose here and see the fans enjoy it in front of us.We wanted to make a statement.We wanted to come here and we wanted to win in front of them.It's not over yet.Hopefully, we can bring the championship back home."The Dodgers' pen has a scoreless innings streak of 23, a new MLB postseason record, surpassing the 1977 New York Yankees.However, the rest of the game was a mere formality as both teams went through the motions before the Dodgers popped champagne aged 29 years in the visiting clubhouse.The victory earned the Dodgers their 22nd National League pennant, the second most in league history behind only their rivals, the Giants, who have 23.Nearly one year ago, the Cubs clinched their first World Series berth since 1945 against these same Dodgers.That night, as the mob of adoring fans celebrated in Wrigleyville, the Dodgers team buses were unable to leave, so the players had to wait over two hours in the visiting locker room.During that time, the Dodgers sat and stewed, thinking about this exact moment that could occur one year later, and how great it would be to beat the Cubs on their own field to advance to the World Series.Revenge is, indeed, sweet.Up Next: The Dodgers advance to the World Series, awaiting either the Houston Astros or New York Yankees for Game 1 at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday, Oct. 24.

Full Recovery Expected for Hayward After Injury in Celtics Debut:::::Boston Celtics head coach Brad Stevens said he expects Gordon Hayward to make a full recovery from the gruesome injury he suffered in Tuesday's season opener.(Published Thursday, Oct. 19, 2017) The Boston Celtics said Gordon Hayward is expected to make a "full recovery" after undergoing successful surgery on Wednesday night.The team announced Thursday afternoon that Hayward underwent "successful bony and ligamentous stabilization surgery for the fracture dislocation of his left ankle" sustained in Tuesday night's season opener.Hayward's father tweeted Thursday morning the surgery was 'a big success,' and his wife Robyn posted her own message on social media saying "He did great with surgery!So now we are starting the recovery process."His agent, Mark Bartelstein, added that the surgery "went really well."No timetable has been set for his return, but Bartelstein told ESPN it remains unlikely the 27-year-old forward will return this season.The Celtics player had arrived at New England Baptist Hospital on Wednesday after flying in from Cleveland, where he and former Cavaliers point guard Kyrie Irving played their first game in Celtics green.Hayward came down awkwardly after an alley-oop pass in the first quarter, dislocating his left ankle and fracturing his leg.In a video message on the Celtics' Twitter page Wednesday, Hayward spoke to his fans from his hospital bed."Wanted to say thank you to everyone whose had me in their thoughts and prayers," he said."I'm gonna be alright."Hurting me that I can't be there for the home opener," Hayward went on to say in his video tweet."I want nothing more than to be with my teammates and to walk out on that floor tonight.But I'll be supporting you guys from here and wishing you the best of luck."While the team initially tweeted that Hayward had been diagnosed with a broken ankle, Stevens said in a press conference Wednesday that hospital tests had confirmed his actual injuries."He put a lot of effort into trying to start his career out well in Boston, but this is a setback," Stevens added.Despite the setback, the coach said he believes Hayward will be back to full health."We are expecting a full recovery," he said."We know there are going to be a lot of tough days ahead on that recovery, but at the same time, I think, hopefully, he'll improve day to day."Stevens coached Hayward at Butler University.After spending the first seven seasons of his NBA career with the Utah Jazz, Hayward signed a four-year, $128 million contract to play for his college coach in Boston.As Hayward lay on the court Tuesday night, the Quicken Loans Arena fell silent, with Celtics and Cavs players alike showing their concern.The crowds erupted in applause when he was carried off the floor on a stretcher.The following day, athletes and fans have taken to social media to support Hayward."Thanks for all the prayers for Gordon and our family," Hayward's wife, Robyn, tweeted Wednesday."It sucks, but this is what happens."Robyn Hayward's tweet included a quote, reading, "When everything seems like it's falling apart that's when God is putting things together just the way he wants it."In their opener, the Celtics came back from a 16-point halftime deficit and jockeyed with Cleveland for the lead in the fourth quarter.The Cavs won their first game 102-99.Wednesday night, the Celtics played their home opener without Hayward against the Milwaukee Bucks, but it was clear Hayward was on the mind of everyone.Love for the forward was evident in every corner of TD Garden, as fans who miss him signed a giant "get well soon" banner for him, gave him a standing ovation, and even chanted his name.The Bucks beat the Celtics 108100.

separate criminal sexual conduct charges and has been sued by more than 125 women alleging abuse.Nassar has pleaded not guilty to the assault charges, and the dozens of civil suits filed in Michigan are currently in mediation.Maroney, now 21, says the abuse began while attending a U.S. National team training camp at the Karolyi Ranch in the Sam Houston Forest north of Houston, Texas.Maroney was 13 at the time and wrote that Nassar told her she was receiving "medically necessary treatment he had been performing on patients for over 30 years."Maroney did not detail Nassar's specific actions.Maroney, who won a team gold and an individual silver on vault as part of the "Fierce Five" U.S. women's team at the 2012 Olympics in London, said Nassar continued to give her "treatment" throughout her career.She described Nassar giving her a sleeping pill while the team traveled to Japan for the 2011 world championships.Maroney says Nassar later visited her in her hotel room after the team arrived in Tokyo, where he molested her yet again."I thought I was going to die that night," Maroney wrote.Maroney did not immediately return an interview request from The Associated Press.Attorneys for Nassar had no comment.Maroney says she decided to come forward as part of the "#MeToo" movement on social media that arose in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein."This is happening everywhere," Maroney wrote."Wherever there is a position of power, there is the potential for abuse.I had a dream to go to the Olympics, and the things I had to endure to get there, were unnecessary and disgusting."Maroney called for change, urging other victims to speak out and demanding organizations "be held accountable for their inappropriate actions and behavior."Maroney is the highest profile gymnast yet to come forward claiming she was abused by Nassar.Jamie Dantzscher, a bronze medalist on the 2000 U.S. Olympic team, was part of the initial wave of lawsuits filed against Nassar in 2016.Aly Raisman, who won six medals while serving as the captain of the U.S. women's team in both 2012 and 2016, called for sweeping change at USA Gymnastics in August.USA Gymnastics launched an independent review of its policies in the wake of the allegations against Nassar in the summer of 2016 following reporting by the Indianapolis Star that highlighted chronic mishandling of abuse allegations against coaches and staff at some of its more than 3,500 clubs across the country.In June, the federation immediately adopted 70 recommendations proffered by Deborah Daniels, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw the review.The new guidelines require member gyms to go to authorities immediately, with Daniels suggesting USA Gymnastics consider withholding membership from clubs that decline to do so.The organization also named Toby Stark, a child welfare advocate, as its director of SafeSport.Part of Stark's mandate is educating members on rules, educational programs, reporting and adjudication services.USA Gymnastics praised Maroney's strength in a statement on Wednesday, adding it is "outraged and disgusted" by Nassar's alleged conduct."We are strengthening and enhancing our policies and procedures regarding abuse, as well as expanding our educational efforts to increase awareness of signs to watch for and reporting suspicions of abuse, including the obligation to immediately report," USA Gymnastics wrote."USA Gymnastics, its members and community are committed to working together to keep our athletes as safe as possible."The organization had initially agreed to purchase the training facility at the Karolyi Ranch following longtime national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's retirement shortly after the 2016 Olympics ended.The organization has since opted out of that agreement.Steve Penny, longtime president and CEO, resigned in March.A replacement has not been named.The allegations and fallout have reached Capitol Hill.Two different pieces of legislation are in the works that call for greater responsibility for organizations that oversee Olympic sports to immediately report sex-abuse allegations to law enforcement or child-welfare authorities.California Sen. Dianne Feinstein issued a release Wednesday saying she is putting the finishing touches on a bill she is co-sponsoring that would make failure to report sexual abuse a crime."It has become clear that for too long, amateur athletics organizations have shirked their responsibility of protecting young, vulnerable children," Feinstein wrote."That must stop, and it must stop now."Maroney, who lives in California and officially retired in 2015, encouraged others to speak out."Our silence has given the wrong people power for too long," she wrote, "and it's time to take our power back."
Search Firm: Whom should Florida hire to replace Jim McElwain?:::::The SEC coaching landscape is forever fluid, but few expected the Florida job to open this season.Even fewer expected it to be the first in-season SEC coaching vacancy.Jim McElwain is out as Gators coach, ending a bizarre and tension-filled period in Gainesville.Despite winning two SEC East division titles, McElwain was let go after his team dropped to 3-4 after?a 42-7 loss to rival Georgia.He went 22-12 (16-8) with the Gators.Florida is back in the market for a coach for the third time since two-time national championship winner Urban Meyer moved on after the 2010 season.Where should Florida turn after the McElwain mess?ESPN.com's search firm is on the job.Senior staff writer Chris Low and staff writer Alex Scarborough, both of whom have years of experience covering the SEC, join me to break down the Florida job, what the school wants and who should be next to lead a program with three national titles since 1996.Where the Florida job stands Alex Scarborough: It's a good location, and there's a lot to like about it.But if you're a coach looking at this job, you have to ask yourself what they want from it.McElwain's won-loss record speaks for itself, so you have to wonder: Do they want a coach who will?win, or do they want a coach who will?play with style points?Some guys, I wonder how they'll?respond to something like that.When you look at the footprint, the resources, there's obviously a lot to like.Chris Low: It's still one of the best five to eight jobs in college football.Florida has made more of an investment, but are they totally committed to being one of the best programs in the country?The coaches' offices are still in the stadium.Look around the country and the SEC.How many coaches are still working out of the stadium?Now, I know they're building a new operations building, but Florida has always been behind the times when it comes to reinvesting in their football program.They sort of lived on the Steve Spurrier years, and then Urban Meyer had that great run, but they have not reinvested until recently.That's probably a question a lot of people will have.Are they fully committed across campus to be a football power, the way Alabama is, the way Ohio State is?Scarborough: Do you want to challenge yourself by being in the SEC and competing with a resurgent Georgia and always having the specter of Alabama?But on top of that, do you really want to go into Florida, where Florida State, with the exception of this year, has really had it rolling?Miami's getting it going.There's a lot of talent in that state, but there's a lot of competition there.Adam Rittenberg: They have to look a certain way at Florida.That's what is unique about the Florida fan base, maybe unlike anywhere else in the SEC.They were in many ways spoiled by Spurrier; not just the winning but the exciting offense.And that continued with Meyer.Winning games clearly wasn't enough with McElwain, who claimed titles in a down division and whose teams didn't look a certain way.I wonder how much that plays into it, not just for coaching candidates but also for Florida.How much of that aesthetic is attached to this particular job?Low: I've spoken to two Gator guys the past few years and the question is always: When will we?start looking like we used to offensively?That's sort of interwoven in that fan base.They'll?be entertaining; they'll?score points; they'll?be dynamic offensively.Whoever they get, they better know that you better win the way the Gators want you to win.Scarborough: They want offense there, but it's not just that Florida's offense hasn't been good.It's been dreadful.It's really a lack of creativity, a lack of playmakers, which doesn't add up when you look at the talent they've had and the talent around them in recruiting.So yes, there's an expectation that they score points, but they haven't been good or average with McElwain and Will Muschamp.To say they have to get a coach who scores 40 points a game isn't necessarily true.You just want a competent offense with a quarterback who can throw the ball downfield.I can understand the frustration from the fan base on that.What Florida wants Rittenberg: They had a defensive-oriented head coach [Muschamp], and the offense was dreadful.They had an offensive-oriented head coach [McElwain], and it hasn't looked much better aside from those few games when Will Grier was at quarterback.So, is it 100 percent that the next guy should be an offense guy?I think so.But maybe there is some flexibility there with the candidate pool.Scarborough: You don't necessarily have to be a whiz offensively.But you have to show you can recruit and develop quarterbacks and recruit the offensive skill positions.It probably will come down to a former offensive play-caller.But more than anything, the quarterback position is what they'll have to take a long, hard look at -- a guy who not just has the scheme offensively, but can develop that position.Rittenberg: The quarterback thing has reached an inexcusable level, so it's important.Knowledge of that fan base and the landscape will help.It will be hard if you've never recruited in that area to go in and have success.You mention Florida State, but talking to coaches, they all point to Miami and the talent they're bringing in.You're in a state everybody recruits.Clemson recruits there, Georgia recruits there, Florida State and Miami.So it's hard to go in cold.Scarborough: They need to pull playmakers out of that state.We all know they're there, and we know Florida has been lacking them.Low: They need somebody who can assemble a staff that has relationships in that state and go in and recruit and get the premium talent.You've got to know people in that state, who to deal with them and how to deal with them.The candidates Mississippi State coach Dan Mullen: He makes a lot of sense.He's been at Florida as an offensive coordinator.He developed elite quarterbacks there, including a Heisman Trophy winner [Tim Tebow].He knows the SEC.He's overachieved to a degree at Mississippi State in a tougher division, so there are obvious connections, and he checks many of the boxes.-- Rittenberg He checks a lot of boxes except the "won big games" box.That's the one knock Mullen has had on him.When the Bulldogs have been ranked and playing a quality ranked team, they've failed over and over and over again.We can talk about the disparity in talent, from Mississippi State to an Alabama or an Auburn, but that track record, as it's built up through the years, has been an issue.And the recruiting aspect of this, Mullen is not a true recruiter.He does not get up for it like a lot of coaches do.If he can assemble a staff to supplement that, he could be fine.But that part of it, in a state that's so competitive, is important.-- Scarborough UCF coach Scott Frost: He's had tremendous success in his second year.He's regarded by many as the top Group of 5 coaching candidate in this cycle.He's in the state, so he has familiarity.His offense is different than what you see around most of the SEC.The only knock on him is they went the Group of 5 route with McElwain, so will you?do that again?But Scott is a pretty interesting name.-- Rittenberg I really like the idea of calling him and seeing what he has to say about how he would approach the job.I know Florida will want a guy heavy on experience, but Frost is a guy you can build long-term with and see what he can do.Maybe [Georgia coach] Kirby Smart being young influences them.He had even less experience when he walked into Georgia.I wonder if that weighs on them at all.It's easy to go for a guy with eight, 10, 12 years of experience.But if you get a younger guy and build from the foundation, it can be something special.Frost really fits that.-- Scarborough Frost is a natural.He's already in that state.He worked in a great offense at Oregon.He would be on my list as well.-- Low Former Oregon and NFL coach Chip Kelly: Because he brings that excitement level on offense, if you hire Kelly, you'll immediately excite that fan base.And they might not worry as much about the pieces, because he's always had this exciting offense, even when they had good but not across-the-board elite talent at Oregon.What he does is so different than what you see around the SEC.He would immediately get the Gator fans juiced up.-- Rittenberg Memphis coach Mike Norvell: His offense is a hot commodity right now, and he's done a great job at Memphis.He should definitely be on their list.-- Low TCU coach Gary Patterson: If Patterson's ever going to leave, it will be for a job like this, a Georgia, a Florida.He's proved he can coach, and he's a great developer of talent.-- Low He's an example of a guy who has not necessarily made his name on offense but has shown the ability to oversee quality offenses and keep his hands out of it.-- Scarborough Former Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops: I'd at least call him and make sure he wants to stay retired because he would be a check-every-box guy.He said he's done, and I believe him, but it's Florida and it's potentially a lot of money.You see if he really wants to stay retired.-- Scarborough I think Stoops is done coaching, but it's worth a call.-- Low USF coach Charlie Strong: Because of Strong's contacts and ties in that state, he would be one to talk to.He knows all the high school coaches, and he recruits his rear end off.Nobody knows that state as well as he does.He'd clean up with the Florida brand recruiting.He would need to surround himself with a great offensive mind.-- Low Oregon coach Willie Taggart: I know he just left for Oregon, but he's a Florida guy.He had success at USF.He recruited a great quarterback in Quinton Flowers.Maybe he wants to get back home.He's doing a pretty nice job with the Ducks and has an offensive background.-- Rittenberg I think after one year, when you're getting it rolling there, you can see what you can build there.In the Pac-12, you can deal with a little less heat than if he walked into Gainesville.They'll?expect him to walk in there, win and score points right away.-- Scarborough The Search Firm recommends: UCF coach Scott Frost There are flashier options like Chip Kelly or pie-in-the-sky ones like Bob Stoops, but Frost makes the most sense for what Florida needs right now.He's a proven offensive coach with a dynamic scheme that few are running in the region.Frost also has evolved the scheme from his time at Oregon and would attract the playmakers, specifically the quarterbacks, that Florida desperately needs.The Gators could go with an older, more seasoned coach like Mullen, but Frost is a rising star who could get this program back to national prominence.And he would entertain a fan base that cares about how Florida looks when it wins.The firm thinks the time is right for Florida to make a strong push for Frost and bring him to Gainesville.
Gaffes, TV ratings concerns dominated as NFL, players forged anthem peace:::::This story appears in ESPN The Magazine's Nov. 13 issue.Subscribe today!NOBODY KNEW WHERE to sit.Side by side or across from one another?It was the final question raised by a group of 11 NFL team owners as they mingled inside the sixth-floor conference room at the league's Park Avenue headquarters in New York City, minutes before they were to meet with a group of 12 players, one former player and three union leaders on the morning of Tuesday, Oct. 17.The day already had been stressful, and the meeting hadn't even started.League executives had spent that morning as they had the previous four weeks: grappling with a series of events the league and owners could not control, unleashed by President Donald Trump's harsh criticism of the decision by a handful of players to kneel during the national anthem.Morale was bad inside the league office, and the pressure was not letting up.There was the looming notion that sponsors would leave the NFL -- not just because of the protests but because of an array of challenges confronting the league, including the continuing decline in TV ratings.Nearly all of the league's longtime sponsors, from Papa John's to USAA, were rattled, and fissures within the league offices and teams, to say nothing of the players, were starting to expand.Among many league and team executives, the games had become, improbably, an afterthought.These two days of New York meetings held the potential to provide a measure of hope -- a way for owners to formulate a plan with players that would satisfy disenchanted fans and advertisers.It was no secret that commissioner Roger Goodell and the owners wanted the players to stop kneeling during the anthem immediately.A week earlier, Goodell said that he hoped owners and players could "move past" the anthem issue at the meetings.If and how that could be accomplished was unclear.After Goodell's statement, Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys' owner, threatened to bench any player who knelt, the only owner to issue such an ultimatum, one that won praise in Texas and across much of America's heartland.Spurred on by Jones' stance, some hard-line owners looked at the meetings as the opportunity to vote on a mandate that would force all players to stand for the anthem.For weeks, Goodell had tried to get in front of the issue.One owner had complained that NBA commissioner Adam Silver got away with ordering players to stand because, unlike Goodell, he has a good relationship with the union.Another owner had remarked to a colleague that Trump would like nothing more than for players to strike over the protests, maybe forcing a suspension of the season.As owners filed into the large conference room featuring a massive, football-shaped table, everyone feared the discussion could get ugly.NFL executive Troy Vincent, who cared deeply about the players' concerns but had little patience for the protests, called San Francisco 49ers GM John Lynch the Saturday before the meeting.He told him that if safety Eric Reid, one of the most ardent protesters, knelt the next day, he shouldn't "bother to show up" at the players-owners meeting because nobody would take him seriously, according to people briefed on the call.Reid knelt anyway.And he intended to show up.Just before Reid and the other players and union leadership arrived, talk among the owners turned to a final issue, small but symbolic: the seating arrangement.In collective bargaining negotiations, the owners sat opposite players and union representatives.But Goodell told the owners their job that morning was to listen; the session was not a negotiation or anything that could be resolved by a quid pro quo.The owners decided the meeting would have to start with the tiniest of gestures: We'll sit side by side with the players.THE NIGHT BEFORE that meeting, Jerry Jones stood in a suite at Yankee Stadium, watching the Yankees play the Houston Astros in the ALCS but also, perhaps, catching a terrifying glimpse into his future.The Cowboys are what the Yankees once were: America's most iconic team in America's most iconic -- and patriotic -- sport.Jones was a man at the pinnacle of his profession that chilly night, the Hall of Fame owner whose power among his peers is drawn from a relentless skill at growing the NFL's total revenues and the guile to outmuscle everyone.But those who have spoken with him sense a dull panic, as if so much of what the NFL has built -- what he has built since buying the Cowboys in 1989 -- is eroding.Jones and his fellow owners had arrived in New York that day like heads of state, setting up shop at the Four Seasons and in their own apartments with a clear agenda: Stop Trump from attacking our business.Find a way to persuade players to stop kneeling.Get the focus back to football.But the owners had far different ideas about how to accomplish such difficult goals, according to nearly two dozen interviews Outside the Lines conducted with owners, league and team executives, players and lawyers briefed on the two days of closed-door meetings.For one thing, this was not the usual scandal or crisis the league could fight in the court system or the court of public opinion and then march away from.The game itself had come under a monthlong attack by the president of the United States, with no letting up.It was also a prickly regional problem.The players' protests and the president's criticism played far differently in New England and California than they did in Texas, where Jones and Houston Texans owner Bob McNair were fielding an avalanche of complaints from outraged fans.This time, Goodell didn't have to simply manage owners' bruised egos and simmering feuds; this was a national political crisis threatening the league's business and its brand, seen through a different lens by each owner depending on his or her own political leanings and each team's fan base.It would require leadership, diplomacy and, most likely, a little luck.Yet in many ways, the meetings would be a referendum on the same argument owners have been holding in private meetings for years: What is the NFL's identity?Is it a strict entertainment company that Jones and others envision, controlling the behavior of its players in service of its financial bottom line?Or should it attempt to transform itself into a more socially conscious league that would strive, through the forging of a rare and fragile owners-players partnership in this moment, to use its mammoth platform to try to change society for the good, even if the cost of that process, slow and complicated, would likely be measured in short-term declining popularity and lower revenues?Some owners left the Yankees game early, seeking a good night's sleep before the meeting with the players the next morning.Jones could afford to stay out late.Goodell had personally decided which owners would attend, and he had not invited Jones.The commissioner, sources say, wanted to prevent the players-owners meeting from devolving into an argument about whether a player should be benched if he kneels -- an argument that was more likely to break out if Jones attended.For his part, Jones, who declined comment for this story, didn't seem bothered.He beamed in the Yankee Stadium suite alongside his oldest son, Stephen, masking worries over what was now at stake for the NFL in 2017.Polls show that the protest issue has resonated with millions of fans who insist all players should stand for the national anthem; some are calling for an NFL boycott and vowing to never watch another NFL game.Owners are alarmed at how rapidly fans' outrage is eroding many of the league's key business metrics, and executives at some broadcast partners have complained to owners about how the NFL lurches from crisis to crisis.A recent Morning Consult poll revealed that the NFL's net favorability has dropped to 11 percent from a high of 56 percent in May.Jones was furious that local TV ratings in Dallas were down, especially a 19 percent drop for this year's game against Green Bay, compared with last year's."There is no question the league is suffering negative effects from these protests," he would tell reporters after the Cowboys routed the 49ers."All times, I want to do the right thing by [NFL sponsors] and their customers.I have a great responsibility to the people who support us.... We all get great benefits from having a lot of us watching our games.All of us do."Jones arrived in New York to have a good time -- and to deliver a reckoning.The only question was whether his billionaire partners and Goodell would heed that reckoning.AS THE HISTORIC players-owners meeting began, the players, led by retired wide receiver Anquan Boldin and Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins, entered the conference room and shook the owners' hands, an uncommon occurrence at prior tension-filled joint meetings.The players took seats side by side with the owners.Goodell wanted to put the players at ease by allowing every one of their voices to be heard.The players said that they felt the owners -- as a collective more than the small group in the room -- were being duplicitous; they were empathetic to their concerns behind closed doors but not publicly.Fans needed to hear from owners that players who knelt or raised fists were good men who loved their country, they argued.Messages of support couldn't be delivered only inside the locker rooms.Finally, New York Jets linebacker Demario Davis stood up in the center of the room and told owners: "I'm going to break it down for you guys.You guys aren't supporting us, and until you do, there's going to be an issue."Davis' message, and passion, seemed to relieve the tension.Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank later told Davis that he'd "missed his calling" as a great public speaker.A few owners tried to separate their deep dislike of unemployed quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who started the protests a little more than a year ago, from the players' broader message: This wasn't an "anthem protest" but rather an "inequality in America" protest.Knowing that their motives and message had largely been lost in the political chaos, the players told stories of their personal connections to the military and showed a good grasp of the business problems suddenly confronting the league.Left unsaid was the warning issued on Oct. 11 by Buccaneers defensive tackle Gerald McCoy about forcing players to stand: "I think it's gonna be an uproar if that is to happen, because you're basically taking away a constitutional right to freedom of speech."League executives tried to show they understood the players' concerns.Several league staff members presented a three-pronged action plan: expand the My Cause, My Cleats initiative; help convene more meetings with lawmakers to ramp up lobbying for players' causes on Capitol Hill and, through the clubs, in statehouses across the country; and use the NFL's platform to promote it all.The league had scrapped a staff idea to extend an olive branch to Kaepernick -- who in October filed a collusion claim against the owners -- by inviting him to visit the league headquarters.The action plan had met harsh criticism when it was first introduced inside the league office the Thursday before the owners' meetings.Anna Isaacson, the NFL's vice president of social responsibility, chief marketing officer Dawn Hudson and others had presented the plan to Goodell and top executives, including public relations chief Joe Lockhart, chief operating officer Tod Leiweke, chief media and business officer Brian Rolapp and general counsel Jeff Pash.Isaacson characterized the plan as a chance to seize the social moment and make an impact beyond football.There was also a request for a huge marketing budget.The league's business executives ripped it, accusing Isaacson -- who had joined the NFL after working in merchandising and community relations for baseball's Brooklyn Cyclones -- and Hudson of losing sight of the goal, which was to persuade all the players to stand for the anthem.The plan was "too political," they said, and would likely invite further attacks by Trump."How could you possibly present this to owners?"one executive asked.As the proposal was discussed, Goodell remained mostly quiet but seethed because he felt the plan was uninspired.Neither Goodell nor the business executives liked the action plan at that moment, but what worried the business executives was that Goodell was not focused on what they deemed the priority: the very real financial problems facing the NFL.Fact was, they were right.Goodell believed that all players should stand, but he and Vincent had been working with them for more than a year on their concerns, calling them individually and holding meetings, and the commissioner deeply cared about their cause.Now, in the meeting with players, Goodell, despite his initial reservations about Isaacson's plan, supported it "full bore," an owner says.Not only that, the commissioner moved around the room to guide the conversation about its pluses.Many times he told the owners they weren't hearing the players' core arguments."We're all in this together," Goodell told them.The players and the union executives, who have been at odds with Goodell for years, were impressed."It was the proudest I've ever been in the NFL," one owner said later.This was Goodell leading in a manner they'd rarely seen: He was not playing a zero-sum game, he was not risk-averse and his compassion clearly lay with the players in the face of severe pressure from hard-line owners and business executives."He did a great job because he didn't say much," Blank says."I don't mean that in a negative way."The players had arrived at NFL headquarters wanting to be their own voice rather than have the union speak for them.DeMaurice Smith, the players' association chief, was uncharacteristically quiet during the session, having found a way to move forward on this issue with Goodell after a private meeting at Dulles International Airport on Oct. 3.In a similar sort of way, the players concluded that Goodell seemed to be speaking for himself more than for many owners and even the league -- something that stunned them because, after all, some players privately view the commissioner as the puppet of ruthless billionaire owners."There was sincerity on both sides," 49ers CEO Jed York says.The meeting was going so well that even the unintentionally awkward moments were forgiven.At one point, Buffalo Bills co-owner Terry Pegula, moved by Anquan Boldin's story about his cousin being shot and killed by a police officer, complimented him on how impressive he was but kept calling him "Antwan."Then Pegula suggested that Boldin would be the perfect NFL spokesman on social issues not only because he had walked away from the game to pursue causes but because, the owner said, it couldn't be a "white owner but needs to be someone who's black."Some people quickly glanced at one another; others looked down, cringing.But the discussion resumed, and soon the session was running so long -- by 90 minutes -- that nobody knew how to end it.At one point, Robert Kraft mumbled to the two Jets players seated on either side of him, "Can we just shut the f--- up and end this?"Everyone on that side of the table laughed, and the optics of the Patriots owner laughing with two players from his team's rival seemed to have accomplished the mission.But it was hard to tell if it was just optics.Shortly after 1 p.m., Goodell and Smith stepped out of the session to tell Lockhart and union spokesman George Atallah to craft a joint NFL-NFLPA statement, a symbol of rare cooperation.Players were still skeptical that the owners and league executives beyond Goodell were motivated to act -- a week later, Chargers tackle Russell Okung would label the league's lack of urgency "disappointing" and said the players-owners meeting appeared "unproductive at best and disingenuous at worst."Before everyone left the room that afternoon, Davis made one last point: how important it had been that acting Jets owner Chris Johnson, the brother of Woody Johnson, now Trump's ambassador to the United Kingdom, had visited with every player in the locker room to hear their concerns."Guys will stand up if you hear them," Davis told the owners.TWO HOURS LATER, those 11 owners joined their counterparts and league executives in a third-floor conference room at the Conrad Hotel in lower Manhattan.It was uncertain and tense.Most pro-stand owners, like Dan Snyder of the Washington Redskins, had been purposefully excluded from the players' meeting.Inside the conference room, Goodell kicked off the session by asking each of the 11 owners to give his account of the players' meeting.Nearly all offered slight variations on the same theme: It was a very good session; the players were passionate and very impressive; we've got a lot of work to do to address their concerns and to use the NFL platform to address these difficult social, racial and justice issues.The mandate to stand wasn't mentioned.Goodell didn't interrupt anyone, and he summed it up by saying that the two sides were "on a good path to a partnership."Goodell then opened the floor to discussion, and something surprising happened: Nobody debated.Jones asked a pair of benign questions about the process for Isaacson's proposal, a far different occurrence than in the committee meetings three weeks earlier when, according to an owner, he had "hijacked" the protest discussion.Owners were stunned."OK," Goodell said, "let's move on and we'll come back to this."The meeting broke around 5 p.m., and many of the owners left for the night believing that the ones who hated the protests most had relented.But Goodell had purposefully tabled the discussion out of deference to Jones, giving him the evening to speak to owners and gauge the support for a league-wide mandate to stand.AT THE CONRAD on Wednesday, Day 2 of the meetings began with most owners and team executives back inside the third-floor conference room.While league staffers reviewed mundane legal matters and pored over a PowerPoint presentation showcasing this season's declining TV ratings, a strange suspense lingered over the session, given that the anthem issue remained unresolved: What would Jerry Jones say?By late morning, Goodell finally moved the discussion to the protests.It was a "special privileged session," with only owners plus one adviser allowed.Snyder spoke first.He said that there were real business issues at stake, and he mentioned that in his market, the defense industry and other sponsors were angry about the protests.He didn't put any dollars on it.To many in the room, Snyder's speech felt like an opening act for the headlining band.After Snyder sat down, Jones stood and left no question that it was his floor."I'm the ranking owner here," he said.At first, some in the room admired Jones' pure bravado, the mix of folksy politician and visionary salesman he has perfected.But he was angry.He said the owners had to take the business impact seriously, as the league was threatened by a polarizing issue it couldn't contain or control.To some in the room, it was clear Jones was trying to build momentum for an anthem mandate resolution, and in the words of one owner, "he brought up a lot of fair points."Jones believed he was one of the few showing any urgency on the matter and seemed to be more frustrated that not everybody was listening than he was passionate about the mandate.As Jones spoke, Snyder mumbled out loud, "See, Jones gets it -- 96 percent of Americans are for guys standing," a claim some dismissed as a grand overstatement.McNair, a multimillion-dollar Trump campaign contributor, spoke next, echoing many of the same business concerns."We can't have the inmates running the prison," McNair said.That statement stunned some in the room.Then Kraft, who is close friends with Trump, politely rebuked the hardliners, saying that he supported the league's marketing proposal and predicted the issue would work itself out over time.This argument seemed to find a receptive audience in the room.An unofficial count had only nine owners in favor of a mandate, though the reasons for the opposition varied: Some owners had tired of Jones always commandeering such meetings; some were jealous of his power and eager to see him go down; some saw the players-must-stand mandate as bad policy to invoke in the middle of the season; some owners were angry with Jones' hard-line public stance on kneeling, feeling that it had backed them all into a corner."The majority of owners understand this is important to the players and want to be supportive, even if they don't exactly know how to be supportive," one owner says.Now, suddenly, Jones found himself in an unfamiliar position: He wasn't getting his way.He knew it, and everyone knew it.Like the numerous reasons behind the protests, the business concerns were nuanced -- one major sponsor had threatened to pull out if the NFL were to issue a mandate to stand.York spoke next.Though Jones and Snyder were angry with him -- they felt that if he had forced Kaepernick to stand a year ago, this crisis could have been averted -- York and Jeffrey Lurie of the Eagles had emerged as thoughtful leaders.Knowing that many of the players who were still kneeling were on his 49ers, York emphasized that he understood the business concerns and that each market was different, and that he had been talking to his players for a long time and would continue to do so.Lurie had spoken up during the meeting, supporting the players' right to kneel.After the owners finished, Troy Vincent stood up.He was offended by McNair's characterization of the players as "inmates."Vincent said that in all his years of playing in the NFL -- during which, he said, he had been called every name in the book, including the N-word -- he never felt like an "inmate."It was starting to get nasty.Vincent and Jones had a sharp but quick back-and-forth, with Jones finally reminding the room that rather than league office vice presidents, it was he and fellow owners who had helped build the NFL's $15 billion-a-year business, and they would ultimately decide what to do.McNair later pulled Vincent aside and apologized, saying that he felt horrible and that his words weren't meant to be taken literally, which Vincent appreciated.The meetings were already running long and were ending on a raw note -- and there were more agenda items to hit.For the second time in a month, a few frustrated owners grumbled about Lockhart, angry that the league was, as usual, appearing to be reactive in a public relations sense in the face of a crippling crisis.League executives worried that during upcoming events -- Veterans Day and the NFL's Salute to Service -- pro-military groups might stage protests.Goodell left the meeting room to be ushered to a news conference.The final topic of a long morning was the most salient one: the commissioner's next contract.Jones is not technically on the six-person committee that determines Goodell's compensation, but he has willed himself onto it.And so, before everyone could leave, he spoke for 20 minutes, delving into all of the league's problems that everyone knew by heart.He wanted Goodell's contract to be more incentive-based than it is."This is the most one-sided contract ever," he said.This speech, like the one earlier in the day by him, was not vintage Jones: His usual annoying but endearing Jerryisms were replaced by a palpable urgency; it seemed to a few owners as if only Jones could see that an opportunity to regain control of the league was slipping away.As Jones spoke, a few owners wondered what exactly had been accomplished during the week in New York.Had Goodell won?Had the players won?Had Jones lost?For most, it was enough that the owners and players had come together and that perhaps the promise of their newly formed partnership would bury the desire of some players to take a knee or raise their fists again.As a top league executive remarked when it was over, it took a president's attacks to get everyone to come together -- or at least agree to keep talking, as they intend to do at the next owners-players summit, scheduled for Oct. 31, a meeting that the players have invited Kaepernick to attend.Just after 2 p.m., the New York meetings adjourned, two hours late.Owners filed out to meet in the lobby with reporters, explaining the league's baby steps toward turning "protest into progress."All of the reporters waited for Jones.A day earlier, he had tried to duck underneath a staircase at the hotel to avoid them, but about two-dozen reporters swarmed, ready to assume their common position of being his rapt audience.But Jones didn't stop walking.He searched for a way out of the hotel and hit a dead end before turning back and going down an escalator.Jones likes to talk the most when he's selling.For now, at least, he had nothing to sell.But there was a very real sense that he wasn't done fighting, not on the anthem, not on Goodell's contract and not on his worries about the NFL's future.As he left the meeting room, Jerry Jones was silent.And then he was gone, slipping out a hotel side door and out of New York, where so much had been discussed and so little had been decided.
Astros manager A.J. Hinch: Ken Giles 'wasn't surprised' about losing closer role:::::HOUSTON -- If the Astros have a lead in the ninth inning Sunday night -- and likely in any remaining game in the World Series -- Ken Giles will stay put in the bullpen.Astros manager A.J.Hinch informed Giles that he will be removed from the closer role after another dismal performance Saturday night in a 6-2 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers that evened the series at two games apiece."He wasn't surprised," Hinch said Sunday before Game 5 at Minute Maid Park."He understands, and he wants to be there for his teammates."Giles has made seven appearances in the postseason and has allowed at least one run in six of them.He has faced 40 batters and given up 12 hits -- including three home runs -- and six walks.Giles' postseason ERA is 11.74.The World Series has been particularly rough for Giles.In Game 2, he gave up a 10th-inning leadoff homer to Yasiel Puig before allowing a two-out walk to Logan Forsythe and an RBI single to Kike Hernandez.In Game 4, he entered with the score tied in the ninth inning, faced three batters and didn't record an out."I didn't do my job, plain and simple," Giles said."I let the team down."Giles offered little in the way of an explanation for his struggles other than to say he's making "crappy pitches."At this point, the hard-throwing right-hander's confidence appears to be as broken as anything related to his mechanics or his pitch mix.Hinch predicted that Giles will pitch again before the World Series is over.But he wouldn't commit to using him in the closer role again."He's tough enough to handle it.He's got weapons to handle it," Hinch said."This is a big stage.He wants to do well, like everybody does, and having to live it out on this stage has been a little bit of a grind for him.Got to have a short memory as a closer, no matter what.If we need him to get critical outs, he's going to come in and give his best."

The Latest: Kershaw retires all 6 batters faced:::::The Latest on Game 5 of the World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Houston Astros (all times local): 8:06 p.m. Dodgers lefty Clayton Kershaw is off to another impressive start against the Houston Astros in Game 5 of the World Series.Kershaw has retired all six batters faced, all since Los Angeles scored three runs in the top of the first to give him a 3-0 lead.It is a rematch of left-handed aces, Kershaw against Dallas Keuchel like in Game 1 last Tuesday.The Dodgers won the World Series opener 3-1 when Kershaw struck out 11 with no walks while giving up one run on three hits over seven innings.Kershaw did have only one strikeout through the first two innings Sunday night.Keuchel settled down with a 1-2-3 second, needing only 13 pitches to get out of the inning.That was after throwing 32 pitches with two walks in the Dodgers' three-run first.7:47 p.m. Logan Forsythe's two-run single and a run-scoring throwing error by first baseman Yuli Gurriel helped the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 3-0 first inning lead against Houston Astros ace Dallas Keuchel.Keuchel struggled with his control, walking two and throwing just 15 of 32 pitches for strikes in the inning.In losing the opener to Clayton Kershaw last week at Dodger Stadium, Keuchel threw 52 of 84 pitches for strikes and walked one while allowing three runs over 6 2/3 innings.Chris Taylor singled up the middle leading off and Corey Seager took a called third strike.Justin Turner walked on five pitches and Enrique Hernandez on four, loading the bases and prompting a visit to the mound by pitching coach Brent Strom.Game 4 star Cody Bellinger struck out, chasing an outside 1-2 slider.After catcher Brian McCann's third trip to the mound of the inning, Forsythe lined a hip-high slider into left field as two runs scored.The ball bounced off the heel of Marwin Gonzalez's glove, allowing Turner to come home without a play.With runners at the corners, Forsythe started for second and Keuchel threw to first.Gurriel's throw was wide, forcing Jose Altuve to come off the base, and Forsythe beat the second baseman to the bag as Hernandez scored.Houston challenged the safe call by second base umpire Mark Wegner, which was upheld in a video review.Kershaw retired the side in order in the first, throwing nine of 12 pitches for strikes.7:10 p.m. Former President George W. Bush has thrown out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 5 with father and former President George H.W.Bush on the field cheering him on.The younger Bush was a former controlling owner of the Texas Rangers, but donned an Astros jacket and received a nice round of applause when he stepped on the mound.He then made a nice, firm toss to Houston ace Justin Verlander.The elder Bush, who is 93 and in a wheelchair, was handed a ball when he came onto the field.The one-time Yale first baseman held it with a perfect grip as the crowd cheered.The two talked with Verlander for a couple of minutes before posing for pictures with him.They also took pitchers with Astros owner Jim Crane and his wife Whitney.The 41st president then announced "Let's play ball" to the crowd as his son stood behind him smiling.This wasn't the first time the 43rd president has thrown out a first pitch at the World Series.He famously did it in Game 3 of the 2001 World Series in New York when the Yankees played the Diamondbacks less than two months after 9/11.That time he wore a black jacket with "FDNY" on the back to honor the firefighters killed in the terrorist attacks.6:00 p.m. Houston rapper Travis Scott is predicting a win for the Astros in Game 5.The "Goosebumps" rapper and Kylie Jenner's beau says: "We're taking the win.I had a dream that they were going to win.It's lit."Scott has been a big supporter of the Houston Rockets over the last couple of years and has attended several of their games.He's good friends with James Harden and even designed a T-shirt that was distributed before one of the team's playoff games last season.But on Sunday he was only thinking about the Astros: "I'm the No.1 Astros fan at this current moment in this building right now.It might be crazy."And speaking of the Rockets, their opponents on Monday, the Philadelphia 76ers, spent part of their off day taking in the game.Star center Joel Embiid and his teammates crowded around the batting cage before the game, with half in Dodgers jerseys and the other half in Astros orange.5:49 p.m. Yuli Gurriel still has to face the fans in Los Angeles after his racist gesture toward Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish.The Astros first baseman has had the support of Houston fans since his response toward Darvish after hitting a home run in Game 3 on Friday night.But the series will be back in LA for Game 6 on Tuesday night.Major League Baseball suspended Gurriel for the first five games of the 2018 regular season, but didn't take him out of the World Series."I don't think I need to talk to him about it, I think everyone is aware it's going to be a rough setting for him," Astros manager A.J.Hinch said before Game 5 in Houston."I don't think you can convince 55,000 fans to turn the page as fast as maybe the two teams have.And that goes out of support for their own players and their own people."The Cuban-born Gurriel pulled on the corners of his eyes after the homer off Darvish during Houston's 5-3 win in Game 3.He also used a derogatory Spanish term in reference to Darvish, who was born in Japan.Gurriel, who played in Japan in 2014, has apologized for his actions.Hinch said Gurriel has a good heart and made a mistake."He'll pay for it," Hinch said."And I think that obviously in the looming suspension to come, but also with the reaction in LA, I'm sure will be on the aggressive side."5:14 p.m. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts says Justin Turner would be at third base if Los Angeles had not been able to use a designated hitter in Game 5.Roberts put Turner at DH, kept Corey Seager at shortstop, moved Logan Forsythe from second to third and inserted Charlie Culberson at second."If it was at Dodger Stadium, yes, he would play," Roberts says."It was just kind of weighing his calf versus being comfortable being the DH, Charlie never DH-ing before, Corey would really rather play the field.I think if you put everything in and trust the defense, second base, at third as well, so it's sort of a no-brainer for me."5:08 p.m. Los Angeles' 6-2 comeback win in Game 4 had 15,906,000 viewers on Fox's three outlets, down 7 percent from the 17 million who watched Cleveland beat the Chicago Cubs 7-2 in the fourth game last year.Fox said Saturday's game was seen by an average of 15,401,000 on its main Fox network and 375,000 on Fox Deportes.In addition, an average of 130,500 streamed the game on Fox Sports Go.Last year's fourth game was seen by an average of 16.7 million on Fox, 212,000 on Fox Deportes and 88,000 in Fox Sports Go.3:41 p.m.The Houston Astros are staying with the same batting order for the third straight World Series game.Center fielder George Springer tops the Astros' order Sunday night, followed by third baseman Alex Bregman, second baseman Jose Altuve, shortstop Carlos Correa, first baseman Yuli Gurriel, right fielder Josh Reddick, designated hitter Evan Gattis, left fielder Marwin Gonzalez and catcher Brian McCann.Left-hander Dallas Keuchel is on the mound.The Los Angeles Dodgers won 6-2 Saturday night to even the Series at two games apiece.More MLB baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball
Florida, McElwain agree to part ways after 3rd straight loss:::::The paperwork for Jim McElwain's departure hadn't even been completed when Florida athletic director Scott Stricklin announced a motto for his coaching search: He wants the Gators to be fun again.That surely starts with an improved offense.The school and McElwain agreed to part ways Sunday, a day after a third consecutive loss and nearly a week after McElwain said his players and their families had received death threats.Stricklin named defensive coordinator Randy Shannon the team's interim coach for the final four games.Stricklin said the sides reached an agreement in principle to settle McElwain's $12.5 million buyout, but he declined to reveal details until the deal is signed."This is more than just wins and losses," Stricklin said."I'll just leave it at that."Florida (3-4, 3-3 Southeastern Conference), which is still paying former coach Will Muschamp, hoped to significantly reduce McElwain's sum and likely used his actions over the last week as leverage.Regardless, McElwain's tenure will be remembered for failing to fix a floundering offense.Three years ago, McElwain proclaimed he could win with his dog at quarterback.The Gators currently rank 113th in total offense, in triple digits nationally for the third time in McElwain's three seasons."When Florida has been really good, from a distance, it has looked really fun and I want it to be really fun," Stricklin said."Our fans, they deserve it to be really fun.I want our players and student-athletes to have a lot of fun, like this is a rewarding experience to come here and get a degree from a top-10 public university and to play at one of the storied football programs in the country."McElwain went 22-12 with the Gators, including 4-9 against ranked teams, and became the first coach in league history to take a team to the SEC championship game in his first two years.Florida was eliminated from contention in the Eastern Division with a 42-7 loss to rival Georgia on Saturday.It was Florida's most lopsided loss in the series since 1982.McElwain's downfall was more about relationships than records.His already-strained rapport with administrators reached a new low last Monday when he mentioned the death threats.The bombshell shocked Stricklin, who had not been notified about a potentially harmful situation.Stricklin met with McElwain later that day, and the coach rebuffed a request to provide more information about the threats.The school's position was this: If there were death threats and administrators did nothing about them, the Gators would be legally liable if something horrible happened.If McElwain exaggerated the threats or made them up altogether, then he essentially sullied an entire fan base without merit.McElwain made the situation even worse two days later when he said he would provide more details about the death threats "when it becomes unmanageable."McElwain seemed resigned to his fate Saturday night, probably because his problems started long before last week.The former Alabama assistant and Colorado State head coach complained publicly about Florida's facilities shortly after taking the job and openly questioned the school's commitment to the football program two years later.His initial comments came while the Gators were planning to build an indoor practice facility and his most recent ones came after they had announced plans to build a $60 million, stand-alone football facility.His comments rubbed Florida officials the wrong way.They probably would have found a way to live with them had McElwain delivered on promises to improve an offense that has been dormant for nearly a decade.McElwain didn't make Florida's offense any better than his predecessor and repeatedly failed to adequately develop a quarterback.The Gators surely will hire another offensive-minded coach to start the next rebuild.Mississippi State's Dan Mullen seems like the obvious choice.The 45-year-old Mullen was Florida's offensive coordinator under Urban Meyer and worked for Stricklin in Starkville, Mississippi.His resume includes a No.1 draft pick (Alex Smith), an NFL Rookie of the Year (Dak Prescott) and a Heisman Trophy winner (Tim Tebow).Mullen also is familiar with the pressure of coaching in the SEC and in Gainesville.Other possible candidates: Syracuse's Dino Babers, Iowa State's Matt Campbell, Central Florida's Scott Frost, Southern Methodist's Chad Morris and Memphis' Mike Norvell."I think fans sometimes look at hiring coaches kind of like you or I might look at going down to Best Buy and buying a 50-inch TV," Stricklin said."You look at the side of the box and read all the specs and you open up the box and that's what's going to be in there.Personnel hirings are not quite like that.... "These are figure-it-out kind of jobs.Every school is different.Every school is unique.Every school has its own set of strengths and challenges.There's not a one-size-fits-all approach to what's going to be successful at every school.So you have to get somebody who's smart enough to come in and figure out the puzzle at your particular school."More AP college football: www.collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/APTop25
Wilson's heroics lead Seahawks to wild 41-38 win over Texans:::::No matter how much Deshaun Watson impersonated Russell Wilson on Sunday, the original ended up coming out on top.Wilson hit Jimmy Graham for an 18-yard touchdown with 21 seconds left, his second TD catch of the fourth quarter, and the Seattle Seahawks rallied for a wild 41-38 win over the Houston Texans on Sunday.Down 38-34 with 1:39 left and out of timeouts, Wilson took Seattle 80 yards in barely a minute.He hit Paul Richardson for 48 yards on a jump ball to start the drive, found Tyler Lockett for 19 yards, and drilled a strike to Graham for the winner.Wilson finished 26 of 41 for a career-high 452 yards and four TDs.He hit Richardson for two TDs and found Graham on a 1-yard TD pass with 5:41 left.It was an unexpected shootout that again highlighted Wilson's greatness in the fourth quarter and Watson's potential as the league's next star QB."This to me might be (Wilson's) finest work today," Seattle wide receiver Doug Baldwin said.Watson was nearly the equal of Wilson, throwing for 402 yards and four touchdowns.But he couldn't come up with a final answer and was intercepted by Richard Sherman with 7 seconds left on a desperation throw.Sherman had two interceptions, his first since Week 10 of last season, and Earl Thomas returned a pick 78 yards for a TD in the first quarter.But they were the only mistakes by Watson in an otherwise stunning performance against one of the best defenses in the NFL and an even better final rally by Wilson."Go ahead and give him rookie of the year.I love watching him," Wilson said.Watson threw touchdown passes of 59 and 20 yards to Will Fuller, 2 yards to Lamar Miller, and a wide receiver screen that DeAndre Hopkins took 72 yards for a score with 5:01 left to give Houston a 38-34 lead.It was Watson's TD pass to Miller that reminded everyone of Wilson.He spun away from a sack and flipped a pass to Miller as he was being brought to the ground."We definitely know how other teams feel now," Sherman said.Watson is the first rookie to throw at least three touchdown passes in four consecutive games.His 16 touchdown passes in his past four games are the most by a rookie in any four-game span.And if he needed more accolades, Watson became the first player in the Super Bowl era with 400 yards passing, four TD passes and 50 yards rushing in a game.This season, Watson has 19 passing touchdowns, the most by a rookie in his first seven games of a season.Watson mimicked Wilson in nearly every manner, leaving the Seahawks mostly impressed and a little stunned by the performance."He played a better game than a lot of people come in here and play at that position," Seattle defensive end Frank Clark said."And that's just a credit to him, a credit to their team."Wilson and the Seahawks had two chances late to rally.Wilson drove the Seahawks to the Houston 20 with 2:55 left, but Marcus Williams intercepted at the Houston 6, undercutting a pass intended for Richardson.Seattle forced Houston to punt and this time Wilson didn't make a mistake.Wilson was the entirety of Seattle's offense.He accounted for 482 yards running and passing.The two QBs combined for eight TD passes and 854 yards passing.Hopkins finished with eight receptions for 224 yards, while Fuller had five catches for 125 yards.NATIONAL ANTHEM The day started with the majority of Houston's roster kneeling during the national anthem in protest of owner Bob McNair's "inmates running the prison" comment that emerged this past week.Only 10 of Houston's active players stood for the anthem.Houston offensive lineman Duane Brown, who ended his holdout and reported to the team this week, said he believed there was universal support among the players that stood and those that knelt."Some people didn't feel quite comfortable (kneeling) and some people did, but we all supported each other.That was what was important," Brown said.RUNNING NOWHERE Seattle's run game was again nonexistent.The Seahawks finished with 33 yards rushing on 21 carries.Wilson led the way with 30 yards, but Seattle's running backs didn't have a run go for more than 4 yards.FULL(ER) HOUSE Fuller continues to dazzle since he returned from a collarbone injury that kept him sidelined the first three games of the season.Since 1991, no player has reached seven TD receptions in fewer total receptions than Fuller.Fuller now has seven TDs on 13 receptions this season."I just got to keep clicking with Deshaun and hopefully we get better from here," Fuller said.INJURIES Texans: Houston was already thin on the defensive line with both Joel Heath and Kendall Langford inactive.The Texans lost Christian Covington to an elbow injury suffered early in the second half.Seahawks: Thomas said he

Verlander, Keuchel and more convinced baseballs are juiced:::::Justin Verlander is convinced: Baseballs are slicker.Rich Hill isn't so sure.With home runs soaring to record levels during the regular season and the World Series, juiced balls are on pitchers' minds."The main complaint is that the balls seem a little bit different in the postseason, and even from the postseason to the World Series balls," Verlander said Sunday, two days ahead of his start for the Houston Astros in Game 6."They're a little slick.You just deal with it.But I don't think it's the case of one pitcher saying, 'Hey, something is different here.'I think as a whole, everybody is saying, 'Whoa, something is a little off here.'"Fifteen home runs were hit as the Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers split the first four games.That includes a record eight in Game 2 five of them in extra innings.The record for a six-game series is 17 in 1953, 1977 and 2009.The overall mark of 21 was set by Anaheim and San Francisco over seven games in 2002 the season before survey drug testing.Speculation that something is amiss has been fueled by a study claiming to have found differences in the size and seam height of balls since the 2015 All-Star break."I know there was talk about different sizes and some of the baseballs were slightly bigger and some were smaller.Some of the seams were higher, some of the seams were lower.But, no, it's been consistent," said Hill, who will start Game 6 for the Dodgers."I think that just has to do with conditions if it's colder it's going to be slicker.If it's a little bit warmer out or humid, I think you're going to find that you're going to have a little bit more of moisture to the baseballs."Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred insists nothing nefarious is going on."I'm absolutely confident that the balls that we're using are within our established specifications," he said Friday.Verlander rejected that assertion."I know Mr. Manfred said the balls haven't changed, but I think there's enough information out there to say that's not true," he responded.Verlander also does not think it's an issue of how balls are rubbed up before games."I know baseball uses the same mud for every single ball for every single game that's played," he said."I think there's a broader issue that we're all missing."On the day he become commissioner in January 2015, Manfred said, "I'm cognizant in the drop in offense over the last five years, and it's become a topic of conversation in the game, and it's something that we're going to have to continue to monitor and study."Offense started rebounding during the second half of the season, and a record 6,105 home runs were hit this year, 2.4 percent more than the previous mark of 5,963 set in 2000 at the height of the Steroids Era."I think it's pretty clear," Verlander said."I think our commissioner has said publicly that they wanted more offense in the game.I'm pretty sure I'm not fabricating a quote here when I say that.I think it was already All-Star break of '15, or right before, when he said that."Astros pitcher Dallas Keuchel was quoted as saying after Game 2: "Obviously, the balls are juiced."San Francisco's Johnny Cueto and Toronto's Marcus Stroman also think the balls have changed, with Stroman blaming slick balls for a rise in pitcher blisters an affliction which has struck Hill a few times in the past couple seasons, too.Houston's Brent Strom and the Dodgers' Rick Honeycutt, the World Series pitching coaches, both were quoted by Sports Illustrated on Sunday as saying the slickness of the ball made throwing sliders difficult."Everyone is entitled to their opinion," Astros manager A.J.Hinch said."I don't see a ton difference, but I'm not going to get in a verbal war with coaches and players who think otherwise."Dodgers manager Dave Roberts had a similar view but acknowledged the power records got his attention."The pitchers talk about it feels different in their hand.The one component is the slickness and guys at different ballparks rub it up differently," he said."Sort of feels the same to me.But it's hard to argue the numbers.You know there's more velocity.Guys are swinging harder.I know in Los Angeles the air was light.It was hot.The ball was flying, carrying more than typically.But I hesitate to try to give you any insight because I really don't know."More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball
The Latest: Cowboys beat Redskins, Seahawks top Texans:::::The Latest on the eighth Sunday of the NFL regular season (all times Eastern): 7:47 p.m.The Dallas Cowboys beat their NFC rivals the Redskins 33-19 in Washington, and the Seahawks rallied past the Texans in a shootout in late afternoon action.Seattle rallied past Houston 41-38 on Russell Wilson's last-minute touchdown pass, his fourth.Deshaun Watson also threw four TD passes.That gave the Texans rookie an NFL record 19 through his first seven games.Kurt Warner had the old mark of 18 touchdown throws in his first seven games for the Rams in 1999.In the late game, Le'Veon Bell and the Pittsburgh Steelers visit Matthew Stafford and the Detroit Lions.The Week 8 finale pits the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs, two teams that were riding high before losing their last two games.7:30 p.m. DeShaun Watson threw four more touchdown passes, giving him an NFL record 19 through his first seven career games.That's one more than Kurt Warner had in 1999 with the then-St. Louis Rams.But the Texans lost a shootout 41-38 to Russell Wilson and the Seattle Seahawks, who sealed the win on Richard Sherman's interception of Watson's deep throw with seven seconds left.Houston fell to 3-4, a game behind Tennessee and Jacksonville in the AFC South.The Seahawks won their fourth straight after a 1-2 start.6:32 p.m. Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins says the next proposed meeting between the owners and players to discuss social justice initiatives has been canceled."The league didn't accept our invitation," Jenkins said after the Eagles win over the 49ers.NFL players proposed to meet Monday in Philadelphia.Jenkins said the league declined, citing scheduling issues.The league and players met last week in New York to discuss player demonstrations during the national anthem and other issues.Jenkins, one of the founders of The Players Coalition, says owners and the players should meet to discuss alternative ways players can get their message out."They want to get back to football; we want to move past anthem demonstrations," Jenkins said."But to do that, we need to be able to replace the platform that we have."5:15 p.m.The early games are in the books and there weren't any shutouts.That's notable because the NFL's Week 8 began with the Ravens' 40-0 whitewash of the Dolphins on Thursday night.That was the fourth shutout in a five-day span and the sixth overall this season.There were only three shutouts all of last season and just two the year before that.The Browns and 49ers both fell to 0-8 today.Cleveland lost 33-16 to the Vikings in the final London game of the season and the 49ers fell 33-10 to the Eagles.Philadelphia improved to a league-best 7-1.In other games, the Panthers beat the Buccaneers 17-3, the Patriots beat the Chargers 21-13 and the Bills walloped the Raiders 34-14The Saints beat the Bears 20-12, the Falcons edge the Jets 25-20 and the Bengals beat the Colts 24-23.4:12 p.m. Only 10 active Houston Texans players stood for the national anthem with the rest of the team kneeling down.The Texans had indicated there would be some type of protest following comments by owner Bob McNair.McNair has issued two apologies and is attempting to explain his comments after a story in ESPN The Magazine this week revealed that he said "we can't have the inmates running the prison" during a meeting of NFL owners about players who protest by kneeling during the national anthem.There were reports the Texans would consider staying in the locker room for the anthem, but the entire team took the field about 10 minutes before kickoff.When the anthem started more than half the active roster took a knee.The majority of Seattle's defensive line continued to sit as it has for most of the season.3:10 p.m.The Bears have lost tight end Zach Miller for the remainder of their game in New Orleans after an apparently serious knee injury on what initially was ruled a touchdown catch, and then overturned on video review.Miller came down awkwardly on his left leg after hauling in Mitchell Trubisky's 25-yard pass to the end zone while safety Rafael Bush dived, his arm outstretched, to try to break up the play.Miller's left leg hyperextended as he came down with the ball and crashed to the turf.Replay showed he bobbled the ball upon his upper body's impact with the field, and it was ruled that the ball made contact with the ground when it briefly jarred lose in Miller's arms.The ruling of an incomplete pass came as Miller was carted off the field, and the Bears then concluded the drive with Connor Barth's 44-yard field goal to trim the Saints' lead to 14-6 late in the third quarter.2:50 p.m.The Buffalo Bills added running back Carlton Chester "Cookie" Gilchrist to their Wall of Fame at halftime of their game against the Oakland Raiders today.Gilchrist, who died in 2011 at age 75, was posthumously recognized for his Bills' career from 1962 through 1964.Gilchrist was the American Football League player of the year in 1962 when he rushed for 1,096 yards and a league-leading 13 touchdowns.Along with quarterback Jack Kemp, he helped the Bills win their first of two AFL championships in 1964.Gilchrist is third all-time in franchise history with 31 rushing touchdowns behind Thurman Thomas (65) and O.J.Simpson (57).2:10 p.m.Seven NFL players visibly protested during the national anthem in early games.Most of them were at the 49ers-Eagles game, where Philadelphia players Malcom Jenkins and Rodney McLeod raised their fists.Kneeling on the 49ers sideline were Eric Reid, Eli Harold, Adrian Colbert and Marquise Goodwin.Chargers tackle Russell Okung raised a fist at Foxborough, Massachusetts.At Cincinnati, the Colts joined arms on the sideline, and in the final NFL game in London this season, almost all of the Vikings and Browns stood arm-in-arm during the playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner" and "God Save The Queen."Some members of the Houston Texans will likely make some type of expression later at Seattle in reaction to comments by the team's owner.Bob McNair has apologized after a report revealed that he said "we can't have the inmates running the prison" during a meeting of NFL owners about players who protest by kneeling during the national anthem.12:45 p.m. Week 8 began with another Cleveland loss.The Browns fell to 0-8 with a 33-16 loss to the Vikings in London.There isn't a single game in this weekend's schedule pitting teams with winning records but there are several milestones in reach.Saints quarterback Drew Brees needs a dozen completions against the Bears to reach 6,000 for his career and join Hall of Famers Brett Favre and Peyton Manning in that exclusive club.Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston needs 225 passing yards against the Panthers to reach 10,000 for his career.Bills kicker Stephen Hauschka needs one more field goal of 50 or more yards to set the NFL record with 13 consecutive conversions from that distance.12:20 p.m.The Cleveland Browns are closing in on their eighth loss, halfway to a winless season.The Browns had their first halftime lead of the season, and led Minnesota 16-15 late in the third quarter before the Vikings responded with two touchdown drives to take a 30-16 lead in London.Jerick McKinnon scored from a yard out and added a 2-point run to make it 23-16.Then, tight end Kyle Rudolph caught a 4-yard pass from Case Keenum.A win would make the Vikings 6-2.The Browns are one of two winless teams in the NFL this season.The other is the San Francisco 49ers, who play the Philadelphia Eagles today.11:19 a.m.The Cleveland Browns have their first halftime lead of the season after DeShone Kizer put them up 13-12 against the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday at Twickenham.The rookie quarterback capped an 82-yard drive with a 1-yard run for a touchdown to give the winless Browns (0-7) a four-point lead with 42 seconds left in the half.The Vikings responded with a 34-yard field goal as time expired.The Browns took a 6-0 lead through a 26-yard touchdown run by Isaiah Crowell on their first drive before the Vikings responded with nine straight points.Both teams missed an extra point.For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/APNFL
Cowboys 'Feed Zeke,' capitalize on mistakes to beat Redskins:::::After letting the ball slip out of his hands on his first carry, Ekeziel Elliott was determined not to let his Dallas Cowboys teammates down again.Elliott bounced back from his fumble to run for 150 yards and two touchdowns as the Cowboys took advantage of a blocked field goal and three turnovers to beat the Washington Redskins 33-19 in a wet, sloppy game Sunday to move into sole possession of second place in the NFC East."We always talk about when you got that ball in your hands, that's the team, so you've got to protect it," Elliott said."I had to do something."Playing in a driving rainstorm that made it difficult to hold onto the ball, let alone throw it, Dak Prescott completed 14 of his 22 passes for 143 yards as Dallas (4-3) heeded the message on Elliott's cleats to "Feed Zeke."With another hearing on his NFL suspension coming Monday, Elliott carried the ball 33 times, scored twice for the second consecutive game and surpassed 100 yards for the third time in a row."He's hard enough when you have holes filled, let alone when you're giving him a clear running lane," Redskins linebacker Ryan Kerrigan said."It is never going to be easy."Elliott said he didn't think about his pending hearing, which could determine whether he's suspended the next six games or will be available for the rest of the season.He didn't have the chance to because he called conditions so treacherous that he struggled to hold on to the ball late because of the rain and cold.What could be Elliott's last game until mid-December turned in the second quarter when Dallas' Tyrone Crawford blocked Nick Rose's field goal attempt and Orlando Scandrick returned it 86 yards to set up a 1-yard Elliott TD run two plays later.Instead of the Redskins (3-4) leading 16-7, the Cowboys went up 14-13 and never trailed again."That block was huge," Prescott said."That might've been the turning point and just the key play in the whole game."Washington QB Kirk Cousins lost one fumble and kick returner Chris Thompson lost another.Cousins was 26 of 39 for 263 yards and a 1-yard TD pass to Josh Doctson that cut it to 26-19, but Rose missed the extra point and Dallas sealed it with an interception return for a touchdown by Byron Jones with 21 seconds left.NO PROBLEM, NUGENT Signed to fill in for injured kicker Dan Bailey, Mike Nugent was wide left from 49 yards on his first attempt for the Cowboys.Nugent, who worked out for the Redskins last week when they decided to sign Rose to replace the injured Dustin Hopkins, shook it off and made field goals from 36, 48, 27 and 37 yards in the second half."It's one of those ones you want back, but I feel like I learned from it," Nugent said."I was happy to connect on the rest."FEEL THE RUSH The Cowboys took full advantage of the Redskins' bevy of injuries along the offensive line, sacking Cousins four times.Washington was without starting left tackle Trent Williams, center Spencer Long and right guard Brandon Scherff because of knee injuries and had two rookies making their NFL debuts Chase Roullier at center and Tyler Catalina at right guard."The D-line has done a great job getting a lot of pressure: strip sacks, making plays," Dallas linebacker Sean Lee said.INVISIBLE PRYOR Redskins WR Terrelle Pryor was a nonfactor for a second consecutive game.Cousins threw Pryor's way just once, a week after four targets and two receptions in a loss at Philadelphia.INJURIES Cowboys: WR Cole Beasley left in the third quarter with a concussion.Redskins: TE Jordan Reed injured his right hamstring late in the second quarter and did not return.... TE Niles Paul was concussed on a helmet-to-helmet hit during Rob Kelley's 1-yard TD run in the first quarter.... LT T.J. Clemmings left with an ankle injury and LG Shawn Lauvao left with a stinger.... DL Matt Ioannidis broke his hand, S Stefan McClure suffered a hamstring injury and S Montae Nicholson a shoulder injury.... CB Bashaud Breeland was inactive with a knee injury.QUOTABLE Prescott, trying to explain playing in wet conditions: "The next rainy day, go outside, take a ball and see what you can do with it.And good luck with it."Redskins coach Jay Gruden: "I don't know how you could have more injuries on the offensive line.I really don't.It's mind-boggling."For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/APNFL
Eagles' Jenkins: NFL owners declined meeting with players:::::Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins, one of the founders of The Players Coalition, said the next proposed meeting between the owners and players to discuss social justice initiatives has been canceled."The league didn't accept our invitation," Jenkins said Sunday.NFL players proposed to meet Monday in Philadelphia.Jenkins said the league cited scheduling and logistical issues."At this point, the ball is in their court," Jenkins said."We'll continue to do what we've been doing.Guys are working around the league."League spokesman Brian McCarthy said Sunday night: "Nothing is set, but the league is eager to continue the dialogue with the players."The league and players met last week in New York to discuss player demonstrations during the national anthem and other issues."They want to get back to football; we want to move past anthem demonstrations," Jenkins said."But to do that, we need to be able to replace the platform that we have."Jenkins wants a venue outside the stadium and not during the anthem for athletes to raise awareness of social issues."We don't really enjoy doing this," Jenkins said."We'd love to have a different platform and we think that's something we could work collaboratively with the NFL to create, to actually draw awareness to the issues we're doing, to use the NFL as a vehicle to make real change."Colin Kaepernick, who began kneeling during the national anthem before the 2016 season and currently is out of the NFL, did not attend the meeting last week.Jenkins declined to address a report Sunday on Slate.com that said Kaepernick had been iced out of discussions between owners and players.Jenkins and other players had said Kaepernick was invited.McCarthy also made it clear the NFL would like to include Kaepernick."We would welcome Colin at a meeting, but it's the players who are extending the invitations," he said.Kaepernick has filed a grievance against the NFL, alleging that he was not signed because of collusion by owners who wanted him out of the league because of the protests.Jenkins said the players want Kaepernick "to be a part of the conversation."San Francisco safety Eric Reid, who took a knee during the national anthem again Sunday, said Kaepernick told him he would attend if invited."I know Colin has been fighting to get in the room to speak to the appropriate people in the NFL," Reid said."He told me that he was explicitly told he had no place being there.The NFL wants the protests to end.It's bad for their business.But it's ridiculous that they don't want Colin to be there being that he was the first one to start protesting.If we have to force him into the room, that's what we'll do."Chargers linebacker Russell Okung, who has been raising his fist during the national anthem, said the league has "amazing political and economic power" and hoped it would walk with the players "to will that power in a way that changes the dynamic of our country."Jenkins and Eagles' teammate Rodney McLeod raised their fists during the national anthem Sunday.Kneeling across the field on the San Francisco 49ers sideline were Reid, Eli Harold, Adrian Colbert and Marquise Goodwin.All but 10 members of the Houston Texans took a knee during the national anthem Sunday, as the vast majority of the team protested the owner's "inmates running the prison" comment.Before this week, no Texans had protested during the anthem."It's already a sensitive issue," Jenkins said."What am I proud of is, I feel like the voice of the players has been pretty concise and consistent.Even when you've had responses the president, responses from different owners that have not been in the good spirit of solidarity.The players have remained pretty level-headed.We're more concerned about getting actual work done and change and going about the right steps to do that."Jenkins said he did not know when players and owners might meet again."I feel like we've done everything that we needed to do to really try to work in a collaborative effort with the league," Jenkins said."We've showed up at meetings that they've requested.We've had the conversations they wanted to between us."Jenkins was among a group of Eagles that made a trip last week to the state capitol in Harrisburg and met with legislators to discuss criminal justice reform.AP Pro Football Writers Rob Maaddi and Barry Wilner contributed.For more NFL coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/APNFL
