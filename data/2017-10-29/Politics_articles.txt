Speculation swirls as Mueller indictment looms in Russia investigation:::::Speculation has escalated in Washington and across the country as lawmakers await the announcement of at least one indictment in special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election an announcement that could come as early as Monday.The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., predicted Sunday on ABC News This Week that two prominent Trump campaign associates believed to be at the center of the investigation former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort could be indicted.MUELLER HAS FILED CHARGES IN RUSSIA-TRUMP ASSOCIATES PROBE: MULTIPLE REPORTS Well, you know, there are two people I think just from press reporting that it is likely to be, either Mike Flynn or Paul Manafort, Schiff said.We havent been informed of who it is, and I dont think it would been appropriate for Bob Mueller to tell us.Manafort has been the subject of an investigation into his dealings in Ukraine several years ago for which he did not file as a foreign agent until June 2017.Flynn was a Trump surrogate during the campaign and briefly served as national security adviser before being fired for failing to fully disclose his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, Russias former ambassador to the United States.The Wall Street Journal reported at least one person could be taken into custody as early as Monday.Meanwhile, House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., told Fox News Sunday, We dont know whos being charged.We dont know what they are being charged for.We dont know the time period.He added it was kind of ironic that the people charged with investigating the law and executing the law would violate the law.GOWDY SLAMS MUELLER TEAM OVER LEAKS ABOUT CHARGES IN TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE Speaking on CBS News Face the Nation, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. who has publicly feuded in recent days with President Trump said he had no knowledge regarding the indictments, and that hes focused on doing his job for the American people.I dont know the substance.I have no knowledge.Like you, well wait and see what happens, Corker said Sunday.But most of us are focused on the policies we have to deal with on behalf of the American people, and right now you know thats been a sideshow.Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also told Face the Nation that Muellers investigation from the very beginning has gone along two tracks.One is the independent counsels investigation to see if theres criminal wrongdoing, and it looks like were going to find out as early as tomorrow about some indictments in that area.On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump was confident Mueller would soon close his investigation.The Justice Departments special counsels office declined to comment on the reports of filed charges.
Death of US soldiers in Niger restarts debate about military involvement post Vietnam:::::The United States found itself involved in a lengthy, divisive, military conflict overseas.A surfeit of controversial incidents besieged the U.S. military and confounded official Washington as to what to do.Leaders at the National Security Council argued that local fighters were improving their military skills.As a result, the U.S. could cede more power to them.In other words, the war needed to be de-Americanized.Instead, the Defense secretary chose another term: Vietnamization.The above scenario obviously isnt about the four U.S. soldiers killed earlier this month in Niger.It isnt about President Trumps decision in August to maintain the U.S. mission in Afghanistan and bolster troop levels there.But what the U.S. is doing in Niger and Chad and Mali and Afghanistan and Iraq and Libya and Djibouti and Turkey and Yemen and Jordan and Uganda and Cameroon and South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic and Somalia and Kosovo and Cuba and parts of Syria certainly echoes Defense Secretary Melvin Laird telling President Richard Nixon the U.S. should Vietnamize the battle in southeast Asia.That would denote a shift.Laird asserted that Vietnamization properly characterized U.S. involvement going forward.After all, the U.S. didnt want an open-ended commitment in Vietnam.Many in Washington wanted to get out as soon as possible.Things certainly didnt work out that way.The U.S. found itself paralyzed in Vietnam for years.As a result, Vietnam Syndrome set in among the public and the nations political leaders.Americans were reluctant to engage overseas.In a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, President Ronald Reagan said that the U.S. lived with Vietnam Syndrome for too long.As a result, Reagan said Americans were told that peace would come if we would simply stop interfering and go home.Reagan declared we dishonor the memory of the 50,000 young Americans who died in that cause when we give way to feelings of guilt as if we were doing something shameful.Reagan told the VFW that was the lesson for all of us on Vietnam.If we are forced to fight, we must have the means and the determination to prevail or we will not have what it takes to secure the peace.Two months ago, Trump made the case to Afghanize the fight.The president said Afghan troops would bear the heaviest burden in this struggle.He also spoke of the thousands of U.S. troops who fought and died in Afghanistan.Trump suggested the U.S. needs to remain engaged in Afghanistan to secure the cause for which they gave their lives.Vietnam was a seminal period in the American experience.Its natural to draw parallels between Vietnam and other lengthy military engagements.The U.S. has now been in Afghanistan since shortly after 9/11.How long should the U.S. stay?Ironically, military analysts now believe Vietnam isnt the model to which people should look when discussing Afghanistan.They note how long the U.S. has remained on the Korean Peninsula.This is ironic.Consider the fact that the 60-plus year U.S. presence there hasnt inhibited the possibility of the U.S. facing off with Pyongyang in a nuclear war.Those chances are now as high as ever.In June, the president submitted to Congress a report detailing all of the places the U.S. is involved militarily (most are listed above), information about deployments and justifications for the operations.Most of these missives from the administration to Congress contain a crucial phrase.The letter states the information the president is sending to Capitol Hill is consistent with the War Powers Resolution, as part of my efforts to keep Congress informed about deployments of the U.S. Armed Forces equipped for combat.Note it states consistent with the resolution.The letter doesnt state in compliance with.No administration of either party has truly acknowledged the resolution since its adoption in 1974.Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war.Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution names the president commander in chief.Congress created the resolution as an additional check on the president to curb his war-making authority.This effort backfired as Congress inadvertently ceded more latitude to the president.So short of declaring war somewhere, presidents simply slip Congress a note at regular intervals as to what the U.S. is doing where.Constitutional?Unclear.Adhering to the War Powers Resolution?Not really.Consistent with the resolution?You bet.This brings us to Niger.Think the U.S. is at war in Niger?Then why are there four dead Americans there and what were they doing there?Trumps June letter spells it all out.The president told lawmakers that United States military personnel in the Lake Chad Basin continue to provide a wide variety of support to African partners conducting counterterrorism operations in the region.In Niger, there are about 645 U.S. military personnel deployed to support these missions.In Cameroon, roughly 300 U.S. military personnel are also deployed, the bulk of whom are supporting United States airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations in the region.These forces are equipped with weapons for the purpose of providing their own force protection and security, and they will remain in Cameroon, with the consent of the government of Cameroon, until their support is no longer needed.Time to Vietnamize the effort?The operation has caused us to begin to re-examine force protection in Niger, said Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.We have to re-evaluate what were doing there.Few Americans even knew the U.S. was involved in Niger.Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky, trolled fellow GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham on Twitter after the South Carolina senator told NBC he wasnt fully aware of U.S. military operations there.You know you are in too many wars in too many places when even warmonger Lindsay Graham cant keep track anymore, Paul tweeted.This is why Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., has long argued that the 2001 and 2002 authorizations Congress approved for wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are calcified.Hes pushed for a retrenched Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) for years now.We were in Niger to deal with an ISIS threat, Kaine said.Its time for Congress to finally revisit the authorization which is badly out of date and have a debate on full view of the American public about all the different countries where we are in engaged in military action right now.Lawmakers of both parties have flirted with such a proposal for several years.Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., convenes a hearing Monday about a potential new AUMF with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis.It is perhaps more important than ever that we have a sober national conversation about Congresss Constitutional role in authorizing the use of military force, Corker said.Congress felt it was in the dark a few weeks ago about what went down in Niger and demanded more information from the Pentagon.Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., threatened to subpoena military officials after they were less than forthcoming about Niger.That prompted Mattis to pay McCain a courtesy call at his office.When asked in the hall if he hustled to Capitol Hill because of McCains subpoena warning, Mattis stopped in his tracks in a corridor of the Russell Senate Office Building.Are you kidding me?replied an incredulous Mattis.The Defense secretary than ventured over to talk with Graham.After that conclave, Graham offered perhaps the most sober assessment yet about U.S. involvement overseas and perhaps why Congress is mulling a new AUMF.This war is getting hot in places where its been cool, he said about the broader war on terrorism.The war is beginning to morph, Graham also said, noting that there would be more -- not less --operations like the one in Niger.So the U.S. finds itself in Niger and Mali and Cameroon and Chad and the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo and a host of other places few Americans have ever heard of -- to say nothing about Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.The perfect solution would be the Vietnamization of these conflicts as suggested so long ago by Defense Secretary Melvin Laird.But with the U.S. now committed all over the globe, its pretty clear the opposite happened.These battles are now Americanized.
Puerto Rico power company will cancel contract with Whitefish, firm from Zinke's hometown, director says:::::The Puerto Rican government's power company is going to scrap its $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy Holdings once it wraps up current work on Hurricane Maria recovery efforts, power company director Ricardo Ramos said Sunday.Ramos said he's bowing to a demand by Puerto Rico Gov.Ricardo Rosell, who had called Sunday for the island's power company to cancel the contract with the Montana company from Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke's hometown.Roughly 70 percent of the U.S. territory has been languishing without power more than a month after Maria struck on Sept. 20 as a Category 4 storm with winds of up to 154 mph.Ramos says the cancellation will delay pending work by 10 to 12 weeks but will not affect current work.The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) awarded the contract to Whitefish Energy Holdings help crews restore transmission and distribution lines damaged or destroyed during the hurricane.The two-year-old company had just two full-time employees when the storm hit last month, but says it is contracting with hundreds of workers for the Puerto Rico project."I have petitioned the board of PREPA to invoke the cancellation clause so that after the current immediate work that is being done is finished, that contract is no longer available," Rosell said Sunday, according to BuzzFeed.ZINKE: 'I HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO' WITH MONTANA COMPANY GETTING $300M CONTRACT "It's interfering with everything and it doesn't go towards the best interests of the people of Puerto Rico," he reportedly said referring to the contract."We are very disappointed in the decision by Governor Rossell to ask PREPA to cancel the contract which led to PREPA's announcement this afternoon," Whitefish Energy Holdings said in a statement."The decision will only delay what the people of Puerto Rico want and deserve to have the power restored quickly in the same manner their fellow citizens on the mainland experience after a natural disaster."The company added that it "will certainly finish any work that PREPA wants us to complete and stand by our commitments knowing that we made an important contribution to the restoration of the power grid since our arrival on the island on October 2."The contract for the small Montana company has come under intense scrutiny, and audits of the Whitefish contract at a local and federal level are under way.I had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish Energy receiving a contract in Puerto Rico, Zinke said in a statement Friday.Any attempts by the dishonest media or political operatives to tie me to awarding or influencing any contract involving Whitefish are completely baseless.Fox News' John Roberts, Jennifer Bowman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Gowdy slams Mueller team over leaks about charges in Trump-Russia probe:::::Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, the leader of the Houses top investigative committee, slammed special counsel Robert Mueller on Sunday for allowing the news media to learn that he and his legal team now have charges in their Russia investigation.In the only conversation Ive had with Robert Mueller, I stressed to him the importance of cutting out the leaks, Gowdy, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, told Fox News Sunday.Its kind of ironic that the people charged with investigating the law and the violations of the law would violate the law.Mueller and his team have for roughly the past five months been leading a Justice Department investigation into whether anybody associated with the President Trumps 2016 White House campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election outcome.On Friday night, CNN reported that Muellers team has filed the first charges in the case with a federal grand jury.Make no mistake, disclosing grand jury material is a violation of the law.Somebody violated their oath of secrecy, Gowdy, a South Carolina lawmaker and former federal prosecutor, also told Fox News on Sunday.The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that anyone charged will be taken into custody Monday.However, the charges have been sealed by a federal judge.So whoever is charged and whether the charges are criminal remains unclear.The possible charges come as Mueller's tactics have been called into question.During a raid by the FBI in July of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's Virginia home, a source close to the investigation told Fox News at the time the scope of the search was "heavy-handed, designed to intimidate."Andrew Weissmann, the prosecutor tapped by Mueller to help lead the investigation, has also received criticism.Sidney Powell, a former federal prosecutor recently wrote about Weissman in a piece titled, Judging by Mueller's staffing choices, he may not be very interested in justice.Powell accused Weissmann, once the director of the Enron Task Force, of prosecutorial overreach in past cases and said it could signal whats to come for President Trump and his associates in the Russia probe.What was supposed to have been a search for Russias cyberspace intrusions into our electoral politics has morphed into a malevolent mission targeting friends, family and colleagues of the president, Powell wrote in The Hill.The Mueller investigation has become an all-out assault to find crimes to pin on them and it wont matter if there are no crimes to be found.This team can make some.Powell cited several cases where Weissmann won convictions that were later overturned.During a Saturday appearance on Fox News, former Department of Justice official Robert Driscoll told anchor Leland Vittert its possible the indictment might not even be directly tied to Russian collusion.Think back to the Clinton years, Driscoll said.The Whitewater investigation was about an Arkansas land deal.And it ended up being about something else completely.Driscoll added, Robert Mueller is free to look at taxes, is free to look at lobbying filings, foreign agent filings.Things like that could all be involved that wouldnt necessarily touch on the issue of Russia collusion that everyone seems focused on politically.Speculation has focused on former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn as likely targets.Manafort has been the subject of a longstanding investigation into his dealings in the Ukraine several years ago -- for which he did not file as a foreign agent until June 2017.Federal agents, reportedly in search of evidence related to the Russia investigation, this summer raided his northern Virginia home.He also was reportedly wiretapped by investigators before and after the 2016 presidential election.Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, was a Trump surrogate during the campaign and briefly served as national security adviser before being fired for failing to fully disclose his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, then-Russian ambassador to the United States.The FBI also secured approval from a federal court to monitor the communications of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.On Saturday, Page released a statement to Fox News in response to questions about whether he or his lawyers have been notified about any charges.Page said in the statement that he has worked with the executive branch and Congress since being contacted in March.But he also suggested that revelations about the Democratic Party having helped finance a dossier to smear Trump has tainted any Russia probe.In terms of charges', I cant even imagine what might even be considered now that the false evidence from the politically-motivated, big-money-financed Dodgy Dossier that started this extrajudicial disaster has instead been so thoroughly exposed as a complete sham, Carter wrote in the statement.Richard Hibey, an attorney for Manafort, told Fox News on Friday that neither he nor any of his colleagues representing Manafort had been informed of any indictment of their client.Manafort has been the subject of a longstanding investigation into his dealings in the Ukraine several years ago for which he did not file as a foreign agent until June 2017.In addition to his home being raided, Manafort was reportedly wiretapped by investigators before and after the 2016 presidential election.Flynn served as a Trump surrogate during the campaign and briefly served as national security adviser before being fired over his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, who was Russia's ambassador to the United States.Mueller has reportedly probed whether Flynn was involved in a private effort to get former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's emails from Russian hackers.The Justice Departments special counsels office declined to comment on the reports of filed charges.Trump has denied allegations that his campaign colluded with Russians and condemned investigations into the matter as a witch hunt.Fox News' Catherine Herridge, James Rosen, John Roberts, Brooke Singman and Kaitlyn Schallhorn contributed to this report.
Hill Republicans want more answers from Wasserman Schultz, Podesta about Trump dossier money:::::Congressional Republicans on Sunday called for Democrats John Podesta and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz to provide further answers about their party paying for a dossier on President Trumps alleged ties to Russia, after telling Senate investigators last month that they had no knowledge of such payments.Wasserman Schultz is the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and Podesta was the chairman of Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign.Both groups purportedly paid millions for research that led to the dossier, The Washington Post reported last week.South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, suggested on Fox News Sunday that the DNC paying a law firm for so-called opposition research connected to the dossier was tantamount to money laundering.I'm not an election law expert, but the good news is you don't have to be, to understand the absurdity of believing that you can launder all of your campaign money by just hiring a law firm, said Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor.So Im interested in that.He also seemed to question Podesta and Wasserman Schultz telling the Senate Intelligence Committee last month that they didnt know who paid for the dossier.I am also interested in sharing some memory tricks with folks at the DNC because no one can remember who paid $10 million to a law firm to do oppo research, Gowdy said.I find that stunning.$10 million and no one can remember who authorized it, who approved it, who said, This is a really good idea.When questioned about the issue by Fox News last week on Capitol Hill, Wasserman Schultz said only: I wasnt aware of the arrangement at all.Also on Sunday, Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Podesta and Wasserman Schultz absolutely need to be recalled before the panel.It's difficult to imagine that a campaign chairman, that the head of the DNC would not know of an expenditure of this magnitude and significance, Collins said on CBS Face the Nation.Podesta's attorney Marc Elias, who worked for the law firm that brokered the dossier funding, sat next to Podesta during his Senate appearance last mont, according to CNN.Collins also said Sunday that Elias should be questioned, too.California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, on Sunday declined to answer on ABCs This Week whether the DNC and Clinton campaign should have disclosed earlier their stake in the dossier.I can't answer that, he said.I certainly would have liked to know who paid for it earlier, but nonetheless, that's just one factor to be considered.Fox News' Jason Donner and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Puerto Rico gov seeks to cancel $300M Whitefish contract:::::Puerto Rico's governor on Sunday demanded that the board of the island's power company cancel the $300M contract with Whitefish Energy Holdings amid increased scrutiny of the Montana company's role in Hurricane Maria recovery efforts.The announcement by Gov.Ricardo Rossello comes as federal legislators seek to investigate the contract awarded to the small company from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's hometown."There cannot be any kind of distraction that alters the commitment to restore electrical power as soon as possible in Puerto Rico," Rossello said, adding that nearly $8 million has been paid to Whitefish so far.Whitefish spokesman Chris Chiames told The Associated Press that the company would soon issue comment.Power company spokesman Carlos Monroig did not return messages for comment.Rossello said he has requested that crews from New York and Florida come help restore power in Puerto Rico as he criticized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for not meeting its goals.The agency could not be immediately reached for comment.Audits of the Whitefish contract at a local and federal level are ongoing, and the governor also announced the appointment of an outside coordinator to oversee the power company's purchase and contracting division."If something illegal was done, once again, the officials involved in that process will feel the full weight of the law, and I will take administrative actions," Rossello said.Roughly 70 percent of the island remains without power more than a month after Hurricane Maria struck the U.S. territory on Sept. 20 as a Category 4 storm with winds of up to 154 mph (245 kph).Power company Director Ricardo Ramos has said that Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority reached a deal with Whitefish just days before the hurricane struck, saying that he spoke with at least five other companies that demanded similar rates, in addition to a down payment the agency did not have.Ramos also said the Federal Emergency Management Agency had approved of the deal, something the agency has denied.FEMA said it has not approved any reimbursement requests from the power company for money to cover repairs to the island's electrical system.The contract said the utility would not pay costs unallowable under FEMA grants, but it also said, "The federal government is not a party to this contract."FEMA has raised concerns about how Whitefish got the deal and whether the contracted prices were reasonable.The 2-year-old company had just two full-time employees when the storm hit, but it has since hired more than 300 workers.A Whitefish contract obtained by The Associated Press found that the deal included $20,277 an hour for a heavy lift Chinook helicopter, $650 an hour for a large crane truck, $322 an hour for a foreman of a power line crew, $319 an hour for a journeyman lineman and $286 an hour for a mechanic.Each worker also gets a daily allowance of $80 for food, $332 for a hotel room and $1,000 for each flight to or from the mainland.Whitefish Energy Holdings is based in Whitefish, Montana.Zinke, a former Montana congressman, knows Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski, and Zinke's son also had a summer job at a Whitefish construction site."I had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish Energy receiving a contract in Puerto Rico," Zinke recently said in a statement linked to a tweet."Any attempts by the dishonest media or political operatives to tie me to awarding or influencing any contract involving Whitefish are completely baseless."Democrats also have questioned the role of HBC Investments, a key financial backer of Whitefish Energy.The Dallas-based company's founder and general partner, Joe Colonnetta, has contributed thousands of dollars to Trump and other Republicans.Chiames has said Colonnetta's political donations were "irrelevant" and that the company would cooperate with any federal authorities.This week, Rep.Rob Bishop, the Utah Republican who heads the House Natural Resources Committee, sent the power company director a letter demanding documents, including those related to the contract with Whitefish and others that show what authority the agency has to deviate from normal contracting processes.A Bishop spokesman did not immediately return a message for comment on Sunday.A federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico's finances announced this week that retired Air Force Col. Noel Zamot will be in charge of power reconstruction efforts.Rossello and other officials have rejected the appointment, saying the local government is in charge of a power company that is $9 billion in debt and that had struggled with ongoing outages before hurricanes Irma and Maria hit last month.
Trump: Claims about Clinton camp spending millions on 'fake dossier' has GOP 'united & angry':::::President Trump on Sunday said the lack of investigation into the Clinton campaign spending a reported $12 million on a dossier crafted during the 2016 presidential race to smear him has sparked unprecedented anger and unity among fellow Republicans.Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?), Trump said first in a series of tweets.The president tweeted after South Carolina GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight committee, told Fox News Sunday that he's concerns about Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign purportedly paying a law firm at least $10 million for the dossier, which was to be used as Trump opposition research.Im interested in that laundering money through a law firm, Gowdy said.In the series of tweets Sunday, the president again attempted to make the larger case that Washington and the rest of the country is consumed by the Justice Departments special counsel probe into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia during the White House race, amid similar issues related to Democrats and others.The Uranium to Russia deal, the 33,000 plus deleted Emails, the Comey fix and so much more.Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia, Trump tweeted following news reports earlier this weekend that special counsel Robert Mueller now has federal grand jury charges in the Russia investigation that could be made public as early as Monday.Congressional investigators are in fact looking into new details about an Obama-era Uranium deal with connections to Russia and perhaps Clinton when she was secretary of State.The FBI investigated her use of private email servers and deleted emails when she ran the State Department.However, then-FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump recently fired, concluded the server-email investigation without recommending criminal charges.The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics, but the R's ... are now fighting back like never before.There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out.DO SOMETHING!, Trump also tweeted Sunday.
Ex-Ohio lawmaker kept asking for sex, woman says:::::In a complaint filed earlier this month, an Ohio state employee claims that former Ohio state Sen. Cliff Hite implored her for sex, describing himself as a grown man with needs.The woman says in a memo filed Oct. 11 that on one occasion she had to tell Hite no eight or nine times before he gave up, the Toledo Blade reported.Hite resigned from the state Senate Oct. 16.The alleged harassment included Facebook posts, invitations to the former senator's condominium, and a request that the woman become his "f--- buddy," Cleveland.com reported.According to the Blade, Hite responded to the womans complaint Oct. 25 by apologizing for his conduct, but saying he disagreed with many of the representations in the complaint, some of which I dont believe happened, were misunderstood, or were portrayed inaccurately.Hite acknowledged, however, that some of his comments to the woman were inappropriate."After we met, I sometimes asked her for hugs and talked with her in a way that was not appropriate for a married man, father, and grandfather like myself," Hite said, according to the Blade."Beyond those hugs, there was no inappropriate physical contact.Hite, a 63-year-old married Republican, was appointed to an Ohio Senate vacancy in 2011 after serving in the state House of Representatives since 2007.The woman was said to be a lawyer for the states Legislative Services Commission, which assists lawmakers in preparing legislative proposals.
Twitter suspends longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone:::::Longtime Trump ally Roger Stones account was suspended by Twitter on Saturday but the self-styled agent provocateur is vowing to return to the social network.I have been informed that I have been suspended for 3 hours and 12 minutes, Stone told Fox News in a text message.While I am uncertain why, sometimes the stark truth offends some people.Added Stone, I'll be baaaaaak.As of Saturday evening, the @RogerJStoneJr account was still unavailable.This account has been suspended, the page for Stones account read.A Twitter spokesperson told Fox News they do not comment on individual accounts.But the company cited its policy on abusive behavior that states users may not incite or engage in the targeted abuse or harassment of others.On Friday, in a series of offensive tweets, Stone lashed out at some of CNNs personalities, including anchors Jake Tapper and Don Lemon.It came as the network reported that a federal grand jury has approved the first charges in special counsel Robert Muellers Russia investigation.MUELLER HAS FILED CHARGES IN RUSSIA-TRUMP ASSOCIATES PROBE: MULTIPLE REPORTS In one tweet, he called Lemon a dumb piece of s--t. He also called him dumber than dog s--t. He also referred to Lemon and Tapper as human excrement and CNN contributor Ana Navarro as a dumbf--k. Stone, who was interviewed by the House Intelligence Committee for its Russia probe, is a colorful political consultant and longtime informal adviser to Trump who often serves a surrogate for the president in the media.
House Intelligence Committee strikes deal for access to Fusion GPS bank records:::::The House Intelligence Committee said Saturday it has struck a deal to gain access to bank records from Fusion GPS, the firm behind the salacious anti-Trump dossier.The company had recently attempted to block the committees subpoena for its banking records.The parties have reached an agreement related to the House Intelligence Committee's subpoena for Fusion GPS's bank records that will secure the Committee's access to the records necessary for its investigation, the intelligence committee said in a statement released Saturday.Lawmakers for months have been trying to investigate the origin of the salacious anti-Trump dossier, which claimed the Russian government had compromising material on President Trump.It was provided to journalists and the FBI last year, when Trump was still a Republican candidate.CONSERVATIVE WEBSITE FUNDED INITIAL FUSION GPS TRUMP OPPOSITION EFFORT Over the last week, it was revealed that Fusion GPS was retained last year by Marc E. Elias, an attorney representing the DNC and the Clinton campaign.The firm then hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to write the dossier.On Friday evening, it was revealed that the opposition research project was initially backed by the conservative Washington Free Beacon website.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., had issued a subpoena on Oct. 4 for Fusion GPS TD Bank records.In seeking a "temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction" to block the release of those records, Fusion argued the release would them their rights to free speech and expressive association as guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution."Earlier this month, two officials from the political research firm invoked their Fifth Amendment right and refused to answer questions Wednesday before the same House panel on Capitol Hill.Fusion GPS co-founder Peter Fritsch and top lieutenant Thomas Catan both took the Fifth on every question posed.Fox News Catherine Herridge contributed to this report.
GOP tax plan trashes the value of two popular tax breaks:::::GOP tax plan could trash the value of two popular tax breaks 4:02 PM ET Tue, 26 Sept 2017 | 00:45 The Republican tax reform plan being unveiled Wednesday shows that while two popular deductions would remain intact, they'd become useless to the majority of taxpayers who now take advantage of them.GOP lawmakers want to retain the tax breaks for mortgage interest and charitable contributions.Yet given that the plan is to nearly double the standard deduction, "many current itemizers would choose that instead, so a lot less people would use those deductions," said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.The plan is facing stiff opposition from elements of the real estate industry, most notably the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB).On Saturday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the association made a decision to formally oppose the GOP plan after top Republicans told them they wouldn't replace the deductions, or give credit for property taxes.Currently, taxpayers choose between the standard deduction or itemized deductions and use whichever amount is greater to reduce their tax bill.For 2017, the standard deduction is $6,350 for individual taxpayers, $9,350 for heads of households and $12,700 for joint filers.In other words, if those amounts nearly double, a married couple would need deductions to exceed $24,000 to make itemizing worthwhile.The Tax Policy Center estimates that of the 45 million tax filers who itemize, 38 million, or 84 percent, would opt for the $24,000 standard deduction because it would exceed the combined value of other deductions available to them.
Trump is leaning toward Jay Powell for next Fed chair, but remains undecided: Source:::::President Donald Trump is leaning toward naming Jerome "Jay" Powell as Fed chair but remains undecided, a source told CNBC.For weeks, Powell has been considered the front-runner for the job as the president considers who will steward the central bank when Janet Yellen's term expires in February.However, the competition has turned into a derby in which various candidates have moved to the front only to get pushed back in the wake of news developments.On Saturday, a source also told The Wall street Journal that Powell was Trump's likely pick for the Fed chairmanship.Powell, a current Fed governor, has the advantage of presenting Trump with a chance to break from the Yellen Fed yet maintain many of the same policies that have kept the stock market rally intact and interest rates low."If Trump believes Yellen's approach is best for keeping market levels growing, he is going to seek a Fed chair who can carry on her mantle but under the Trump brand.The best non-Yellen Yellen is Powell," Beacon Policy Advisors said in a report Friday morning.Powell was appointed to the Fed in 2012 to fill an unexpired term that won't end until 2028.He has emerged as a compromise candidate as Trump considers reappointing Yellen or moving to a starker alternative like Stanford economist John Taylor, who would be expected to push for higher rates and a faster reduction in the Fed's $4.5 trillion balance sheet.The president has praised Yellen in recent days, but the chance to make a break from the past could prove too enticing."Given the president's propensity for comparing himself against President Obama and seeking to continually undercut his legacy, choosing the Obama-appointed Yellen for another term would not give Trump the satisfaction of leaving his own mark on the Federal Reserve," the Beacon noted added."Some Senate Republicans are making grumblings about Powell and his allegiance with Yellen's decision making while at the Fed, however, Senate Republicans will not obstruct a Trump nomination of Powell."Trump previously has indicated he will make a choice before he leaves on his next foreign trip next Friday.
Rep. Kevin Brady says lawmakers considering raising 401(k) contribution limit:::::Lawmakers are considering increasing the contribution limit for a popular retirement savings plan, CNBC has learned.CNBC has confirmed that lawmakers are now looking at raising the 401(k) contribution limit to $20,000 or more.That is a reversal from earlier reports that lawmakers were considering reducing that tax-deductible amount to as low as $2,400.Earlier, top House tax writer Rep. Kevin Brady said that he would like changes to "help people save more, sooner."The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee said he has talked to President Donald Trump twice this week about 401(k)s. "He'd like to raise the limits so people can save more in those plans.So do I. I think that's a good start," Brady said.Under current law, taxpayers can put a specified amount in 401(k) retirement savings plans without paying taxes upfront.Lowering the amount could help to raise tax revenue as the GOP looks for ways to offset across-the-board individual and corporate tax cuts.The amount workers can contribute to a 401(k) rises to $18,500 next year, up from $18,000 in 2017.People age 50 and older can tack on a so-called catch-up contribution of $6,000.Potential changes to the popular retirement savings have been all over the map.On Monday, Trump emphatically tweeted that "there will be NO change to your 401(k)."He called the 401(k) tax benefit a "great and popular middle class tax break that works."But on Wednesday afternoon, the president appeared to back off that tweet, calling 401(k) plans "very important."Trump said he didn't want a proposal to change them to "go too far."CNBC's Ylan Mui and Jacob Pramuk contributed to this report.
The only thing growing faster than the economy is our deficit:::::"These projections foreshadow another period of trillion-dollar deficits at a time when the United States has experienced one of the longest continuous economic expansions in history and an unemployment rate of 4.5 percent," the center's analysis concludes.Noting deficit trends since 1980, the analysis adds that the nation "has piled up debt more than twice as fast as economic growth."In January, the CBO projected a fiscal 2018 deficit of $48 billion, rising to $1 trillion by 2023.Over the 10-year period from 2018-2027, it forecast deficits totaling $9.4-trillion.By June, the CBO revised all those numbers to reflect more-than-expected red ink.It pegged the 2018 deficit at $563 billion, a $1.02 trillion deficit in 2022, and 10-year deficits of $10.1-trillion.The Bipartisan Policy Center analysis updates those projections.It assumes $200 billion over 10 years for the costs of recent wildfires, hurricane damage and flooding.And it folds in the $1.5 trillion in higher deficits allowed by the new budget resolution Congress has passed to smooth the way for tax cuts.The $1 trillion deficit level held symbolic power for Republicans during President Barack Obama's tenure.They used the prospect of "trillion-dollar deficits as far as the eye can see" to win back the House in 2010 and force a Democratic administration into contentious budget negotiations.A GOP-controlled Congress has since eased the spending caps that resulted from those budget talks.House conservatives pushed for new spending cuts in the 2018 budget resolution but abandoned them under pressure from the Senate.The question now is whether the $1 trillion figure still has symbolic power as it shadows a Republican drive to cut taxes.A former GOP staff director at the Senate Budget Committee, who helped produce the new deficit analysis, hopes so but doesn't expect it."I'm afraid not," said Steve Bell, who is now at the Bipartisan Policy Center."What you're hearing from me is the last squawk of a dying deficit hawk."
New White House report predicts corporate tax cuts will boost GDP by 3 to 5 percent:::::President Donald Trump's Council of Economic Advisers on Friday released the second in a series of reports on how proposed changes to the tax code could influence economic growth.The CEA predicted that corporate tax cuts alone would produce GDP growth of between 3 and 5 percent in as little as three years.The cuts are part of the tax reform package currently being finalized in Congress and expected to be unveiled as a bill next week.From the report: "Our findings indicate that the business side of the Unified Framework would increase GDP by between 3 and 5 percent over the baseline long-run projection.The GDP effects we estimate are growth impacts from corporate tax reform alone.The literature and models vary as to the timeframe over which these benefits could be realized; some have the effects as soon as 3 to 5 years, others find it could take at least double that time.There will be additional GDP effects from reforms to individual income and pass-through business taxes, which we have not modeled."On a call with reporters Friday, CEA Chairman Kevin Hassett said he was optimistic that the Trump administration's current budget proposal, combined with corporate tax cuts, would create enough growth to make overall tax cuts revenue neutral once they were fully implemented into the economy."We want to help the middle class get the raise it deserves, and the best way to keep the economy going and to knock it out of the low growth of past decades is to do something to give it a boost in the arm, and that's tax reform, regulatory reform and infrastructure," Hasset said."That's corporate tax reform in particular, that defeats the offshoring model and encourages firms to locate their activity back here in the United States."Hassett acknowledged that CEA's models would likely be impacted by the results of ongoing negotiations on Capitol Hill to finalize the tax reform bill."We modeled the corporate side with the details available.We really need to know where the individual brackets are and how that relates to income distribution," he said.Hassett also emphasized the dual importance of cutting the statutory corporate tax rate and easing the repatriation of funds U.S. companies hold overseas."Our current tax code incentivizes this shell game, and massively increases our trade deficit," Hassett said of the practice known as offshoring.By reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, "firms will have much less incentive to play this round-trip game."Hassett's predictions about corporate profits and wage growth have already come under scrutiny from some economists, who argue that the administration is drawing conclusions about growth that are not backed up by historical or empirical evidence.Former Clinton administration Treasury Secretary Larry Summers recently wrote in a blog post that the Trump administration's predictions linking wage growth and corporate tax cuts are "some combination of dishonest, incompetent and absurd."Read the entire report below.
US drug overdose deaths topped 60,000 in 2016, with more potent illicit drug use on the rise:::::Potent synthetic opioids such as fentanyl have already accelerated the number of deaths from drug overdose in the U.S. in recent years.And now, even stronger versions may make the opioid crisis in the U.S. even worse, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Deaths from drug overdose in this country exceeded 60,000 last year, partially driven by a fivefold increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, according to data released Friday.And analogs of fentanyl, such as carfentanil used to tranquilize large animals were increasingly implicated in overdose deaths, particularly in Eastern states, according to the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.Often the substances were found along with illicit drugs such as heroin and cocaine, raising a concern that these more potent drugs "have become a part of illicit opioid markets in multiple states," the authors wrote."Because of its extreme potency, even limited circulation of carfentanil could markedly increase the number of fatal overdoses," they said.Already the numbers are staggering, driven since 2013 by the introduction of fentanyl into the market for heroin, the CDC said.Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine; carfentanil is estimated to be 10,000 times more potent than morphine.Other fentanyl analogs are thought to be less potent.The variability can lead to disaster."The increased mixing or co-use of fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, and varying fentanyl analogs might contribute to increased risk for overdose because persons misusing opioids and other drugs are exposed to drug products with substantially varied potency," the report authors wrote.The data show that the number of overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids rose to 20,000 last year, from 3,105 in 2013.The report examined data from 10 states, using information from death certificates and coroner reports, in addition to information from death scene investigations and results of forensic toxicology testing.The CDC said this is the first report to use "toxicologic and scene evidence from multiple states to characterize opioid overdose deaths."There were about 700 deaths in which fentanyl analogs were involved."This finding raises concern that in the near future, fentanyl analog overdose deaths might mirror the rapidly rising trajectory of fentanyl overdose deaths that began in 2013 and become a major factor in opioid overdose deaths," the authors wrote.They say the CDC has expanded the number of states participating in its Enhanced State Opioid Overdose Surveillance program to 32 and Washington, D.C., from the 10 included in this report, and increased funding to improve forensic toxicologic testing.The authors also said measures should be taken to address the growing number of opioid overdose deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, including increasing access to medication-assisted treatment a move also endorsed this week by Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and increasing availability of the overdose-reversal drug naloxone.
Ex-US ambassador: Trump has gotten China to do more on North Korea than any American president:::::Former ambassador: Trump needs to get China to turn up heat on North Korea 8:22 AM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 | 02:56 President Donald Trump, in unprecedented fashion, has been able to get the Chinese government to turn the screws on North Korea in hopes of getting Kim Jong Un to halt military provocations, according to a former diplomat who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents."The Chinese have done more under President Trump's prodding than any other American president.They signed on to the UN sanctions.There are now individual Chinese sanctions; the central bank governors instructed banks in China to wind up loans to North Korea," Nicholas Burns told CNBC on Friday.He appeared on "Squawk Box," a week before Trump embarks on a trip to Asia, which includes stops in China and South Korea."The Chinese are clearly frustrated with the North Koreans.The Chinese don't want a war on the Korean Peninsula.They want trade," said Burns, who served as U.S. ambassador to NATO and was the State Department's third-ranking official during George W. Bush's presidency.He also advised the administrations of George H.W.Bush and Bill Clinton.Chinese President Xi Jinping, who was just given a major governing mandate, will be "eager to cooperate" with Trump, said Burns, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government."The president [Trump] has obviously gone slow on any kind of major [trade] sanctions against China because he's prioritizing the North Korean issue.The Chinese understand that."
Trump responds to California billionaire urging impeachment:::::President Donald Trump is responding to a California billionaire who has vowed to spend at least $10 million in advertising calling for the president's impeachment.Trump is using Twitter to call Tom Steyer "wacky & totally unhinged."He says Steyer "has been fighting me and my Make America Great Again agenda from the beginning," adding the billionaire environmentalist "never wins elections!"Steyer recently launched the advertising, which has been running on Fox News and other national outlets, arguing that Trump should be ousted from office.Steyer contends Trump is pushing the U.S. toward a nuclear war, is obstructing justice at the FBI and threatening to shut down news organizations he doesn't like.Steyer wants viewers to call their members of Congress and tell them to bring articles of impeachment.
Mattis talks diplomacy on North Korea ahead of Trump's Asia tour:::::U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis emphasized diplomatic efforts instead of military ones to resolve the crisis with North Korea as he stood at the tense and heavily-fortified border between North and South on Friday, saying: "Our goal is not war."His remarks came before U.S. President Donald Trump who has threatened to destroy the North, if necessary leaves on his first trip to Asia next week.His tour will include a stop in South Korea to meet President Moon Jae-in.Moon, after talks with Mattis, said the "aggressive deployment" of U.S. strategic assets on the Korean peninsula had been effective in deterring the threat from North Korea.Separately, North Korea said it will release on Friday a South Korean fishing boat that was found to be in North Korean waters illegally, state media said, as the U.S. defense secretary visited the border dividing the Korean peninsula.The tension between North Korea and the United States has been building after a series of weapons tests by Pyongyang and bellicose verbal exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, stoking fears any miscalculation could lead to an armed confrontation."North Korean provocations continue to threaten regional and global security despite unanimous condemnation by the United Nations Security Council," Mattis said in prepared remarks as he visited the demilitarized zone (DMZ)."As Secretary of State Tillerson has made clear, our goal is not war, but rather the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."Standing alongside Mattis, South Korean Defence Minister Song Young-moo said: "We together will continue to defend peace through strong will and strong might."The proposed return of the South Korean fishing boat and its crew would avoid potentially worsening already strained relations between Pyongyang and South Korea and its U.S. ally.The South Korean fishing boat was seized on Oct. 21 and investigation by the North found the boat and crew entered North Korean waters for fishing, state news agency KCNA reported.North Korea decided to release the boat after "taking into account the fact that all the crewmen honestly admitted their offense, repeatedly apologizing and asking for leniency," the report said in English.The vessel and its crew would be released in waters at the military boundary between the two Koreas, which are still technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.North Korean fishing boats have at times been found drifting south of the maritime border between the two Koreas, often having run out of fuel or broken down.Most North Korean crew are released to the North after interrogations by intelligence officials if they wish to return.It is more unusual for South Korean fishing vessels to be found in similar circumstances.A South Korean Unification Ministry official said it was aware the fishing boat had gone missing earlier in the week.The crew of 10, including seven South Koreans and three Vietnamese, would be questioned by officials on their return, he added.
British newspaper got anonymous call 25 minutes before JFK assassination:::::LONDON Twenty-five minutes before John F. Kennedy was assassinated, a British newspaper received an anonymous tip about "some big news" in the United States, according to the trove of more than 2,800 documents released late Thursday by the National Archives.The mystery call was made to a senior reporter at the Cambridge News, a paper that serves the East Anglia area of eastern England, on Nov. 22, 1963, at 6:05 p.m. local time.Kennedy was shot shortly afterward, as he rode in a presidential motorcade in Dallas, Texas, at 12:30 a.m. CST.Dallas is six hours behind Britain."The caller said only that the Cambridge News reporter should call the American Embassy in London for some big news and then hung up," the memo, from the FBI's deputy director James Angleton to J. Edgar Hoover, its director, said.The revelation, one of many that emerged from the planned release of the Kennedy assassination documents so far, there's no smoking guns adds to the raft of conspiracy theories surrounding his death.In fact, the memo was first released in July, but went unreported until the cache of files was released Thursday.More from USA Today: JFK files: Highlights from 2,800 previously classified records With JFK files open, students say open civil rights cold case files, too Trump withholds others due to national security concerns The memo, dated Nov. 26, 1963, says: "After the word of the President's death was received the reporter informed the Cambridge police of the anonymous call, and the police informed MI5.The important point is that the call was made, according to MI5 calculations, about 25 minutes before the President was shot.The Cambridge reporter had never received a call of this kind before, and MI5 state that he is known to them as a sound and loyal person with no security record."The reporter's name was not mentioned in the memo, which adds that Britain's MI5 security services had received "similar anonymous phone calls of a strangely coincidental nature."The Cambridge Newsnoted in a story Friday that it too did not know the name of the reporter who took the call, although it said the existence of the memo was first discovered by a lawyer, Michael Eddowes, who devoted much of his life to investigating the mystery surrounding Kennedy's death.Eddowes, who died in 1992, told the Cambridge News in 1981 that he believed the anonymous caller was a British-born Soviet agent named Albert Osborne.Two months before Kennedy's assassination, Eddowes believed that Osborne, who also apparently used the alias John Howard Bowen, had befriended Lee Harvey Oswald, the man ultimately charged with murdering Kennedy.Eddowes' theory was that the call was made "because the Soviet Union was eager that the assassination should be seen as a conspiracy," according to the paper.
Putin oversees test fire of four nuclear-capable ballistic missiles:::::Russian President Vladimir Putin personally oversaw the launch of four nuclear-capable ballistic missiles as part of a test for Moscow's strategic nuclear forces, according to the Kremlin.The training exercise, which was conducted Thursday evening, included the testing of land, air and submarine-based ballistic missiles, Russia's defense ministry said in a statement.A Topol intercontinental ballistic missile was tested from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia, hitting a target thousands of miles away at a military testing range on the Kamchatka Peninsula.Three other intercontinental-range ballistic missiles were launched from nuclear-powered submarines."The training assignments were accomplished in full and all the practice targets were successfully destroyed," the ministry said.In a tweet at 7:09 p.m. London time (2:09 p.m.ET) on Thursday, Russia's defense ministry posted a video that appeared to show the nuclear-capable ballistic missile tests.Last month, Russia launched two intercontinental missiles in the space of two weeks amid escalating geopolitical tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
The US is operating three carriers in the Pacific for the first time in a decade:::::The Navy has three carrier strike groups currently in the Pacific where North Korea's nuclear saber rattling has the U.S. and its Asian allies keeping a close watch on the pariah state.The last time the Navy operated three carriers together in the Pacific Fleet was back in 2007, and the current show of force comes just before an upcoming state visit to South Korea by President Donald Trump."Three carrier groups is certainly a robust force," said Dean Cheng, a defense expert and senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based conservative think tank.Defense experts say the carrier-based aircraft has the ability to perform a preemptive strike against North Korea and fleet escort ships could fire cruise missiles.The North's new air-defense system, though, might be capable of intercepting the military aircraft and missiles."This gives us the ability to actually do something as opposed to other kinds of military-symbolic gestures," said Denny Roy, an Asia Pacific security expert and senior fellow at the East-West Center, a think tank in Honolulu.In the past, he said, the U.S. has tended to use symbolic flights of aircraft along the border or sending a single ship near North Korea.The carrier power in the Pacific comes as the Pentagon's top general Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is in South Korea to meet with leaders of South Korea's military "to examine strategies, plans and means needed to deter any North Korean aggression," according to the Department of Defense.
Obamacare insurers were on track to break even, analysis says:::::Obamacare health plans "were on track to break even or make modest profits" on average in 2017 before the Trump administration decided this month to end reimbursement payments to insurers, a new report says.The analysis also said prices for Obamacare plans next year likely would have risen by just mid-to-high-single-digit percentage points on average if President Donald Trump had not for months threatened to end those payments, and if Republicans in Congress had not repeatedly tried to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act in 2017.Instead, because of the lack of a "stable policy environment," the average price of the most popular type of Obamacare plan is rising by an average of 34 percent in most of the United States next year, the analysis said.The report also found that the individual health plan market's "risk pool" or mix of customers whose premiums are supposed to more than offset their respective health benefit costs was not weakened by price hikes for Obamacare plans in 2017.In other words, those premium increases did not "drive many healthy enrollees from the individual market," the analysis found.The report issued Friday was written Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in the Brookings Institution's Economic Studies Program.Fiedler's research was conducted as part of the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy.It comes less than a week before next Wednesday's start of open enrollment in Obamacare plans.Fiedler, in an interview with CNBC, said his analysis shows that "after a rocky start, this market was really on a path to stabilize."He also said that "it's important for people to understand that what we're seeing here" with sharply higher premium prices "is not an inherent feature of this market, but a consequence of a conscious policy choice."Both points are disputed by the Trump adminstration, which claims that Obamacare has inherent flaws that are leading to high premium prices for consumers, and to insurers exiting individual health plan marketplaces.In an interview Monday with WKYC-TV in Cleveland, Seema Verma, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said, "There's a lot of problems with the Affordable Care Act that I think are creating barriers for people to get affordable, accessible coverage.""We had the same problem last year before the Trump administration came here," Verma said."If you look at last year, look at the headlines: a number of insurers leaving the marketplace, we saw double-digit increases.That's exactly the same thing that we're having here," she said."Those problems existed before and that's because the Affordable Care Act's fundamental structure isn't working, so the exact same issues happened last year as well."But according to his report, Fiedler's analysis "estimates that insurers were on track to incur small losses averaging 0.4 percent of premium revenue on [Obamacare]-compliant plans in 2017 before the Trump Administration ended cost-sharing reduction payments for the final quarter of the year."And the report adds there is reason to believe that the data Fiedler analyzed "may systematically understate insurers' actual financial performance, suggesting that insurers were, in fact, on track to make modest profits" on Obamacare plans on average nationwide this year.The Trump administration on Oct. 12 said it would no longer pay Obamacare insurers reimbursements for discounts that those insurers offer to low-income customers in their out-of-pocket health costs.Those discounts must continued to be offered by law.But the Trump administration said the reimbursements for their costs to insurers had to be discontinued, because Congress never directly appropriated the money.Because of threats to cut off that money in the past year, many insurers had raised their prices more sharply for 2018 plans than they otherwise would have.A coalition of 18 states and the District of Columbia is suing the administration to compel restoration of the payments, which would be worth an estimated $10 billion to insurers next year.A federal judge in California on Wednesday rejected an emergency request to restore the payments temporarily while that case proceeds.
US publishes thousands of previously secret documents about JFK assassination:::::There are approximately 5 million pages of documents about Kennedy's 1963 assassination and the vast majority has been publicly available since the late 1990s.But President Donald Trump blocked the release of certain files on Thursday, placing them under a six-month review."I have no choice," he said in a memo, according to White House officials."Additional records will be released subject to redactions recommended by the executive offices and agencies," the National Archives said in a statement on Thursday, adding that it would process those records as soon as possible on a rolling basis.No major insights are expected from the latest trove.The Associated Press contributed to this report
Trump holding back some JFK files, releasing others:::::President Donald Trump acted Thursday to block the release of hundreds of records on the John F. Kennedy assassination, bending to CIA and FBI appeals to keep those secrets."I have no choice," Trump said in a memo, according to White House officials.He was placing those files under a six-month review while letting 2,800 other records come out Thursday evening, racing a deadline to honor a law mandating their release.Officials say Trump will impress upon federal agencies that JFK files should stay secret after the six-month review "only in the rarest cases."Much of Thursday passed with nothing from the White House or National Archives except silence, leaving unclear how the government would comply with a law requiring the records to come out by the end of the day unless Trump had been persuaded by intelligence agencies to hold some back.White House officials said the FBI and CIA made the most requests within the government to withhold some information.No blockbusters had been expected in the last trove of secret files regarding Kennedy's assassination Nov. 22, 1963, given a statement months ago by the Archives that it assumed the records, then under preparation, would be "tangential" to what's known about the killing.But for historians, it's a chance to answer lingering questions, put some unfounded conspiracy theories to rest, perhaps give life to other theories or none of that, if the material adds little to the record.Researchers were frustrated by the uncertainty that surrounded the release for much of the day."The government has had 25 yearswith a known end-dateto prepare #JFKfiles for release," University of Virginia historian Larry Sabato tweeted in the afternoon."Deadline is here.Chaos."Asked what he meant, Sabato emailed to say: "Contradictory signals were given all day.Trump's tweets led us to believe that disclosure was ready to go.Everybody outside government was ready to move quickly."Trump had been a bit coy about the scheduled release on the eve of it, tweeting: " The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow.So interesting!"Experts say the publication of the last trove of evidence could help allay suspicions of a conspiracy at least for some."As long as the government is withholding documents like these, it's going to fuel suspicion that there is a smoking gun out there about the Kennedy assassination," said Patrick Maney, a presidential historian at Boston College.The collection includes more than 3,100 records comprising hundreds of thousands of pages that have never been seen by the public.About 30,000 documents were released previously with redactions.Experts said intelligence agencies pushed Trump to keep some of the remaining materials secret the CIA didn't comment on that.Whatever details are released, they're not expected to give a definitive answer to a question that still lingers for some: Whether anyone other than Lee Harvey Oswald was involved in the assassination.The Warren Commission in 1964 reported that Oswald had been the lone gunman, and another congressional probe in 1979 found no evidence to support the theory that the CIA had been involved.But other interpretations, some more creative than others, have persisted.The 1992 law mandating release of the JFK documents states that all the files "shall be publicly disclosed in full" within 25 years that means by Thursday unless the president certifies that "continued postponement is made necessary by an identifiable harm to the military defense; intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations."That doesn't allow the president, for example, to hold some records back because they might be embarrassing to agencies or people."In any release of this size, there always are embarrassing details," said Douglas Brinkley, a professor at Rice University.The law does not specify penalties for noncompliance, saying only that House and Senate committees are responsible for oversight of the collection.
Trump declares the opioid epidemic a public health emergency:::::President Donald Trump on Thursday declared the nation's opioid epidemic a public health emergency, the first time since 2010 that the federal government has designated such an emergency nationwide.But the president stopped short of officially labeling the crisis -- which claimed the lives of 64,000 Americans in 2016 -- a state of national emergency."I'm officially declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency under federal law," Trump said at a White House event.Ending the epidemic "will require the resolve of our entire country," he said.Calling the crisis a "national shame and a human tragedy," Trump vowed to crack down on heroin imports from Mexico and fentanyl imports from China.He also pledged to use evidence-based addiction treatment, and to reduce drug use among young people through a national advertising campaign.The president also discussed his personal experience with addiction: Trump's brother, Fred Trump, died of complications from alcoholism."Fred was a great guy, and he would tell me, 'don't drink, don't drink.'He would constantly tell me this, over and over."Trump credits his brother's example with convincing him to never drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes.Trump singled out China, which exports an incredibly strong opioid, fentanyl, which officials believe is responsible for thousands of deaths.Trump also said he would raise the issue of fentanyl exports with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to the country early next week.He also pledged to go after companies that produce and distribute certain opioids wholesale to "pill mill" medical practices."We will be bringing some very major lawsuits against people and against companies that have been hurting our communities," he said.In a move reminiscent of the war on drugs in the 1980s, Trump also said clever advertising could play a major role in discouraging young people from using drugs."Our most important thing is going to be really, really great advertising, so people don't start and don't have to go through these problems," he said.The designation of a public health emergency would expand the ways that individuals can get treatment for opioid addiction, which could particularly benefit people in rural areas.The emergency declaration would also free up public health emergency funds at the Department of Health and Human Services, and grant individual states more flexibility in how they use federal dollars, and allow them to direct more funds toward addiction treatment and prevention.Labor Department grants known as National Dislocated Worker Grants would also be available to workers who cite opiate addiction as the reason they're applying for the grants.Those grants are typically only available to victims of natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires.
Paul Ryan is confident he can sweeten tax reform to win over GOP holdouts:::::"The Ways and Means Committee will be putting out a specific plan very shortly, and they're going to work with all of our members to look at and consider and address these concerns," Ryan told reporters Thursday."I believe that the Ways and Means Committee will be working with these members in particular to find a solution."Nearly all Republicans will get behind a bill to chop tax rates in an effort to spur economic growth.However, lawmakers have expressed concerns about other specific provisions in a tax framework released last month, most of which are intended to raise money.GOP leaders have called for scrapping state and local tax deductions, a popular provision that largely benefits high-tax blue states.Some lawmakers in the Northeast opposed the budget resolution, but they never truly imperiled its passage.Later Thursday, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, told reporters that a meeting with the Republicans in favor of state and local deductions did not yield a compromise."They made it clear.They need this problem solved before they vote 'yes' on tax reform," he said.Before the vote, the House Liberty Caucus, led by Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., also announced it would oppose what it called "wasteful" spending in the budget measure.The group raised concerns about deficits generated by it.The budget also allows for tax cuts to add up to $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over a decade.Ryan on Thursday described the budget as "really important" to passing tax reform.It unlocks budget reconciliation, which allows the Senate to pass a plan with only a simple majority, or at least 50 of 52 GOP votes with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a tie.Ryan did not answer questions about whether the House would make other controversial tweaks to the tax code, like changing the popular 401(k) contribution benefit.He deferred specific policy questions to the House Ways and Means Committee, the chamber's chief tax-writing panel.Brady said the House will introduce a bill on Wednesday and start committee deliberations on Nov. 6.CNBC's Christina Wilkie contributed to this report.
Billionaire Insys founder charged in US opioid bribe case:::::The billionaire founder of Insys Therapeutics was arrested on Thursday on charges that he participated in a scheme with other executives to bribe doctors to prescribe a fentanyl-based cancer pain drug and to defraud insurers.John Kapoor, 74, who stepped down as chief executive of Insys in January, was charged with having engaged in conspiracies to commit racketeering, mail fraud and wire fraud in an indictment filed in federal court in Boston.He was arrested in Arizona, where Insys is based, and added as a defendant in a previously filed case against six former Insys executives and managers, including former Chief Executive Michael Babich, prosecutors said.Brian Kelly, Kapoor's lawyer, said in an email: "My client is innocent and he intends to fight these charges vigorously."Insys, which has been in settlement talks with the U.S. Justice Department in connection with the probe, declined to comment.Its stock price fell 4.56 percent to $7.08 in midday trading on Thursday.The charges marked a major escalation of the ongoing investigations of Insys related to Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray that contains fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic opioid.Those probes have come amid a national opioid abuse epidemic.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were involved in over 33,000 deaths in 2015.The death rate has continued to rise, according to estimates.Kapoor, who founded Insys in 2002 and remains a board member, stepped down in January as the company's chairman and chief executive, a role he took on in November 2015.He is currently the chairman of drugmaker Akorn and president of investment firm EJ Financial Enterprises.According to the indictment, following the launch of Subsys in 2012, Kapoor and Babich grew dissatisfied with the drug's success in its initial three months on the market.It says they, with others, devised a scheme to pay bribes in the form of speaker fees and food and entertainment to medical practitioners to prescribe Subsys and to increase the dosage and volume of existing prescriptions.They also sought to mislead and defraud insurers who were reluctant to approve payment for Subsys when it was prescribed to patients who did not have cancer, the indictment said.
New sanctions on North Korea announced by the Treasury Department:::::New sanctions on North Korea announced by the Treasury Department 12:12 PM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 | 00:25 "Today's sanctions target the North Korean military and regime officials engaged in flagrant abuses of human rights.We also are targeting North Korean financial facilitators who attempt to keep the regime afloat with foreign currency earned through forced labor operations."The newly sanctioned parties include North Korean diplomats, military security officers and officials with state-owned construction companies.According to the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the DPRK's Military Security Command and two of its top officials, Jo Kyong-Chol and Sin Yong Il, will be put under sanction, as will Ri Thae Chol, the country's first vice minister of the Ministry of People's Security.The diplomats being sanctioned are Ku Sung Sop the consul general in Shenyang, China and Kim Min Chol, who works at the North Korean Embassy in Vietnam.The other targeted parties are connected to a system of North Korean construction companies that export labor overseas, often to work in slave-like conditions, the U.S. said.The country's External Construction Bureau and its director, Kim Kang Jin, will be sanctioned, as will the Ch'olhyo'n Overseas Construction Company.In September, the Treasury Department announced sanctions in against eight North Korean banks and 26 people linked to the country's financial networks.The actions come as the U.S. presses the communist dictatorship to end its nuclear weapons testing and missile launchings.
House narrowly passes budget, clearing the way for tax reform:::::Among the no votes from New York were Republican Reps. Peter King, Lee Zeldin, John Faso, Elise Stefanik and John Katko; noes from New Jersey included Reps. Frank LoBiondo, Tom MacArthur and Leonard Lance.These members hoped that by stalling the tax-reform process, they might gain enough leverage to protect a popular deduction for state and local taxes, known as the SALT write-off.The current GOP tax framework calls for eliminating the SALT deduction to help pay for the tax cuts.But this would likely have a disproportionate impact on middle-income taxpayers in places like New York, New Jersey and California, and as of late Wednesday, it was still unclear how many of the 30 Republicans who represent high-tax states would vote against the budget."Why should I vote for something that would end up decimating my district?"King told Reuters on Wednesday.Also among the no votes were some of the most fiscally conservative members of the House Republican caucus, who were concerned that the budget contained too much spending.Shortly before the vote, the House Liberty Caucus released a statement opposing the budget.With the budget vote out of the way, Republicans must now move on to the brass tacks phase of reforming the tax code.Shortly after the vote on Thursday, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Calif., announced that a tax reform bill would be formally introduced on Wednesday, with a markup in his committee slated to begin Nov. 6."Today is a historic day, and we are ready to deliver tax relief that improves the lives of middle income Americans and struggling families who have been left behind in our slow-growing economy," Brady said in a statement.
The Fed chair contest is Trump's version of 'The Bachelor':::::Like pretty much every big personnel call in this White House, President Donald Trump has turned his selection of a Federal Reserve chair into a version of "The Bachelor" with everyone feverishly guessing who will get the role of leading the world's most important central bank.Trump has gone so far as to solicit advice from Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs in a televised interview."Tell me who your preference is," Trump asked Dobbs."I'd love to hear it.You could even cut it out if you want.You don't have to I would love to hear you.I only want that from people I respect."Dobbs went on to suggest keeping Janet Yellen, something that I'm told is at least somewhat attractive to Trump given that markets love the current chair and would likely react favorably to her status quo renomination.But a source who talks to the president regularly about the Fed and other economic matters tells me that while Trump does like Yellen, he is not going to renominate her because he wants to put his own mark on the central bank something the president also suggested to Dobbs.Just after this conversation, another senior source close to the Fed nomination process cautioned me not to rule Yellen or anyone else out."He changes his mind about it every day," this person said.But a consensus among people close to the process has emerged that the race is likely down to either current Fed Governor Jerome "Jay" Powell or Stanford economist John Taylor.Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh sparked increasing speculation after a meeting last week with Vice President Mike Pence.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is pushing against Warsh and in favor of Powell, whom he got to know in recent months working on financial reform issues.National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn has been mostly out of the running for weeks now both because of his clash with Trump over the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and because the president wants the former Goldman Sachs president to keep working on the high-stakes tax cut push.An announcement on the Fed chair pick could come any day, but sources close to the matter say it will most likely happen next week before the president departs for a 12-day trip to Asia.Even that is not assured, however.If Trump can't make up his mind, the announcement could wait until he gets back.The Senate needs to have hearings before the Banking Committee and a full vote prior to Yellen's term expiring on Feb. 3.Ideally, the process of sending up the next nominee would start soon.The Senate can move quickly when it wants to it's basically up to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell so next week is really not a hard deadline for the president.The arguments favoring a Powell chairmanship include that it would allow Trump to install his own pick while also likely continuing the very modest approach to rate normalization and balance sheet drawdown initiated by the Yellen Fed.Taylor, while much more beloved by conservatives on the Hill and places like The Wall Street Journal editorial board, would present at least something more of a hawkish risk that might spark jitters on Wall Street.Some conservatives on Capitol Hill have led a behind-the-scenes campaign against Powell and in favor of Taylor or Warsh.But it's not clear that those efforts will produce results, especially given that Trump generally does whatever he wants with limited regard for what Republicans in Congress say.And Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., is among the few on record arguing against Powell.Taylor won a straw poll when Trump met with Senate Republicans earlier this week and quizzed them on their Fed preference, but there is very little chance many would vote "no" if Trump actually sends up a Powell nomination.And Powell is a former banker rather than a wonky economist like Taylor, a style Trump tends to prefer in his nominees.So the betting line remains on Powell for chair and perhaps Taylor for vice chair, if he is willing.Heavy caveats continue to apply.Trump could change his mind at the last minute and turn the process on its head, possibly even electing to simply stick with Yellen, though that remains unlikely.The rose is still up for grabs.Ben White is Politico's chief economic correspondent and a CNBC contributor.He also authors the daily tip sheet Politico Morning Money [politico.com/morningmoney].Follow him on Twitter @morningmoneyben.
Trump apparently is having a hard time making up his mind for Fed chair:::::'Nobody has been ruled out' for Fed chair -Senior administration official 3:42 PM ET Wed, 25 Oct 2017 | 02:58 The race to see who will lead the Federal Reserve in 2018 and beyond is becoming a process of elimination, with two and perhaps three candidates remaining.President Donald Trump apparently has solidified his thinking and is now choosing between Fed Governor Jerome "Jay" Powell and Stanford economist John Taylor.However, several twists have been interjected into the equation."Trump changes his mind about it everyday," a source told Politico, according to a report posted Thursday.The site speculated that current Chair Janet Yellen remains in the mix because Trump is worried that removing her might disrupt the hardy stock market rally that has taken place since his election.The Dow industrials have surged more than 30 percent from the low just a couple days before the Nov. 8 election.However, one source reportedly close to Trump did tell Politico that Yellen was out of the race completely.The report adds further detail on how the process has unfolded.Former Governor Kevin Warsh, once considered a favorite for the job, has fallen out of favor, perhaps because of a long-simmering feud he has had with recently appointed Governor Randal Quarles, according to a Bloomberg report that Politico cited.Meanwhile, Keith Hennessey, a former advisor to President George W. Bush, is backing Warsh.Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic advisor, also has been ruled out in a number of reports, though an administration official told CNBC otherwise.And Trump added to the strangeness of the process when he asked Lou Dobbs, a host on Fox Business, whom he thought the president should appoint.That comes just a few days after Trump asked members of the GOP leadership for a show of hands on what they thought he should do.Dobbs said he thought Yellen was worth considering for reappointment."We're obviously doing very well together if you look at the markets," Trump said on the show.CNBC has reached out to those involved for comment.Read the full Politico report here.
Corker: Some items in tax bill are just buying off special interests:::::Senator Bob Corker says some tax efforts are ridiculous 10:58 AM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 | 02:02 Some of the items in the GOP tax reform discussion are just "buying off" special interests and serve no other purpose, Republican Sen. Bob Corker told CNBC on Thursday."Some of the things we're doing, I'm sorry, are ridiculous," Corker told "Squawk Box," though he did not mention any specifics."I'm sorry, but we live in a political world," said Corker, a member on the Senate Budget and Banking committees.Those things are "not going to drive 1 ounce of economic growth.But it's what you have to do to pass a tax bill."Corker described some efforts to pass tax reform as "unfortunate.""It's buying off of people to pass tax reform," Corker said."We could take a lot of this off in the trash can and make it easier and actually do something that grows our economy and increases our wages," he said.President Donald Trump and the GOP have been pushing for a major overhaul to the U.S. tax code.They believe tax relief would give the current economy a boost.House Republicans on Thursday narrowly approved a budget deal, a crucial step toward passing tax cuts later this year.Corker, who has been highly critical of Trump, told CNBC that despite his war of words with the president he's "all in" on tax reform.Corker is not seeking reelection.The Tennessee Republican said he wants to "go out with afterburners trying to make things happen."
Sen. Bob Corker: Criticism of Trump will 'absolutely not' affect my tax-reform vote:::::Sen. Bob Corker: Some of the 'ridiculous' things in tax reform are just 'buying off' lawmakers to pass it 11:18 AM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 | 00:50 Sen. Bob Corker told CNBC on Thursday his sharp criticism of President Donald Trump's fitness for office will "absolutely not" influence his vote on tax reform.The Tennessee Republican described himself as "all in" on the GOP effort to overhaul the tax system, regardless of his feelings on the president's competence."This tax reform is our agenda, it's the Republican Senate agenda," Corker said in a "Squawk Box" interview."It would be like somebody in your listening audience representing their company, sitting across the table from someone they may have a low regard for, but are they going do something that's going to damage their company because of that?Absolutely not."The spat between Corker and Trump erupted anew on Tuesday, when Trump unleashed a blistering string of tweets following the senator's assertion that the White House should "step aside" and let Congress handle writing the tax bill.Later responding to Trump, Corker said the claims in the president's tweets were untrue.He said Trump "debases our country" and will not "rise to the occasion as president."
Trump to declare public health emergency for opioids, a partial measure to fight drug epidemic:::::WASHINGTON President Trump will order his health secretary to declare the opioid crisis a public health emergency Thursday but will stop short of declaring a more sweeping state of national emergency, aides said.In an address from the White House, Trump will also try to rally the nation to a growing epidemic that claimed 64,000 American lives last year, and will advocate for a sustained national effort to end to the addiction crisis."Drug demand and opioid misuse is the crisis next door," said Kellyanne Conway, a senior counselor to the president, previewing the tone of Trump's speech Wednesday."This is no longer someone else's co-worker, someone else's community, someone else's kid.Drug use knows no geographic boundaries or demographic differences."More from USA Today: FDA chief supports opioid prescription limits, regrets agency's prior inaction Trump says he'll declare opioid crisis a national emergency.Here's what that could mean As he chairs Trump's opioid commission, Christie champions his home-state drug companies To respond to that crisis, Trump will sign a presidential memorandum ordering Acting Secretary of Health and Human Services Eric Hargan to waive regulations and give states more flexibility in how they use federal funds, said four senior officials responsible for crafting the administration's new opioid policy.The officials previewed the action to USA TODAY on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak ahead of the president's announcement.Trump first promised to declare a national emergency to combat the crisis on Aug. 10, and repeated that pledge last week.Speaking to reporters on the south lawn of the White House Wednesday, Trump touted a "big meeting" on opioids, and said a national emergency "gives us power to do things that you can't do right now."But there's a legal distinction between a public health emergency, which the secretary of Health can declare under the Public Health Services Act, and a presidential emergency under the National Emergencies Act.The latter is what the president's own opioid commission recommended in July.Declaring a state of national emergency would give the president even more power to waive privacy laws and Medicare regulations to increase the number of beds available to treat substance abuse.Those facilities are now limited to 16 beds.James Hodge, a law professor at Arizona State University, said a "dual declaration" using both laws would make a larger difference, but that any emergency would be a welcome response to the crisis.Trump's decision to go with a more measured response, a public health emergency, demonstrates the complexity of an opioid crisis that continues to grow through an ever-evolving cycle of addiction, from prescription pain pills to illegal heroin to the lethal fentanyl.But the legal powers Trump is invoking were designed for a short-term emergencies like disasters and infectious diseases.
New screenings begins for passengers on US-bound flights:::::New security screenings for all passengers on U.S.-bound flights began on Thursday, with airlines worldwide questioning flyers about their trip and their luggage in the latest Trump administration decision affecting global travel.However, confusion still remains about the new regulations, which come at the end of a 120-day period following the United States lifting a ban on laptops in airplane cabins affecting 10 Mideast cities.The new regulations cover all the 2,100 flights from around the world entering the U.S. on any given day.Some airlines said they had received permission to delay implementing the new rules until January.At Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel, long-haul carrier Emirates began questioning passengers about their luggage, liquids they were carrying and where they were coming from.Passengers also had to have their carry-on bags searched, along with their electronics.Emirates declined to discuss the new procedures in detail on Thursday.On Wednesday, it said it would conduct "passenger pre-screening interviews" for those traveling on U.S.-bound flights in concert with other checks on electronics.Elsewhere, things did not appear to be going so smoothly.In China, an official in the Xiamen Airlines press office, who would only give his surname as Qiu, said that the airlines received a "demand" about the new U.S. regulations and planned "to take some security measures, including security safety interviews from today on.""We're not going to interview all passengers, but focus on those with a certain degree of risk when checking the passengers' documents on the ground," he said, without elaborating.An official with the Eastern Airlines publicity department said that she saw media reports about security safety interviews but didn't have immediate details on what her company was doing.An official at the Beijing Airport press center would only say: "We always strictly follow relevant regulations of the Civil Aviation Administration when conducting security checks."Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity under regulations.At Air China, the country's flag carrier, an official who only gave his surname, Zhang, said it would comply."We will meet the demands from the U.S. side, but as for the detailed measures (we will take), it is inconvenient for us to release," he said.South Korea's Transport Ministry said that the United States agreed to delay implementing the new screening for the country's two biggest carriers, Korean Air Lines Co. and Asiana Airlines Inc., until next year on condition they deploy staff at boarding gates to monitor travelers.Royal Jordanian, based in Amman, also has said it would introduce the new procedures in mid-January.Other airlines with U.S.-bound flights at Seoul's Incheon International Airport brought in as many as seven extra staff Thursday to question passengers under the new rules but there were no major delays, airport spokesman Lee Jung-hoon said.Singapore Airlines passengers may be required to "undergo enhanced security measures" including inspection of personal electronic devices "as well as security questioning during check-in and boarding," the carrier said on its website.Other carriers who announced the new regulations on Wednesday included Air France, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., the airlines of Germany's Lufthansa Group and EgyptAir.In Hong Kong, passengers described some of the questions they were asked."They asked me if I packed my own bag, where I packed it from, where I came from, they looked at my itinerary, verify where I was, who I was, from where I came from," said Fran Young, who was travelling to Los Angeles.Some showed displeasure."It's a little inconvenient, I kind of just want to get my printed ticket and then just go inside," passenger Gavin Lai said."I don't want to wait on people to interview me like that.So it's a little annoying."U.S. carriers also will be affected by the new rules.Delta Air Lines said it was telling passengers traveling to the U.S. to arrive at the airport at least three hours before their flight and allow extra time to get through security.United declined to comment, while American did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In March, U.S. officials introduced the laptop ban in the cabins of some Mideast airlines over concerns Islamic State fighters and other extremists could hide bombs inside of them.The ban was lifted after those airlines began using devices like CT scanners to examine electronics before passengers boarded planes heading to the U.S.Some also increasingly swab passengers' hands to check for explosive residue.The laptop ban as well as travel bans affecting predominantly Muslim countries have hurt Mideast airlines.Emirates, the region's biggest, said it slashed 20 percent of its flights to the U.S. in the wake of the restrictions.
Final trove of documents to offer new details on JFK assassination:::::More than half a century after U.S. President John F. Kennedy was struck down by an assassin's bullet in Dallas, Texas, the United States is due on Thursday to release the final files on the investigation into the killing that rattled a nation.Academics who have studied Kennedy's slaying on Nov. 22, 1963, said they expected the final batch of files to offer no major new details on why Lee Harvey Oswald gunned down the first and only Irish-American Roman Catholic to hold the office.They also feared that the final batch of more than 5 million total pages on the Kennedy assassination held in the National Archives will do little to quell long-held conspiracy theories that the 46-year-old president's killing was organized by the Mafia, by Cuba, or a cabal of rogue agents.Thousands of books, articles, TV shows and films have explored the idea that Kennedy's assassination was the result of an elaborate conspiracy.None have produced conclusive proof that Oswald, who was shot dead a day after killing Kennedy, worked with anyone else, though they retain a powerful cultural currency."My students are really skeptical that Oswald was the lone assassin," said Patrick Maney, a professor of history at Boston College."It's hard to get our minds around this, that someone like a loner, a loser, could on his own have murdered Kennedy and changed the course of world history.But that's where the evidence is."In 1992, Congress ordered that all records relating to the investigation into Kennedy's death should be open to the public, and set a final deadline of Oct. 26, 2017, for the entire set to be made public.President Donald Trump on Saturday confirmed that he would allow the documents to be made public.The documents to be released on Thursday will likely focus on efforts by the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine what contact Oswald had with spies from Cuba and the former Soviet Union on a trip to Mexico City in September 1963, experts said."There was a real concern that Oswald was maybe in league with the Soviet Union," Maney said.Kennedy's assassination was the first in a string of politically motivated killings, including those of his brother Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., that stunned the United States during the turbulent 1960s.He remains one of the most admired U.S. presidents.
Republican tax fight complicates plan to pass budget in House:::::A budget plan crucial to President Donald Trump's hopes for large-scale tax cuts looked set for a close vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday after some Republicans vowed opposition in an effort to protect a popular tax break.The rebellious faction is resisting a proposal to eliminate a federal deduction for state and local income taxes, which would hit middle-class voters in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California.The idea is one of several that have been floated as Republicans craft a tax-cut plan.The budget blueprint, which has already been approved by the Senate, is central to their efforts to push tax legislation through Congress in the face of staunch opposition from Democrats.The proposal "is obviously an issue of concern to a group of members, and the shared goal is to work together to address the issue and move forward," an aide to House Majority Whip Steve Scalise said on Wednesday.With the clock ticking toward a vote, the impasse had yet to be settled.Republican lawmakers had planned to meet in House Speaker Paul Ryan's office at 9 p.m. to try to hammer out a resolution, but the meeting was postponed until after the budget vote, which was set for 10:30 a.m. (1430 GMT).Republican Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey told reporters it was possible there were enough votes to block the budget plan."It's got to be close," he said.Scalise predicted victory."We're going to get it done," he told Fox News Channel.Republicans have sketched out a tax package that independent analysts say would cut taxes for businesses and individuals by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, but detailed legislation is not expected to be unveiled until next week.If Congress approves a tax-cut plan, it would hand Trump his first major legislative win since he took office in January."I am urging Republicans who have questions about SALT (the state and local tax deduction) to vote no tomorrow and keep voting no until we get some compromise we can live with," Republican Representative Peter King of New York told Reuters.An aide to Republican Representative Tom Reed of New York said there was discussion of a compromise that would call for a tax credit up to a certain income amount to replace the deduction, and that he would support it.Republican Representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey told Reuters he was not interested in a compromise at this time, and instead wanted the repeal provision taken off the table."I will be voting no on the budget tomorrow," he said.
Trump says Russia is hurting US efforts on North Korea nuclear issue:::::President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Russia was hurting U.S. efforts to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons while China had been helpful.In an interview with Fox Business Network, Trump said it would be easier to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue if the United States had a better relationship with Russia."China is helping us and maybe Russia's going through the other way and hurting what we're getting," Trump said of the North Korea situation.A series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have ratcheted up tensions.
Commerce Sec. Ross explains how GOP could strike a deal on taxes:::::Disagreements over controversial pieces of the Republican tax proposal threaten to trip up the party's efforts to approve a tax overhaul this year.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Wednesday at the NetNet event outlined a possible compromise for lawmakers.The House hopes to pass a budget on Thursday and move one step closer to approving a tax plan.If House Republicans can clear a budget resolution already passed by the Senate, they hope to release a tax bill next week and pass it by Thanksgiving.Already, sticking points in the plan have emerged, threatening the loss of votes for a party that holds only a narrow majority in the Senate.Ross identified multiple "hard" questions facing the GOP as it aims to broadly chop tax rates for individuals and businesses.Republicans have to decide whether to add a fourth, highest income tax rate on the wealthy above the top 35 percent outlined in a framework last month.They also have to consider how to handle several popular deductions like state and local tax deductions.Republican lawmakers in the high-tax blue states that benefit from the provisions already have fought back against a proposal to scrap them.Ross suggested a cap on the income levels at which the deductions could be used.The income cap could also apply to popular provisions like the charitable deduction, he said.Doing so "saves some of the money but doesn't do away with the concept," Ross said.While the White House has given input on the tax plan, like President Donald Trump did when he urged Congress not to change a retirement savings benefit, the congressional tax-writing committees will ultimately decide the bill's shape.The tax writers sought to get rid of some deductions to offset the deficits created by the tax cuts.A major deficit increase could put off some GOP lawmakers concerned about fiscal discipline.On the timeline for passing a tax plan, Ross echoed Trump and GOP congressional leaders in saying he wants a bill approved this year.He added: "I think what's more important is to get it done and get it done properly and to endorse the directional guidance the president has given."However, Ross said that taking longer to pass a tax proposal could create "indecision" or "paralysis" when businesses or individuals plan financial moves at the end of the year.While Ross is a top economic advisor to Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and chief economic advisor Gary Cohn have led the White House effort on taxes.Ross added that he believes the U.S. will ultimately reach a deal with Canada and Mexico on revising the North American Free Trade Agreement.Negotiations on reworking the deal will go into next year.
Trump Unworried About What Former Aides Will Tell Mueller, Lawyer Says:::::He likes and respects Mr. Manafort and appreciates the work he did for him during the three months he was with the campaign.He likes General Flynn personally, but understands that they have their own path with the special counsel, Mr. Cobb said."I think he would be sad for them, as a friend and a former colleague, if the process results in punishment or indictments.But to the extent that that happens, thats beyond his control.Mr. Mueller is investigating whether Mr. Manafort violated federal tax laws or lobbied on behalf of foreign officials without registering.His team is also investigating Mr. Manafort for possible money laundering, a line of inquiry he took over this spring from federal prosecutors in Manhattan, according to lawyers and federal officials.Many of the activities Mr. Mueller is scrutinizing date back years, well before Mr. Manafort joined the Trump campaign.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Manafort has said from the beginning neither he nor anyone else in the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government to undermine the 2016 election, said Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Mr. Manafort.Finally, everyone seems to be coming to that same conclusion.The special counsel is also examining Mr. Flynns financial ties to Russia and whether he concealed lobbying he did last year for Turkey.The White House has given Mr. Mullers team documents related to Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn, as well as the firing of the F.B.I.director, James B.

Democrats Attack Tax Bill as a Middle-Class Con Job:::::There are areas where we can come together, said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, but theres no way we can come together on raising taxes on the middle class.Thats the Achilles heel of their bill.Republicans are putting the middle class at the forefront of the discussion of their plan to pass the most sweeping rewrite of the tax code in a generation.Their primary claim is that cutting taxes on businesses, including reducing the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, will generate large wage gains for American workers.The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, told reporters on Thursday that the entire purpose of this tax bill is to cut middle-class taxes.But he warned earlier in the week that, to meet Democrats demands to avoid cutting taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, we would basically have to destroy the growth elements of this tax reform plan.Republicans argue that lightening the tax burden on businesses will generate economic growth to help offset the cost of the plan.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, suggested in an op-ed on NBC.com this month that antipathy toward Mr. Trump was keeping Democrats from joining the tax effort.Here in the Senate, the need for tax reform is loudly supported by Democrats or at least it was, until the last election, he wrote.Crucial details of the House and Senate versions of the plan are still unknown, in part because Republicans are struggling with how to pay for the tax cuts they are envisioning.Lawmakers have cleared the way for a $1.5 trillion tax cut but are considering a plan that would cost much more than that, which will require them to find a way to offset the cuts by ending tax breaks and employing accounting maneuvers to stay within that defined amount.Many of the details still in flux are important because they would affect middle-class taxpayers directly, including the boundaries of income-tax brackets, the size of an expanded child tax credit and the fate of some deductions that Republicans had targeted for elimination, such as one for state and local taxes paid.A framework for the plan, released by Republican leaders in September, calls for cutting corporate rates; nearly doubling the standard deduction for individuals and couples; reducing the number of individual income tax brackets to three or four, from seven; overhauling the way in which the United States taxes multinational corporations; and taxing so-called pass-through entities, which are businesses whose owners pay taxes on profits through the individual tax code, at a rate of 25 percent.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Depending on how the details are filled in, such a tax bill could reduce income taxes on nearly all middle-class families or it could raise them for millions of middle-class families, by eliminating deductions and other tax breaks and not reducing rates enough to make up for that.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Publicly, Republicans have long said Democrats should and will vote for their tax bill.Mr. Trump has sought to pressure, in particular, a handful of Democratic senators from states he won, including Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana.Mr. Trump invited several Democrats to the White House this month, along with every Republican on the Finance Committee, and placed Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, another Democrat from a state he won, next to him at the table.Before the meeting, Mr. Trump joked that he expected to get unanimous support from Democrats on the bill.The Democrats left pleased with the presidents talk.He said all the right things there, said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who delivered copies to Mr. Trump of two tax bills focused on the middle class that he is sponsoring.He said, over and over, this is a middle-class tax break; this is not for rich guys like me.In the House and Senate, though, Democrats say they have had little input in drafting the tax legislation.Republican lawmakers have been meeting in recent weeks, in both chambers, to hash out the final language for the legislation.Democrats say they have not been invited.Its hard to say that were participating in a tax negotiation, said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, who is chairman of the moderate New Democrat Coalition.Were not throwing up our arms.Its the start of a process.Mr. Himes and Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, including Suzan DelBene of Washington and Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the committees top Democrat, said they have discussed the bill with the committee chairman, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas.But, they said, Republicans have not agreed to some basic Democratic requests for the bill, including that it not add to the federal deficit.Past overhauls of the tax code have been marked by bipartisanship, most recently in 1986, when Democrats such as Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey joined Republicans such as Senator Robert Packwood of Oregon in delivering a bill to President Ronald Reagan.In recent years, Mr. Wyden has written two sweeping tax overhaul bills with Republican Senate colleagues, first with Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and then with Dan Coats of Indiana, who is now the director of national intelligence.Some pieces of those plans are echoed in the Republican framework this year, including the consolidation of income tax brackets on the personal side, and the expansion of the standard deduction.(Mr. Wydens plans proposed to nearly triple it.)But Mr. Wyden is sharply critical of the bill Republicans are drafting now, which he said includes gifts to big businesses and the wealthy, funny math for budget scoring that will assess the cost of the plan, increased deficits and a bunch of false promises to the middle class.He said he hoped that the bill would collapse and that Mr. Trump would turn to a bipartisan effort centered on the middle class instead.
The Little-Known Pragmatist Who Is Shaping the Trump Tax Cuts:::::The rapid rise of Mr. Muzinich, a lanky father of two from Manhattan, is emblematic of the new power dynamics in Mr. Trumps Washington, where business experience and New York roots are often pathways to top posts.He fits the mold of Mr. Trumps top economic advisers, Mr. Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, both of whom made a career on Wall Street.While not a Goldman Sachs alumnus, as they are, he brings an extensive background from the world of finance, having been a banker at Morgan Stanley and the president of Muzinich & Co., an international investment firm founded by his father.Yet for all the intricacies of Wall Street finance, Mr. Muzinich has had to scale a steep learning curve in understanding the peculiarities of the tax code and the legislative land mines that have roiled previous attempts to rewrite tax law.Some lobbyists have expressed frustration that Mr. Muzinich and his Treasury team have been overly secretive about the tax plan and that, despite his business background, he does not always appear enthusiastic to be haggling over tax code deductions with representatives of American industries.A congressional tax staff member who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings said that it had sometimes been evident that Mr. Muzinich was learning on the job in a world of tax and accounting technicians, but added that he had a strong sense of business economics, asked smart questions and was comfortable with data.His Wall Street brashness sometimes shines through when he gets into deal-making mode.Like other political newcomers in the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich has occasionally shown frustration with the grinding pace of legislating.On Capitol Hill, Mr. Muzinich is often paired with Mr. Cohns top deputy, Shahira Knight, to convey the administrations views in big tax meetings.He speaks almost daily with Mr. Mnuchin and, according to congressional aides, it is apparent that he has the authority to speak on behalf of the secretary.Justins leadership and expertise has been essential in advancing tax reform, which has been our administrations top domestic priority, Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement.Mr. Muzinich, who holds an M.B.A. from Harvard and a law degree from Yale, was relatively unknown in tax policy circles before he was plucked from Wall Street to join the Treasury Department.His most notable prior experience in the world of policy came while working on the campaign of one of Mr. Trumps arch rivals: Jeb Bush.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Bush first learned of Mr. Muzinich because of his work as an informal adviser to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, another nemesis of Mr. Trump.While Mr. Trumps personality-driven campaign was lean on policy, Mr. Muzinich was busy overseeing a team that cranked out detailed proposals for Mr. Bush on taxes, education and health care.Those attracted little public attention for Mr. Bushs failed White House bid, but the experience gave Mr. Muzinich a taste of doing thankless work in a political caldron and managing big personalities under pressure.One of the earliest iterations of the tax framework unveiled by Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans last month was the one that Mr. Muzinich drafted for Mr. Bush in 2015.Like the current plan, that one would have collapsed the personal income tax brackets from seven to three and lowered the rates.It would have doubled the standard deduction, reduced the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and switched the United States to a territorial tax system, as the current plan would also do.What impressed me beyond his business experience, which is pretty unique, is that hes just a policy wonk, Mr. Bush said in an interview.Justin has a desire to serve and hes getting to do it at a high level, and Im really proud of him for doing it.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Policy has long been a passion for Mr. Muzinich, who regularly sought out opportunities while on Wall Street to publish essays on subjects ranging from foreign aid to the mandate of the Federal Reserve.Some of his earliest writing on tax policy could be considered heretical in an administration with a guiding principle of America First.In a 2007 Op-Ed article in The New York Times, Mr. Muzinich and a co-author, Eric Werker, called on Congress to offer tax credits to companies that build factories in developing countries and to offset the lost revenue with reductions in foreign aid.Gregory Mankiw, the Harvard economist, called the idea clever at the time but suggested that such a concept would be panned as the outsource American jobs to third-world sweatshops tax credit.Mr. Muzinich has also written extensively on issues that extend far beyond taxes.In 2010, he wrote a long essay for the Hoover Institution on modernizing nuclear nonproliferation strategy in international waters.He grew up and studied in Democratic havens like New York City and Harvard, but Mr. Muzinichs conservative leanings were obvious at an early age.Former colleagues describe his views on tax policy as center-right, with a focus on spurring economic growth by broadening the base of taxpayers and lowering tax rates.Like many officials who have joined the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich is straddling two worlds.His wife, a doctor, and young children still live in New York, and he spends his weeks living out of hotels in Washington and commuting home to the Upper East Side on the weekends.A squash enthusiast, Mr. Muzinich has little time for the courts amid the crush of meetings and number crunching, according to friends who keep in regular touch with him.While many members of the Trump administration have become household names defending the president and his policies on television, Mr. Muzinich, who declined to be interviewed, has kept his distance from public political combat and maintained a low profile.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I think that he is pragmatic, said Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School, where Mr. Muzinich taught before joining the Treasury Department.Hes looking for good policy solutions, not policy positions.Critics have accused the Treasury Department of taking a different approach.Some economists have scoffed at Mr. Mnuchins promises that tax cuts would more than pay for themselves because of the robust economic growth he says they will create.The department came under fire for removing from its web site an economic study that contradicted the secretarys analysis of the benefits of corporate tax cuts.Yet Mr. Muzinichs reputation for pragmatism over ideology is providing comfort for those who know him and disagree with the direction of Mr. Trumps agenda.Im really happy that someone like Justin is working in the administration, because to have thoughtful, level-headed people who are open to evidence, and who are able to bring complicated issues together, I think leaves us better off four years later, said Mr. Werker, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who collaborated with Mr. Muzinich on writing projects at Harvard but is not a Republican.For now, Mr. Muzinich will be consumed with tax rates and distribution tables as he tries to help shepherd tax legislation to Mr. Trumps desk in less than three months.Early analyses of the Republican tax plan have found that it would disproportionately benefit the rich, but the Trump administration is working with tax writers in Congress to make the legislation more progressive.The final shape of the tax plan remains to be seen, but Mr. Taylor, who said that Mr. Muzinich was an above-average student in his Advanced Placement calculus class, is holding out hope that his former pupil will find a way to ensure that the poor are not forgotten.I see him in these pictures marching behind Mnuchin and I say, Oh, Justin, put in a good word for us, Mr. Taylor, a self-described liberal, said.I think people should be caring about other people.
Will Congress Ever Limit the Forever-Expanding 9/11 War?:::::Previous efforts collapsed under disagreements between lawmakers opposed to restricting the executive branchs interpretation of its current wartime powers and those unwilling to vote for a new blank check for a forever war.Among the disputes: whether a replacement should have an expiration date, constrain the use of ground forces, limit the wars geographic scope and permit the government to start attacking other militant groups merely associated with the major enemies it would name.Adding to the political headwinds, two of the Republican lawmakers most interested in drafting a new war authorization law are lame ducks and estranged from the White House: Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has proposed a new war authorization bill with Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia.Both Republican senators, who have announced that they will not seek re-election, have publicly denounced Mr. Trump in recent weeks as dangerously unfit to be the commander in chief.Photo But as the 9/11 war enters its 17th year, questions about the scope and limits of presidential war-making powers are taking on new urgency.Mr. Trump is giving the Pentagon and the C.I.A.broader latitude to pursue counterterrorism drone strikes and commando raids away from traditional battlefields.Two government officials said Mr. Trump had recently signed his new rules for such kill-or-capture counterterrorism operations, without major changes to an interagency agreement first described last month by The New York Times.Under the Obama-era rules, there was individualized high-level vetting of proposed strikes, and targets had to pose a specific threat, as individuals, to Americans.Under the new Trump rules, the administration will instead approve a persistent campaign of direct action for various countries where Islamist militants are operating, without higher-level review of particular strikes, and targets may include any suspected member of a group deemed covered by the 9/11 war authorization.And while the Trump administration decided to keep an Obama-era requirement of near certainty that no civilians would be killed, it reduced the required level of confidence that the intended target was present in a strike zone from near certainty to reasonable certainty, one official said further lowering constraints on attacks.Moreover, NBC News reported this past week that the Trump administration was exploring arming the surveillance drones that now fly over Niger and Mali in search of suspected Islamist militants.The new rules could also permit the Pentagon to carry out offensive ground combat operations in North and West Africa, escalating deployments that key lawmakers seem to have been only dimly aware of before the deaths of the four soldiers this month.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I didnt know there was a thousand troops in Niger, Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, recently told NBCs Meet the Press.Mr. Graham opposes rewriting the 9/11 war authorization law but wanted more information about what the government is doing with it, saying: This is an endless war without boundaries, no limitation on time and geography.You got to tell us more.The questions about Mr. Trumps interpretation of his war powers range beyond conventional counterterrorism operations.For example, Mr. Trump has suggested that he may abandon diplomatic efforts to curb North Koreas testing of nuclear bombs and longer-range missiles and order an attack.But he and his administration have said nothing suggesting that they would seek prior authorization from Congress and the United Nations Security Council.Photo On April 6, Mr. Trump ordered airstrikes against Syrian government forces as punishment for using chemical weapons, without going to Congress or the United Nations for permission.His administration refused to answer questions about why it thought he had lawful authority to carry out such an act of war unilaterally, especially as a matter of international law, leaving it unclear whether it had first considered potential legal constraints.A Freedom of Information Act lawsuit recently revealed that Mr. Trumps legal team did draft and internally circulate a seven-page, unsigned memo analyzing a legal basis for potential military action against Syria.While the memo is undated, Justice Department lawyers said it was probably produced on April 6, the day of the strikes.But the administration is keeping the memos contents secret, so it is not clear what, if anything, it says about international law.The United Nations Charter, a treaty ratified by the United States, forbids attacking another sovereign country without Security Council permission or a self-defense claim.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.It is also not clear whether the memos analysis of domestic law claimed constitutional power for Mr. Trump to lawfully attack Syria merely because he decided that it would be in the national interest as a set of leaked administration talking points maintained or whether it invoked the 9/11 war authorization law as purported congressional sanction.But in June, after the United States military shot down a Syrian government fighter jet prompting Russia to threaten to shoot down any American aircraft that flew west of the Euphrates River the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., asserted that the executive branchs legal authority to attack the Syrian jet came from the 9/11 war authorization law.General Dunfords rationale was that the American presence in Syria stemmed from its fight against Al Qaeda and the Islamic State under that law, and that the jet had been menacing a rebel militia the United States was supporting.Several lawmakers and witnesses at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in June on whether to replace the 9/11 war authorization law criticized his claim as stretching the 2001 law too far.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The existence of the April 6 memo came to light via a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by Protect Democracy, a government watchdog group founded by former Obama administration lawyers.On Thursday, the group filed a new lawsuit for documents that could similarly reveal whether the Trump administration has developed any analysis about a legal basis for a potential pre-emptive attack on North Korea.Protect Democracys executive director, Ian Bassin, said the Senate should ask the top Trump administration witnesses on Monday to explain their understanding of Mr. Trumps powers to unilaterally start or expand wars beyond those linked to the much-stretched 9/11 war authorization law.Senator Corker may be worried about the lack of adult day care in the White House, but the framers actually assigned those duties to Congress, Mr. Bassin said, invoking the chairmans rejoinder to Mr. Trumps insults on Twitter earlier this month.With a commander in chief unilaterally launching missiles at Syria and threatening nuclear war against North Korea, Corker needs to focus on more than an Islamic State A.U.M.F.He needs to put safety bumpers around the president.
In Choice of Fed Chairman, Trump Downgrades Deregulation:::::Choosing Mr. Powell would reflect a judgment by the Trump administration that it can loosen Wall Streets chains even without the enthusiastic participation of the next Fed chairman.Mr. Trump likes Ms. Yellens approach to monetary policy, which has yielded strong economic growth and low unemployment, and aides including Mr. Mnuchin have argued that appointing Mr. Powell is the best way to maintain continuity while satisfying Republican demands that Ms. Yellen be replaced, according to people familiar with the internal discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly about them.Mr. Trump has already chosen Randal K. Quarles to lead the push for deregulation at the Fed.Mr. Quarles was sworn in earlier this month as the Feds first vice chairman for supervision, a position created after the financial crisis to oversee the Feds work on regulatory issues.Administration officials have also told some conservatives that Mr. Powell is more sympathetic to deregulation than may be suggested by his public comments, according to a person who participated in one such meeting, and described it on condition of anonymity.But some independent analysts and congressional Republicans argue that choosing Mr. Powell would be a gamble.Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics, which tracks regulatory issues for financial industry clients, said that she expected Mr. Powell would defer to Mr. Quarles.That said, she continued, Powell will generally favor course corrections, not redirections.Photo Mr. Powells regulatory views are also raising eyebrows among conservatives on Capitol Hill.Mr. Powell joined the Fed in 2012 but, because of a procedural quirk, he had to be confirmed again in 2014.Twenty-three Republicans voted against him, with several citing his record of support for new financial regulations; all but two of those senators are still serving.Senator Scott is looking for fresh leadership at the Federal Reserve, and Mr. Powell would have to answer serious concerns both old and new at any potential nomination hearing he might have before the Senate Banking Committee, said a spokesman for Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican who voted against Mr. Powells confirmation.Advertisement Continue reading the main story If Mr. Trump does not choose Ms. Yellen, she would become the first person in the Feds modern history to complete a term as chairman without being nominated for a second.A major reason is that the White House does not share her views on financial regulation.In a speech in August, she warned against forgetting the lessons of 2008.The events of the crisis demanded action, needed reforms were implemented and these reforms have made the system safer, she said.Mr. Taylors outspoken critiques of the Feds economic stimulus campaign have won him the backing of conservatives including Vice President Mike Pence, according to the people familiar with the internal discussions.But his comments about regulatory issues have been less frequent and less critical of regulation.He has said that banks were allowed to take too many risks before the crisis and, in a 2015 interview, he said he had no problem with requiring the biggest banks to raise more capital after the crisis.Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress argue that excessive financial regulation, much of it created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, is inhibiting economic growth.The Trump administration in June released a plan for reducing regulation, much of which can be carried out by the Fed and other regulators without legislation.The changes would exempt smaller banks from many postcrisis regulations, and loosen restrictions on larger banks.That would let banks borrow more freely, and take more risks with that money.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.At a hearing a few weeks after the plan was released, Mr. Powell offered a tepid review.I see it is a mixed bag, he said.There are some ideas in the report that make sense, maybe not as expressed there, but it would enable us to reduce the cost of regulation without affecting safety and soundness.But, he added, There are some ideas that I would not support.Since joining the Fed in May 2012, Mr. Powell has voted in favor of every action to tighten regulation the Fed has undertaken.But he has sometimes expressed concerns in internal discussions about the effects of those decisions, and about the aggregate weight of so many new regulations.At the June hearing, he said that there were clear opportunities for improvement.The whole idea is to preserve the significant core reforms that were made but to go back and clean up our work, he said.Specifically, Mr. Powell wants to overhaul the Volcker Rule, which is intended to prevent big banks from making certain kinds of risky investments with their own money.Mr. Powell and other Fed officials have long regarded the rule as costly and ineffective, in part because they say it duplicates other measures aimed at limiting risk-taking.Photo He said regulators were working on revisions that would limit its application to smaller banks and loosen the strictures on larger banks.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Powell also expressed support for cost-benefit analysis of proposed rules, an idea backed by the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers.He said the Fed was pushing to improve its analysis of regulatory costs.We have an obligation to make our regulation no more costly than it needs to be, he said.And he has endorsed greater transparency regarding the Feds annual stress tests of large banks, aimed at assessing their ability to weather economic downturns.But on the issue at the center of the debate over regulation, Mr. Powell broke ranks with the administration.Banking regulators have significantly limited the use of borrowed money as a source of funding, requiring banks to raise more capital.The Trump administration has proposed a host of changes to loosen those restrictions.Mr. Powell said he supported the current regulations.I happen to think weve gotten it about right, he said.Importantly, the White House expects Mr. Quarles, and not the next Fed chairman, to take the lead role in sorting out these questions.Mr. Quarless job was created by the Dodd-Frank Act to sharpen the Feds focus on regulation.At his confirmation hearing in July, he echoed Mr. Powells characterization of postcrisis regulation as a rough draft that required editing.Regulatory policies enacted since the financial crisis have improved the safety and soundness of the financial system, Mr. Quarles said.But as with any complex undertaking, after the first wave of reform, and with the benefit of experience and reflection, some refinements will undoubtedly be in order.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Powell and Mr. Quarles are friends.The two men were colleagues at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm based in Washington.Mr. Trump can also stock the Feds board with officials committed to deregulation.There are seven seats on the board, and Mr. Trump can quickly fill as many as six of those seats with his own nominees, assuming Ms. Yellen steps down in February.The presidents of the regional reserve banks, some of whom are proponents of financial regulation, only vote on monetary policy.
Roger Stone Suspended From Twitter After Expletive-Laden Tweets:::::Then his Twitter account was suspended, but there was some confusion.On Saturday, Mr. Stone wrote on Facebook that Twitter had notified him that the suspension would last only a few hours.But on Sunday, the account remained suspended.It was unclear whether that would be permanent.Mr. Stone told The Wrap he would sue Twitter.The battle for free speech has just begun, he said.I have been inundated on Twitter with bloggers threatening to kill me, my wife, my kids and even my dogs, yet Twitter seems unconcerned about that, he told The Wrap.This is just part and parcel of the tech lefts effort to silence conservative voices.Mr. Stone has since promised to speak out on other Twitter accounts, including those associated with his blog and the biographical movie Get Me Roger Stone.He has also started a petition calling for Twitter to reinstate his account.Emails sent to Mr. Stone via his blog, StoneColdTruth, were not answered immediately on Sunday.As a corporation, Twitter has the right to suspend accounts.A spokeswoman said on Sunday that she could not comment on any specific users but pointed to the company policy on abusive behavior.She highlighted the lines that said that users may not incite or engage in the targeted abuse or harassment of others and that an account may be considered abusive if it is inciting others to harass another account.There has been scrutiny over the companys suspension policies given Twitters growing role in public discourse, especially because Mr. Trump uses it to bypass traditional news outlets and reach his supporters and detractors directly.Mr. Trump has tweeted to promote policies and to lob insults at various targets, including mainstream media organizations like The New York Times, politicians on both sides of the aisle, celebrities who criticize him and the mayor of San Juan, P.R.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He has also retweeted images and videos with violent content, including one that showed him wrestling and repeatedly punching a man with a CNN logo imposed over his face, and another clip edited to show the president hitting a golf ball and striking his former campaign rival Hillary Clinton in the back.Some targets of Mr. Trumps criticism have endured additional insults and threats from the presidents supporters, leading some to wonder whether the president has encouraged harassment and should be banned from Twitter himself.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Stone left Mr. Trumps campaign in 2015 amid widespread speculation about the reason for his departure.Mr. Trump said Mr. Stone was fired; Mr. Stone said he left voluntarily, suggesting that the candidates comments about the news anchor Megyn Kelly comments that referred to blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever had prompted his departure.But Mr. Stone remained loyal to the president and maintains that the two still have a close relationship.On Monday, InfoWars published an article in which Mr. Stone said he urged Mr. Trump, in a friendly phone call, to release government documents about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.Mr. Trump ordered the release of more than 2,800 of the documents on Thursday.
Mark Warner: Tech Millionaire Who Became Techs Critic in Congress:::::This week, Mr. Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, will push for new answers.Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter are set to testify at congressional hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday about the election and the power of their platforms.Lawmakers are increasingly taking a critical tone with Silicon Valley, with Mr. Warner among the harshest.He has already pushed a bill requiring the companies to disclose who paid for digital political ads, the biggest legislative effort so far to regulate the companies.Mr. Warners position is a sharp reversal.Before entering politics, he built a fortune that at one time was estimated at around $200 million as a technology and telecommunications investor and executive.His political identity, first as governor of Virginia and then as a senator, has been wrapped in promises to bring 21st century jobs.He has a broad and close network of tech executives and investors.Photo Mr. Warner is emblematic of the shifting politics for technology.Mark didnt come to this point with the social media companies lightly, said Saxby Chambliss, a retired Republican senator from Georgia who regularly meets with Mr. Warner and the Intelligence Committee chairman, Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, a Republican, to discuss the Russia investigation.The reluctance of the technology companies to take seriously the investigation into Russian election meddling pushed Mr. Warner over the edge, Mr. Chambliss said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That is a poor attitude for American companies, Mr. Chambliss added.Mark will make sure this issue is highlighted because it needs to stop.Ahead of the hearings, Twitter and Facebook have scrambled to disarm lawmakers with announcements of voluntary changes to their advertising businesses.Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, for example, spent a couple days in Washington promising more disclosures.Twitter announced it would disclose who buys political ads on its site, and it blocked two Russia-based media organizations from purchasing advertisements.Twitter is taking an appropriate and welcome step, Representative Adam Schiff of California, the leading Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said last week.The companies say the internal investigations and answering lawmakers questions are a top priority.In their announcements on voluntary ad disclosures, Twitter and Facebook said their stricter policies for who can place political ads and promises to make those purchases public are signs of their commitment to correcting their mistakes.We look forward to answering lawmakers questions, said Joel Kaplan, vice president of global public policy for Facebook, in a statement.We take this issue very seriously and think its important Congress gets the full picture of what happened, including what we know about Russian activity on our platform, and is able to share its assessment with the American public.But lawmakers said the companies, who have been interacting privately for months, still have a long way to go.Last week, congressional aides said the online giants were pushing back against lawmakers.The companies argued against the ad disclosure bill and dragged their feet to participate in a hearing on Tuesday.Lobbyists for Facebook explained how their voluntary efforts on political ad disclosures could work better than regulations.Twitter has not addressed its problems with automated accounts, known as bots, that can quickly spread propaganda or fake news.In addition, not all social media companies have announced that they will tighten rules for buying political ads, one of the most pressing issues.And even if they do, lawmakers should still make more disclosure a legal requirement, said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota, who is a co-sponsor of the disclosure bill with Mr. Warner and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If their policies comply with our bill, they should support our bill and maybe can use their policy as a standard when we pass our bill, Ms. Klobuchar said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Much of the harshest criticism so far is coming from Democrats like Mr. Warner and Ms. Klobuchar, which could limit the fallout for the tech companies.The Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Burr, has been more reserved than Mr. Warner, for example.Many Republicans are reluctant to add any regulations to businesses.Some are also afraid of crossing other party members or President Trump, who regularly play down Russian interference in the election.Photo Republicans have slowly begun calling for more scrutiny of the companies.But lawmakers who are more oriented toward free markets have been reluctant to regulate the rapidly evolving industry.Other top regulators, particularly those appointed by Mr. Trump, are also considered unlikely to take strong action against the industry.The top antitrust enforcer at the Justice Department, Makan Delrahim, said in an interview last week that his agency would watch to see whether the size of technology companies hurts competition, but that size alone was not justification for action against them.There are people who think big is just bad, Mr. Delrahim said.He invoked the name of Robert Jackson, the top antitrust enforcer for the agency about 80 years ago, who said he was reluctant to try to break up big companies just for the sake of doing so.That has made it easier for Mr. Warner to assert himself as a leading voice about the power of the tech companies as unexpected as it may be.Mr. Warner accumulated his wealth with an early investment in the cellular service provider Nextel, which was sold to Sprint in 2005 for $35

2 Navy SEALs Under Suspicion in Strangling of Green Beret in Mali:::::No one has been charged in Sergeant Melgars death, which a military medical examiner ruled to be a homicide by asphyxiation, or strangulation, said three military officials briefed on the autopsy results.The two Navy SEALs, who have not been identified, were flown out of Mali shortly after the episode and were placed on administrative leave.The biggest unanswered question is why Sergeant Melgar was killed.N.C.I.S.does not discuss the details of ongoing investigations, Ed Buice, the agencys spokesman, said in an email, confirming that his service had taken over the case on Sept. 25.Neither the Army nor the militarys Africa Command issued a statement about Sergeant Melgars death, not even after investigators changed their description of the two SEALs from witnesses to persons of interest, meaning the authorities were trying to determine what the commandos knew about the death and if they were involved.The uncertainty has left soldiers in the tight-knit Green Beret community to speculate wildly about any number of possible motives, from whether it was a personal dispute among housemates gone horribly wrong to whether Sergeant Melgar had stumbled upon some illicit activity the SEALs were involved in, and they silenced him, according to interviews with troops and their families.Other officials briefed on the inquiry said they had heard no suggestion that the Navy commandos had been doing anything illegal.When contacted separately by telephone on Saturday, Sergeant Melgars widow, Michelle, and his brother, Shawn, declined to comment.Lawmakers have criticized top officers and Pentagon officials for offering a shifting timeline of the events in the Niger attack, and for failing to respond with timely, accurate information about the American militarys role on the continent at a time when President Trump has loosened restrictions on the armed forces to intensify attacks against the Islamic State and Al Qaeda around the world.Sergeant Melgar, a graduate of Texas Tech University who joined the Army in 2012, was assigned to the 3rd Special Forces Group, based at Fort Bragg, N.C., the same unit whose soldiers were attacked by a much larger and heavily armed group of Islamic State fighters near the border between Niger and Mali on Oct. 4.Advertisement Continue reading the main story According to military officials, Sergeant Melgar was part of a small team in Bamako assigned to help provide intelligence about Islamic militancies in Mali to the United States ambassador there, Paul A. Folmsbee, to protect American personnel against attacks.The sergeant also helped assess which Malian Army troops might be trained and equipped to build a counterterrorism force.Sergeant Melgar, a native of Lubbock, Tex., was about four months into what military officials said was a six-month tour in Mali, and was living with three other American Special Operations troops in a house provided by the American Embassy.Photo Two of those housemates were members of the Navys SEAL Team 6, which has over the past decade carried out kill-or-capture missions in Libya, Yemen, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia, as well as the one that killed bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in 2011.According to two senior American military officials, the two SEAL commandos were in Mali at the request of Mr. Folmsbee in a previously undisclosed and highly unusual clandestine mission to support French and Malian counterterrorism forces battling Al Qaedas branch in North and West Africa, known as Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, as well as smaller cells aligned with Al Qaeda or the Islamic State.The Americans helped provide intelligence for missions, and had participated in at least two such operations in Mali this year before Sergeant Melgars death.Much is unknown about what happened around 5 a.m. on June 4 in the team house.The initial reports to Sergeant Melgars superiors in Germany said he had been injured while wrestling or grappling with the two Navy commandos, according to three officials who have been briefed on the investigation.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.According to one version of events, one of the SEALs put Sergeant Melgar in a chokehold.When the sergeant passed out, the commandos frantically tried to revive him.Failing that, they rushed him to an emergency clinic, where he was pronounced dead.Spokesmen for the Africa Command, the Special Operations Command, the Defense Department and the Army and Navy investigative services declined to comment, citing the continuing investigation, or did not respond to emails and phone calls on Sunday.A spokesman for the State Departments Africa Bureau and Mr. Folmsbee, Nicholas A. Sadoski, directed all questions to the Pentagon.Mr. Sadoski declined to answer questions about what kind of oversight the ambassador exercised over the American military personnel in Mali, how frequently was he briefed on Special Operations missions there and when he learned about Sergeant Melgars death.Why American Special Operations forces are in Mali at all is a story in a nutshell of the American militarys successes and failures in Africa.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mali had been one of West Africas most stable nations before 2012, and was held up by the Pentagon as a model partner in combating Islamic militants.But when secular Tuareg separatists began an uprising, as they had done in the past, insurgents linked to Al Qaeda took advantage of the deteriorating security situation.When the militants surged across Malis northern desert in 2012, American-trained commanders of the countrys elite army units defected at a critical time, taking troops, trucks, weapons and their newfound skills to the enemy.A confidential internal review completed by the Africa Command after the debacle concluded that there were critical gaps in the American training for Malian troops and senior officers.With Malis army in collapse, the rebels were pushed out by French and Chadian troops early in 2013, and the United Nations established a peacekeeping mission.But the chaos continues today.Various armed insurgents regularly attack Malian forces and the United Nations peacekeepers.To date, 149 peacekeepers have been killed in Mali, making it one of the most dangerous peacekeeping missions in the world.And terrorists continue to mount deadly attacks, including an assault in June on a resort outside Bamako that killed at least five people.For the 3rd Special Forces Group, the past year has served as a reminder that Africa remains a dangerous assignment.In addition to Sergeant Melgar and the four soldiers killed in Niger, one soldier committed suicide in Kenya last October and another died in a vehicle accident while on patrol in Niger in February.Those who knew Sergeant Melgar described him as a soldiers soldier he deployed to Afghanistan twice on training missions between July 2014 and February 2016, according to his Army service record and a devoted father of two sons, 13 and 15, who texted and talked via Skype multiple times a day with his wife while serving overseas.More than four months later, his death still has many at Fort Bragg and in Lubbock reeling.An online community bulletin board in Lubbock stated: A Melgar family representative shared that Staff Sgt.Melgar did what most only dream of and excelled at every turn!His life was epic!He is missed dearly every single day.Sergeant Melgar was also honored at the high school he attended in Wolfforth, Tex., Frenship High, during the homecoming football game on Oct. 6.A final tribute awaits Sergeant Melgar: He is scheduled to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery on Nov. 20.
Puerto Rico Cancels Whitefish Energy Contract to Rebuild Power Lines:::::Mr. Rossell said he had asked for a federal investigation of the contract award process, and for the power authority to appoint a trustee to review contract bidding.He stressed that no wrongdoing had been discovered, but he said that the contract had become a distraction and that attention had to be refocused on restoring service.I am making this determination because it is in the best interest of the people of Puerto Rico, Mr. Rossell said at a news conference.The contract had been attracting intense scrutiny in Washington.The House Committee on Natural Resources, which oversees Puerto Rican affairs, sent a letter on Thursday to the power authority demanding all records connected to the contract.That same day, the inspector generals office at the Department of Homeland Security said it was investigating.Mr. Rossell also ordered an audit of the contract, and the board that Congress created to oversee Puerto Ricos financial affairs asked a federal court to appoint a new manager to supervise the utility.The chief executive of the power authority, Ricardo Ramos, defended the contract, which he awarded.But he said on Sunday that he understood the governors decision to cancel it because negative publicity and politics on the mainland had made the situation untenable.Mr. Ramos said Whitefish had recently requested security protection because people had started throwing rocks and bottles at the companys crews on the island, in the belief that the contract had been awarded corruptly.If you are in your house without power, and theres a sense that the energy authority gave away $300 million to a company that either had or did not have experience, the reaction is not positive, and were seeing that, Mr. Ramos said.Democrats on the mainland and opposition politicians in Puerto Rico questioned the deal and were alarmed to see that the companys chief executive, Andy Techmanski, came from the same small town in Montana as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.In an interview shortly after securing the contract, Mr. Techmanski told a local news station that he had been in touch with Mr. Zinke, whose son worked for Whitefish last summer, for more resources.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Both the Department of the Interior and Mr. Techmanski denied any impropriety in connection with the contract.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.When the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yuln Cruz, raised questions about the contract, the company fired back on Twitter, suggesting that it could withdraw its crews from her city.The company later apologized.In a statement on Friday, FEMA said it had not confirmed whether prices listed in the contract between Whitefish and the power authority were reasonable.Mr. Ramos said the prices were in line with what other companies had requested.In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Ramos said he had not heard of Whitefish before September.We checked them out on the internet, he said.There was a list of projects that they had done in the past, including with the Department of Energy.They showed a lot of experience in using helicopters to build transmission lines.On paper, they did have the experience necessary.Mr. Ramos had earlier said that Whitefish got the deal over competitors like PowerSecure because it did not ask for a large payment up front.Other companies, wary of Prepas bankruptcy, had demanded hefty sums, he said.Mr. Ramos said on Sunday that the contract was being canceled because attention had shifted from managing a humanitarian crisis to managing reputations.Thats risky, he said.I want to clarify that the cancellation of this contract does not mean there was anything outside the law, or out of the ordinary.He said the power authority had already paid Whitefish or been billed about $20.8 million for work done so far, and would have to reimburse the company for the cost of returning helicopters, trucks and other equipment from Puerto Rico to the United States.He said that work that was already in progress would be completed by Whitefish.Mr. Ramos said he would send a letter to the electric company board asking for a resolution formally ending the contract, and that the board would meet Monday or Tuesday to address the matter.The cancellation would take effect 30 days after a resolution is adopted.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Whitefish said in a statement on Sunday that it was very disappointed at the cancellation.The decision will only delay what the people of Puerto Rico want and deserve to have the power restored quickly in the same manner their fellow citizens on the mainland experience after a natural disaster, the statement said.We will certainly finish any work that Prepa wants us to complete, and stand by our commitments, knowing that we made an important contribution to the restoration of the power grid since our arrival on the island on Oct. 2.The company said it had already finished work on two major transmission lines, significantly speeding up the restoration of power to the city of Manat and to parts of San Juan.In interviews this month, Mr. Techmanski said he had flown to Puerto Rico before the contract was signed with Prepa on a leap of faith, and that his companys ability to mobilize quickly was vital to winning the contract.Asked this month how such a small company could manage such a big job, Mr. Ramos of Prepa said, Every company is small at some point in time.Criticism was also targeted at the Army Corps of Engineers, which was given responsibility by the Trump administration for restoring power in Puerto Rico and had no involvement in the Whitefish deal.Governor Rossell said he was led to believe that the Corps would restore power throughout the island within 40 days, but that it has just seven engineering crews on the island.Everyone has their role here, and the Corps of Engineers, honestly, has not played its role, Mr. Rossell said.The Corps contracted two companies, and those companies are in the process of subcontracting.This does not have the sense of urgency that it should have.Mr. Rossell said the governors of New York and Florida had now agreed to send utility crews to Puerto Rico.Such mutual aid arrangements are common after emergencies, and are usually invoked immediately.But the power authority has said it did not seek that kind of aid after the hurricane because having the Army Corps of Engineers do the restoration work would have spared it from paying anything.Jos E. Snchez, the head of the Corpss energy restoration task force, defended its work in a statement.We understand the frustration by the governor of Puerto Rico, and realize the importance of restoring power as quickly as possible, Mr. Snchez said.We continue to expedite the delivery of crews, material and equipment to the island in support of this urgent effort.We will not be satisfied until the people of Puerto Rico have safe and reliable power.
Trump Tries to Shift Focus as First Charges Reportedly Loom in Russia Case:::::And on Sunday, in tweets to his more than 40 million followers, he offered a litany of accusations against Mrs. Clinton and seemed to praise Republicans for starting the new congressional investigations.Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?), the Uranium to Russia deal, the 33,000 plus deleted Emails, the Comey fix and so much more, Mr. Trump wrote.Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia collusion, which doesnt exist.The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics, but the Rs, he added, are now fighting back like never before.There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out.DO SOMETHING!Mr. Trump was apparently referring to reports last week that Mrs. Clintons campaign and the Democratic National Committee had paid for research that was included in a salacious dossier made public in January by BuzzFeed.The dossier contained claims about connections between Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia.The president was also reviving unproved allegations that Mrs. Clinton was part of a quid pro quo in which the Clinton Foundation received donations in exchange for her support as secretary of state for a business deal that gave Russia control over a large share of uranium production in the United States.And he was returning to questions about Mrs. Clintons use of a private email server and how James B. Comey, the former F.B.I.director, handled an investigation into the matter, which was closed with no charges being filed.Mr. Trump initially cited the email case as a reason for firing Mr. Comey, before conceding that it was because of the Russia inquiry.Video The presidents Twitter fusillade came as he and his advisers braced for the first public action by Robert S. Mueller III, the special prosecutor named after Mr. Comeys ouster to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election.As part of his inquiry, Mr. Mueller is believed to be examining whether there was collusion between Mr. Trumps campaign and Moscow, and whether the president obstructed justice when he fired Mr. Comey.Advertisement Continue reading the main story CNN reported on Friday that a federal grand jury in Washington had approved the first charges in Mr. Muellers investigation, and that plans had been made for anyone charged to be taken into custody as early as Monday.CNN said the target of the charges was unclear.The New York Times has not confirmed that charges have been approved.Multiple congressional committees have undertaken their own investigations into Russian meddling in the elections, following up on the conclusion of United States intelligence agencies that Moscow sought to sway the contest in favor of Mr. Trump an idea that he has frequently dismissed as a hoax.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Some Republicans have been reluctant to embrace Mr. Trumps efforts to shift the spotlight away from Russias interference, arguing that the episode should be scrutinized as a foreign policy and national security issue, not a matter of personal grievance for the president.Speaking on NBCs Meet the Press on Sunday, Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said that Mr. Trump had been too defensive about Mr. Muellers inquiry.We ought to instead focus on the outrage that the Russians meddled in our elections, said Mr. Portman, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, urged his fellow Republicans on Fox News Sunday to give Mr. Mueller a chance to do his job.But a Trump ally, Gov.Chris Christie of New Jersey, said on ABCs This Week that if unspecified new facts put Mr. Mueller in a compromised position, he must recuse himself.Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer handling the response to the Russia investigation, said that the presidents tweets were unrelated to the activities of the special counsel, with whom he continues to cooperate.But they reflected a habit of Mr. Trumps in which he seeks to tar an opponent with the same accusations leveled at him.He did so last year during a presidential debate when Mrs. Clinton called him Putins puppet, responding: No puppet, no puppet.Youre the puppet.No, youre the puppet.The tweets came days after House Republicans announced that they were opening new investigations into two of Mr. Trumps most frequently cited grievances: the Obama Justice Departments investigation of Mrs. Clintons emails and the uranium deal.Mr. Trump is working to fuel those inquiries.The White House acknowledged on Friday that the president had urged the Justice Department to release the informant in the uranium investigation from his confidentiality agreement so he could speak to Congress.Critics called the move improper presidential interference in a federal criminal inquiry, but Mr. Trumps advisers said he was merely encouraging transparency.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In recent days Mr. Trump has suggested that he believes that the questions he has been raising about Mrs. Clintons conduct should put to rest any allegations about his own actions, and end the scrutiny of Russias meddling in the election.This was the Democrats coming up with an excuse for losing an election, Mr. Trump told reporters last week.They lost it by a lot.They didnt know what to say, so they made up the whole Russia hoax.Now its turning out that the hoax has turned around, and you look at whats happened with Russia, and you look at the uranium deal, and you look at the fake dossier.So thats all turned around.Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who serves on the Intelligence Committee, said on CBSs Face the Nation on Sunday that while she had yet to encounter any definitive evidence of collusion, she had seen lots of evidence that the Russians were very active in trying to influence the elections.
A 40-Foot Cross Has Honored War Dead for 90 Years. Is It Unlawful?:::::In a 2-to-1 ruling, the three-judge panel declared that the Peace Cross violated the First Amendment by having a primary effect of endorsing religion and excessively entangles the government and religion.Douglas Laycock, a religious liberties scholar and professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, praised the decision.The cross asserts the truth of one religion and, implicitly but necessarily, the falsehood of all other religions, he said.Its secondary meanings, as in honoring war dead, are entirely derivative of its primary meaning as a symbol of the Resurrection.If the Fourth Circuit denies a request for the full court to reconsider the panels decision, defenders of the monument vow to take the case to the Supreme Court.They argue that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent, threatening national treasures such as the 24-foot Canadian Cross of Sacrifice and 13-foot Argonne Cross in Arlington National Cemetery both within the Fourth Circuits jurisdiction as well as the ground zero cross, the steel beams discovered among World Trade Center debris now on display in the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.It is brooding hostility toward religion, a sort of cleansing, said Kelly Shackelford, the president of First Liberty Institute, one of the legal groups aiding the American Legion in defending the cross.We would immediately need to begin massive bulldozing and sandblasting of veterans memorials across the country in a way that most people would find inconceivable.In his Fourth Circuit dissent, Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory, first appointed by President Bill Clinton, argued that the Establishment Clause does not require the government to purge from the public sphere any reference to religion.Supporters of the cross also argue that context is vital: The Peace Cross is displayed alongside an American flag, amid a park of memorials for veterans of various wars.Its four sides, they say, are marked prominently with patriotic, not religious, virtues: valor, endurance, courage and devotion.The fallen soldiers are listed on a tablet with a quote from President Woodrow Wilson.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But opponents say it is hardly integrated: No other monument in the area is taller than 10 feet, and there are no other religious symbols in the park.They note that its fallen soldiers names are rusted away and obscured by bushes.And the cross has been the site of prayer gatherings as well as Veterans Day vigils and even such vigils are often opened in prayer.Two past Supreme Court cases, decided the same day in 2005, may foreshadow the factors that would control the outcome in the Supreme Court.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, officials had authorized the display of framed copies of the Ten Commandments in courthouses.After pushback, they had modified the exhibits to include Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence and other historical documents, arguing that the Ten Commandments were similarly influential in the development of Western legal thought.The Supreme Court ruled the displays unconstitutional, finding that they had no evident secular purpose.Michael W. McConnell, a constitutional law scholar at Stanford, calls such displays triumphalism a flavor of who is top dog.In a second case, Thomas Van Orden v. Rick Perry, the court allowed carvings of the Ten Commandments in a Texas State Capitol monument that had been donated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a primarily secular group, in 1961.The court cited the donors lack of religious intent.In his Van Orden opinion, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who cast the swing vote in both cases, called the historical factor alone determinative: The monument had stood since 1961 without controversy.The Peace Cross, also donated by a secular group, is almost twice as old as the monument in that case, and has been on public property for a comparable span.If the Supreme Court reviews this one, Mr. McConnell believes it will be squarely governed by Justice Breyers opinion.I think they thought they were putting this kind of case to rest with Van Orden, said Mr. McConnell, who has also served as a judge in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.Somehow, the Fourth Circuit didnt get the memo.I think this is a pretty easy case, and I found the Fourth Circuits decision quite surprising.If the Supreme Court were to grant review, the likelihood is very high that it would be reversed.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Peace Cross opponents argue that there is a stark difference between the Ten Commandments and a cross namely, the figures each represents.The court pointed out that Moses was a lawmaker as well as a religious leader, said Monica Miller, senior counsel at the American Humanist Association, who argued the case in the Fourth Circuit.There were connections to the nations history of lawmakers that made the Ten Commandments overall less religious than an enormous, free-standing Latin cross that unequivocally represents Christianity.The Supreme Courts thinking on displays of the cross is murky.In Salazar v. Buono, a 2010 decision regarding a cross-shaped war memorial in a remote part of the Mojave Desert, six justices wrote distinct opinions.In 2011, when the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal regarding a series of highway memorial crosses for fallen police officers in Utah, Justice Clarence Thomass 19-page dissent argued that the court had rejected an opportunity to provide clarity to an Establishment Clause jurisprudence in shambles.Awaiting its fate, the Peace Cross stands with a tarp draped neatly across the top, where the concrete has begun to crumble.Elizave Mordan, the King Pawn manager, can see it from her shop.We heard they may be taking it down, and I disagree with that.It just doesnt bother anybody around here, she said as she sorted through used power tools, record players and antique jewelry for sale.I worry nobody is going to remember them, she said of the 49 fallen soldiers.You cant remember something you cannot see.
Bedlam Out Here in Arizona After Jeff Flake Departs Senate Race:::::It definitely opens up the Senate for potentially a full spectrum of conservatives to win or potentially lose the seat entirely, said Representative Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican.The possibilities are almost endless.Mike Noble, a Republican pollster, called it bedlam out here in Arizona.Everyones phones are blowing up, he said.This is essentially a free-for-all.For Democrats to narrow the Republican hold on the Senate, they will have to take aim at two Republican seats, Mr. Flakes and Senator Dean Hellers in Nevada.No other Republican up for re-election next year comes from a generally competitive state.But while they have talked a big game in Arizona, hoping for a demographic and political shift, so far, Democrats have little to show for their efforts.The party does not hold a single statewide office.In 2012, the last time the state had an open Senate seat, Democrats recruited Richard H. Carmona, a tough-talking Vietnam War hero and former surgeon general in the administration of George W. Bush.Despite Mr. Carmonas conservative credentials, Mr. Flake won the seat, 49 percent to 46 percent.Photo Next year could be different.The challenge for Republican Party officials will be to find a candidate who is aligned closely enough with Mr. Trump to appeal to his populist wing of the party and to beat Ms. Ward in a primary dominated by the hard right but not so closely that he or she would lose to Ms. Sinema.The party needs an acceptable not Kelli choice who can surf the policy divides that are besieging our party right now, said Chuck Coughlin, a Republican strategist in Arizona.He and other strategists say they have been inundated with text messages and phone calls since Mr. Flakes surprise decision to leave the race.Mr. Flake, who lost support with Trump supporters in Arizona after publishing a book, Conscience of a Conservative, that took aim at the president, announced his retirement this past week with a blistering indictment of Mr. Trump and the Republicans who embrace him.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But while he framed his decision as a matter of principle, polling in the state showed just how difficult it would be for an anti-Trump Republican to win an Arizona primary.One recent poll showed Mr. Flake with an 18 percent approval rating, and a survey in August by Arizona High Ground, Mr. Coughlins firm, found Mr. Flake trailing both Ms. Ward and Ms. Sinema.Ms. Ward has the backing of Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trumps former chief strategist, who has vowed to wage war on establishment Republicans, chief among them Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.Ed Rollins, a veteran strategist who is the co-chairman of Great America, a Trump-aligned political action committee, recently signed on as her campaign manager.And Robert Mercer, the deep-pocketed New York investor who helped finance Mr. Trumps campaign, has donated $300,000 to Ms.Wards political action committee this year, according to Federal Election Commission records.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But Steven Law, the chief executive of the Senate Leadership Fund, a political action committee aligned with Mr. McConnell, vowed that Mr. Bannon and his allies would be the losers.Senator Flakes decision to exit the race gives everyone a chance the White House and Republicans in Arizona to work together to find a strong candidate who can hold this seat, Mr. Law said in an email.Thats not going to be Kelli Ward.Arizona House Republicans met privately in Washington on Thursday morning to discuss who might challenge Ms. Ward.At least one potential candidate, Representative David Schweikert, told reporters last week that he lacked the burning passion to run.No consensus was reached on an alternative.Speculation has centered on State Treasurer Jeff DeWit, an early and enthusiastic Trump backer who was the chief operating officer of the presidents 2016 campaign, and Representative Martha McSally, a retired Air Force colonel and the first American woman to fly in combat.Photo But it is unclear whether Mr. DeWit is interested.And with Mr. McCain battling brain cancer, party operatives say Ms. McSally, who has long expressed a desire to serve in the Senate, may be betting that his seat will open up and that she could ascend to the Senate through appointment by the governor.Ms. McSally has also drawn opposition from a coalition of conservative advocacy groups, led by the Club for Growth.On Friday, the Club for Growth released a letter urging Matt Salmon, a former representative from Arizona, to jump into the race, calling Mr. Salmon a proven, principled conservative.Mr. Salmon, who is now the chief lobbyist for Arizona State University, is considering it, a person close to him said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Whoever wins the Republican primary will almost certainly face Ms. Sinema, who is pitching herself to voters as a consensus builder with a compelling life story: She was homeless as a child, and her family lived for a time in an abandoned gas station.In a brief interview while taking a break from fund-raising phone calls, the congresswoman described herself as really committed to finding a bipartisan solution to the nations problems and said she subscribed to both liberal and conservative values a philosophy she said had roots in her childhood.We got help from both family and my parents church, but we also got help from the government, she said.Ms. Sinema added that she believed in the conservative concept of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and working really hard every day, and in the liberal notion that youve got to help people in need.Ms. Sinema, 41, is also the first openly bisexual member of the House and has the strong backing of gay rights groups, including the Human Rights Campaign, the powerful Washington advocacy organization, which has vowed to make significant investments in Arizona races this year.But some of her positions have rankled party progressives.Besides her Benghazi vote, she voted against Representative Nancy Pelosi of California for Democratic leader.There is still a lot of resentment toward Ms. Sinema over her Benghazi vote, said Representative Grijalva, who added that he would withhold his endorsement until he learned more about how she would vote on issues including tax cuts, immigration and the environment.Given how Kyrsten Sinema defines herself in the next few months, she could solidify her position with a real chance to win, Mr. Grijalva said.One potential challenger to Ms. Sinema is Mark Kelly, the retired astronaut and husband of former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was badly wounded in a 2011 massacre in Tucson.This past spring, some grass-roots Democratic groups in Arizona drafted a petition encouraging Mr. Kelly, who now advocates gun safety, to enter the race, and they are said to be renewing that effort.
Donald Trump and Michael Moore Quarrel Over Broadway Show:::::Photo Well, Michael Moore succeeded in getting the presidents attention.On Saturday evening, six days after The Terms of My Surrender, Mr. Moores solo show decrying President Trump, closed on Broadway, the president took a gleeful jab at the liberal provocateur on Twitter.Mr. Trumps assertion that the show was forced to close is incorrect.The show had been announced in May as a 12-week limited run, and it ran the full 12 weeks.Michael Moores Broadway show was always meant to be a limited engagement, said Rick Miramontez, a spokesman for the show.It closed, as planned, on Sunday, Oct. 22.It was not forced to close early.Mr. Trumps assertion that the show was a total bomb is a matter of opinion, and in a barrage of tweets late Saturday, Mr. Moore declared his show a smash hit before touting his production and taunting the president.Given the shows limited run and modest grosses, neither the phrase total bomb nor smash hit seems to be a precise description of its financial performance.The capitalization costs are not public for The Terms of My Surrender, which was produced by IMG Original Content and Carole Shorenstein Hays.But it played to houses that were often about three-quarters full, and its weekly grosses ranged from about $260,000 to $460,000.It took in $4.2 million over all and was seen by 74,484 people, according to the Broadway League.
When Silver Costs More Than Gold: How Trumps Actions Have Scrambled Insurance Prices:::::It also organized plans on its site in order of their premium price, so that customers who live in a place where a gold plan costs less than the cheapest silver plan would have an easier time figuring that out.If you live in one of the places where the gold plan is cheaper than the silver plan, and you earn more than about $24,000, you should not buy the more expensive silver option.The gold plan will cost less, and have a lower deductible.There are also high-deductible bronze plans that will have substantially lower premiums that you may also want to consider.If you qualify for a government subsidy, those will be your best options.If you earn too much to qualify for federal help buying insurance, you should also steer clear of the more expensive silver plans on HealthCare.gov.But there may be cheaper options in the silver category if you buy directly from an insurance company.A broker may be able to help you examine all of those options.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If you earn less than $24,000, a silver plan will still be your best choice.Thats because you qualify for additional discounts that will lower your deductible and co-payment, making a silver plan even more generous than a gold plan.Premium subsidies, which are unaffected by the presidents actions, will protect you from premium price increases.The loading of cost increases onto silver plans also makes it hard to easily describe how much more expensive insurance will be next year, compared with this year.The consulting group Avalere Health published a report Wednesday saying that the average silver plan on HealthCare.gov would increase in price by 34 percent by far the largest annual price increase since the Obamacare markets began.Normally, that silver price increase is a good barometer for whats happening with the entire health insurance market.But the Avalere report highlighted that the prices of other plan types arent rising as fast.Gold plans are going up, on average, by 16 percent.Bronze plans are rising, on average, by 18 percent.Some of those increases are probably because of Trump administration actions as well.The government has cut back on advertising and outreach to help enroll healthy customers, and has signaled that it may not enforce the government mandate to obtain insurance as vigorously as the Obama administration did.In their filings with regulators, insurance companies said they were increasing premiums to address that broader policy uncertainty.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Our map draws on prices that were published online Wednesday for 2018 plans on HealthCare.gov.The website serves 39 states, and the precise prices we examined were for single customers who dont smoke, age 40, though the trends should be the same for customers with different family sizes and ages.Information from the remaining states, which run their own marketplaces, will become available next week.
The Unhealthy Politics of Pork: How It Increases Your Medical Costs:::::Advertisement The Unhealthy Politics of Pork: How It Increases Your Medical Costs Image The term pork barrel spending has been around for well over 100 years.It means using government funds on local projects that are primarily used to bring more money to a specific representatives district.Credit Matt Cardy/Getty Images No industry in America spends more on lobbying than health care.In 2016, the health care industry spent half a billion dollars on lobbying, with pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and health professionals making the largest contributions.In 2009, the year the Affordable Care Act was debated, health care lobbying exceeded $550 million.(Last year, by comparison, defense lobbying totaled $129 million, and the gun lobby spent just $10.5 million.)Closely related to industry lobbying is the political maneuvering that congressional leaders use in an effort to pass legislation specifically, targeted provisions known as earmarks, sweeteners or pork barrel spending.The final version of the Graham-Cassidy health bill, for example, would have sent extra money to Alaska and Maine for the crucial votes of senators from those states, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins.In 2010, Democrats hoping to secure votes from reluctant rural state senators added the Frontier States provision to the A.C.A., which increased Medicare payments to five states with low population densities.We all know earmarks and lobbying influence policymakers and policy.In health care, this has critical implications: who gets care, how much they get, how we pay for it.But theres little hard data on exactly who benefits and how large the effects can be.A new study illuminates the ways these political dynamics can change congressional and hospital behavior and how they can increase health care costs for the rest of us.Research by Zack Cooper, Amanda Kowalski and Jennifer Wu at Yale and by Eleanor Powell at the University of Wisconsin-Madison analyzed a provision in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (M.M.A.), known as Section 508, that helped secure Republican votes for the laws passage.The M.M.A., which created Medicare Part D and provided prescription drug coverage for seniors, was a political priority for President George W. Bush ahead of his 2004 re-election campaign.But fiscally conservative Republicans were hesitant to sign on to what amounted to the largest expansion of Medicare in its history, and the bill seemed unlikely to pass.Thats when Section 508 was added.The rate at which Medicare pays individual hospitals is determined largely by a hospitals location and the labor costs, or wage index, in its area.Hospitals can, however, request to be reclassified into a different wage index area to raise their payments.Sometimes there are good reasons for this: Two hospitals might be competing in the same region, and because theyre separated by an arbitrary bureaucratic line, one gets paid more than the other.But Section 508 waivers created new, more ambiguous ways that hospitals in specific districts could appeal their assigned wage index, and gave the executive branch considerable discretion about which requests would be granted and how big the pay increases would be.The Section 508 waivers had large effects on how both politicians and hospitals operated.About 400 hospitals applied for a Medicare pay increase, and 120 waivers were granted.Hospitals in districts represented by a Republican member of Congress who voted for the M.M.A.were seven times more likely to receive a waiver compared with those in districts of members who voted against it.On average, these hospitals saw a 6.5 percent increase in Medicare payments, but the 29 hospitals with the biggest payment increases high 508 recipient hospitals received a 10 percent boost.How did hospitals spend the extra money?Perhaps unsurprisingly, they started treating more Medicare patients about 8 percent more per year.They also expanded nursing staffing by roughly a third, and invested in new technologies.But extra cash also meant big raises for hospital C.E.O.s: nearly half a million dollars per year at each hospital.Over all, high 508 recipient hospitals had $1.25 billion in additional spending from 2005 to 2010 about 25 percent more than they otherwise would have.There was no evidence of improved quality or outcomes.If you told me in advance that wed find this tight a link between Congress and hospitals, I would have been very surprised, Mr. Cooper said.We knew there was some connection, of course, but the more we kept digging, the stronger and more precise the link became.Section 508 payment changes were supposed to expire after three years.But hospitals with lucrative waivers had considerable interest in seeing the program extended, and worked together to form the Section 508 Hospital Coalition.In the years between passage of the M.M.A., and its reauthorization in 2007, legislators in districts with a Section 508 hospital saw a 22 percent rise in total campaign contributions, and a 65 percent increase in donations from the health care sector specifically.In the end, a provision that budgeted $900 million over three years led to billions in extra spending for nearly a decade.Pork, it seems, is as bad for budgets as it is for waistlines.Every time you pass legislation, big or small, these elements are added in, Mr. Cooper said.Its not that any single one is hugely offensive.Its their accumulation and continuation over time.Although Mr. Coopers research offers perhaps the clearest empirical glimpse of the links between lobbying, earmarks and medical spending, this political maneuvering is not new and Medicare hospital payment seems to be a particularly susceptible target.Both Democrats and Republicans have won pay increases for hospitals they represent.In the 1999 budget, the House Republican whip, Tom DeLay, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert reclassified hospitals in their districts into other regions, leading to hundreds of thousands of dollars of extra funding per year.About a dozen years later, in what was called the Bay State Boondoggle , John Kerry, then a senator, succeeded in lobbying for Medicare to pay Massachusetts urban hospitals at the same rate it paid the states rural hospitals.The catch: There was only one hospital that qualified as rural in Massachusetts on the wealthy island of Nantucket.None of this is surprising.A primary motive of elected representatives is getting re-elected.Passing expansive legislation like Medicare Part D or the A.C.A.is hard, especially when legislators cant point to specific benefits for their constituents.But a critical flaw in our current system is that payments are hugely influenced by politicians who have every incentive to increase them for their own districts.You cant get upset at a snake for having fangs, Mr. Cooper told me.We need to design a system that takes payment decisions out of the hands of elected representatives.We think of interest rates as so important and complicated that weve tried to remove politics and give the responsibility to the Fed.The same argument holds for health care.When the government spends a trillion dollars on health care, its too easy for members to direct funds to their districts.Weve been close to a possible solution.The A.C.A.called for establishing an Independent Payment Advisory Board , a 15-member panel charged with making changes to Medicare to control costs.The proposed reforms would have been put into effect unless Congress introduced alternate policies to achieve the same savings.But the advisory board faced fierce bipartisan opposition and was never created.Americas increasingly burdensome health care spending has many roots: new technologies, high drug prices, fragmented care, administrative expenses and the like.But lobbying and political maneuvering can increase costs, too without clear benefits for patients, communities or society at large.Often these costs are borne by all of us, while the benefits if any go to a favored few.Excess medical spending, then, is driven not only by inefficiencies in our health system, but also by those in our political system.Our solutions, it seems, must confront that uncomfortable reality.Dhruv Khullar , M.D., M.P.P., is a physician at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and a researcher at the Weill Cornell Department of Healthcare Policy and Research.Follow him on

Democrats Lack Strong Challengers for Some Vulnerable G.O.P. House Seats:::::Over all, there are 11 districts (out of the 50 districts that ought to be most competitive, by our estimates) where the Democrats dont have a candidate who raised $100,000.On average, those 11 districts are much less educated than the battlegrounds as a whole; just 31 percent of whites over age 25 have a degree.In comparison, whites with a degree represent 41 percent of the population in the other 39 districts that ought to be most competitive.Democratic Fund-Raising Lagging in Working-Class Districts Democratic share of fund-raising in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018, by white educational attainment.20% 40 60 100% 75 50 25 0 Whites with degree Democratic share of fund-raising 20% 30 40 50 60 100% 75 50 25 0 Whites with a college degree Democratic share of fund-raising There is still plenty of time for Democrats to find candidates in those districts.And even in working-class areas, Democrats are doing far better at recruiting and fund-raising than in recent years.They have attracted strong recruits in many competitive working-class districts, like Maines Second, New Yorks 21st and Illinoiss 12th.Democrats even have well-funded challenges in a few working-class districts that werent bound to be competitive at all, like Paul Ryans district in Wisconsin, Kentuckys Sixth or Kansas Second.And working-class districts are often in less expensive media markets, making it easier for Democrats to make a late bid.Photo The Democrats will clearly have the money to compete in expensive markets like Los Angeles and New York.Theyve posted staggering fund-raising totals in many of the best-educated districts, often outpacing longtime Republican congressmen.If anything, Democrats might have the opposite problem in these well-educated areas: too many viable candidates.In Orange County, Calif., Democratic challengers have outraised Republican incumbents by a two-to-one margin this year, even though the Republicans got a head start before their Democratic challengers entered the race.But theres a catch: There are 15 Democratic candidates who have raised more than $100,000 in just those four districts, setting up a series of costly primaries that might ultimately prove detrimental to the partys general election chances.Theres a similar pattern in well-educated districts across the country.Democrats Have Many Candidates in Well-Educated Districts Number of Democrats who have raised over $100,000 in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018.20% 40 60 6 4 2 0 Number of Dems over $100k Whites with a degree Number of Democrats who have raised over $100,000 in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018.20% 30 40 50 60 6 4 2 0 Pct.whites with a degree Number of Dems over $100k The abundance of Democratic challengers in these well-educated districts is a reflection of huge enthusiasm.In these areas, theres no shortage of well-to-do and well-connected political novices looking to do something about Mr. Trumps presidency, just as there was no shortage of well-educated Democrats lining up for the Jan. 21 Womens March or donating to the campaign of Jon Ossoff in Georgias Sixth District special election.Few established politicians are standing in the way of these political newcomers.The Democratic bench is quite weak in these traditionally Republican and often heavily gerrymandered areas.There are no obvious contenders strong enough to clear the field.The enthusiasm among well-educated Democrats and the relative lack of success recruiting established politicians in working-class areas has occasionally led to an odd mismatch: affluent, liberal types running in working-class districts.Take Josh Harder, who worked for a San Francisco venture capital firm but is now running in Californias typically competitive 10th District in the Central Valley, or ex-Obama administration officials like Elissa Slotkin, Lauren Baer and Andy Kim, who are running in middle-class districts in Michigan, Florida and New Jersey.The good news for Democrats is that they dont need perfect recruits to pull off big wins if its a so-called wave election year.Mr. Ossoff was a true political novice and still came close to winning, and the 2006 and 2010 wave midterm elections are full of examples of fairly weak recruits who pulled off important victories.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the G.O.P.starts from a position of strength: The Democrats path to a House majority is much more challenging than it was in 2006, or than it was for the Republicans in 2010.They cant afford to leave many districts like New Yorks 24th or Californias 21st off the board.
The Cookie Crumbles: A Retracted Study Points to a Larger Truth:::::Before the study period, about 20 percent of the children chose an apple, and 80 percent the cookie.But when researchers put an Elmo sticker on the apple, more than a third chose it.Thats a significant result, and from a cheap, easily replicated intervention.While the intervention seems simple, any study like this is anything but.For many reasons, doing research in nutrition is very, very hard.Photo First, the researchers have to fund their work, which can take years.Then the work has to be vetted and approved by an Institutional Review Board, which safeguards subjects from potential harm.I.R.B.s are especially vigilant when studies involve children, a vulnerable group.Even if the research is of minimal risk, this process can take months.Then theres getting permission from schools to do the work.As you can imagine, many are resistant to allowing research on their premises.Often, protocols and rules require getting permission from parents to allow their children to be part of studies.If parents (understandably) refuse, figuring out how to do the work without involving some children can be tricky.Finally, many methodological decisions come into play.Lets imagine that we want to do a simple test of cookies versus apples, plus or minus stickers as this study did.Its possible that children eat different things on different days, so we need to make sure that we test them on multiple days of the week.Its possible that they might change their behavior once, but then go back to their old ways, so we need to test responses over time.Its possible that handing out the cookie or apple personally might change behavior more than just leaving the choices out for display.If thats the case, we need to stay hidden and observe unobtrusively.This matters because in the real world its probably not feasible to have someone handing out these foods in schools, and we need the methods to mirror what will most likely happen later.Its also possible that the choices might differ based on whether children can take both the apple and the cookie (in which case they could get the sticker and the treat) or whether they had to choose one.I point out all these things to reinforce that this type of research isnt as simple as many might initially think.Without addressing these questions, and more, the work may be flawed or not easily generalized.Advertisement Continue reading the main story These difficulties are some of the reasons so much research on food and nutrition is done with animals, like mice.We dont need to worry as much about I.R.B.s or getting a school on board.We dont have to worry about mice noticing whos recording data.And we can control what theyre offered to eat, every meal of every day.But the same things that make animal studies so much easier to perform also make them much less meaningful.Human eating and nutrition are typically more complex than anything a mouse would encounter.Overcoming these problems and proving spectacular results in preteens are some of the reasons this study on cookies and apples, and others like it, are so compelling.The authors have transformed this work into popular appearances, books and publicity for the Food and Brand Lab.Photo But cracks began to appear in Mr. Wansinks and the Food and Brand Labs work not long ago, when other researchers noted discrepancies in some of his studies.The numbers didnt add up; odd things appeared in the data, including the study on apples and cookies.The issues were significant enough that JAMA Pediatrics retracted the original article, and the researchers posted a replacement.The problems didnt end there.As Stephanie Lee at BuzzFeed recently reported, it appears that the study wasnt conducted on 8-to-11-year-olds as published.It was done on 3-to-5-year-olds.Just as mice cant be easily extrapolated to humans, research done on 3-to-5-year-olds doesnt necessarily generalize to 8-to-11-year-olds.Putting an Elmo sticker on an apple for a small child might matter, but that doesnt mean it will for a fifth grader.On Friday, the study was fully retracted.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Making things worse, this may have happened in other publications.Ms. Lee has also reported on a study published in Preventive Medicine in 2012 that claimed that children are more likely to eat vegetables if you give them a cool name, like X-ray Vision Carrots.That study, too, may be retracted or corrected, along with a host of others.As a researcher, and one who works with children, I find it hard to understand how you could do a study of 3-to-5-year-olds, analyze the data, write it up and then somehow forget and imagine it happened with 8-to-11-year-olds.The grant application would have required detail on the study subjects, as well as justification for the age ranges.The I.R.B.would require researchers to be specific about the ages of the children studied.I reached out to the authors of the study to ask how this could have happened, and Mr. Wansink replied: The explanation for mislabeling of the age groups in the study is both simple and embarrassing.I was not present for the 2008 data collection, and when I later wrote the paper I wrongly inferred that these children must have been the typical age range of elementary students we usually study.Instead, I discovered that while the data was indeed collected in elementary schools, it was actually collected at Head Start day cares that happened to meet in those elementary schools.This is a level of disconnect that many scientists would find inconceivable, and I do not mean to suggest that this is the norm for nutrition research.It does, however, illustrate how an inattention to detail can derail what might be promising work.The difficulties of research in this area are already significant.Distrust makes things worse.The social sciences are already suffering from a replication problem; when work that makes a big splash fails to hold up, it hurts science in general.We want to believe there are easy fixes to the obesity epidemic and nutrition in general.We want to believe there are simple actions we can take, like putting labels on menus, or stickers on food, or jazzing up the names of vegetables.Sadly, all of that may not work, regardless of what advocates say.When nutrition solutions sound too good to be true, theres a good chance they are.
Why the Fact-Checking at Facebook Needs to Be Checked:::::Since the 2016 presidential campaign, Facebook has taken a number of actions to prevent the continued distribution of false news articles on its platform, most notably by labeling articles rated as false or misleading by fact checkers as disputed.But how effective are these measures?To date, Facebook has offered little information to the public other than a recent email to fact checkers asserting that labeled articles receive 80 percent fewer impressions.But more data is necessary to determine the success of these efforts.Research (including my own) suggests the need to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of Facebooks interventions.Yales Gordon Pennycook and David Rand offer two principal warnings.First, the effects of exposure to false information are not easily countered by labeling, as they find in a paper they wrote with Tyrone D. Cannon.False information we have previously encountered feels more familiar, producing a feeling of fluency that causes us to rate it as more accurate than information we have not seen before.This effect persists even when Facebook-style warnings label a headline disputed.We should be cautious about assuming that labels tagging articles as false are enough to prevent misinformation on social media from affecting peoples beliefs.Photo In a second paper, Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand find that the presence of disputed labels causes study participants to rate unlabeled false stories as slightly more accurate an implied truth effect.If Facebook is seen as taking responsibility for the accuracy of information in its news feed through labeling, readers could start assuming that unlabeled stories have survived scrutiny from fact checkers (which is rarely correct there are far too many for humans to check everything).Advertisement Continue reading the main story Encouragingly, my students at Dartmouth College and I find that the effects of Facebook-style disputed banners on the perceived accuracy of false headlines are larger than those Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand observed.The proportion of respondents rating a false headline as somewhat or very accurate in our study decreased to 19 percent with the standard Facebook disputed banner, from 29 percent in the unlabeled condition.It goes down even further, to 16 percent, when the warning instead states that the headline is rated false.(We find no evidence of a large implied truth effect, though we lack the statistical precision necessary to detect effects of the size Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand measure.)Other results suggest further reason for caution.Back in April, Facebook provided users with Tips to Spot False News in an article that was linked above users news feeds.We find that general warnings of this sort are also potentially counterproductive.When we showed a warning reminding users to remain skeptical and think critically to spot misleading articles, it did reduce belief in the accuracy of false news headlines somewhat but it also somewhat reduced the perceived accuracy of news articles that were not false.Readers seemed to become more skeptical of all the headlines that they encountered.(A similar effect was not observed for the fact-check banners.)
A Big Test of Police Body Cameras Defies Expectations:::::After the public uprising in response to the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., advocates and many police officials turned to cameras as a way to reduce violent encounters and build trust.By 2015, 95 percent of large police departments reported they were using body cameras or had committed to doing so in the near future, according to a national survey.Photo The cameras provide an independent, if sometimes ambiguous, record of police-civilian encounters.Until now, the most commonly cited study on police body cameras had suggested that cameras did indeed have a calming effect.That experiment took place in 2012 in Rialto, Calif., where officers were randomly assigned cameras based on their shifts.Over a year, shifts that included cameras experienced half as many use-of-force incidents (including the use of a police baton, Taser or gun) as those shifts without cameras.The number of complaints filed by civilians against officers also declined a stunning 90 percent compared with the previous year.The Rialto study had a big impact in policing.Axon (formerly known as Taser International) has sold more than 300,000 police cameras worldwide and cites the Rialto study on its website.A federal district judge also cited the study in 2013 when she ordered the New York City Police Department to conduct a yearlong pilot program using body cameras.(Results are due out this spring.)But the Rialto experiment featured just 54 officers, compared with over 2,000 in Washington.Officers in Washington captured five times as many hours of video.The larger sample size and the long-term way the cameras were assigned added to the reliability of the D.C. results.This is the most important empirical study on the impact of police body-worn cameras to date, said Harlan Yu from Upturn, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit consulting company that studies how technology affects social issues.It was not directly involved in the research.The results call into question whether police departments should be adopting body-worn cameras, given their high cost.The federal government has given police departments more than $40 million to invest in body cameras, and state and local authorities have spent many millions more.The devices vary in price, but the biggest expense is the data-storage cost.In Washington, M.P.D.officers collect about a thousand hours of footage a day.About 40 percent of it is deleted within 90 days, while the rest is to be kept for months, years or decades, depending on the statute of limitations for the charges connected to the footage.Video The cameras also have a cost in terms of privacy violations.In a report on the policies governing police body cams in 50 major departments, Upturn and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights found that many cities have weak rules in place.Those rules can allow departments to refuse to share footage with civilians who want to file complaints, for example.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some companies are exploring ways to integrate facial recognition software into police cameras, a level of surveillance that would disproportionately affect low-income minority communities, where the police tend to spend the most time.D.C. has relatively strong body-worn-camera procedures, Mr. Yu said.In cities that have weaker policies, its certainly possible that the cameras may be doing more harm than good.Like other advocacy groups, the American Civil Liberties Union has supported body cameras.But the study, says Monica Hopkins-Maxwell at the A.C.L.U.of D.C., should give us pause.For now, Washington officials say they intend to continue using cameras.But they admit to being surprised by the findings.I thought it would make a difference on police and civilian behavior particularly for officers, and this is the exception, who might be more inclined to misbehave, said the M.P.D.chief, Peter Newsham.Why didnt the cameras change behavior?After all, we know that other cameras do change behavior.Public closed-circuit TV cameras seem to lead to a moderate decrease in crime, particularly in parking garages.Traffic cameras significantly decrease speeding and fatal accidents.Even the suggestion that someone is watching us tends to influence us: In 2011, researchers at Newcastle University in England posted pictures of a pair of male eyes and the caption, Cycle Thieves: We Are Watching You.Bike thefts decreased by 62 percent in those locations and not elsewhere.One hypothesis is that officers got used to the cameras and became desensitized to them.But the researchers saw no difference in behavior during the initial phase, when the cameras were new.(The researchers also checked the data to make sure officers were turning their cameras on when they were supposed to, and found a very high level of compliance.)Another possibility is that officers without cameras were acting like officers with cameras, simply because they knew other officers had the devices.An equally plausible explanation has to do with fear: In Washington, police officers are instructed to turn on their cameras whenever they answer a call or encounter the public in a law-enforcement context.The kinds of situations that might lead to civilian complaints or use-of-force incidents are high-stress encounters.When frightened, humans tend to act on automatic fear responses (or, in the case of good police officers in an ideal world, training).Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its a lot to ask, psychologically speaking, to not only remember the camera is on but to moderate your behavior, said Mr. Yokum, the head of the Lab @ DC.Photo Finally, cameras may have had less impact in Washington, because the police department there has already had to confront excessive-force problems.After a devastating 1998 Washington Post series revealed that the citys police department had shot and killed more people per resident in the 1990s than any other police force in a large American city, the Department of Justice entered into a memorandum of agreement with D.C. to reform its policing.We went through a transformation with regard to use of force when Justice came in here, Chief Newsham said.Cities that lack such accountability in their police culture may find cameras more effective, under this theory.(The Rialto Police Department had been reeling from a series of scandals when the Rialto study showed a large impact from cameras.)Even if cameras do not reduce violent encounters, they can still offer other kinds of benefits: for training, or to hold a rogue officer accountable after the fact.To Chief Newsham, the cameras primary benefit is to improve relations with the community.The transparency and trust that the community has, knowing your department is recording the interactions, I dont think you can undervalue that, he said.So far, its hard to say for sure if cameras increase trust, but Chief Newsham said hed like to find out more through additional studies like this one.The nine-person research team pre-published its design online, so that there would be less temptation to rejigger the approach after the results were in (an emerging best practice in social science research).We like to be very anecdotal in policing to compare this year to that year, said M.P.D.Commander Ralph Ennis, who oversaw the rollout of the cameras and worked closely with researchers.This study is a whole other thing.An updated version of this article, with more about the national implications of the Washington, D.C., study of police body cameras, can be found here.
The Fed Claims to Be Independent. Thats Mostly a Myth.:::::Over the course of Fed history, we find a dozen and a half other episodes of major overhaul.Some empower the Fed, others limit its autonomy, and some, like Dodd-Frank, do both.Controlling for the duration of recessions, Congress is more likely to amend the Federal Reserve Act when inflation and unemployment tick substantially higher.Congress is also more likely to act when electoral rewards are greatest.If one party controls both the White House and Congress, voters know whom to reward or blame.If the parties divide power, voters have a harder time.Congress is more likely to threaten action than to take it.Using legislative records to document lawmakers attention to the Fed, we examined all the bills introduced in the House and Senate between 1947 and 2014 that address the power, structure and governance of the central bank.Over nearly seven decades, 333 House and Senate members introduced 879 bills.Fingers Point at the Fed When the Economy Misfires Higher unemployment is correlated with the number of congressional bills between 1947 and 2014 addressing the power and governance of the Fed.1960 1980 2000 bills introduced per year 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1960 1980 2000 bills introduced per year 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Viewing the number of bills introduced each year (1947-2014) in the context of when the unemployment rate was above its median makes the pattern clear.When the economy hums, lawmakers leave the Fed alone.For example, congressional attention dropped markedly during Alan Greenspans Great Moderation starting in the 1980s, when the Fed tended to achieve its mandates.When the economy sours, most recently in the wake of the global financial crisis, reactive lawmakers pummel the Fed.The Fed today remains caught in the cross hairs of partisan polarization.Republican proposals to limit its discretion, for instance, would require the Fed to adopt rate-setting monetary policy rules.Others want greater transparency from the Fed, such as allowing auditors to review monetary policy deliberations.Even though the current Fed is still occupied by Obama appointees, Democrats are also critical, favoring stronger limits on emergency lending.Threats matter because they restrict Fed autonomy.Fed officials understand that responsiveness, sometimes even deference, to their congressional bosses lessens the chance that Congress and the president will revise the Federal Reserve Act.Photo Critics in Congress take aim at both monetary goals and tools.In July, the House financial services chairman, Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, warned Ms. Yellen that the Fed should cease and desist from buying assets that venture into fiscal policy: If we are not careful, we may wake up one day to find our central bankers have instead become our central planners.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Feds 2012 adoption of an inflation target also belies any notion of Fed independence.Ben Bernanke, then the Fed chairman, first broached the subject with his colleagues a decade earlier.Fed transcripts reveal acute sensitivity to securing congressional support.As Donald Kohn, then the Fed vice chairman, argued in 2008, having an inflation target wont have any effect if it is repudiated by the Congress.In the immediate wake of the financial crisis, the perceived political risk of setting a target again deterred Fed action.The Fed did not adopt its target until unemployment had finally subsided, years after the crisis.Even today, when former Fed officials recommend a higher inflation goal to generate greater growth, G.O.P.lawmakers direct Ms. Yellen not to change the target.Perhaps the Fed would be less eager to raise interest rates again if it could independently raise the inflation bar instead.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.As President Trump thinks about whether to choose a new Fed leader, Ms. Yellen, whose term expires in February, and her colleagues have been busy normalizing monetary policy.A decade after the financial crisis and near generational lows in unemployment, the Fed is finally unwinding its four-plus-trillion-dollar balance sheet, gradually raising interest rates and keeping an eye on inflation that has been below the desired target.This Fed seems eager to drop Mr. Bernankes crisis prescriptions.At her September news conference, however, Ms. Yellen reminded market participants that future policy makers would have a free hand to follow the Bernanke playbook the next time the country faces a financial crisis.Rates could return to zero, the balance sheet could be expanded, and so-called forward guidance could provide clear communication about future policy.Political interdependence cautions against such certainty.Some of the contenders to replace Ms. Yellen, like Kevin Warsh and John Taylor, show little interest in Mr. Bernankes unconventional policies, underscoring the efficacy of congressional threats.And President Trumps rare opportunity to overhaul the Board of Governors makes room for skeptics of the Feds financial crisis response.A new Fed, backed by an expanding economy, may temporarily quiet the legislative critics.But whether in this presidential term or some later one, an inevitable economic slowdown or a more serious financial panic will surely restart the cycle of crisis, blame and reform.
Mexicos Record Violence Is a Crisis 20 Years in the Making:::::It makes me desperate, he said, shaking his head at his countrys missteps, because this violence, its increasing.Extreme Measures Photo In 2006, a new president and a new drug cartel both took extreme actions, the consequences of which are still unfolding.The implosion of Colombian cartels set off a fierce competition in Mexico for control of the drug trade.A new cartel, La Familia Michoacna, broke off from a larger group, then cemented its power by deploying extreme, theatrical violence.Though they principally targeted other cartels, the gruesome attacks shocked Mexico.That same year, Felipe Caldern won the presidency by a hair.Though monitors approved the vote, his leftist opponent called it illegitimate, and the narrow victory for Mr. Caldern left him without a strong mandate.Shortly after taking office, the new president declared war on the cartels and sent in the military.Critics say Mr. Caldern sought to legitimize his presidency through the show of force.Defenders say he had little alternative.Mexico had been a single-party state and, like most such states, had controlled local officials through patronage and corruption.When that system disappeared, drug cartels filled the vacuum, buying off mayors and judges.Only the military had the firepower and autonomy to take them on.This began the drug war that has killed tens of thousands of people.But it also created a subtler set of problems now driving more and broader violence.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Short-Term Solutions, Long-Term Problems Photo Mr. Caldern adopted the so-called kingpin strategy, in which troops captured or killed cartel leaders.This generated headlines, pleased the United States and could be accomplished top-down, with little input from corrupt or weak local law enforcement.But this short-term solution to the drug war deepened long-term problems.In bypassing mayors and governors because Mexicos pre-democratic practices had left them systemically corrupt and unaccountable, the government further reduced their accountability.And in bypassing already weak local police and judges, the government allowed those institutions to atrophy, with money and political attention diverted to military and federal forces instead.Murder rate per 100,000 15 10 5 0 18.7 1998 2007 2011 2016 15 10 5

officers from conducting investigations drifted.As the kingpin strategy fractured the cartels, smaller groups rose in their place.Since then, said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst, there has been a significant change in the way organized crime works in Mexico.Drug trafficking required resources and infrastructure that the new groups lacked, leading many to turn to kidnapping, theft and extortion.Predatory crimes spiked.Ordinary Mexicans, once bystanders to the conflict, became its targets at a moment when the state had left them vulnerable.In the process of that fragmentation, we didnt do the job of structuring the institutions of the police forces, said Mr. Valds, who ran the civil national security intelligence service as this was unfolding.So we have the worst of the worst.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Key Point of Failure Photo The solution to the problem would seem obvious.Strong police and prosecutors, overseen by politicians who are held accountable by voters, could close the vacuum in which gangs and corrupt officials flourish.Instead, disorder and violence have risen.Joy Langston, a political scientist at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City, traces many of the countrys woes to a seemingly minor quirk in its political system.All candidates are selected by the party, and officials serve one term before being shuffled off to another post.During the one-party era, this was meant to impose accountability, which flowed from party leadership.Oversight institutions, seen as superfluous, never fully developed.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the

while cementing many of its old problems, creating what Ms. Langston called a nightmare scenario in which the institutions of accountability and transparency are extraordinarily weak even after 17 years of democracy.For example, voters have little opportunity to kick out bad leaders or reward good ones, giving officials little incentive to push through difficult reforms.And criminal groups are able to fill the pockets of notoriously underpaid policemen and other civil servants often providing the wrong kind of incentives.At the end of the day, this is all an issue of accountability, Mr. Hope said.That is the key point of failure in Mexico.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Nothing happens if a police officer does not do their work, he added.Nothing happens if a mayor fails to transform local law enforcement.Nothing happens if a governor fails to invest in prosecutorial services.Nothing happens.A Frail State Recedes Though recent electoral changes will allow some officials to stand for re-election in 2021, deeper problems are taking root.As public outrage over corruption rises, party leaders, seeing their own careers in peril, are becoming more reluctant to risk pushing for change.I cannot think of a single prosecutor or judge who stands out on fighting corruption, said Paul F. Lagunes, a Columbia University professor who studies corruption.There are people staking their careers on this, but not in the judiciary in the press, Mr. Lagunes said.But, he added, Mexico is one of the riskiest countries in the world to do journalism.The combination of corruption, weak accountability and weak institutions has left the state vulnerable.In poor and rural areas, it has effectively receded.Criminal groups and youth gangs are filling the void, co-opting local officials or simply muscling them out.The result may be less dramatic than Mr. Calderns drug war, in which warring cartels publicly displayed dismembered corpses.But it is just as deadly, playing out in thousands of home invasions, gang killings and stickups gone wrong.State and Society Atomize This is leading communities to do, at the grass-roots level, what Mr. Caldern did a decade earlier: bypass distrusted institutions, worsening the underlying problem.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Businesses and middle-class Mexicans are hiring private security in record numbers.But like the Army, hired guards cannot solve crimes or lock up suspects.Mark Ungar, a Brooklyn College professor, said this growing practice relieves a lot of political pressure on the state to improve the police.Rural communities, which are more vulnerable, have formed self-defense militias to run off gangs and mayors alike.Inevitably, the militias are even more corruptible and less accountable than the police they replaced.Nearly all target their onetime sponsors for extortion, robbery and kidnapping.Many are involved in the heroin trade, which is booming as opioid addiction drives up American demand.In a disturbing trend, desperate and frightened communities increasingly seek at least the illusion of security by lynching suspected criminals.Mr. Ungar said these expressions of vigilantism represent a disempowerment of the state.Paralysis Amid Disaster Photo Mexicans seem keenly aware that their government is growing less responsive just as streets are becoming more dangerous.Polls show growing dissatisfaction, particularly over corruption.We have this political class that totally forgets why they are there, said Armando Torjes, a community activist in Guadalupe, a working-class city in the northeast.Each election, he said, brings a new official with a new three-year plan.Most, he added, leave office conspicuously wealthier.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When officials do act, they address superficial issues, adding more patrols or changing police strategy without confronting what he called the countrys social decomposition.Mr. Valds, the former head of the intelligence service, described facing a similar struggle in top levels of government.We wanted to improve the institutions, the judges, the jails, the police, he said.We spent years trying to convince the political class.But he found those institutions dominated by parties rather than technocrats and subject to the whims of officials who are required by law to cycle out every term unresponsive, just as Mr. Torjes had.Whats happening in Guadalupe is whats happening in all of Mexico, Mr. Torjes said.There was a political demand for change, but nothing really changed for us.
Bipartisan Health Proposal Is Too Late for 2018, but a Salve for 2019:::::It would make it easier for state governments to tweak Obamacares rules on how they run their markets, easing the way for more experiments.The draft bill would make the application process for such state innovation waivers easier to complete, but would still require that the state plans cover a similar number of residents and offer insurance with comparable affordability to plans established under the Affordable Care Act.It would allow more Americans to sign up for very high-deductible insurance plans known as catastrophic insurance under the Affordable Care Act.The current law limits those plans to customers under 30 years old, or those who have demonstrated they cannot afford other insurance options.The draft legislation would also ensure that the federal government assigns money for advertising about the Obamacare enrollment period and for hiring professionals to help customers select and sign up for plans; the money would be a portion of the fees it collects from insurers selling plans on HealthCare.gov.The Trump administration had slashed the budget for both programs in August.It does not include one of the industrys biggest requests: funding that would protect insurers from high costs associated with very expensive patients.Insurers and other experts who testified before the Senate health committee said such a program could help substantially lower premiums.But states may be able to use innovation waivers to establish such programs themselves.Alaska has already had such a waiver approved by the Trump administration.The insurers were generally supportive of the plan, and one of the main associations, Americas Health Insurance Plans, came out with a statement in favor of the proposed bill.But some emphasized that the legislation does not fix all of what ails the market.Weve stated repeatedly that the individual market is not stable, said Joseph R. Swedish, the chief executive of Anthem, a large for-profit insurer that offers Blue Cross plans in several states, although he praised lawmakers efforts to provide more certainty in 2019.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The deals prospects in Congress remain uncertain.Though some senators from each party have endorsed its approach, several Republicans have spoken out against it.In the House, a spokesman for Speaker Paul Ryan said that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare.But even if the deal moves forward quickly, it is unlikely to affect next years health plans.Carriers in most states have raised their prices substantially to make up for the canceled federal payments, and there is little time for them to lower them again if the payments are restored.(The draft bill tries to address this problem, by asking states to establish a new rebate program, where carriers who get paid twice would need to pay back the federal government.)For 2018, it probably wont happen in time, said Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor of law at Washington and Lee University, who monitors health legislation closely.The carriers are thinking now about 2019, and its very important for 2019.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Insurance plans for each year go on sale during the prior fall, but the process of devising plans and setting prices begins months earlier.This year, many current insurers announced their exits from the 2018 Obamacare markets months ago, some explicitly naming President Trumps threats about the cost-sharing payments as a reason.Analysts said it was unclear whether the plan might lure reluctant insurers back into the markets, but they said the funding would cause many insurance premiums to fall in 2019.But the lengthy planning process of insurers means that the proposed bills two-year funding cycle could lead to another round of price increases in 2020, if an extension bill isnt passed far in advance.Many insurers had been hoping that the Alexander-Murray legislation would make the funding permanent.While Mr. Trump has insisted he will not support any legislation that he believes to be a bailout to the insurers, policy experts say the insurers are getting only what they are due under the law.Because the insurers set the prices for their 2017 plans assuming they would receive the federal funding, the presidents decision represents more than $1 billion in lost payments, according to a recent analysis from Avalere Health, a consulting firm.The funding has not contributed to outsize profits for the insurers selling individual policies under the law, in spite of Mr. Trumps recent tweet about the insurers who have made a fortune w/ OCare.Most insurance companies have lost money trying to pursue these exchange markets, said Dan Mendelson, Avaleres president.Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are not allowed to pocket more than 20 percent of their premium dollars for overhead and profits.If they earn more, they are required to return the excess to consumers through rebates.The insurers generally lost money in the first three years of the Obamacare market, said Deep Banerjee, an analyst for Standard & Poors, though it appears they were faring better this year, before the cancellation of government payments.It is not a market that has been profitable for them, he said.While there are exceptions, most insurers are making their money in other insurance markets like the government programs Medicare and Medicaid as well as in the much larger employer market.It gives the market some measure of predictability, Mr. Banerjee said, but he emphasized that the legislation is not a permanent solution.Much of what it does is restore the funding that already existed before President Trumps announcement that he was cutting it off.Its not a huge additional support for the market.
Democrats Think Men Have It Easier. Republicans Disagree.:::::Ninety-six percent of respondents say gender equality is important, but they disagree on whether it has been achieved.Half say the country hasnt gone far enough in giving women equal rights, about 40 percent say it has been about right, and 10 percent say it has gone too far.A Partisan Divide on the Benefits of Changing Gender Roles Changing gender roles have made it easier for: REPUBLICANS DEMOCRATS Women to lead satisfying lives Women to be successful at work Families to earn enough to live comfortably Men to lead satisfying lives Parents to raise children Marriages to be successful Men to be successful at work 36% 53% 40% 30% 32% 26% 23% 58% 57% 54% 48% 48% 47% 27% agree Republicans Democrats Women to lead satisfying lives Women to be successful at work Families to earn enough to live comfortably Men to lead satisfying lives Parents to raise children Marriages to be successful Men to be successful at work 36% 53% 40% 30% 32% 26% 23% 58% 57% 54% 48% 48% 47% 27% agree There really is no consensus among the public about whether changing roles have made things better or easier for families or for men and women, said Juliana Horowitz, associate director of research at Pew and an author of the report.Although there are small gender gaps, the partisan divide drives the differences in responses, she said.Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to say changing gender roles had improved peoples lives.College graduates were also more likely than those without college degrees to say that changing gender roles were a good thing, and that more needed to be done.Of college graduates, 69 percent said men had it easier, compared with 27 percent of those with a high school education or less who said so.Seventy-one percent of college graduates said changing gender roles had given women more satisfying lives, compared with 49 percent of those without college degrees.Views about gender equality reflected experiences with gender discrimination, particularly at work.Women, Democrats and college graduates were much more likely to say they were discriminated against because of their gender, and more likely to think gender equality had not gone far enough.Male privilege allows men to be free to move about in public without threat of harassment, a woman, 54, told Pew, which published responses anonymously.When they speak, they are assumed to have some authority without having to prove it.They still earn more money than women.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But Republican men were more likely than Democratic men to say they had experienced discrimination.And while only 10 percent of the public said the country had gone too far toward gender equality, 23 percent of men who said they experienced discrimination said so.The largest shares of both men and women who said they experienced gender discrimination said it came in hiring, pay or promotions.Ten percent of women said they had experienced harassment or catcalling.People who say women have it easier these days say women get preferential treatment in job opportunities, and those who think men have it easier say they have better pay and job opportunities.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When asked how women have it easier, one respondent, a 53-year-old man, said, Lower standards for the same positions in order to get more women for those positions.Another man, 46, said: Everyone is on the prowl for perceived injustice and attempts to elevate women of all ages.Not so much for males.Explaining why men have it easier, a 29-year-old man said, You simply need to look at the percentages of male C.E.O.s and relative salaries to see there is likely a systematic advantage to being male.Women have benefited more than men from being employed and from having men doing more at home, respondents said.But even for women, fewer than half of respondents said changing gender roles had benefited them outside work.This might be because even though most women work and men do more at home, women still shoulder the bulk of the family responsibilities.When asked how its easier to be a man, one respondent, a woman, 65, said: Because most of them dont have to work outside the home and take care of the children and everything else a woman normally does.A womans work is never done.
Googles Founders Wanted to Shape a City. Toronto Is Their Chance.:::::The Sidewalk Labs proposal in the competitive bid for the project floated all kinds of technological dreams: a thermal energy grid that would be carbon neutral, sensors that separate waste from recycling, modular buildings that convert from retail to housing, monitors that track noise and pollution, self-driving transit shuttles, shared-ride taxibots, adaptive traffic lights, delivery robots, heated bike paths and sidewalks that melt snow on their own.In theory, each of these ideas would be best tested across more than just one building or street, and all of them would be more easily implemented together.Once you cover your traffic lights in sensors, its easier to turn them into air-quality monitors, too; as long as youre redesigning streets around driverless cars, you can also think about what the delivery robots need.Photo The prospect of a city designed by technologists, at least as a thought experiment until now, has made some nervous, urbanists especially.The tech industry is better known in its Silicon Valley backyard for contributing to rather than solving urban problems like unaffordable housing and traffic.And its corporate campuses are mostly models of how not to build cities, with mega office parks (and spaceship designs) dependent on cars and detached from their neighboring communities.Theres no small contradiction in having tech founders muse about how to build better cities from places that bear little resemblance to lively cities at all.The tech industry also thrives by working in ways that can be incompatible with public-sector city building.Its hard to move fast and break things in government, and public funds dont allow for the failure rates that venture capital does.New tech products are often targeted to early adopters, and they spread to the rest of us later.But you cant do that with innovations in public service; if the tech savvy get the nicer bus routes or the new Wi-Fi kiosks first, that raises equity issues for the rest of the city.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Theres also the hitch that cities are inherently organic and unpredictable.They resist omniscient engineering.And past efforts at doing that whether through the urban renewal of individual neighborhoods or the wholesale development of utopias have invariably failed for that reason.Many intractable urban problems are in fact not engineering problems at all, including the ones that most look like it.Housing is very expensive in a place like San Francisco not because we havent developed the right engineering methods to build it more cheaply.Unaffordable housing is largely a political problem we havent developed the societal consensus to build enough of it.Sidewalk Labs, to its credit, has internalized many of these criticisms.The company, formed by Google two years ago, has pointedly been based in New York City and not Silicon Valley.Its staffed by both technologists and government alums.Its leader, the former New York City deputy mayor Dan Doctoroff, openly acknowledges the gulf between technologists and city government types.And Sidewalk Labs says it wants to bridge the two.Photo We all collectively see cities as about friction: good friction and bad friction, Mr. Doctoroff told me not long after Sidewalk Labs started.Good friction is serendipity, its opportunity, its diversity, its seeing 40 different nationalities on the subway as you commute in the morning.Bad friction is congestion, its pollution.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The technologists temptation may be to try to build a city from scratch, with none of that friction.And especially without the greatest friction of all, politics.In Toronto, Sidewalk Labs is looking at something between a blank slate and New York City: a sizable plot of land to develop thats still part of a city large enough that any successful ideas could ultimately spread.Because its looking at a neighborhood and not just a typical developers parcel, Sidewalk Labs can play with all the infrastructure that connects those parcels the utility grid, the street network, the sidewalks.But there would be no point in doing all that if there werent thousands of people nearby ready to move in, as is the case in rapidly growing Toronto.(Google also announced Tuesday that it would move its Canadian headquarters, which are in Toronto, into the first pilot phase of the development.)The challenge now amid all the carbon-neutral, internet-enabled robot-monitor sensors will be to keep those humans in mind.
Trumps Attack on Insurer Gravy Train Could Actually Help a Lot of Consumers:::::The insurer-regulator hack will mean that navigating the Obamacare marketplace will be more complicated for consumers (more on that later).And the change will cost taxpayers more money perhaps $21 billion more in 2018 alone.But, in the end, most customers will be unharmed by the presidents decision, and a substantial fraction will be better off, able to buy plans for about the same price they pay now, yet with lower deductibles.The presidents move was to cut off a form of Obamacare funding known as the cost-sharing reduction subsidies.Those were payments the government made to health insurers to compensate them for lowering the deductibles and co-payments for low-income customers.But he didnt cut off another, more important form of subsidy.The Affordable Care Act also includes tax credits that help low- and middle-income Americans pay their insurance premiums.Those tax credits increase in value along with the price of a certain midlevel insurance plan, known as silver.If you qualify for a subsidy, you can never be asked to pay more for that plan than a set fraction of your income.Insurers in more than 40 states have decided to compensate for the missing cost-sharing subsidies by making hefty increases to the prices of this silver plan but small or no increases to their other plans.Consumers who qualify for subsidies are still asked to pay the same fraction of their income toward a health plan, and the federal government pays the insurers the rest of the higher silver-plan premium.So consumers are no worse off, and insurers make up for the loss of the cost-sharing subsidies canceled by Mr. Trump.And for many Obamacare consumers, theres also a silver lining in these pricier silver plans.There are other kinds of plans being sold on the marketplace: high-deductible plans called bronze and low-deductible plans called gold and platinum.Consumers can use their subsidy to buy any color plan they like.And, with the price of silver plans rising faster than the other categories, most consumers with subsidies will now be able to buy a lower-deductible health plan for the same price as the silver plans that are currently most popular on the exchanges.(They can also choose to buy high-deductible bronze plans for very low prices, or in some cases get them free.)This was a backdoor, unintended way of increasing premium subsidies for some people, said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group.The new pricing structure is the worst for people who earn too much to qualify for a subsidy those earning more than four times the federal poverty level, or about $100,000 a year for a family of four.But most of them will also be protected from the cost increases.If they avoid silver plans sold on the Obamacare marketplaces in most states, they can find plans that dont have the special, Trump-prompted increases.That means that unsubsidized customers who want to buy silver plans will probably need to shop outside of HealthCare.gov, through a human or online broker.Or they can buy a bronze, gold or platinum plan.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its a convoluted kludge of a workaround, said David Anderson, a research associate at the Duke University Margolis Center for Health Policy, who has looked closely at how carriers are pricing their plans.But Mr. Anderson said he thought the upside was strong enough that Congress should abandon its efforts to restore the canceled subsidies.A lot of people are going to see during open enrollment that they are going to be able to afford a better plan with lower deductibles and lower premiums than they could this year, he said.There are still downsides.It is possible that insurers, worried about the lost payments and thin on trust for the federal government, will flee the markets before the enrollment period starts at the beginning of next month.But no major insurer departures have been announced since the president announced his decision on Thursday.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.There are a few states where insurance regulators didnt allow insurers to increase only their silver plan prices.In those states, subsidized customers will be held harmless but no one will get a cheaper gold plan, and unsubsidized customers will face price increases.There are some states where there is no individual market outside the Obamacare marketplace, and in those places, unsubsidized customers wont be able to get a good deal on a silver plan (though they can still buy another color plan).Perhaps the biggest problem: Shopping for a plan is going to be harder.Many Obamacare customers who just renew this years plan will be passing up a better deal, and many scared of initial sticker shock may not realize there are cheaper options.In addition to eliminating the cost-sharing reduction subsidies, President Trumps administration has also cut back on funds for advertising about the marketplaces and on professionals who help customers sign up.(The Alexander-Murray deal would restore much of that funding, but probably not soon enough to make a big difference.)Its hard, said Lori Lodes, a former Obama administration official and co-founder of a new nonprofit group, Get America Covered, focused on helping spread the word about Obamacare enrollment.She says she worries about growing consumer confusion: My biggest concern is really I do not believe that the administration will educate people about this, and so there is going to be an information gap.But the Congressional Budget Office, when considering the effects of ending the cost-sharing subsidies a few months ago, concluded that, over time, the strategy of raising the price of only silver plans would become widespread, and that consumers would figure it out.It estimated that, by 2020, a world with no cost-sharing reductions would be a world with fewer uninsured Americans.The increased subsidies would make purchasing nongroup insurance more attractive for some people, increasing sign-ups, the report said.Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murrays newly announced proposal would fund the payments for two years, increase advertising for the marketplaces and make it easier for states to experiment on how they run their insurance markets.Mr. Trump has indicated that he might sign such a bill.But the deal, even if it does pass Congress, comes too late to affect insurance prices for next year.In 2018, at least, we will be living in a world of high-priced silver plans.Luckily for those who need insurance, that may not turn out as badly as many people had feared.
How a Healthy Economy Can Shorten Life Spans:::::Its a different story with agricultural economies.The Cutler, Huang and Lleras-Muney study, published as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, found that mortality rates fall when such economies are growing.Before 1945, when agriculture was more dominant in the United States economy, growth was not associated with rising mortality either.Photo Other research published in the journal Health Economics supports the pollution hypothesis.In their analysis of the Great Recession in Europe, Jos Tapia Granados of Drexel University and Edward Ionides of the University of Michigan found that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a one percent lower mortality rate for respiratory illnesses, as well as reductions in mortality for cardiovascular disease and heart conditions, which are known to be sensitive to air pollution.In countries where the recession was more severe the Baltic States, Spain, Greece and Slovenia respiratory disease mortality fell 16 percent during 2007-2010, compared with just a 3.2 percent decline in the four years preceding the recession.Other factors contribute to rising mortality during expansions.Occupational hazards and stress can directly harm health through work.Some studies find that alcohol and tobacco consumption increases during booms, too.Both are associated with higher death rates.Also, employed people drive more, increasing mortality from auto accidents.During recessions, people without jobs may have more time to sleep and exercise and may eat more healthfully.One study found that higher unemployment is associated with lower rates of obesity, increased physical activity and a better diet.On the other hand, suicides increase during economic downturns.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Some recent work suggests that economic booms may have become less deadly and busts more so in recent years.This could be a result of less polluting production in modern, expanding economies, or of better medical care for those with conditions sensitive to pollution.Safer roads and cars, and less driving under the influence of alcohol and other substances, could also play a role.Its also possible that opioids and other drugs may have made recessions more harmful to health than they used to be, Mr. Cutler said.Other analysis shows that although smaller economic booms increase mortality, larger ones decrease it.Japans economic booms in the 1960s and 1970s are associated with longer life spans there, for example.Serious and lengthy downturns like the Great Depression are associated with shorter lives, even as smaller ones lengthen them.Wealthier nations are healthier nations, an effect seen across generations.People in their formative years children and teenagers are particularly sensitive to the economic environment.Conditions in utero can have lasting health and economic effects.Graduating from college during a recession can depress ones earnings for a decade.People growing up during a strong economy are more likely to have access to resources and to develop skills and opportunities that promote health.These benefits can last a lifetime, increasing longevity.In total, theres little question that long-term economic growth broadly improves the human condition.But not everyone enjoys the gains equally.In the short run, economic expansions can cut short the lives of some.
Is Uber Helping or Hurting Mass Transit?:::::In new survey data, though, there are some provocative patterns.Researchers at the U.C.Davis Institute of Transportation Studies surveyed 2,000 people about their travel behavior in seven major metro areas, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and including people who live in their suburbs and those who dont use these services.Photo The results suggest that ride-hailing draws people away from public transit.And the authors, Regina Clewlow and Gouri Shankar Mishra, estimate that 49 percent to 61 percent of ride-hailing trips either wouldnt have been made at all if these apps didnt exist, or would have been made by foot, biking or transit.All of those trips, in other words, added cars to the road that otherwise wouldnt have been there.That picture implies that Uber and the like could make traffic worse.And lets further assume that many of those trips additionally require drivers to cruise around waiting for rides, and to deadhead occasionally after the rides are over (to return to, say, the airport with an empty back seat).Among people who use these apps, 3 percent said they rode heavy rail like subway systems more since starting to ride-hail.Thats consistent with the idea that apps could help you travel the last mile home from the train if you dont live near a stop, or that they could help you cobble together transportation options once you ditch your own car.But 6 percent said they rode the bus less, and 3 percent said the same of light rail.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Among the most common reasons people gave for turning away from transit: Service was too slow or unreliable.It potentially does not bode well for public transit, then, that just as these apps are growing more dominant, transit systems in cities like New York, Washington and San Francisco are facing deep problems.In New York, where other data has also suggested that ride-hailing lures riders away from public transit, officials have speculated about Ubers role in recent declining subway ridership.Austin, Tex., offers another intriguing case study.In May 2016, Uber and Lyft temporarily pulled out of the city over a new law that required the companies to submit drivers to fingerprint background checks.Their departure created a natural experiment, and afterward researchers at the University of Michigan, Texas A&M and Columbia University surveyed Austin residents about how the change affected their travel behavior.Asked about the last trip riders took with Uber and Lyft, 3 percent said they took similar trips afterward by public transit instead (Austin has much lower transit usage in general than New York).That also implies some substitution.Further complicating this picture, 9 percent said they bought a personal car as a result of the change.The bulk of the evidence so far shows that these services dont inherently make transportation more efficient at the level of an entire city, even if they have the potential to.They may make your travel more efficient, because you dont have to hunt for a parking spot or wait for the bus.But when you aggregate the behavior of many people, transportation becomes less efficient when transit riders switch to cars, when new car services entice people onto trips they wouldnt otherwise have taken, or when people who give up their cars wind up traveling even more in someone elses.Its equally not preordained that these apps will make traffic worse, or that they must come at the expense of public transit.If more people left their solo cars for car-pooled ride-hailing, rather than leaving public buses for solo Uber rides, that would reduce the number of cars on the road and the miles they travel.If transit agencies partnered with these companies, as some have begun to try doing, ride-hailing could fill niches that trains and buses dont handle well, like late-night journeys, transit for riders with disabilities, and suburban service.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Theres this potential opportunity for policy makers, city planners and these firms themselves to find solutions where were steering toward that future, Ms. Clewlow said.Its unlikely well get there by chance, though.
Frustrated with the Russia investigation, Trump demands Democrats and Hillary Clinton face more scrutiny:::::On Sunday morning, President Trump expressed frustration that his campaign is under investigation over possible ties to Russia's plot to influence the 2016 election but that his former opponent Hillary Clinton is not facing the same level of scrutiny.In four tweets sent over 24 minutes, Trump wrote: Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?), the Uranium to Russia deal, the 33,000 plus deleted Emails, the Comey fix and so much more.Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia, 'collusion,' which doesn't exist.The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics, but the R's are now fighting back like never before.There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out.DO SOMETHING!The tweets came as CNN has continued to report that on Friday a federal grand jury in Washington approved the first charges in the investigation led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, citing sources briefed on the matter.The charges are sealed, and it's unclear who could be charged and for what.The history of the dossier Trump referenced is a complicated one.During the 2016 Republican primaries, the conservative Washington Free Beacon paid the Washington firm Fusion GPS to investigate Trump's background and, eventually, his business ties to Russia, The Washington Post reported Friday.The publication receives financial support from billionaire GOP donor Paul Singer, according to two people familiar with Singer, whose firm did not respond to requests seeking comment.Fusion GPS is an opposition research firm run by ex-journalists, but how is it connected to the Trump dossier, Donald Trump Jr.'s Trump Tower meeting and the 2016 election?The Fact Checker's Glenn Kessler explains.(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) After the Free Beacon stopped paying Fusion GPS, the research firm offered in April 2016 to continue researching Trump for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, The Post reported last week.According to that reporting, Fusion GPS then hired Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community, who compiled a 35-page dossier on Trump.Brian Fallon, a former spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said he learned about Steele and the dossier after the election.People familiar with the matter said the Clinton campaign and the DNC did not direct Steeles activities.It's unclear how much the Clinton campaign and DNC paid for the information.The Clinton campaign paid Perkins Coie $5.6 million in legal fees from June 2015 to December 2016, according to campaign finance records cited by The Post, and the DNC paid the firm $3.6 million in legal and compliance consulting since November 2015 though its impossible to tell from the filings how much of that work was for other legal matters and how much of it related to Fusion GPS.It's unclear how Trump arrived at the $12 million figure used in his tweets.[Trump and Republicans steer Russia probes in new directions] When it comes to the Uranium to Russia deal that Trump referenced in his tweet, House and Senate Republican leaders have already announced two investigations into decisions made during the Obama administration, when Clinton was secretary of state, involving a uranium deal that increased Russias share of the U.S. nuclear market.At the same time, the House Oversight Committee has launched a probe into the Clinton email investigation that will examine, among other things, why then-FBI Director James B. Comey publicly announced that the bureau was investigating Clinton but then waited months before making a similar announcement about its inquiries into the Trump campaign.Democrats have argued that these investigations are intended to distract from the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
As Russia case unfolds, Trump and Republicans go to battle with Clinton and Democrats:::::President Trump issued four tweets over 24 minutes Sunday, attacking special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs probe as unfair and citing various Hillary Clinton controversies that he said warranted investigation.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Tensions between Republicans and Democrats over the investigation of Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election intensified Sunday, with President Trump demanding to know why his campaign is under federal scrutiny while his former opponent Hillary Clinton is not.The presidents latest outburst over the inquiry led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III surfaced on Twitter as his administration braced for the possibility that the first batch of charges in the case could be publicly announced as soon as Monday.CNN reported that a federal grand jury had approved an indictment, although details of the possible charges and the name of a defendant remained unclear.Trump issued four tweets over 24 minutes, attacking the Mueller probe as unfair and citing various Clinton controversies that he said warranted investigation.Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia, collusion, which doesnt exist, the president said.The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics, but the Rs are now fighting back like never before.There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out.DO SOMETHING!Later in the morning, Trump added: All of this Russia talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform.Is this coincidental?NOT!Fusion GPS is an opposition research firm run by ex-journalists, but how is it connected to the Trump dossier, Donald Trump Jr.'s Trump Tower meeting and the 2016 election?The Fact Checker's Glenn Kessler explains.(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) On Sunday talk shows, Republicans rallied around Trump and questioned how CNN could have received information about secret grand jury proceedings.There are very, very strict laws on grand jury secrecy, so depending on who leaked this to CNN, thats a criminal violation, potentially, New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie (R), a longtime friend of Trumps, said on CNNs State of the Union on Sunday.For us to have confidence in this process, weve got to make sure that the grand jury process remains confidential, remains secret, so that the special counsel can work effectively to be able to get to the bottom of all that hes looking into.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) cast doubt on the objectivity of Muellers team, noting that the prosecutors staff includes a lot of individuals, attorneys who played in politics, whove given money on the Democratic side.Of the eight attorneys on the team who have been publicly identified, four made donations to Democrats, including President Barack Obama and Clinton.This president won the election solely on the idea that he connected with the American people.No other influence involved, McCarthy said on Foxs Sunday Morning Futures.But the idea of what Ive watched, of what the Democrats have been doing, it sure raises a lot of questions.Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, came to Muellers defense and said that he doesnt agree with Republicans who are calling for Mueller to resign or stop his investigation.I would encourage my Republican friends give the guy a chance to do his job, Gowdy said on Fox News Sunday.The result will be known by the facts, by what he uncovers....I would say give the guy a chance to do his job.Democratic lawmakers mostly stayed out of the Sunday fray after a week in which Clintons 2016 campaign came under fresh scrutiny.The campaign funded political opposition research into Trump that helped create a highly publicized dossier on the Republican candidate and fueled some allegations now under scrutiny by Mueller.House Republicans have announced a probe into a deal involving U.S. uranium reached under the Obama administration in 2010.Heres what you need to know.(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) The 35-page dossier is composed of 17 memos containing raw intelligence, some of it highly salacious and not independently confirmed.It relies on Kremlin-linked sources and alleges that the Russian government had been trying to support Trumps candidacy while gathering compromising information that could be used as blackmail.The dossier was published in full by BuzzFeed in January.Its unclear how much the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee paid for the opposition research by Fusion GPS, a Washington firm that conducts investigations for private clients.The Clinton campaign paid $5.6 million in legal fees to a law firm from June 2015 to December 2016, according to campaign finance records, and the DNC paid the firm $3.6 million in legal and compliance consulting since November 2015.Its impossible to tell from the filings how much of that work was for other legal matters and how much of it related to Fusion GPS.Trump tweeted Sunday morning that the dossier, which he called Clinton made Fake Dossier, could have cost as much as $12 million, although he did not explain how he reached that number.Compiled by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele, the dossier mirrors a separate conclusion reached by U.S. intelligence agencies that the Russian government intervened in the U.S. election in an effort to bolster Trump and harm Clinton, such as through hacking the DNC and distributing materials to WikiLeaks to publish at key moments.Fusion GPS, which hired Steele to gather information, was first employed to investigate Trump during the Republican primaries by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication that receives financial support from billionaire GOP donor Paul Singer, according to two people familiar with Singer.The Beacon said in a statement that its research ended before Fusion GPS hired Steele and that none of the research that it commissioned is included in the dossier.In April 2016, an attorney representing Clintons presidential campaign and the DNC hired Fusion GPS, which then hired Steele.Brian Fallon, a former spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said he learned about Steele and the dossier after the election.People familiar with the matter told The Washington Post that the Clinton campaign and the DNC did not direct Steeles activities.Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said Sunday that a lot of the information in the dossier has been corroborated.I certainly would have liked to know who paid for it earlier, but nonetheless, thats just one factor to be considered, Schiff said on ABCs This Week on Sunday.It doesnt answer the ultimate question, which is: How much of the work is accurate?How much of it is true?And my colleagues dont seem particularly interested in that question, but that is really the most important question for the American people.Schiff said he has not been told anything about any impending indictments in Muellers investigation, noting that such notification would not have been appropriate.Trump also tweeted Sunday about Clintons involvement in what he called the Uranium to Russia deal, demanding that the matter receive greater scrutiny.The 2010 deal approved by the Obama administration while Clinton was secretary of state allowed a Russian nuclear energy agency to acquire a controlling stake in a Canadian-based company that had mining licenses for about 20 percent of U.S. uranium extraction capacity.The company cannot export the uranium.Earlier this month, House and Senate Republican leaders announced they would investigate the uranium deal, and the House Oversight Committee launched a probe into how the FBI investigated Clinton during the campaign.In the latter investigation, Republicans say they want to know why then-FBI Director James B. Comey publicly announced that the bureau was investigating Clinton but waited months before making a similar announcement about its inquiries into the Trump campaign.Ed OKeefe, Glenn Kessler and Karoun Demirjian contributed to this report.
Africa trip illustrates Haleys trusted, unusually direct relationship with Trump:::::U.S.Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley visited South Sudan and delivered a "harsh message" to the nation's President Salva Kiir.(Reuters) U.S.Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley visited South Sudan and delivered a "harsh message" to the nation's President Salva Kiir.(Reuters) JUBA, South Sudan President Trump had a message more like an ultimatum for the leader of this flailing, violence-torn African nation, a man who largely owes his position and the very existence of his country to the United States.But he didnt turn to the ostensible top U.S. diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, to deliver the message.Instead, the messenger was Nikki Haley.I basically said the United States had invested well over $11 billion in South Sudan and into him, and that we were now questioning that investment, Haley, the tough-talking U.N. ambassador, said last week about her one-on-one discussion with South Sudanese President Salva Kiir.Her diplomatic mission to Africa which included visits to desperate refugee camps that more than once brought Haley to tears illustrated in stark terms her trusted position and unusually direct relationship with the president.Trump routinely talks with her about matters of world affairs even as policy differences over Iran, Afghanistan and other issues have tested his relationship with Tillerson.Haley said she had spoken with Trump during the trip and plans to conduct a fuller debriefing with him and Vice President Pence in person early this week.She said she would provide Tillerson an in-person readout of her trip if schedules allowed.U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley meets South Sudanese refugee children at the Nguenyyiel refugee camp in Gambella Region, Ethiopia October 24, 2017.(Tiksa Negeri/Reuters) I think that Ill give options, and if asked Ill give the recommendation about next moves for U.S. policy in the three sub-Saharan nations she visited, Haley said.And she expects to be asked.Usually the presidents very good at that, she said.[Haley tells leader of troubled S. Sudan that U.S. policy is at a crossroads] Haleys prominent role in the Trumps administration as a kind of shadow secretary of state has led to widespread speculation that the former South Carolina governor, who has no prior experience in foreign policy, could be in line to replace Tillerson a job she insisted she does not want during a joint interview with The Washington Post and Reuters.Her rise has also put her on many Republicans shortlist as a potential presidential or vice presidential candidate.Haley denies any immediate ambitions, even as she does not hide her political instincts.I cannot even imagine it, she said at the idea of running for the White House.In explaining her new diplomatic role, Haley regularly invokes her statehouse experience in Columbia, S.C., saying the haggling and strategizing of electoral politics made her a better negotiator.Haleys former pollster is a top adviser and accompanied her to Africa.When youre a governor youre very results-oriented and youre always looking at what that final level needs to be.When I look at this administration, the results are there, Haley said early in the trip.People may not like the way he gets to the results, which I think is really, its more of a communication thing.U.N.Ambassador Nikki Haley visited a U.N. aid camp in Juba, South Sudan Oct. 25.This anti-government protest caused her to cut the visit short.(The Washington Post) Haley was late to support Trump and backed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) in the Republican primary.But as part of his administration, Haley frequently serves as Trumps chief messenger and interpreter on foreign policy.She used a September address to the conservative American Enterprise Institute to telegraph the strategy Trump adopted a month later in refusing to endorse the U.N.-backed international nuclear deal with Iran.She used another address to the conservative Heritage Foundation this month to cheer the presidents decision as prudent and Reaganesque.Tillerson and other top Trump national security aides had argued against undermining a deal they see as flawed but valuable.[Would Haley replace Tillerson at State?She says no] As Trump does, Haley also cites economic markers such as a soaring stock market as evidence of achievement and highlights national security successes in combating the Islamic State.If you take out the personality, take out the person, look at the results and you cant deny it, you cant deny it, she said in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the first stop in Africa last week.At the end of the trip, Haley tweeted a picture of her caressing a young child and wrote: With no education, abducted as child soldiers, young girls raped ...We cant take our eyes off the children of S. Sudan & DRC.#FutureLeaders.Tillerson, who was also traveling on a diplomatic mission last week, does not use Twitter.Neither he nor Haley do much to mask a sometimes chilly relationship, although both say they work in tandem.Haley has broad license to speak on Trumps behalf at the U.N., which has occasionally led to grumbling from Tillersons allies and others, saying that she strays from her lane.[Haley presents a road map for Trump to back away from Iran nuclear deal ] She said she is not bound to a strict set of talking points dictated from Washington, whether in her discussions with other U.N. diplomats or on the road.It goes back to the original conversation we had when he asked me to do this, it really does, because I didnt want to leave being governor to go recite talking points, Haley said of Trump.I can think for myself, I can do for myself.I am very aware of who I work for and very aware of the national security team and Im very aware of doing everything in the best interests of the United States and for peace and security around the world, and Im very careful with how I use that flexibility, she said.And credit goes to the president, she continued.When I go, he says, go do.I dont go and go off the reserve or anything like that.The deaths of four American soldiers in an ambush in Niger earlier in October lent an immediacy to Haleys larger goal of highlighting what she calls the risk of terrorists, some displaced from the Middle East, finding a new foothold in Africa.She met with the leaders of each nation she visited Ethiopia, South Sudan and Congo and insisted that reporters traveling with her could see at least part of each meeting.In Ethiopia, that meant intervening with security agents attempting to keep the American press at bay.[Haley urges Congo leader to hold elections so or risk international backlash] That each of the strongmen agreed to receive her suggests that they knew she was Trumps direct envoy, no matter her title.And what the leaders heard was a channeling and repackaging of Trump.Her public warnings about the limits of American patience, funding and diplomatic support were an unmistakable, if softer, reference to Trumps America First message.And her impassioned pledges to help people displaced by war gave an empathetic face to a Trump foreign policy marked by suspicion of U.S. engagement abroad.With Kiir, Haley said she brought along photographs of suffering refugees she had visited the day before at an Ethiopian camp where she heard harrowing personal stories of rape and murder.Kiir did not deny the atrocities attributed to his soldiers, she said.These are firm, candid conversations for a reason, Haley said in the Post interview Friday in Kinshasa, Congo, her last stop in Africa.We dont care about what they say and how pretty they say it, Haley said of her talks with African leaders.We care about what they do and how effective it is.That balance-sheet message is a familiar one for Haley, who has tried with some success to shake up moribund U.N. institutions and demand greater accountability.She frequently dangles the threat of cutbacks in U.S. funding, as Trump also did during his address to the U.N. General Assembly last month.[Nikki Haley and the tragedy of South Sudan] If the tense sessions in guarded government compounds were the meat of her trip, Haleys three visits to refugee and civilian protection camps were the emotional heart.She toured huts, schools, a haven for traumatized women, another for traumatized former child soldiers and a women-run bakery.She hugged rape survivors and delivered polio vaccines.She asked grinning kids how old they were and was startled to learn that they did not reliably know the answer.In one of the camps, Haley walked past signs proclaiming Trump a peacemaker and protector.In another, signs implored Haley to take messages of heartbreak and political frustration home to Washington.If she saw those messages, Haley gave no sign.But the sight of aimless children milling in the U.N.-assisted camps brought Haley to tears.Each camp housed desperate people who say they cannot go home.Living in the camps can mean children are schooled irregularly or not at all.Their parents have little opportunity to work, and the childrens chances may be no better.Haley noted that those bleak prospects may also make these uprooted children susceptible to extremist ideology.And in that, she closed the loop between an impulse to help for the sake of helping and the Trumpian mandate to keep U.S. interests paramount.Those kids will be 18 one day.Theyll be an adult.And theyll be an uneducated adult with no social skills that will have resented the fact that they were put in that situation, Haley said.And thats dangerous for the United States and thats dangerous for the world.
Republicans, desperate for a win, already face setbacks as they prepare to unveil tax bill this week:::::Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.)listens to President Trump at the White House September.The Houses chief tax writer will enter the spotlight this week, when he unveils Republican tax legislation.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) The Republican effort to overhaul the tax code suffered a bruising setback over the weekend when a powerful corporate interest group came out against the proposal just days ahead of House leaders plan to release it to the public.The National Association of Home Builders, after learning that a homeownership tax credit it had wanted will not be in an initial version of the bill, is preparing a nationwide campaign against it.The development underscored just how difficult the prospect of a successful tax overhaul will be, given the complex and competing interests that President Trump and GOP lawmakers are trying to serve.We will do everything we can to defeat this thing, said Jerry Howard, chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders.Trump and Republicans have cast the measure as a once-in-a-generation rewrite of the federal tax code, one they say will stimulate the economy, create millions of jobs and give voters a reason to stick with their party in next years midterm elections.Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is scheduled to reveal the bill Wednesday.For the president and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), the stakes couldnt be higher.With the approach of the end of their first year controlling the White House and Congress, and the failure of health-care legislation still fresh, Republicans are desperate to post a win before next years midterm election cycle begins in earnest.By many of their own accounts, failure to pass tax legislation could lead to an electoral bloodbath, and the end of Ryans political career, in 2018.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Oct. 25 compared the tax reform process to whitewater rafting.and said it's about to hit "Class V rapids."(Reuters) [Paul Ryan begins a make-or-break push for tax legislation and his future] Much of the pressure, and spotlight, will fall on Brady.A bare-pated, unfailingly sunny former Chamber of Commerce executive who is largely unknown outside of Washington after 20 years on Capitol Hill, Bradys challenge is to build consensus while fellow Republican lawmakers, corporate lobbyists and perhaps even Trump himself pick the bill apart.Ryan and Brady had been hoping to stave off corporate defections as long as possible, arguing that the plans benefits to the economy would outweigh the loss of any industry-specific tax break.But a decision to roll back key itemized deductions has already alienated the home builders as well as the National Association of Realtors, both major lobbying forces on Capitol Hill.Home builders are considered among the most politically influential groups, as they play a large role in the local economy for virtually every congressional district and contribute millions to political campaigns.Lawmakers have frequently leaned in whatever direction the home builders have taken.Howard and Bradys aides spent weeks working together to add to the bill a homeownership tax credit, which essentially would have replaced the mortgage-interest and property-tax deductions, combining both benefits into a new tax credit.Howard said home builders like other parts of the tax plan, such as tax cuts for businesses and lower rates for many families.But he feared that other changes could tip the housing industry into a recession.He was particularly concerned about ideas to eliminate the federal deduction for state and local taxes and doubling the standard deduction, which could remove incentives for all but the very wealthy to deduct their mortgage interest and have a chilling effect on homeownership.The homeownership credit had some buy-in from the White House and congressional tax writers, but leaders including Ryan were wary of threatening the bills passage by reneging on a pledge they had made for weeks to scores of lawmakers, according to a person familiar with the negotiations that the mortgage-interest deduction would remain intact.A look at what President Trump has promised Americans as it relates to his tax reform plan.(Joyce Koh/The Washington Post) Chairman Brady and his staff and [NAHB] worked hours and hours on it and we were very excited about that concept, and all of the sudden on Friday we were told that concept would no longer be considered, Howard said.After Brady and Ryan communicated that the changes would not be made, top NAHB officials held an emergency conference call Saturday and agreed unanimously to oppose the bill after months of reserving judgment, a spokesman for the organization said.Now, the group is preparing a public campaign against the bill, with plans to mobilize members in congressional districts across the country.Brady, in a statement, said the homeownership tax credit could still be added, but the advocates will have to make the case directly to lawmakers.Republicans also appear poised to limit what American workers will be allowed to contribute pretax to their retirement plans a change that stands to generate strong opposition.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) suggested Sunday in a television interview that the GOP is instead looking to increase the limit on post-tax contributions as a substitute.Currently, Americans can contribute up to $18,000 a year in pretax income to a 401(k).Those contributions are later taxed when withdrawn in retirement.But the GOP plan appears poised to reduce the pretax contribution limit and increase limits allowed to post-tax accounts.Withdrawals from those accounts are not taxed, meaning the federal government would gain revenue in the short term as a greater portion of initial savings is taxed but lose revenue in the long term.McCarthy suggested that the GOP plan would be a boon to middle-class savers.Well expand the amount you can invest, but well also give you an option to not be taxed later in life, not to have that tax burden hanging over you but actually have more income in the future, he said on Fox News Channels Sunday Morning Futures.Other setbacks could quickly follow.The commercial real-estate industry is wary of a proposal to eliminate or scale back the deductibility of corporate interest payments.Democrats, meanwhile, have not been closely consulted on the bill, and few, if any, are expected to support it.This will be a roller coaster, said Rohit Kumar, a former top domestic policy aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who is now a tax lobbyist for PwC, the accounting and consulting firm.Any major piece of legislation has its brush-with-death moment, and sometimes more than one.But the overriding imperative here is to get a tax bill to the presidents desk and to do so as quickly as possible.Negotiators released a broad framework in September, calling for lower individual and corporate rates, elimination of most itemized deductions and an increase in the standard deduction.But the legislation has been kept unusually close for months, and even members of the Ways and Means Committee said last week that they were unaware of how key provisions would work.We have no details, said Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.).All anyone wants to talk about, especially the business people and so forth, is the tax reform.And I cant tell them anything, because I have no details....Ive been very frustrated that all I can say is, Its going to be good for the economy.The gravity of the task is not lost on Brady, 62, who has led the committee since Ryan left the post two years ago to become speaker.Central to the challenge has been making hard choices about which tax breaks to eliminate to make way for the rate cuts that the GOP has promised.On Saturday, Brady gave ground on the planned elimination of the federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes a provision that had put Republican House members from New York, New Jersey, California and other high-tax states on edge agreeing to maintain a deduction for property taxes but not for income or sales taxes.Youre going to have to have give and take, and I think Kevins strength is that he understands that and is able to pivot and move forward and just keep pivoting and keep moving forward, said former representative Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican who chaired the Ways and Means Committee from 2011 until 2015 and released his own blueprint for comprehensive tax reform shortly before his retirement.He will have an incredible amount of say on many, many issues.But even if youre chairman, you still only have one vote.Inside the committee, the drafting process has unfolded behind closed doors over the course of months.Recently, the pace has quickened, with panel members spending long hours inside a Longworth House Office Building conference room hashing out the plan.Identifying Bradys personal stamp on the tax bill could be difficult.He has been a relentless advocate for pro-growth measures which largely refer to business provisions meant to goose investment.But he has taken little personal ownership of any particular aspect.Bradys test, GOP observers say, is melding the various pieces into a cohesive whole and persuading fellow Republicans to back it.He has a lot more patience than most people, said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.).This has gone on for years ...but to get to this point where were actually putting pen to paper and then to get everyone on the same page?Its been a tremendous effort.A Ways and Means member, Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), recalled pitching an esoteric plan for business-tax deductions that he thought should be incorporated into the tax bill at one of the recent closed-door committee sessions.The idea seemed brilliant, in Schweikerts recollection.But then Brady started asking questions.And not long afterward, Schweikert withdrew his idea and the debate quickly moved along.Thanks to Bradys soft touch, he said, he understood the decision.I dont know of many members here who could handle the ideological or even the temperamental range thats in the room, Schweikert said.Instead of saying, Thats a dumb idea, or, No, Ive got to get you back over here, its, Lets walk through that.How would that work?How would you enforce that?To the public at large, the push for the tax overhaul has largely been identified with Ryan, who has repeatedly said he was dragged kicking and screaming from his coveted Ways and Means post to the speakers office.And Ryan remains a consequential figure who has worked in tandem with Brady to sell the bill to the public.While Brady has become a more familiar presence on cable news, he has yet to step into the public spotlight the way one of his predecessors did a generation ago, when then-Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) went on national TV in 1985 asking Americans to write Rosty to demand tax reform generating tens of thousands of replies that helped build momentum for bipartisan legislation that passed a year later.The Senate is expected to start its own process of drafting a tax bill soon after the House text is released.The stakes will be high for Senate Republicans, too notably McConnell.Bradys counterpart in the Senate, Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), has already cemented a reputation as a monumental figure over four decades of service.But for Brady, guiding a bill of this level of ambition through the House and into law could thrust him into the congressional annals.Hopefully, I contributed a serious, collaborative effort to get to this single, unified tax reform plan, he said.Having the architectural designs, the meetings, discussions, I think was helpful to everybody....I want people to know where were going, why, and to get their engagement when were doing it.Read more at PowerPost Ed OKeefe contributed to this report.
A cyclist flipped off Trumps motorcade and entered the annals of presidential protests:::::A cyclist and Trump's motorcade in Sterling on Saturday.(Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images) The departure of President Trumps motorcade from his Sterling, Va., golf club on Saturday afternoon was chronicled as dutifully and minutely as the retreat of some great army.The president left Trump National Golf Club at 3:12 p.m. after spending the day there on the edge of the Potomac River.A thick column of black SUVs escorted Trump past two pedestrians, a Guardian reporter wrote in a pool report one of whom gave a thumbs down sign.Then it overtook a female cyclist, wearing a white top and cycling helmet, who responded by giving the middle finger.The cyclist was photographed for posterity.So was an IMPEACH sign held aloft outside the golf club that day.On Twitter, Voice of America reporter Steve Herman offered his account as eyewitness to the following events: The cyclist flipped off @POTUS a second time when the motorcade halted at the traffic light, he wrote.No, we do not know her name.Nor does anyone know if Trump, behind bulletproof windows, had seen either of the cyclists streetside salutes.But with knowns and unknowns thus established, the world set about interpreting a middle fingers significance.Newsweek wrote, perhaps speculatively, that to flip off the president of the United States seemed to be the cyclists single-minded goal.[People cant stop being inspired by this fake clip of a little girl insulting Trump] The Guardian avoided analysis.The Reddit commenter zablyzibly did not: Some heroes wear bike helmets.Accused of polluting the record of a motorcades passage with details that were not, really, news, Herman defended himself.The cyclists act has certainly generated an emotional reaction among many, he wrote.Well go him one better.That fleeting, vulgar indignity to the worlds most powerful person was not just news, but a historical tradition.2001: A man throws an egg at Bill Clinton Former president Bill Clinton had not been gone from the White House three months when, as ABC News reported, he walked out of an antique store in Poland and was hit on the arm with an egg.The former president took off his suit jacket and continued his walk in sunny weather for another 15 minutes, signing autographs and greeting tourists, the station reported.Meanwhile, security forces wrestled the teenage egger to the ground.It was good for young people to be angry about something, Clinton remarked, his spokeswoman later told reporters.The Bush years: ducked shoes and flipped birds The most memorable indignity an American president suffered in the modern era may belong to George W. Bush, whose 2008 news conference at a Baghdad palace was interrupted when an Iraqi TV reporter took his shoes off and flung them at the lectern.This is a goodbye kiss from the Iraqi people, dog, Muntadar al-Zaidi yelled as Bush ducked the first shoe.This is for the widows and orphans and all those killed in Iraq, he yelled as the second shoe followed.Like Clinton did his egging, Bush took his shoeing in good humor.It has got to be one of the most weird moments of my presidency, he later reflected.He didnt mention an incident two years earlier, in some ways no less weird.[The violent rally Trump cant move past] Bush was riding in his presidential motorcade through Seattle, as Trump would do years later in Sterling.The president amused himself by waving at a fleet of school buses, full of children returning from a field trip to the zoo.The president was having a great time.He was waving at everybody, he waved at the kids, Rep. Dave Reichert (R-Wash.) later recounted, according to the Associated Press.The sad part of it is though, we got to the last bus and I wont tell you which school district this was the bus driver flipped the president off.Reporters soon found out the name of the school district.Despite protesting that only the president not the children had seen her middle finger, the bus driver was fired.President Obama and the comforts of heckling While speaking about the closing of Guantanamo Bay at National Defense University, a heckler interrupted President Obama's speech and he addressed her directly.(The Washington Post) A few months into his presidency, Barack Obama addressed Congress, wagging his finger at U.S. senators and representatives as he spoke of his plans for immigration reform.The reforms I am proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally, Obama told Congress.You lie, Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) yelled from his seat.Oooooh!exclaimed a chorus.Its not true, Obama said, and went on with his speech.If the 44th president lacked for projectiles and obscenities, hecklers balanced out the deficit so many hecklers that in Obama's second term he told an audience of college students, I wouldn't feel comfortable if I didn't have at least one.Maybe Obama took solace in tradition.The Washington Post once traced the history presidential heckling as far back as Abraham Lincoln, who on the day before his Gettysburg Address remarked to a less-well-remembered crowd: In my position, it is somewhat important that I should not say any foolish things.And heard back this: If you can help it.A century and a half later, President Trump may be less sanguine about mockery.We dont know if he saw the bird flip on Saturday, or what he thought of it if he did.But Trump has faced no end of jeerers at his rallies and has often shared his feelings with the crowd.Id like to punch him in the face, he said last year, for example.Read more: Could Donald Trump be held legally responsible for inciting violence at his rallies?Trump mocked Obama for bowing to a Saudi king.And then he CNN broke news in the Russia probe.Roger Stones resulting rant got him yanked off Twitter.
CNN broke news in the Russia probe. Roger Stones resulting rant got him yanked off Twitter.:::::Roger Stone, one of President Trump's former campaign advisers and a longtime Republican operative, was suspended from Twitter after tweeting insults and attacks against CNN anchor Don Lemon and New York Times columnist Charles Blow on Oct. 27.(Reuters) Roger Stone didnt tweet anything worse at CNNs Don Lemon than he has said to someone else before.Piece of s---, Stone wrote to the anchor mid-rant on Friday night, after CNN told viewers of an indictment in an investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election, which Stone helped President Trump win.But Stone has said that to many on Twitter most recently Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), whom he called a closeted piece of s--- in September.Likewise human excrement, which graced several Stone tweets before it appeared in Fridays tirade against Lemon and CNN.And when at 10 p.m. as word of the indictment report spread and Stone tweeted that Lemon must be confronted, humiliated, mocked and punished he echoed his own words from May, when he demanded that the same fate befall MSNBCs Joy Reid.So maybe it wasnt the words themselves but rather the sheer quantity of them tweet after foul, aggressive tweet all night that finally led Twitter to yank @RogerJStoneJr.[Roger Stone helped Donald Trump get elected president - now hes helping himself] The company rarely comments when it takes action against individual accounts, but it pointed BuzzFeed to its policies against abuse, harassment and intimidation three words that Stone has been accused of many times in his political career.Stone has been at Trumps side, on and off, since at least 1999, when he directed the moguls first exploratory campaign for president.He used to appear on CNN often in the last election to plug Trump until Stone called another commentator an entitled diva bitch on Twitter and was pulled off the air.Trump cut ties with Stone several months later (I really don't want publicity seekers, the future president said).But as The Washington Post wrote, Stone remained one of Trumps loudest boosters on his Twitter account, radio show and website and reportedly continued to advise the president behind the scenes.In an April interview with the Post, Roger Stone said he still talks with President Trump.(McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post) Stone connected Trump to conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, for example, and reportedly (per CNN) pushed Trump to fire FBI Director James B. Comey, which special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is now investigating as part of his Russia probe.[Bob Mueller has an unreleased Trump letter about firing James B. Comey.Heres why thats big.]Stone launched his last tweetstorm after the network reported that someone was likely to be arrested in that investigation as soon as Monday, Lemon told his viewers.The charges are sealed, according to CNN, and it's unclear who could be charged and for what.Stone started out with jokes Mueller must have indicted the Trump campaign managers driver for double parking, he wrote but turned angry as the night advanced.He blasted Lemon and other reporters for lying, for fake news, and for not digging into Democratic scandals.And the insults flew.Stones account went dark at some point after he predicted that Lemon would be laid off.His tweets are now preserved only on the third-party Trump Twitter Archives and in screen shots.Whatever caused the suspension, Stone has been skirting notions of propriety since he worked for Richard Nixon in the 1970s, and he promptly fell back to supplementary Twitter accounts to keep yelling at people on Friday.I have been informed that my main account has been suspended for 3 hours and 12 minutes.Sometimes the stark truth offends some people.I'll be baaaaaack... Get Me Roger Stone (@STONEFLIK) October 28, 2017 He said his main account would be back online within a few hours on Saturday.On Sunday morning, it remained dark with no explanation.Now Stone, between curses and insults, celebrates himself as a martyr to censorship, and the conspiracy theorist he once linked Trump up with Jones warns of crackdowns to come.I have been inundated on Twitter with death threats, threats to kill my wife, my family, my children and even my dogs yet Twitter seems unconcerned with these bloggers, Stone wrote to Politico after the suspension, which the site reported may be permanent.He told Politico hed been talking to lawyers, and planned to take legal action against Twitter.This story has been updated.An earlier version incorrectly referred to Stone's Twitter handle as @RogerStoneJr, instead of @RogerJStoneJr.Read more: Trump ends relationship with longtime political adviser Roger Stone Trump insults and threatens GOP senators in long rant after health bill failure
Republicans horrible week (and not-great year) was entirely predictable:::::Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said on Oct. 24 that he will not run for reelection in 2018.Flake said the GOP is at risk of becoming a "fearful, backward-looking minority party."(U.S. Senate) Nine months into gaining full control of Washington, Republicans are not where they hoped theyd be.Very far from it, actually.They have no major legislative accomplishments to tout.After this week, they are tipping into a civil war.And early polls suggest voters would rather elect a generic Democrat than a generic Republican in next years congressional elections.All of this was entirely predictable not that there was much Republican leaders could do about it.And yes, Im referring to President Trump.But Republicans fracturing was evident long before Trump rode down that escalator in Trump Tower two and a half years ago.I think were trying to figure out when Republicans are either going to hit rock bottom or make the party great again, said Doug Heye, a former top Republican House aide and GOP consultant.And to me, Trump is a symptom of that as much as he is a current cause.Lets run down three main reasons that the difficult week Republicans just had and the not-great year theyre still having were entirely predictable.1.Trump is Trump.After Trump got elected, congressional Republicans made a decision to forget the campaign.The ninth Supreme Court seat, repealing Obamacare and passing the first tax bill in decades all took precedence over all the negatives that come with Trump, including the Access Hollywood tape, Trump's unpredictability, his rhetoric toward the GOP in the campaign and his fundamental opposition to traditional Republican positions on issues such as trade policy.But Trump wouldnt let them forget.Day by day, he proved many Republicans worst fears about him.A short list: 1.Hes very defensive and prides himself on counterpunching regardless of whether the criticism is coming from within his own party.2.He demands loyalty without returning it and casts Republicans as the reason for his failures without apparent consideration of his own role.3.Hes an untrustworthy dealmaker who can flip positions at a moments notice.4.Hes not ideological and has little grasp of policy.Republicans hoped against all evidence that Trump would change his ways after the campaign and become more like them.Instead, over the past few weeks, weve heard some powerful Republicans proclaim they think Trump is a danger to American democracy.During a rally in Youngstown, Ohio, July 25, President Trump said he "can be more presidential" than all U.S. presidents except Abraham Lincoln.(The Washington Post) Trump is Trump, and Republicans voters and congressional leaders knew exactly what theyd be getting when he got elected: an erratic leader who thrives on chaos.Its hard to tell how serious he is, Alice Rivlin, a former Clinton administration official and economics and health-care policy analyst with the Brookings Institution, told The Fix in September.Hes made his deficit of trust bigger and bigger.2.They are trying to pass major social and economic reform legislation by themselves.After a majority of senators voted against the GOP "skinny repeal" health-care bill, July 28, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said it was "clearly a disappointing moment."(U.S. Senate) By themselves, I mean without incorporating Democrats, which limits the total number of votes they have to pass legislation.Pushing through major legislation on party line votes is also a political risk.One that is predictable.In 2010, Democrats passed Obamacare without any Republican votes, and they paid the political price.In the election immediately after Democrats passed Obamacare, they lost 63 seats in the House of Representatives.They have yet to win back the majority.Republicans arent heeding recent historys warnings.In the summer, they tried to push through an unpopular Obamacare repeal without any Democrats votes.After a few Republican defections, it failed by one vote in the Senate.Now, Republicans are trying the same party-line strategy on a tax bill.[Trump's bipartisan kick seems less than sincere] 3.The Republican Party is changing Tea party activists on Capitol Hill in 2013.(J. Scott Applewhite/AP) And has been happening for a while.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) retired this week because he determined he couldnt win a GOP primary as a Trump critic.He also said he thought the fever that is Trumpism would eventually break, just not in time for the 2018 election.Dont be so sure about that, says The Fixs Aaron Blake.Trumps anti-establishment and pro-culture war vigor have been in demand among the GOP base for the better part of the past decade.See: The tea party and all the controversial GOP Senate candidates that movement helped elevate.The irony is that Senate Republicans thought they had tamped down on that section of their party.Then Trump happened.They hadnt lost a primary race in five years until the fall in Alabama, where pro-Trump forces sided against them.Now, the Republican establishment is in a war against those same Trump forces for the soul of their party.Some Republicans think nothing less than their electoral future is on the line.I dont think we know if it is Trumps party yet, said Steve Bell, a former GOP Senate aide who is now with the Bipartisan Policy Center.If it becomes defined by him, though, we will be a minority party for many years.Republicans troubles were relatively easy to see coming: The tea party.Brushing aside hard lessons learned by Democrats on policymaking.Nominating Trump.For those reasons, if Republicans worst-case scenario happens, and they lose control of Washington, we can say that, too, was entirely predictable.
Frustrated with the Russia investigation, Trump demands Democrats and Hillary Clinton face more scrutiny:::::On Sunday morning, President Trump expressed frustration that his campaign is under investigation over possible ties to Russia's plot to influence the 2016 election but that his former opponent Hillary Clinton is not facing the same level of scrutiny.In four tweets sent over 24 minutes, Trump wrote: Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?), the Uranium to Russia deal, the 33,000 plus deleted Emails, the Comey fix and so much more.Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia, 'collusion,' which doesn't exist.The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics, but the R's are now fighting back like never before.There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out.DO SOMETHING!The tweets came as CNN has continued to report that on Friday a federal grand jury in Washington approved the first charges in the investigation led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, citing sources briefed on the matter.The charges are sealed, and it's unclear who could be charged and for what.The history of the dossier Trump referenced is a complicated one.During the 2016 Republican primaries, the conservative Washington Free Beacon paid the Washington firm Fusion GPS to investigate Trump's background and, eventually, his business ties to Russia, The Washington Post reported Friday.The publication receives financial support from billionaire GOP donor Paul Singer, according to two people familiar with Singer, whose firm did not respond to requests seeking comment.Fusion GPS is an opposition research firm run by ex-journalists, but how is it connected to the Trump dossier, Donald Trump Jr.'s Trump Tower meeting and the 2016 election?The Fact Checker's Glenn Kessler explains.(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) After the Free Beacon stopped paying Fusion GPS, the research firm offered in April 2016 to continue researching Trump for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, The Post reported last week.According to that reporting, Fusion GPS then hired Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community, who compiled a 35-page dossier on Trump.Brian Fallon, a former spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said he learned about Steele and the dossier after the election.People familiar with the matter said the Clinton campaign and the DNC did not direct Steeles activities.It's unclear how much the Clinton campaign and DNC paid for the information.The Clinton campaign paid Perkins Coie $5.6 million in legal fees from June 2015 to December 2016, according to campaign finance records cited by The Post, and the DNC paid the firm $3.6 million in legal and compliance consulting since November 2015 though its impossible to tell from the filings how much of that work was for other legal matters and how much of it related to Fusion GPS.It's unclear how Trump arrived at the $12 million figure used in his tweets.[Trump and Republicans steer Russia probes in new directions] When it comes to the Uranium to Russia deal that Trump referenced in his tweet, House and Senate Republican leaders have already announced two investigations into decisions made during the Obama administration, when Clinton was secretary of state, involving a uranium deal that increased Russias share of the U.S. nuclear market.At the same time, the House Oversight Committee has launched a probe into the Clinton email investigation that will examine, among other things, why then-FBI Director James B. Comey publicly announced that the bureau was investigating Clinton but then waited months before making a similar announcement about its inquiries into the Trump campaign.Democrats have argued that these investigations are intended to distract from the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Women marched. Now what?:::::Sarah Schulz listens Saturday during the Speechwriting the Resistance breakout session at the Women's Convention in Detroit.(Rachel Woolf for The Washington Post) Until the morning after the 2016 presidential election, politics was not a particularly high priority for Sarah Schulz.I called myself a Democrat, and that was pretty much the extent of my political involvement, Schulz recalled.I woke up on Nov. 9 I woke up physically, and I woke up politically.Within weeks, the 40-year-old mother of two co-founded a local group of liberal activists, Women of Michigan Action Network (WOMAN), that now counts more than 1,300 members in the Midland area, where she lives.The day after the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States, Schulz joined tens of thousands on the Mall in Washington to put Donald Trump on notice that his presidency would be facing a wall of resistance.Now shes trying to figure out: Whats next?Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) speaks at a luncheon honoring her public service Saturday at the inaugural Womens Convention in Detroit.(Rachel Woolf for The Washington Post) Friends are urging her to run for office.But what office?And how?I dont know the nuts and bolts of it, said Schulz, who works in human resources for a nonprofit.I dont know how to fundraise.I dont know where one gets a campaign manager.Charting a future for themselves and for the forces of opposition that have been unleashed in the Trump era is what drew Schulz and more than 4,000 other women from across the nation to Detroits Cobo Convention Center over the weekend.This level of engagement Ive never seen before.Its as true in rural Michigan as it is in downtown Detroit, said former state Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer, an attendee who is running for governor in 2018.This is about training and organizing and building our bench of candidates and also campaign operatives as we look to next years midterms.That will be the test, Whitmer added.The three-day convention was put together by the organizers of Januarys post-inauguration womens march, which is believed to have been among the largest single-day political demonstration in U.S. history, with protests in hundreds of cities and towns around the nation.We cannot afford to be shut down or shut up by any man, particularly not one as indecent and deplorable as Donald Trump, declared keynote speaker Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.).Attendees wave pom poms during the Women's Convention in Detroit.(Rachel Woolf/For The Washington Post) Waters closed her speech by leading the women in a chant: Impeach 45!But it was about more than Trump.I want to push back against the values he represents, but also fight for progressive values that I believe in, said Lebanese American Fayrouz Saad, 34, who is running for an open congressional seat in the Detroit area that both parties see as competitive.If elected, she would be the first Muslim woman to serve in Congress.[Nancy Pelosi isnt going anywhere.Will it help or hurt Democrats in 2018?]The gathering was plagued by early organizational problems, including a backlash against a decision to showcase a male politician Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) with a prominent speaking role.Sanders backed out amid the complaints.That misstep, however, did not appear to dampen the enthusiasm of the thousands who showed up, some wearing the pink knit pussy hats that became the symbol of the January march.Their T-shirts brandished slogans declaring the future is female and that they were reclaiming our time, a liberal meme that also served as the conventions slogan.It just all fell into place.it just felt inspiring, said Linda Sarsour, one of the main organizers of both the march and convention.People are extraordinarily motivated and feeling hopeful, and thats exactly what the point of the convention was.They were a diverse group, women of nearly every age and ethnicity.There was programming for children and a pumping pod for nursing mothers.Mens bathrooms in the convention center were changed to gender-neutral ones for the weekend.Stoking their fervor was the recent wave of revelations of sexual harassment by powerful men, among them movie producer Harvey Weinstein and political pundit Mark Halperin.I have been silenced for 20 years.I have been slut-shamed, I have been harassed, I have been maligned, and you know what?I am just like you, said actress Rose McGowan, who has accused Weinstein of raping her.What happened to me behind the scenes happens to all of us in this society.It cannot stand and will not stand.[It cannot stand: Actresses Rose McGowan, Amber Tamblyn say they wont be silenced over sexual assault] Identity issues were a theme of many of the convention events, which included a workshop titled Confronting White Womanhood, for white women committed to being part of an intersectional feminist movement to unpack the ways white women uphold and benefit from white supremacy.Other sessions looked at the practical challenges of turning the raw feelings left over from the 2016 election into lasting political power.Among them: How to Organize a Protest/Rally in Less Than 24 Hours!Yet to create a lasting movement and succeed in winning more elective offices, women must do more than present an angry front, gubernatorial candidate Whitmer said.The key is a vision that really does get people into better-paying jobs and get our kids the education they need those bread-and-butter issues.In one fiery speech after another, the women were told that the best way to achieve that is to elect more women to political office.I am a firm believer that the conversation changes when a woman takes a seat at the table, Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) said in her speech Friday.Missing from the lineup of speakers were some of the biggest names in Democratic politics 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.).All had been invited and declined.However, Sens.Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), both of whom are being talked about as possible presidential contenders in 2020, did speak on the opening night.If we want a different outcome, we must change the players list, Gillibrand said.Just imagine if Congress was 51 percent women.During the 2016 election cycle, Emilys List, a leading funder of female candidates who support abortion rights, had discussions with what was then a record 920 women interested in running.We called it our Hillary bump, said Stephanie Schriock, Emilys List president.This year so far, the organization has heard from 20,500 including 47 on Friday alone.This is our pipeline, Schriock said.This is extraordinary.As a group, she added, they are generally more liberal than their male counterparts, and more than half are under the age of 45, which is a sea change for us.More than 100 women lined up for a training session on running for office that Emilys List held here Saturday afternoon.Among them was Schulz only to be turned away because there was no room left at the oversubscribed session.She went to one called Speechwriting the Resistance instead.Read more at PowerPost
Nancy Pelosi isnt going anywhere. Will it help or hurt Democrats in 2018?:::::The Washington Post's Michael Scherer dives into the challenges facing House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and how she's trying to win back the House.(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Nancy Pelosi wanted everyone to know that she had been here before and knew what to do.Let me just give you some hope, the House Democratic leader told campaign donors on Oct. 17 at a private gathering on the patio of the Las Vegas Four Seasons Hotel.Any time a president in office is below 50 percent in recent history, his party has lost the Congress in the next election.Her sample size was a bit small for comfort in the past half-century, only the three most recent presidents have given up the House.But this was a pep talk, not an academic symposium.Pelosi, a San Francisco Democrat who has raised her party more than $633 million over the past 15 years, was on a seven-city, eight-day tour to show that the 2018 midterm campaign was in full swing.The Democratic effort to retake the House and return from the wilderness would probably rise or fall on the performance of one of the most polarizing figures in modern American politics.We have a plan and a vision to unify, she told the donors, according to attendees.After three decades in Congress, Pelosi, 77, makes an unlikely general to lead the troops into another change election.Her party, deemed elite and out of touch in 2016, is struggling to win back Midwestern working-class voters, and anger at Washingtons entrenched leaders is pretty much the only thing that unites the country.But rather than shrink from the spotlight, Pelosi is once again in control her partys top fundraiser, senior midterm election strategist and top legislative negotiator, in partnership with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).She has for months led a rolling battle with the Trump agenda, setting a disciplined, pugilistic tone for her caucus and casting herself as the official face of the resistance.With substantial help from the opposition, she has been winning more than not, at least as measured by a growing number of competitive seats, her ability to outmaneuver Republican leaders on Capitol Hill and Trumps low approval ratings.There are a lot of ways to skin a cat, she likes to joke about the president.And he is skinning himself.That doesnt mean that anything is ordained.Its not a slam dunk, she told the donors.Given all the things that can still go wrong, she was almost certainly understating the risk.A second shot The last time Pelosi led Democrats in an effort to take back the House, she was a new face on the scene, promising to drain the swamp a decade before Trump adopted the phrase.She became the first female speaker and the most powerful woman in American history, only to lose the gavel four years later after passing the Affordable Care Act, the 2009 stimulus and new financial regulations.These days, undocumented immigrant activists shout her down from the left when she visits the Bay Area.Some of the younger House Democrats have begun to call for a generational change at the top.And Republicans delight in the possibility of turning Midwestern races into referendums on San Francisco values.[Women marched.Now what?A pillar of the resistance gathers in Detroit to figure out next steps] Over the summer, the GOP won a special House election in Georgia by tarring the local candidate with the Pelosi brand.One ad featured the Golden Gate Bridge, cable cars and a pig-tailed hippie flashing a two-fingered peace sign.Democratic pollsters later found in focus groups that attacking Washington liberals proved effective in the Republican-leaning district.I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out, President Trump taunted weeks later on Twitter.That would be very bad for the Republican Party.Pelosi denies that any of this affects her or her caucus, arguing that 70 seats will be more competitive next year than the one Democrats lost in Georgia.Instead, she defiantly flashes a gay-pride rainbow flag band on the Apple Watch on her left wrist, refusing to disguise her liberal credentials.Self-promotion is a terrible thing, but evidently someone has to do it, she explained a few days earlier, sitting in her Capitol office for one of several interviews with The Washington Post over the past two weeks.The minute you do better, they will come after you, and thats why they come after me.No one doubts that Pelosi can put points on the board.In the three months that ended in September, she held 165 fundraising events in 35 cities, raising $38.9 million for House Democrats helping top the committee fundraising haul of Republicans, according to her aides.From left, Vice President Pence and President Trump meet Sept. 6 with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Pelosi.Schumer and Pelosi secured a three-month budget extension in the talks, giving Democrats a leg up in a December faceoff.(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) She also has made herself a constant national media presence, including with four hour-long CNN prime-time specials this year alone more airtime than many of the networks paid contributors.If you know the name of any legislator who knows how (and wants to) do that job, please give it to me so my children can have their grandmother back!said her youngest daughter, Alexandra Pelosi, in an email.Behind the scenes, Pelosi has been working with Republicans to undermine the Trump agenda.In recent months, she has strategized with Republican governors over preserving key parts of the ACA.She described Nevada Gov.Brian Sandoval as a resource on persuading others to resist Medicaid cuts, and aides said she also talked with Ohio Gov.John Kasich and Alaska Gov.Bill Walker, an independent.A spokesman for Walker confirmed the conversations; the offices of Sandoval and Kasich did not reply to a request for comment.She also has led her caucus to negotiating victories in Washington.The budget agreement this past spring failed to fund most Republican priorities, including a new border wall, while providing billions for medical research, disaster funding and college grants.Even though they had the signature and two majorities, we ate their lunch, Pelosi boasted.Thats what we do.The process repeated itself last month, when she joined Schumer in winning Trumps support for a three-month budget extension, set to create a December showdown over the 2018 budget.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) later argued that the deal was not as bad as it seemed.He was trying to pin a rose on it, poor baby, Pelosi said.We now have more leverage.Next she is leading the campaign to turn the American public against Republican tax legislation, which she calls our Armageddon.Nancy is key to maintaining our unity, said Rep. Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.), the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee.She knows the process, she knows the policy, and she knows the politics better than anyone.Staying on message The big task before Pelosi, the one that will ultimately seal or undermine her legacy, is the Democratic preparation for 2018.Her plan is much the same as in 2006: Keep her members focused on an economic message better jobs, better wages, better future raise a ton of money, recruit candidates and endlessly repeat her revolving databank of alliterative catchphrase trifectas.Money, message and mobilization, she says to describe Democratic priorities.Cronyism, corruption and incompetence is another, which she invokes to describe the party of Trump, echoing a phrase she deployed against President George W. Bush.Democrats have a growing number of takeover scenarios, but we wont know until later next year which races develop into serious opportunities, explained Nathan Gonzales, who runs the political handicapping operation Inside Elections.The takeover potential looks far stronger for Democrats in the House than in the Senate.But Pelosi is convinced the effort will work only if Democrats stay disciplined.Her friend and Democratic donor Tom Steyer recently started airing television ads to demand Trumps impeachment, creating a clear risk to Pelosis economic message.Her response has been a study in nuance.I think the presentation that Tom Steyer made was one that no one could disagree with in terms of justification, she said before explaining that outside advocates have a different role from those in government.She wants to keep the focus on jobs.Everything is an opportunity cost of time, she added.Pelosi has also opened the door to bringing more moderate politicians into the party.Her staff says she has no concerns if some Democratic candidates in tough districts, including Paul Davis in Kansas, promise on the campaign trail to turn her out of office.That doesnt mean she does not share her colleagues disdain for Trump.She jokes that her nicknames for the president are Rock Bottom and Difficult Circumstances.But she also holds back.I am respectful of the people that voted for him, she said.They are way down the road with me already because they vote.Underlying her entire approach is a fierceness, born not from the frontier liberalism of San Francisco but from the calculating, ethnic, big-city politics of Baltimore.There, her congressman-turned-mayor father regularly displayed the cold mathematics of coalition building in their living room, which also served as his headquarters.Thomas DAlesandro Jr.s photograph hangs on his daughters Capitol office wall.Its a picture of him speaking to first lady Eleanor Roosevelt at a 1940 hearing, given to her by former president Barack Obama.Pelosi still embraces the formality of those days, preferring restaurants with tablecloths, greeting visitors in her office with poured glasses of ice water and often insisting on pleasantries before getting down to business.Enjoyment is not it, said former congressman George Miller (D-Calif.), a longtime friend.What she enjoys is opportunity.She came from a family where politics was about getting things done for people.She also maintains an unflinching focus on her historic achievement.One of the reasons Pelosi did not follow through with her plan to step aside after the last election, she said, was the realization that without Hillary Clinton in the White House, she remained the only senior woman in government.I am a master legislator.I just love it, she said of her inherited appetites.I consider myself a weaver, like I have a loom.And I bring all these different threads together.While Pelosi said she has never experienced sexual harassment in the workplace, she also believes that the unacceptable level of sexism in the culture has changed little since the 1980s.No, its about the same: nick, nick, nick, nick, she said, pointing with her hands to demonstrate how womens power is undercut by the men.This is one of the reasons, she said, that she is so unabashed about pointing out her own abilities.When former White House strategist David Axelrod, a longtime champion, recently asked her in an interview for his podcast whether she would serve out her term, she declined to answer and snapped back: How many men have you asked that question to?Its really a girl question.After the interview, Axelrod spoke of Pelosi with unerring admiration.She is tough as nails, he said.Finding leverage About a week after the Vegas fundraiser, Pelosi traveled to her alma mater, Trinity Washington University, a Catholic womens school in the District, where more than 10 percent of the student population are Dreamers undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children.Pelosi meets Dreamers at Trinity Washington University in the District on Tuesday.(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post) She told the students Democrats would not leave for the winter break without a legislative fix to give them legal status.It was an implicit threat: If Republicans wanted Democratic votes to prevent a government shutdown, they would need to deal.But she denies any effort by Democrats to shut down anything.They have the votes, and they have the White House, she said of the Republicans.They have the power to keep government open.That is a crafty bit of messaging, an attempt to take responsibility off Democrats, even though it has been clear for months that Republicans cannot hold their caucus together.Their disunity gives us leverage, she explained.They need our vote.We need our say.This is the plight of the current Republican leadership.Did she ever feel sympathy for speakers John A. Boehner or Paul D. Ryan as they struggled in their jobs?No, she said, without flinching.Pity.
The dossier and the uranium deal: A guide to the latest allegations:::::Fusion GPS is an opposition research firm run by ex-journalists, but how is it connected to the Trump dossier, Donald Trump Jr.'s Trump Tower meeting and the 2016 election?The Fact Checker's Glenn Kessler explains.(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) As a service to readers bound to be confused by an increasingly complex story, heres a brief guide to the latest developments in the tangled allegations involving Russia, President Trump and Hillary Clinton.The Dossier Background: The dossier is a collection of 17 memos concerning President Trump and Russia written by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer, between June 20 and Dec. 13, 2016.Steele produced his memos under a contract with Fusion GPS, a strategic intelligence firm run by former journalists.The memos are written as raw intelligence, based on interviews Steele had with unidentified Russian sources (identified, for instance, as Kremlin insider), some of whom he paid for information.Raw intelligence is essentially high-grade gossip, without the expectation it would be made public unless it is further verified.The memos, among other things, allege the Russian government had been seeking to split the Western alliance by cultivating and supporting Trump and also gathering compromising information kompromat on him in an effort to blackmail him.The memos, among other allegations, claim the Russian government fed the Trump campaign valuable intelligence on Clinton.Why Its Important: The dossier mirrors a separate conclusion by U.S. intelligence agencies that the Russian government intervened in the U.S. election in an effort to bolster Trump and harm Clinton, such as through hacking the Democratic National Committee and distributing materials to WikiLeaks to publish at key moments.As the official declassified report stated: We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election.Russias goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.We have high confidence in these judgments.Russian President Vladimir Putin intensely disliked Clinton because he was convinced that when she was secretary of state she had promoted anti-Putin, pro-democracy efforts in his country.The FBI considered the information gathered by Steele to be of sufficient importance that it considered paying him for his research, although it later dropped the idea.Whats New: The DNC and Clinton campaign were revealed as the Democratic donors who paid Fusion GPS for Steeles research.(Technically, Perkins Coie, the law firm of Marc Elias, an attorney representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, funded the research.)Separately, a Republican donor who had earlier hired Fusion GPS for information on Trump was revealed to be the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website.But that earlier effort is unrelated to the Democratic-funded research that yielded the dossier, as Steele was hired by Fusion GPS after work for the Free Beacon had ended.We should note that, in another assignment, Fusion had been hired by a U.S. law firm in early 2014 to assist on the defense against a civil action filed by the U.S. government alleging fraud by Prevezon Holdings.Prevezon is owned by Denis Katsyv, the son of a senior Russian government official.Why is that relevant?Natalia Veselnitskaya, who was also working for the law firm on the Prevezon case, met with Trump campaign officials at the Trump Tower in June 2016, including Donald Trump Jr., campaign manager Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner, the husband of Ivanka Trump.Donald Trump Jr. agreed to meet with Veselnitskaya after an intermediary promised dirt on Clinton.She arrived with a memo containing talking points that had been previously shared by Yuri Chaika, Russias prosecutor general who is known as a master of kompromat.Whats controversial: The Trump White House has tried to use the connection between the dossier and Clinton to claim that this shows that rather than Trump colluding with Russia, Clinton colluded with Russia.(The theory appears to be that because Steele was getting information from Russian officials in part with funds provided by the Clinton campaign, the Russians were helping Clinton.)But that ignores the fact that DNC emails as well as the email account of the Clinton campaign chairman were hacked and then published by WikiLeaks as part of the pro-Trump Russian operation identified by U.S. intelligence agencies.(Wikileaks denies it received the material from Russia.)Indeed, the Wall Street Journal reported that a prominent Trump donor and the chief executive of a data-analytics firm working for Trumps presidential campaign in August 2016 discussed how to better organize the Clinton-related emails being released by Wikileaks in order to leverage their impact.Steele started producing his memos in June 2016, about the same time that intelligence agencies began investigating possible ties between Russia and people close to Trump.The connection between Steeles research and official government investigations is murky, but for some Republicans it raises questions about whether the official probe begun in the Obama administration was influenced by information gathered by someone being paid by Democrats.CNN, for instance, reported that the FBI used information in the Steele memos to obtain approval from the secret court that oversees the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to monitor the communications of Carter Page, who Trump had said was a key adviser on national security issues.Presumably, the FBI had verified the information before it could cite it in court.Steele had quoted an ethnic Russian close associate of Trump as saying Page was an intermediary in a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation between the Trump campaign and the Russian leadership.Page has adamantly denied any wrongdoing.Steele, during the campaign, at Fusions direction also briefed reporters from some U.S. news organizations, including The Washington Post, on his findings, according to court filings.Only one publication, Mother Jones, published information based on the briefing before the election.The Uranium deal Background: In 2010, Rosatom, the Russian nuclear energy agency, acquired a controlling stake in Uranium One, a Canadian-based company that had mining licenses for about 20 percent of U.S. uranium extraction capacity.The agreement was approved by the Obama administration when Clinton was secretary of state.Frank Giustra, a Canadian mining financier and a major contributor to the Clinton Foundation, had sold a company, UrAsia, to Uranium One in 2007.Individuals related to Uranium One and UrAsia, including Giustra, donated to the Clinton Foundation, totaling about $145 million.Meanwhile, in 2010, Bill Clinton received $500,000 from a Russian bank to give a speech at a conference in Moscow.Trump, during the campaign, tossed all of these separate facts together to falsely claim that Clinton gave 20 percent of our uranium gave Russia for a big payment.But numerous fact checks have found no evidence for this claim.The original suggestion of wrongdoing was first raised in a book underwritten by an organization headed by Stephen K. Bannon, a key adviser to Trump.Why Its Important: Whenever news about the Russia investigation heats up, the Trump White House cites the uranium deal in an effort to muddy the waters and suggest that Russia had gained something from Clinton in exchange for money.Trump himself has claimed the case is Watergate, modern age.But there is no evidence Clinton even was informed about this deal.The Treasury Department was the key agency that headed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States which approved the investment; Clinton did not participate in the CFIUS decision.The deal was also approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.Ultimately, only the president could have blocked or suspended the arrangement.Moreover, no uranium produced at U.S. mines may be exported, except for some uranium yellowcake which is extracted and processed in Canada before being returned to the United States for use in nuclear power plants.Whats New: The Hill newspaper on Oct. 22 reported the FBI had gathered evidence at the time of the sale that a Russian Rosatom official had conducted a massive bribery scheme, compromising an American trucking company that shipped uranium for Russia.The official eventually was convicted in 2015, but Republicans have said the case should have raised alarms about the Rosatom investment in Uranium One and possibly blocked the deal.But there is no evidence that U.S. officials weighing the transaction knew about the FBI investigation.The reporting prompted House Republicans to announce they would launch an investigation.With the apparent urging of President Trump, the Justice Department gave a former FBI informant in the case approval to testify before Congress.The informants lawyer claimed he would discuss his work uncovering the Russian nuclear bribery case and the efforts he witnessed by Moscow to gain influence with [former president Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton] in hopes of winning favorable uranium decisions from the Obama administration.Whats controversial: Any suggestion that Russian money was directed to influence Clintons decisions would be explosive.But the fatal flaw in this allegation is Hillary Clinton, by all accounts, did not participate in any discussions regarding the Uranium One sale which as we noted does not actually result in the removal of uranium from the United States.(About our rating scale) Send us facts to check by filling out this form Keep tabs on Trumps promises with our Trump Promise Tracker Sign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter
Its just messed up: Most say political divisions are as bad as in Vietnam War era, poll shows:::::Seven in 10 Americans say the nations political divisions are at least as big as during the Vietnam War, according to a new poll, which also finds nearly 6 in 10 saying Donald Trumps presidency is making the U.S. political system more dysfunctional.The Washington Post-University of Maryland poll conducted nine months into Trumps tumultuous presidency reveals a starkly pessimistic view of U.S. politics, widespread distrust of the nations political leaders and their ability to compromise, and an erosion of pride in the way democracy works in America.Trumps arrival in the White House in January ushered in a period of big political fights over issues including health care, taxes and immigration and a sharp escalation in personal attacks on political opponents, over social media and elsewhere.Seven in 10 Americans say the nations politics have reached a dangerous low point, and a majority of those believe the situation is a new normal rather than temporary, according to the poll.[Read full poll results | How the poll was conducted] The poll finds that 7 in 10 Americans view the Trump administration as dysfunctional.But dissatisfaction extends well beyond the executive branch: Even more Americans, 8 in 10, say Congress is dysfunctional, and there is limited trust in other institutions, including the media.Its just messed up now, said Patty Kasbeck, 37, a veterinary technician in Bartlesville, Okla., and a Democrat.Its not even a political system.Its a reality show.In the poll, 14 percent of Americans said they view the ethics and honesty of politicians as excellent or good down from 25 percent in 1997 and 39 percent in 1987.And 12 percent say members of Congress base their policies on a set of core values, while 87 percent say they mainly do whatever is needed to win reelection.By and large, Americans are feeling frustrated not only with the countrys politics but also their ability to talk about politics in a civil way.It seems the country is being divided on so many topics and on so many fronts at one time, said Gene Gardner, a retired communications specialist in Blacksburg, Va., who said American democracy has become a rock-throwing contest.When people have an opinion, they dont just say it to their spouse across the dinner table anymore, said Gardner, 68, who says he tends to vote Democratic.They put it on Facebook.Everything gets amplified and more angry.Recent surveys have shown consumer confidence is up this year and stands at the highest levels in the past decade, so it does not appear that economic concerns are driving discontent with the nations political system.Rather, Trumps presidency appears to be a more critical factor in informing the way people feel about the state of American democracy.While the poll finds similar levels of distrust in the federal government as before Trump took office, it also finds that pride in U.S. democracy is eroding.The share of Americans who are not proud of the way the countrys democracy is working has doubled since three years ago from 18 percent to 36 percent in the new survey conducted among a nationwide sample of more than 1,600 adults by The Post and U-Md.s Center for American Politics and Citizenship.And nearly half of those who say they strongly disapprove of Trumps job performance say they are not proud of American democracy today.Thats about twice as high among as those who somewhat disapprove of the presidents performance.Doubts about democracy are not limited, however, to strong Trump critics.The poll finds that 25 percent of his supporters are not proud of the way democracy is working.Thats a higher figure than for the general public since at least the 1990s, polling shows.I think that since Trumps election, theres a spotlight on Washington and how it really works: that politicians are out for themselves and beholden to special interests, said Nola Sayne, a paralegal in Logansville, Ga., who supported Trump and says she tends to vote Republican.Sayne, 54, partly blames the dysfunction on how the Washington establishment has reacted to Trump.People just flip out at everything he says, Sayne said.Elizabeth Johnston, a worker benefits specialist in Paradise, Calif., said shes embarrassed for the country and primarily blames Democrats for the nations current political dysfunction.Theyre acting like the mean kids in junior high, Johnston said.Theyre all helping to make sure that the president doesnt succeed.Johnston, 58, a registered independent, said there are some things she doesnt like about Trump, like his childish tweets.But she said the country needs to give him a chance.I love it that he hears us, she said.I love it that he wants to cut taxes.Strong majorities in both parties say the political divisions today are at least as strong as during the Vietnam War, a period of protest and unrest that is widely viewed as a dark chapter in American political history.Seven in 10 Americans overall hold that view, but it is particularly strong among those who experienced the Vietnam War era firsthand.Among those who were adults in the 1970s, more than three-quarters say political divisions today are at least as big.Im old enough that I remember the Vietnam War, said Ed Evans, 67, a lawyer in Sioux Falls, S.D., and a Democrat who was a college student in Missouri at the time.With Vietnam, at least it was focused on one issue.Here, its all over the place.In some ways, this is deeply more troubling.Ellen Collins, an independent who is a retired data architect in Dayton, Ohio, said she remembers hearing her brother, who was in the Army returning from Vietnam, say that he was spit upon in the airport during a layover in San Francisco in March 1968.Still, she is among those who say political divisions in the country are worse today.This country is a mess, said Collins, 69.Theres no civility.Friends are now enemies.These issues have made people angry.She blames Trump in large part, saying he has used divisions to his benefit, to play on peoples fears.Collins cited Trumps recent sparring with Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) over the presidents condolence call to the widow of a soldier killed in Niger.He has an inability to say, My bad, and he just keeps going and going, Collins said.Hes childish, and hes a bully.Majorities of both Democrats and Republicans say Americas politics have reached a dangerous low point, though more Democrats (81 percent) than Republicans (56 percent) hold that view.Overall, more Americans say Trump deserves a lot of blame for political dysfunction (51 percent) than either the Republican Party (38 percent) or the Democratic Party (32 percent).Weve had good presidents and bad presidents, said Gardner, the Blacksburg, Va. resident.But for the most part, theyve all played a presidential role.Theyve tried to bring the country together.Thats not so true of Trump.Ones party affiliation tends to color the way one parcels out blame.About three-quarters of Democrats blame Trump a lot for causing dysfunction, as do more than half of political independents.But about 1 in 7 Republicans say Trump deserves a lot of blame.Underscoring the partisan antipathy toward Trump, two-thirds of Democrats in the poll say they do not believe his election was legitimate a view held by 9 percent of Republicans.Overall, 42 percent of Americans say Trumps election was not legitimate.By comparison, 14 percent say former president Barack Obamas 2008 election was not legitimate.Democrats have a clear advantage in public trust, with 56 percent of Americans saying they think the party generally represents their political views, compared with 43 percent of Americans saying the Republican Party does the same.A 55 percent majority says the Republican Party mainly opposes their views, and 60 percent say the same of Trump.Many also say the opposing political party not only does not represent their views but is also undermining Americas core principles.Nearly two-thirds of those who see Democrats as the opposition believe they are undermining the countrys core principles, while a slightly smaller percentage of those who feel the Republican Party opposes their views sense a fundamental threat.Among those who say Trump opposes their views, three-quarters say he is undermining the nations core principles.Democrats and Republicans do agree on many of the causes of political dysfunction in the U.S. political system.At least 6 in 10 Democrats, Republicans and independents say money in politics deserves a lot of blame, while smaller majorities blame people with extreme views, and more than 4 in 10 of each group blame members of Congress.A majority of Americans overall say wealthy political donors deserve a lot of blame, and nearly half say the same for both the news media and social media.In a separate question, three-quarters say media organizations tend to favor one side when dealing with political and social issues, a critique held by most Democrats and Republicans.Gina Haag, a high school government teacher in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said she believes two of the biggest culprits contributing to political dysfunction are hyper-partisanship and the amount of money in politics.Its gotten to the point where money matters more than whos running or what they stand for, said Haag, 24, a registered independent.The poll also suggests that Americans are using political labels to define people more broadly.Half of Americans say that if they know someone is a Democrat, that not only indicates what they think about government policies but also how they live their lives.More than half of Americans said the same thing about Republicans.At the same time, many Americans feel less commonality with their neighbors.A 56 percent majority says there are fewer things that bind Americans together today than in the past, a view shared by majorities across party lines and most demographic groups.The Post-U-Md.poll was conducted Sept. 27-Oct. 5 online and by landline and cellphone among 1,663 adults interviewed through the AmeriSpeak Panel, the probability-based survey panel of NORC at the University of Chicago.Interviews were conducted online and by landline and cellular phones; overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.Emily Guskin contributed to this report.
Paul Ryan begins a make-or-break push for tax legislation  and his future:::::Asked on Oct. 26 about President Trump's involvement in the tax plan, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) joked about Trump being "in Asia" during the tax plan reveal and said that they're working together closely to prevent "surprises."(Reuters) Asked on Oct. 26 about President Trump's involvement in the tax plan, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) joked about Trump being "in Asia" during the tax plan reveal and said that they're working together closely to prevent "surprises."(Reuters) Paul D. Ryan has drifted a long way from the soaring rhetoric he delivered on his first day as House speaker.Nothing could be more inspiring than a job well done, he said after claiming the gavel.Nothing could stir the heart more than real, concrete results.Now, the Wisconsin Republican is more likely to sound like a hardened realist, cracking jokes about how little gets done and even poking fun at himself.As the guest speaker at a black-tie gala Wednesday, Ryan exhorted the media to keep your heads up despite poor approval ratings.It could be a whole lot worse, he said.They could be my approval ratings.Exactly two years ago Sunday, on Oct. 29, 2015, Ryan, then 45, succeeded Republican John A. Boehner of Ohio, then 65, with an aura of generational change and a promise of policy-focused leadership.So far, he hasnt delivered.Even after Republicans claimed control of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue in January, Ryan is still searching for a signature achievement.His enemies and allies alike say he needs a big win, soon.The coming week brings what may shape up as his last, best chance to achieve one and the most important moment of his 19-year congressional career: the debut of legislation to rewrite the tax code.House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announce plans for tax legislation in September.(Melina Mara/The Washington Post) Taxes are supposed to be Ryans issue, his policy wheelhouse.As the disciple of the 1980s fiscal conservative Jack Kemp, Ryans rhetoric is never loftier than when espousing free-market principles and the belief that lower taxes and a streamlined code can help businesses, the economy and even the impoverished.He has craved this moment.He also has good reason to dread it.A major question is whether much has changed since an unruly House Republican Conference, as the caucus is known, forced Boehner out and ground governance to a halt.The conference remains deeply turbulent under Ryan and divided, particularly on the issues of taxes, spending and the national debt.Failure to advance tax legislation even if defeat comes in the Senate, as happened in July with legislation to revise the Affordable Care Act would be crippling.One possibility if Republicans head into 2018 having to explain why they failed on both health care and taxes: a political bloodbath that drops the GOP into the minority and boots Ryan off the dais.The 115th Congress, if we go zero for two, gets a failing grade, said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), the leader of one of the Houses conservative caucuses.I think a lot of us may not come back.Tax reform, in Ryans ideal, was supposed to be bigger than tax cuts.It was supposed to be revenue-neutral lowering some taxes, raising others, closing loopholes and simplifying the code.It wasnt supposed to be so easy to criticize for lowering taxes on corporations and higher-income Americans.President Trump has complicated the challenge by rejecting Ryans branding of tax reform instead calling the effort tax cuts and sometimes tax cuts plus.The president may not be wrong about that distinction, but he has contributed to a mashed-up message on what the bill would actually do, whom it would benefit and importantly, how much it would cost.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Oct. 25 compared the tax reform process to whitewater rafting.and said it's about to hit "Class V rapids."(Reuters) [On taxes, Trump is an eager salesman but the policy action is on the Hill] Even modest tax legislation would in some ways fulfill Ryans calling and offer some much needed momentum to Republicans heading into potentially difficult midterm elections next year.But it requires something that the GOP caucus has long been loath to consider: compromise.In the Boehner days, the grand bargains that Republican leaders sought with then-President Barack Obama frequently ended in ignominious defeat.Skeptics remain dubious that this years bargain will end any differently.I think the broken process has not been fixed, and there are some aspects that have gotten worse over the past few years, Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), a member of the rebellious Freedom Caucus.[Major divisions remain as GOP nears its tax deadline] One problem, Amash said, is that Ryans promise of a bottom-up approach has not materialized.Ryan has won some credit for earlier engagement with the GOPs restive wings, including a weekly lunch with representatives of the Freedom Caucus, Walkers Republican Study Committee and the moderate Tuesday Group.But as Amash noted, It doesnt mean they are actually taking our input.Unlike past years, the GOP moderate wing is a big part of Ryans challenge.Aspirational and even wonky ideas repealing the ACA, for instance were easier to vote for with the certainty of an Obama veto across town.Voting on legislation that could become law is harder and moderates have put up a bigger fight this year, on both health care and taxes, than in any of the previous six years of the House GOPs tenure in the majority.These moderates nearly defeated the budget outline that passed Thursday, including enabling language to pass a tax bill, because the emerging tax proposal might eliminate the federal deduction for state and local taxes a big hit to workers in the blue states where many of these moderate lawmakers live.If you have the Freedom Caucus, and you have New York and New Jersey, youre talking about two opposite ends of the spectrum and a president who sometimes goes his own way, said Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.), who voted against the budget outline.In the Trump era, no one seems particularly happy with Ryan.Some in the conservative intelligentsia, who spent years promoting him, have turned against him for not denouncing whom they see as an anti-intellectual president who rejects Kemps free-market, supply-side philosophy.Staunch Trump supporters dont trust Ryan because of his wobbly support during the 2016 campaign.Democrats now suspect that Ryan, historically unpopular in national polling, might be a more effective boogeyman than Trump in TV ads against Republican incumbents.Liberal satirists have published a 192-page parody magazine devoted to mocking Ryan, poking fun at the most unpopular politician in America and his image as thoughtful policy prince who never delivers.And yet Ryan still has strong support from the people who matter most in keeping his job: House Republicans even those facing tough campaigns next year.Speaker Ryan is always welcome in New Jersey.Hes always welcome in New Jersey, said moderate Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.).Ryan, married with young children, dreaded that part of the job when he took the post two years ago the endless fundraising and travel.But hes blown away the very high cash levels that Boehner hauled in, in part because big donors prefer talking to a high-profile former vice-presidential nominee over the genial but less meaty Boehner.In a cruel twist, failure to enact policy could be Ryans downfall.For the past 30 years, every speaker, Democrat or Republican, has left the job on bad terms, either losing the majority or being chased out by their own party.Ryan will find out soon whether hes about to continue that trend.If were still batting zero on these large items, when it comes to next year, I dont think hell be by himself, said Walker.I think a lot of us will be in trouble.Read more from Paul Kanes archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.
Jeff Flake knew his criticism of Trump would cost him. He couldnt stop himself.:::::Jeff Flakes mind and President Trumps leadership have been taking the Arizona senator in opposite directions all year.Flake said he found himself appalled, again and again, by the presidents boorish behavior and penchant for picking personal fights so much so that he felt compelled to publicly criticize Trump directly, in the press and in a best-selling book.Flake could see the beginnings of political damage during the 2016 presidential campaign, when he first raised doubts about Trump.His decision to retire when his term ends next year, which he announced Tuesday in a dramatic floor speech, came after reams of polling data showed he would lose decisively in a Republican primary battle next year, when he probably would have faced a pro-Trump challenger.But ultimately, Flake said, there was not a single trigger for the decision.If anything, he held on because he is a strong supporter of most of Trumps policies and personnel decisions.He voted for his judicial nominees, his regulatory rollbacks and the GOP health-care plan.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said on Oct. 24 that he will not seek reelection in 2018.Flake said the Republican Party under President Trump is at risk of becoming a fearful, backward-looking minority party.(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) I knew that when I spoke out at that time that I was out of step with a lot of the Republican primary voters, but I felt that I had to do it, he said in an interview.I had hoped and I still hope and Im confident at some point that the fever will break.But it just became more and more apparent that it certainly wasnt going to break by next year.Even if he survived the primary, neither Flake nor others in his orbit deny that the same polling showed he might also have lost the general election to his presumed Democratic opponent, popular Phoenix-area congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema.But it was his disgust with Trumps behavior that proved decisive in his decision to call it quits.I couldnt sleep at night having to embrace the president or condoning his behavior or being okay with some of his positions, he said.I just couldnt do it it was never in the cards.Flakes retirement is not directly tied to the feud between Republican Party leaders and former White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon who is waging a populist war against the GOP establishment but he is a battlefield casualty.The fight he picked with Trump followed years of cooperation with Democrats on immigration policy, global trade deals and reestablishing diplomatic ties to Cuba.Such cooperation is unacceptable to Arizonas most die-hard Republicans.Democrats are saying, See, the Republican Party is falling apart.Then theres the Breitbart Trump people looking at this and thinking, Donald Trump is pushing these RINOs out, said Jarrod White, a longtime party activist who was an Arizona delegate to the Republican National Convention last year, referring to Republicans in Name Only.The truth of the matter is, Jeff Flake is down by double digits in the polls against Kelli Ward.He knows hes not going to win.I think he chose to quit and be dignified and get his final lashes out at Trump.Ward is a former Republican state senator who unsuccessfully challenged Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) last year, accusing him of being past his prime and insufficiently conservative.Just days after the presidential election ended last year, Ward launched her campaign against Flake raising similar concerns about his conservative bona fides.The attacks worked.For now, shes the only GOP Senate candidate.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) walks with his wife, Cheryl, after his surprise retirement announcement, on Oct. 24, 2017, in the Russell Senate Office Building.(Matt McClain/The Washington Post) Ward and her aides did not return multiple requests for comment.But Doug McKee, the head of KelliPAC a group independent of her campaign that first launched during her 2016 bid against McCain said Ward is drawing attention because Flake seems to be a lot more in step with what the Democrats views are as opposed to what the Arizona Republican Party is looking for.A GOP strategist whos reviewed polling in the race concluded that in Arizona and elsewhere, the attacks on Trump are totally unsustainable for anyone.You dont have to be best friends with the guy, but you cant do what Flake did.The old rules still apply local issues matter, said the strategist, who asked for anonymity to speak frankly about Republican dynamics, but the Trump image is the new preeminent test of whether you satisfy the desires of Republican conservative primary voters.Flakes public contortions were apparent throughout the year.In a March interview, he praised Trumps pick of Neil M. Gorsuch to serve as a U.S. Supreme Court justice.A conservative jurist from the West was exactly what Flake wanted to see on the high court.He was also impressed by how the White House introduced Gorsuch to the country in a crisply delivered prime-time address by Trump with GOP senators in the White House East Room to meet the nominee and sing his praises to reporters afterward.It was well done, it really was, both in style and in substance its a really good pick, Flake said at the time.[From March: Home stretch for Trumps Supreme Court nominee could forever alter the Senate] The balancing act and overtures continued in May, when he told constituents back home that he looked forward to working with Trump on confirming other conservative picks to run federal agencies.The president has assembled a pretty good Cabinet.Hes surrounded himself with a good group of people, Flake said during a tour of a nuclear power plant, citing picks for regulatory agencies in particular.But under questioning by a voter at an event in Glendale, Ariz., he said I have a hard time believing that a GOP-controlled Congress could fulfill Trumps wish to quickly pass health-care reform.When a hospital employee asked about how to save the Medicaid program, Flake said, Were trying to find that balance, and we arent close yet, frankly.But Flake voted for the GOP health-care reform plan, even as McCain famously voted no.[From May: Do Republicans who criticize Trump face peril?Jeff Flake is about to find out.]Then Congress went home for August recess and Flake published his best-selling treatise, Conscience of a Conservative, which leveled a blistering attack on Trump.The president responded by relentlessly going after the senator on Twitter.He then announced plans to visit Phoenix for a campaign-style event with speculation building that Trump could endorse Ward or another Flake challenger.It wasnt the Trump rally, but it was two weeks of media coverage leading up to that rally, where the media said Trump is going to come out and bash Flake and endorse someone else, said a Flake confidant, who asked for anonymity to maintain his close relationship with the senator.It was millions of dollars in earned media that basically said, Jeff Flake is going to get roasted by Trump.And then he came out here and that didnt happen.Frosty Taylor, a Republican activist and the editor of a daily email newsletter for thousands of Republicans in Maricopa County, Ariz., warned at the time that most of her readers were disenchanted with Flake.They want him replaced.Theyre just not happy with him, she said in August.Hes not following the way they want him to vote.Hes voting with Democrats on a lot of issues.Hes following John McCains lead on a lot of stuff thats a problem here for a lot of people.Flakes retirement announcement Tuesday came just minutes after Trump left a luncheon with Republican senators.He had talked about the race generally with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), but Flake said he didnt give him much advanced warning.He also didnt call his longtime friend and ideological brother-in-arms, Vice President Pence, with whom he once served in the House.I didnt want to put him in a bad position of knowing that and not sharing it.Hes a trusted friend, Flake said of Pence but the two havent spoken since the announcement.Flake warned that while his criticism of the president helped lead to his downfall, GOP candidates should also be wary of embracing him too tightly.Any Republican who simply aligns themselves for the purpose of the primary with the president on every issue and basically contracts out any thinking on policy issues, and is willing to condone any behavior that the president exhibits I think they put themselves at great risk in a general election, he said.Now free of campaign politics for the first time in 18 years, Flake is focused on how to make his last months in office meaningful while enjoying his newfound political freedom.I dont have any fundraising calls to make, he said.That in itself is a pretty good feeling.Read more at PowerPost

Clinton lawyer kept Russian dossier project closely held:::::Marc Elias served as counsel to both Hillary Clintons campaign and the Democratic National Committee in 2016.(David Jolkovski/For The Washington Post) When Marc Elias, general counsel for Hillary Clintons presidential campaign, hired a private research firm in the spring of 2016 to investigate Donald Trump, he drew from funds he was authorized to spend without oversight by campaign officials, according to a spokesperson for his law firm.The firm hired by Elias, Fusion GPS, produced research that resulted a dossier detailing alleged connections between Trump and Russia.While the funding for the work came from the campaign and the Democratic National Committee, Elias kept the information about the investigation closely held as he advised the campaign on its strategy, according to the spokesperson, who requested anonymity to discuss the internal dynamics.Eliass involvement in the financing and internal dissemination of the Trump research underscores the influence he wields behind the scenes in Democratic politics a role that is now being pushed into the spotlight amid multiple investigations into Russias attempts to meddle in the 2016 elections.The 48-year-old lawyer and his firm, Perkins Coie, represent many of the partys political committees and candidates.Elias also has worked on behalf of companies such as Facebook, fighting in 2011 to exempt the social media network from disclaimer rules on political ads.The companys sale of ads to Russian actors during last years campaign triggered calls on Capitol Hill for more disclosure of online ads.Eliass robust client list which included both Clintons campaign and the Democratic National Committee last year has led to questions about how he juggles competing interests and whether some of the arrangements create awkward dynamics.Fusion GPS is an opposition research firm run by ex-journalists, but how is it connected to the Trump dossier, Donald Trump Jr.'s Trump Tower meeting and the 2016 election?The Fact Checker's Glenn Kessler explains.(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) Elias declined to comment.In September, he accompanied former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta to a closed-door interview with Senate Intelligence Committee staffers, during which Podesta said he had no knowledge of payments to Fusion GPS, according to CNN.At the time, it was not publicly known Elias had hired Fusion GPS; that was revealed by The Washington Post this week.Elias, who was there as Podestas lawyer, did not participate in the interview as a witness, CNN reported.Podesta did not respond to a request for comment.While it is common for campaigns to conduct opposition research, Eliass decision to hire Fusion GPS has drawn intense interest because it resulted in the controversial dossier.Republicans have said their effort to investigate Fusions role in producing the dossier will intensify with the revelation that it was funded by Clintons campaign and the DNC.President Trump seized upon the news, saying this week that this was the Democrats coming up with an excuse for losing the election ...they made up the whole Russia hoax.The dossier was part of research into Trump that Fusion GPS began in the Republican primaries for the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication that receives financing from billionaire GOP donor Paul Singer.The Beacons role was first reported Friday by the New York Times.The Washington Posts Adam Entous looks at the role that Hillary Clintons campaign and the Democratic National Committee played in funding the research that led to a dossier containing allegations about President Trumps links to Russia.(Bastien Inzaurralde,Patrick Martin/The Washington Post) After the Free Beacon stopped funding the project, Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson met with Elias at his Washington law office and asked if he was interested, according to people familiar with the arrangement.Elias agreed, deciding Fusion GPS had more capacity than the campaigns in-house operation to do sophisticated research, according to the Perkins Coie spokesperson.Elias drew from funds that both the Clinton campaign and the DNC were paying Perkins Coie, The Post reported this week.It is unclear who else was familiar with the arrangement, or who knew that Fusion GPS hired a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, who wrote the dossier.Clinton has not responded to requests for comment.A spokesman for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.), who was DNC chairwoman at the time Perkins Coie contracted with Fusion GPS, said the former chair was not aware of the law firms arrangement with Fusion.[Former Clinton, DNC aides largely silent on funding of Trump-Russia dossier] Elias himself did not receive the dossier but was briefed on some of the information in it, according to his firms spokesperson.The dossier was published by BuzzFeed after the election.Clinton campaign officials who said they were not aware of Eliass arrangement with the firm defended his decision to tap its resources.Marc is known as one of the most skilled professionals in Democratic politics, in addition to being the partys top election lawyer, said Brian Fallon, who served as a spokesman for the campaign.I am damn glad he pursued this on behalf of our campaign and only regret more of this material was not verified in time for the voters to learn it before the election.Among Perkins Coies clients is Facebook, which Elias helped in 2011 when the company was asking the Federal Election Commission for an exemption from having to include political disclaimers on the small ads that appear on its site.Advocates for more transparency of online ads said that better disclosure requirements could have prevented a Russian troll farm from running ads during last years election that were aimed at sowing divisions between groups of Americans.Facebook, which noted that it has pledged to create a system to disclose the ads run on its site, declined to comment on Eliass role.Elias is well known in political circles for his work on voting rights cases, an effort that has been funded by Democratic megadonor George Soros.Elias also has scored major victories in hard-fought election recounts, including the 2008 election of Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.).His role as the go-to Democratic lawyer in Washington was spotlighted this week when he was slated to testify in the federal bribery trial of one of his clients, Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.).Elias, who had been expected to testify about the advice he gave Menendez about how to fill out financial disclosures, was ultimately stricken from the witness list by the judge.Even as he has built a robust Democratic client list, Elias has often been at odds with groups that advocate for stricter campaign finance rules, including many on the left, over his efforts that have expanded the influence of wealthy donors in politics.He has done good stuff on the voting rights side, but he has also been an opponent of many campaign finance reforms and has been largely responsible for some of the loopholes that exist in the campaign finance laws, said Lawrence Noble, a former Federal Election Commission general counsel who now works as a senior director at the advocacy group Campaign Legal Center.Elias played a key role in helping craft a massive expansion of party fundraising that was slipped into a 2014 end-of-the-year spending bill.That measure created new party accounts that can accept donations three times larger than contributions to the general party fund.The Republican National Committee is now using money raised by one of those funds to help pay for the legal bills accrued by President Trump and his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., in the multiple Russia probes.[RNC taps legal account to help pay for lawyers for President Trump and son Donald Jr. in Russia probes] In 2015, Elias appeared before the FEC to seek greater interplay between candidates and super PACs, which can collected unlimited contributions.Critics saw it as a way around campaign finance laws that set a strict cap on donations to candidates.Then-commissioner Ann Ravel, a Democratic appointee, objected to the idea and was berated by Elias, who said she should have raised her concerns earlier, she said in an interview.A key element of the measure passed by a 4-to-2 vote, with Ravel in opposition.He was always trying to figure out a way to get around campaign finance restrictions, Ravel said.Veteran election law attorney Robert Bauer, who founded the Perkins Coie political practice and recruited Elias, said that anyone practicing political law cannot escape the politics.It understood that your clients, and their objectives, will come under fire, Bauer said.But it is wrong to find fault in a lawyer because he is effective in making the clients case for a particular law or rule.Former secretary of state John F. Kerry, who hired Elias as general counsel for his 2004 presidential campaign, called Elias an outstanding lawyer.He always gave us advice to live up to the law and not avoid it, Kerry said.Former Senate Democratic leader Harry M. Reid, who won a 1998 recount with the help of Elias, said the lawyers decision to tap Fusion GPS for research makes good sense.Time is not on your side in these elections, Reid said.Franken, who declined an interview request, praised Elias in a statement for helping him secure his Senate seat, while saying that I dont always agree with what he advocates for including when it comes to campaign finance.In his book Al Franken, Giant of the Senate, published this year, the senator ribbed Elias about the size of his legal fees, which totaled $3.6 million, according to federal filings.Franken wrote that he was often sequestered at home, calling people for money to pay our bafflingly large and expensive team of lawyers, led by Democratic super-attorney Marc Elias.(If youre ever in Washington, check out the Franken Wing of the Perkins Coie law office its gorgeous.)Tom Hamburger contributed to this report.
Trump, Republicans steer Russia probes in new directions:::::President Trump and Republicans in Congress are demanding new scrutiny of Hillary Clintons actions as secretary of state, potentially jeopardizing investigations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election just as the probes are closing in on Trumps inner circle.In the span of a week, House and Senate Republican leaders announced two investigations into Obama-era decisions involving a uranium deal that increased Russias share of the U.S. nuclear market and another into how the FBI handled Clintons use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.Trump has cheered on the new Republican-driven investigations, which have resurrected some of the presidents most- favored jabs against Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign.Asked about the uranium deal Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: I can tell you that we do think that theres a lot of cause for concern regarding that deal, and we certainly think it should be looked into.She denied, however, that the White House is trying to steer the congressional investigations away from Russian meddling.The Washington Posts Adam Entous looks at the role that Hillary Clintons campaign and the Democratic National Committee played in funding the research that led to a dossier containing allegations about President Trumps links to Russia.(Bastien Inzaurralde,Patrick Martin/The Washington Post) The president wants to see this completed, she said.Theres still no evidence of collusion between the president and anyone....If any collusion took place, it would be between the DNC and the Clintons.And I think were starting to now see that all of the things that the Democrats had accused this president doing, they were actually guilty of themselves.The DNC refers to the Democratic National Committee.Democrats have cried foul, charging that the investigations are a blatant strategy to distract attention from the investigations into Trumps alleged Kremlin ties, and suggesting the White House may be improperly working to assist the GOPs efforts.Democrats were particularly alarmed by news that Trump urged the Justice Department to lift a gag order on an FBI informant whom House leaders see as a key witness in their new uranium investigation.A White House official confirmed Friday that Trump had discussed the issue with staff and that White House counsel Donald McGahn relayed Trumps position to the Justice Department.But the official said Justice made its own decision on the issue.The partisan breakdown has rocked all but one committee investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, including the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the House Intelligence Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.The exception is the Senate Intelligence Committee.The breakdown also threatens to push the majority of congressional probes into Russia meddling into a political sideshow.It comes just days before Silicon Valley tech giants are scheduled to publicly testify on Capitol Hill about the details of Russias disinformation campaign and just months before lawmakers want to deliver their findings, in part to help the public avoid a similar crisis during the 2018 election.Republicans were careful to avoid focusing on Clinton as they launched one probe into former FBI director James B. Comeys handling of the Clinton email case and another into the Obama-era Justice Departments examination of Russian attempts to influence the U.S. nuclear industry.But Trump took no such precautions, stating Friday on Twitter that there was collusion with HC and Russia an apparent reference to his hotly disputed charge that Clinton helped secure a favorable ruling on the uranium deal in exchange for Russian contributions to her family foundation.[House GOP launches probes into Obama-era uranium deal, Clinton email inquiry] The developments prompted Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, to demand on Twitter a new investigation into whether the president personally intervened w DOJ to advance case against political opponent, something he called beyond disturbing.The White House official denied Friday that Trump had done anything inappropriate.Are we directing it?No.Are we welcoming it?Yes, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.Democrats have little power to make good on their threats beyond raising a political clamor.Schiff has no independent ability to subpoena sources or records without the cooperation of the committee chairman, Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who is the main force behind the House GOPs uranium probe, along with House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.).Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the Senate Judiciary Committees ranking Democrat, told reporters this week that Democrats on the panel largely would strike out on their own.But she faces a similar limitation in compelling sources to furnish documents and testimony.Nonetheless, on Friday Feinstein released copies of five letters seeking information that she had sent to the White House, Trumps personal lawyer Michael Cohen, the heads of Facebook and Twitter, and data firm Cambridge Analytica, which did work for the Trump campaign and whose chief executive had contact with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.As both sides press forward with their new probes, the political battle lines are forming along familiar fissures.The relationship between Judiciary Chairman Sen. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa) and Feinstein has long teetered between collegial and combative.Each side has accused the other of slowing the Russia investigation.Feinstein is frustrated that Grassley wants to couple the probe of Trumps Russia ties with inquiries into Clintons emails and the Russian uranium deal.Grassleys side maintains that Feinsteins resistance cost the committee a chance to interview former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in July, before his house was raided by federal agents.While Grassley has indicated a preference for cooperating with Feinstein going forward, there is little indication they will.This month, Grassley sent dozens of letters demanding information and interviews from various individuals connected to a June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer in Trump Tower, the FBIs Clinton email investigation, the Russian uranium deal and a dossier of salacious allegations about Trumps exploits in Moscow research that Clintons campaign and the DNC paid for.Feinsteins signature was not on any of them.[Clinton campaign, DNC paid for research that led to Russia dossier] In the House, divisions are even more severe.Nunes was accused this past spring of plotting with the White House to launch dubious claims that the names of Trump transition team officials appearing in surveillance reports had been improperly exposed.No evidence was found to support his conclusion, and Nunes under political pressure and an ethics inquiry ceded control of the Russia investigation to Rep. K. Michael Conaway (R-Tex.).Democrats are now accusing Nunes of similar coordination.Nunes and a White House official both said that they had not been in touch about the uranium investigation and were not working together.But Nunes did not rule out briefing the White House about his investigation in the future.Meanwhile, Gowdy and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) are partnering to examine the FBIs handling of Clintons email probe.They announced their investigation in the same hour as Nunes told the news media about his uranium probe.Apparently, if President Trump says jump, House Republicans say how high?And if he says heel, they stand down from conducting serious, credible oversight, the Oversight Committees ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), said in a statement this week.The next day, Cummings joined with the House Judiciary Committees ranking Democrat, Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), to send letters to Trumps campaign consultants, including Cambridge Analytica, demanding information.Cummings and Conyers do not have independent power to subpoena information from witnesses; on their committees, that power rests with the Republican chairman alone.Read more at PowerPost

On taxes, Trump is an eager salesman  but the policy action is on Capitol Hill:::::President Trump walks with Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), left, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), right, to the Senate Republican Policy Luncheon on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.(Matt McClain/The Washington Post) President Trump is cajoling Republican senators on the golf course.He is taking Democratic senators for rides on Air Force One.He is calling up fierce critics such as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) to find common cause.He is deploying his daughter and adviser, Ivanka, to pitch activists and swing suburban voters.And he is using his megaphone, Twitter, to boast about it all.On tax policy, the most consequential legislative fight of his presidency so far, Trump has emerged as a relentless salesman, proclaiming one promise after another.The tax cuts will be big, he tweets.Historic.The biggest TAX CUT in the history of our country.But for all the bustle emanating from the White House, most of the policy action is at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, in the Capitol, as Republicans try to rush through a sweeping tax cut package by the end of the year.Lawmakers are relying on the president to build public pressure.But on policy details, legislators are focused inwardly as they endeavor to write a bill that could pass the Senate.Republicans narrowly control the Senate, where some tensions are boiling over tax policy details as well as Trumps leadership in general.In the House, the administration faces other challenges including that some GOP lawmakers are tuning out Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn is acting as a key interlocutor with Capitol Hill on tax cut legislation.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) The secretary typically would serve as the administrations chief negotiator on anything related to tax policy.But House Republican leaders have made clear to the White House in recent weeks that they do not want Mnuchin, who has struggled to command respect on Capitol Hill, trying to negotiate with rank-and-file lawmakers, according to three people with direct knowledge of the situation.National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn whom Trump considers a master salesman and who gained firsthand experience with corporate tax policy during his years as a Goldman Sachs executive is serving as a key interlocutor with Capitol Hill, along with White House legislative affairs director Marc Short.White House officials said Mnuchin and Cohn are working in tandem, with the treasury secretary playing a more behind-the-scenes role in shaping the policy and promoting it.[Step one is done.But Republicans are still a long way from a tax bill becoming reality.]Hungry for a signature piece of legislation to sign, Trump is fully invested in the tax fight, his advisers said.President Trump is incredibly engaged and knows this issue really well, said Hope Hicks, the White House director of communications.To him, it represents so many different tenets of his core campaign promises job growth, economic development, bringing jobs and money back home from overseas, helping the forgotten men and women.Trump spends long stretches of his day working in his private dining room, just off the Oval Office, where he sits at the head of a table with a stack of newspapers and a phone beside him.The television often is turned to cable news, and advisers come and go for impromptu huddles.When the topic turns to the tax cut push, which happens more and more these days, Trump sometimes yells to his assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, to get one of the big six lawmakers on the phone to talk about his new idea, according to aides.But Trump is learning that his willfulness has its limitations, with many other forces within the Republican Party driving the process.As much as the president wants a win, congressional Republicans are asserting themselves as they turn to the details of legislating.Ivanka Trump, the presidents daughter and a White House senior adviser, speaks during a town hall meeting on tax reform in Richboro, Pa., on Monday.(Rich Schultz/AP) One of the most intense periods in the tax fight will come in early November.Legislators will release the bill, lobbyists will start picking it apart and Trump will be half a world away, on a 12-day tour of Asia.Lawmakers seem to be okay with that.Asked if he was concerned that Trump might tweet something that disrupts the carefully planned rollout of the tax legislation, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) deadpanned Thursday: Hes going to be in Asia.Ryan went on to say that he is working very, very closely with the White House.But Trump intends to stay involved while overseas, getting regular updates from staff and perhaps tweeting his views.Cohn will stay behind to work with Congress, and Vice President Pence and some Cabinet secretaries plan to do media interviews and hold public events to galvanize support, White House officials said.It is difficult to overstate the stakes for Republicans.The party has a unified government controlling both chambers in Congress and the White House but after a series of defeats is under intense pressure to prove it can govern effectively ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.For Republicans, this is existential, said Stephen Moore, a Heritage Foundation economist who advised Trump during last years campaign.For Trump specifically, Moore said, this is the big prize.Hes all-in on the tax bill.Having worked with him, I dont think he cares too much about the exact details of this.I think he wants a bill that helps the middle class and cuts the corporate tax.All the rest is just window dressing to him.[Major divisions remain as GOP near its tax deadline] David Stockman, who worked as President Ronald Reagans budget director the last time major tax reform was passed, in 1981, said Trump and congressional Republicans are barely out of the batters box.Trump is living up to his reputation as the great disrupter, Stockman said.I dont see the tax bill happening before year end.Even if something passes next year, it will be a pale shadow of what people are talking about and what the market seems to have priced in.On Wednesday, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.)plans to release his draft of the tax cut legislation, holding a committee vote on the measure the following week.The tax plan is based on several broad ideas, but many provisions remain unresolved.Trump and GOP congressional leaders want to slash the corporate tax rate far below 35 percent and simplify the taxes paid by families and individuals.They want to expand the child tax credit, eliminate the estate tax, and incentivize companies to bring money and jobs back to the United States.The tax plan would add at least $1.5 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years and, according to numerous budget experts, provide disproportionate benefits to companies and the wealthy.These are just some of the key issues Republicans are trying to address before they bring legislation to the House and the Senate for votes, worried that a few unhappy Republicans could kill the bill.One of those potential dealbreakers is Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), who met with Pence in his West Wing office this week.MacArthur said in an interview that he tried to convince Pence that the GOP tax plan could drive up taxes for people in his state.Pence heard MacArthur out but was noncommittal, telling him Trump wanted to cut everyones taxes.That was not the answer MacArthur was looking for, he said.He wanted substance and a commitment to detailed changes that would help New Jersey.The congressman then voted Thursday to try to block a GOP budget plan in an effort to thwart the entire tax cut push until his concerns were addressed.He did not succeed.Asked if the House Republican leaders were sympathetic to the points he tried to make to Pence at the meeting, MacArthur said, They are only sympathetic to votes.Many of the decisions about the bill are being made by Brady and his colleagues, which is one reason Pence did not have the power to promise MacArthur that he could make changes.Mnuchin and Cohn were able to persuade Ryan to back away from a demand that would have included a new way of taxing imports amid concerns that the change could drive up prices on items such as clothing, electronics and automobiles.But the administration made concessions in other areas.It fell to Mnuchin and Cohn last month to persuade a disappointed Trump to agree to a target for the corporate tax rate that was higher than the president had wanted.Trump had insisted for more than a year that the corporate tax rate should be lowered from 35 percent to 15 percent, but congressional Republicans stressed that this was not possible, as it would add too much to the debt.Trump ultimately agreed to a rate of 20 percent, which the White House views as an achievement, considering that some House Republicans argued that the rate should be closer to 25 percent.Still, there are other examples of GOP leaders ignoring some of Trumps demands.The biggest flash point came this week, when Trump announced in a Monday tweet that 401(k) plans would not be affected by the tax bill, apparently reacting to news reports that House Republicans were considering such changes.[Trump who?Republicans seem to be totally ignoring the president on taxes.]White House aides said the president is especially attuned to how the bill will play with middle-class voters and wanted to make clear that he would protect the popular retirement program.But several senior congressional Republican aides said they were rattled by Trumps unexpected declaration.And two days later, Brady told reporters that there still could be changes to these retirement accounts.Trump has tried to personally win over key Republican senators.He played golf with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on Oct. 15 at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where the three men chewed over tax policy.Trump also has golfed several times recently with Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who is emerging as a central mediator between the president and Senate Republicans.And Wednesday, Trump called McCain who earlier this month blasted Trumps half-baked, spurious nationalism to talk about taxes, and the two made plans to get together soon with Graham, according to a White House official.Ivanka Trump, meanwhile, pitched her child tax credit idea at a town hall meeting in Bucks County, Pa., outside Philadelphia.It cant just be about cutting taxes, she said.Ivanka Trump met recently with Grover Norquist, an anti-tax activist with deep influence among Republican lawmakers, to discuss the idea.Norquist said he told her that he respected her efforts but that the plan may not be passable.She may not be able to get the size or scope of what shes looking at, but this process isnt about getting everything in this specific bill, Norquist said, recalling how he described his outlook to her.It takes time, and there will be more than one plane out of Casablanca on taxes.The president has been trying to woo some Democratic senators to back his tax plan, targeting a handful who are running for reelection next year in states that he won handily.In late September, Trump invited Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.)to fly with him to Indianapolis for the presidents tax speech.During their conversations on Air Force One, Trump pledged to Donnelly that they could work together on taxes and build a bond, leading the senator to feel cautiously upbeat about the prospect of finding consensus, according to four people familiar with the exchanges.Donnellys mood soured, however, once Trump gave his speech at the Indiana State Fairgrounds.The president seemed to threaten the low-key, moderate senator in front of a large home state crowd by warning that we will campaign against him like you wouldnt believe if Donnelly voted against the tax bill.White House aides characterized Trumps remarks as well-intentioned, good-natured ribbing, but Donnelly felt burned by the experience and has since had little engagement with the White House, according to the people familiar with the episode.[Deficits, schmeficits: House conservatives cast aside fiscal warnings to make way for tax cuts] On Oct. 18, Trump gathered a bipartisan group from the Senate Finance Committee at the White House.With cameras rolling, the president leaned over the dark wooden table in the Cabinet Room to promise the largest tax cut in the history of our country.He then joked with Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), the committees ranking Democrat: Im sure well have unanimous support.I have no doubt, right?Right, Ron?I think.Right?Senators chuckled.But once the press corps left the room, there was an immediate disconnect between Trump and some of the Democrats, according to Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.).I said to him very directly, Its good to have this meeting, but I have to tell you, this plan, in my judgment, is a giveaway to the rich, Casey recalled in an interview, adding that he rattled off statistics from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center to make his point.Casey said he and other Democrats there wanted to make clear to Trump that bipartisan support could not be willed by the presidents liveliness.It had to be carefully negotiated, he said.But I just dont see it happening, Casey said.When Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) asked Trump to support two of his proposals on how to craft a middle-class tax cut, such as expanding the child tax credit, Trump seemed excited by the idea and said a new set of working groups could be set up.But later Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.)pushed back against Browns suggestion and said that while he welcomed Democratic input, the committee structure currently in place would drive the talks, according to three people who were briefed on the discussions.As the meeting wrapped up, Trump vaguely warned that he may hound senators who vote against the bill by visiting their states and rallying against them ahead of the midterm elections.He said if those people didnt support a tax cut, it could be pretty tough, recalled Casey, who is up for reelection in 2018.Ill just say, maybe he was offering a price.
Gary Johnson is back, and hes never running for office again:::::Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson at the Libertarian Partys national convention in Orlando in May 2016.(John Raoux/Associated Press) I thought there was no chance that Trump could win, said Gary Johnson.This could be the end of the republic as we know it.It was Wednesday morning, less than 24 hours after Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) had announced that he would reject the politics of President Trump by retiring.Johnson, the 2016 (and 2012) Libertarian Party nominee for president, was in town for another sort of protest.He had sued to be included in the 2016 presidential debates, and he was filing the same lawsuit in another court.Not that he was running for president.Im never going to be a candidate again, said Johnson over a latte in downtown Washington.I dont aspire to be president of the United States anymore, because Trump holds the office.Politics is just toxic.In Arizona, theres going to be crazies running for office.Thats because of Trump crazies are lining up to run.And theyre obsessed with immigration!You know, DACAs one of the most successful immigration programs of all time and space.Wow!A lot of excitement to end rigged 2party debates!See u @SCOTUS 5pm ET #DroptheHammer https://t.co/MuZMPf7OJD Gov.Gary Johnson (@GovGaryJohnson) October 26, 2017 Johnson, who turned 64 this year, was the highest vote-getter of any third-party candidate since the 1990s.He had wanted to win that he did not is part on himself, part on the Commission on Presidential Debates.Instead, he had collected 4,489,235 votes, the most in the Libertarian Partys history, and gotten that party on a few more state ballots.And then, he disappeared.That was always the plan, if he lost.(Johnsons friendly, scattered mien led some to think he was joking.)Johnson vacationed in Aruba, then spent 110 days skiing, then trained for a bike ride across the continental divide, from Mexico to Canada.I did it in 35 days, Johnson said proudly.The record is 14.I think everything being equal I can knock between three and seven days off that time when I do it again.I havent missed a beat, athletically, since Thanksgiving.For a short time in 2016, Johnson speculated about blowing up the two-party system.There had never been a better chance, with two cosmically unpopular candidates nominated by the Democrats and Republicans.He cracked into double digits in some polls, better in some states, but Hillary Clintons campaign must have spent $50 million to stop that.Johnson, who is not bitter about much, is bitter about that.He remembers the Web ads Snapchat ads that showed him speculating about space mining and muffing a question about the war in Syria.An online search for his name still, in October 2017, suggests Aleppo as a companion term If you saw that, youd think I was the dumbest [expletive] on the planet, Johnson said.But the campaign was only partially successful.The Libertarians did beat their records, and turn hundreds of thousands of young and first-time voters into party-crashers.Johnson mostly escaped the rage directed at Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate who got more votes in Michigan and Wisconsin than the winning margin for President Trump.In both states, Johnson tripled up her vote.When she instantly raised millions of dollars to recount the election, he was already out of the country.I think that money ended up in the Green Partys coffers, Johnson said.Neither the Libertarians nor the Greens, with their breakthrough votes, have done much in the shocked country that the election built.Both the Democratic and Republican parties, in many states, have shed voters; the Libertarians have gained some.Just not too many, Johnson said.Theyre up by leaps and bounds, he says, but when you start out at such a low number, leaps and bounds doesnt say as much.Johnson, by his own admission, was not doing anything to help.He was not campaigning for Cliff Hyra, the Libertarian nominee in next months Virginia gubernatorial election.He had not heard much from Libertarians who wanted a star speaker something he heard a lot of between 2012 and 2016.Mostly, he was surprised that the party had not grown and won since he retreated into retirement.How can the Libertarian Party not gain in this kind of environment?Johnson asked.What the Libertarian Party needs is to win, for someone to actually govern.Heres a person with libertarian principles heres how he governed.Anything!Anything, above dogcatcher.The lingering question is: How?Johnson returned to the subject of Flake, who inveighed against Trump like a Roman senator warning about Caesar and then, basically, said that it was up to someone else to fix the Republican Party.Nobody is saying the emperor has no clothes, Johnson said.Hes getting away with stuff that nobody would have gotten away with.It is crazy.It is crazy.Its just amazing to me that every day, theres a new page.The page turns, and it gets crazier.Why, then, wasnt the Libertarian Party surging?Why hadnt Johnson who tried to define the LP as a safe alternative to two dangerous extremes done better?Pro-choice, but anti-taxes.Antiwar, pro-criminal justice reform.The Johnson-branded LPs agenda lined up, in polls, with millions of voters, who then chose sides between Trump and Clinton.Why?Johnson blamed his own way with words.He could not think that the country really wanted what Trump offered.I maintain that what came out of my mouth reflected the feelings of a majority, he said, but Im not a spokesman.For years, peaking with Ron Pauls 2012 presidential bid and Johnsons 2016 bid, libertarians said they were destined to break through.Blaming Johnsons gaffes was one way to explain why they faltered.Another, more pessimistic take was that libertarianism simply could not command majority support.Inside the GOP, libertarian-leaning politicians such as Flake had come around to that conclusion.Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), an ally of the Pauls, said that campaigning for them and against Trump convinced him that voter anger was not really about the desire for smaller government.I thought they were voting for libertarian Republicans, he said in March.But after some soul searching, I realized when they voted for Rand and Ron and me in these primaries, they werent voting for libertarian ideas they were voting for the craziest son of a b- in the race.Asked about Massies comment, Johnson agreed with the premise: Voters had wanted the crazy candidate.Trump was the one who was going to blow things up, he said.Make everybody think youre crazy, and then at the end, show youre not so crazy.Well, he did everything but the last part.Johnson, having been confident about where the country needed to go in 2016, was no longer making predictions.It would be good for Libertarians if someone like Flake jumped over, he said, but he didnt see why he would.Hed find out what I found out, said Johnson, referring to ballot and debate rules.(Austin Petersen, the runner-up for the 2016 LP nomination, has since left to run as a Republican for Senate from Missouri.)At the same time, Flake was willing to predict the end of the GOP, the only party hed won elections with.I think the Republican Partys done for, he said, at the end of Trumps tenure.Why did he think that, given that the party had done fairly well in elections all year?Because of the crazies, the people hed mentioned before.But why would the crazies lose?Asked when and how voters would reject right-wing politics, Johnson kept speculating that politicians were simply stuck in a feedback loop.Presidential nominees needed to win in New Hampshire and Iowa, and Republican voters there demanded anti-immigration policies.Thats what a candidate has to do to win the nomination, he said.Johnsons repeated criticism of Trump prompted an obvious question, one he got visibly sick of in 2016.Trump, he acknowledged, posed a unique threat to the country.Trump made him worry about nuclear war.But unlike Bill Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts who ran as Johnsons vice presidential nominee last year, Johnson was unwilling to suggest that Clinton would have been a better choice.I never got on the lesser evil thing, he said.The republic, he said, would have been in some danger had she won less, but some.You know that during Hillarys entire tenure, it was going to be about the emails, Johnson said.It was going to be about pay-to-play.I pointed out that in conservative media, the defeated Clinton was still being hounded over the scandals that sunk her in 2016.Yeah, I guess she is, Johnson said.
Trump says sex harassment claims are fake news, but there are corroborators:::::Jessica Leeds was one of 16 women who came forward during the 2016 campaign to accuse Donald Trump of sexual harassment.Their claims, however, did not stop him from getting elected to the most powerful office in the world.(Alice Li/The Washington Post) All I can say is its totally fake news.Its just fake.Its fake.Its made-up stuff, and its disgraceful, what happens, but that happens in the world of politics.President Trump, remarks to reporters, Oct. 16, 2017 Jacqueline Alemany of CBS News: Obviously, sexual harassment has been in the news.At least 16 women accused the president of sexually harassing them throughout the course of the campaign.Last week, during a news conference in the Rose Garden, the president called these accusations fake news.Is the official White House position that all of these women are lying?White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders: Yeah, weve been clear on that from the beginning, and the presidents spoken on it.exchange on Oct. 27 As Alemany noted, 16 women have accused Trump of sexually harassing them.While the president dismisses this as fake news, the problem for the White House is that some of these women have produced witnesses who say they heard about the incident at the time long before Trump made his political aspirations known.Such contemporaneous accounts are essential to establishing the credibility of the allegation because they reduce the chances that a person is making up a story for political purposes.In the case of sexual allegations, such accounts can help bolster the credibility of the she said side of the equation.Often, a sexual assault will happen behind closed doors.The contemporary corroborators can explain what they heard at the time and whether the story being told now is consistent with how the story was told years earlier.This does not necessarily mean the allegation is true, but it does give journalistic organizations more confidence to report on the allegation.Below is a summary of the corroborators provided by three of the women who have accusations, drawn from a fact check written during the presidential campaign.That fact check also detailed the witnesses who backed up claims of sexual accusations against former president Bill Clinton who, like Trump, insisted the women accusing him were not telling the truth.Readers can judge for themselves.Kristin Anderson Her allegation: While at a Manhattan nightclub in the early 1990s, Trump slid his fingers under her miniskirt, moved up her inner thigh and touched her vagina through her underwear.Corroborators: Kelly Stedman, a friend.She said she was told about the incident at a womens brunch a few days later.The women found themselves laughing at how pathetic it was on Trumps part.Brad Trent, a New York photographer.He says he heard the story from Anderson at a dinner in 2007.It was just girls saying stories about how they got hit on by creepy old guys, Trent said of the conversation around the table.Natasha Stoynoff Her allegation: While interviewing Trump in 2005 for an article for People magazine about the first anniversary of his third marriage, Trump lured her into a room at Mar-a-Lago and abruptly kissed her, forcing his tongue down her throat.He then said they were going to have an affair.Corroborators: Marina Grasic, who has known Stoynoff for more than 25 years.She said she got a call from her friend the day after the attack, detailing exactly how Trump pushed Stoynoff against a wall.Liz McNeil, at the time a reporter for People (she is now an editor).She said that she heard about the incident the day after Stoynoff returned from her assignment.She was very upset and told me how he shoved her against a wall, she said.Mary Green, another People reporter (now editor) who had just returned to New York.In an early conversation we had in her office, she told me about what happened with Donald Trump, Green said.She was shaky, sitting at her desk, relaying that, He took me to this other room, and when we stepped inside, he pushed me against a wall and stuck his tongue down my throat.Melania was upstairs and could have walked in at any time.Liza Hamm, part of a tightknit group of friends.Natasha has always been a vivacious person who wants to believe in the best of people, and this experience definitely messed with that outlook, she said.Paul McLaughlin, Stoynoffs former journalism professor.He said Stoynoff called him at the time of the alleged incident seeking advice on how to handle it: She didnt know what to do, she was very conflicted, she was angry, she was really confused about how to deal with this.After a discussion, he said, Stoynoff decided it would be best if she kept the incident to herself.Rachel Crooks Her allegation: Trump in 2005 kissed her directly on the lips after she introduced herself and said she was a receptionist who worked for a company that did business with Trump.Corroborators: Brianne Webb, her sister.She said Crooks called her immediately about the incident as soon as she returned to her desk.Being from a town of 1,600 people, being naive, I was like, Are you sure he didnt just miss trying to kiss you on the cheek?She said, No, he kissed me on the mouth.I was like, That is not normal.Clint Hackenburg, her boyfriend at the time.After he asked her that evening how her day had gone, she paused for a second, and then started hysterically crying.(About our rating scale) Send us facts to check by filling out this form Keep

Haley urges Congo leader to hold elections soon or risk international backlash:::::U.N.Ambassador Nikki Haley on Friday demanded that this authoritarian nation hold delayed national elections next year, saying continued international backing for a nation that hosts the largest United Nations peacekeeping mission is at stake.The president must say that were going to have elections in 2018, Haley said ahead of a meeting with President Joseph Kabila, whose term expired last year without a vote.We will not support with funding, resources, anything, if the calendar does not specifically specify no later than 2018 for these elections to happen.It was one of the strongest messages yet from the United States to the leader of this nominal democracy plagued by political repression and where corruption and the detention of journalists is commonplace.This is not a democracy unless the peoples voices are heard, Haley said.We will not support, we will not condone, elections being put off any longer.She later met alone with Kabila at his palatial waterside compound, which includes an enormous statue of his assassinated father out front.It was a firm, candid conversation, Haley said in an interview afterward.We had a conversation about what its like to be a leader.We had a conversation about what is a democracy.We had a conversation about the quality of life of people.We had a conversation about the importance of elections.[Would Haley replace Tillerson at State?She says no.]Kabila does not meet regularly with visiting Western representatives.The unexpectedly long 90-minute session with Haley was more notable because of her public warnings and criticism of a leader she partly blames for a searing humanitarian crisis she witnessed firsthand on Thursday.Haley cried after visiting a United Nations camp housing about 15,000 Congolese forced from their homes by unrest in North Kivu, the remote, lush and dangerous center of cyclical violence that has included mass rape and the abduction of children for use as soldiers and sex slaves.U.N. agencies count 4.5 million Congolese displaced within the country or elsewhere as refugees.Haley walked through muddy, rock-strewn Mungote camp with a woman identified only as Angelique, who told Haley she had been raped in front of her seven children and abandoned by her husband.None of them can leave the camp for fear of various armed groups that prey on locals, the woman said.Haley, looking stricken, hugged Angelique and stood with an arm around her as she cried quietly.When she boarded a U.N. helicopter to leave, scores of children, some in rags, ran to the edge of the landing zone to wave.Aboard the helicopter, Haley cried and put her head in her hands.The reason I got emotional today was the hundred-plus kids that were chasing our cars and seeing us off.All I kept thinking was, whats going to happen to them?Haley said afterward.The sad reality, as it looks now, is that they are going to end up just like their parents.Congo was Haleys final stop on a three-nation visit to Africa focused on delivering tough messages about the limits of U.S. support and countering the spread of violent extremism on the continent.She also visited Ethiopia and South Sudan.In Congo, Haley met with the national election commission and with Catholic elders attempting to broker a solution to the election impasse.She warned against prolonging elections into 2019 or after, saying that would risk the loss of international legitimacy.Kabila has held power since 2001, following the assassination of his father, longtime dictator Laurent Kabila.At 46, he is among the youngest of Africas strongmen.He blames election delays on problems with voter registration and poor security.Aid groups and political observers here say they doubt he will submit to elections anytime soon, and the vocal political opposition accuses him of trying to do an end run around constitutional bars to a third term.Congo government spokesman Lambert Mende said the government wants an election as soon as possible.Its not up to the government, nor to Ms. Haley, to organize the elections, Mende said in a statement, according to Reuters.I dont think that we can be subjected to these kinds of diktats.The head of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Congo has said that international donors have put forward only about 6 percent of the estimated $123 million needed to support an election.Every day we dont have elections in this country, another woman gets raped, another child becomes a soldier, Haley said.All of this has to stop, and the only way they will stop is if we have peaceful elections.
A new reminder that we may never know Hurricane Marias full toll on Puerto Rico:::::President Trump takes part in the distribution of food and supplies at a church in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, on Oct. 3.(Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images) It has been more than a month since Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico.A little less than three-quarters of the island still lacks electricity; earlier this week, the islands former governor shared a photograph of surgeons performing an operation by the light of their cellphones.This is what POTUS calls a 10!Surgery performed with cellphones as flashlights in Puerto Rico today.pic.twitter.com/5pnK5dkkE6 Alejandro (@agarciapadilla) October 21, 2017 Lets assume a worst-case scenario for a patient who is being treated under such conditions.Power is out because of Maria, but, should something go wrong during that surgery, does Maria bear the blame?Its easy to tick off a number of qualifying conditions that would need to be considered: The original condition, what went wrong during the surgery, etc.But this is an example of where data on fatalities in Puerto Rico post-Maria get blurry.Each death is unfortunate, but which deaths might not have happened if Maria had never come ashore?We looked at this question earlier this month, speaking with Joe Trainor of the University of Delawares Disaster Recovery Center.The long and short of it is, no matter what system exists, theres a lot of gray involved in how you will attribute any specific death during this time period, Trainor said, whether you decide its directly or indirectly related to the event itself.Getting hit by a tree branch during hurricane-force winds is one thing.Being unable to immediately get medicine for a chronic condition and dying weeks later?Thats another.Why does that tally matter?A number of reasons, but perhaps the most immediate is that President Trump, during his visit to the island, praised the low death toll (at that point, 16) as an indicator of how much less devastating Maria was to Puerto Rico than Hurricane Katrina was to New Orleans in 2005.(By extension, Trump was saying that his handling of Maria was better than President George W. Bushs of Katrina.)Since that visit, the official total has risen to 51.On Friday, CBS Newss David Begnaud, who has been doing exceptional coverage of the storms aftermath, relayed a statement he had received from the spokesman for Puerto Ricos secretary of public safety, the person responsible for the certified tally of deaths from Maria.Medical examiner in Puerto Rico has authorized 911 cremations of natural deaths since Hurricane Maria https://t.co/65e2pJsW3s pic.twitter.com/8x24XtlK9M David Begnaud (@DavidBegnaud) October 27, 2017 The statement: From the 20th of September to the 18th of October, the medical examiner [for the entire island] authorized 911 cremations of natural deaths.Keep in mind that not all the bodies of persons who died in Puerto Rico go to the medical examiner.But, by law, the medical examiner gives authorization for cremations.The medical examiner analyzes the death summary and the death certificate.If something is suspicious, they assign the case to the pathologist and they can stop the process.They can claim the body and/or call the families for an interview.That 911 people have been cremated suggests a death toll much higher than 51.But notice the caveat: natural deaths.Even had Maria not hit Puerto Rico, people would still have died from old age or car accidents or disease.The implication is that these 911 deaths fit into that category and therefore shouldnt be added to the storms death toll.The question that arises is whether or not that total is abnormally high.If 911 is a lot of deaths for a normal month in Puerto Rico, it may indicate that some hurricane-related deaths are not being counted as such.In 2014, the most recent year for which data were available, 30,152 people died in Puerto Rico.We know from an analysis of national fatality data compiled by ABC News several years ago that there are more deaths in the winter months, correlated to flu season.Between 1995 and 2002, 8.5 percent of deaths in the United States occurred in October.If we assume the same distribution applies in Puerto Rico, that would suggest that some 2,500 people died on Puerto Rico in October 2014.(The CDC did not provide specific figures to The Post by the time this article was published.)In other words, 911 deaths in the month after the landfall would not be abnormally high at all.Begnauds reporting was a response to an article at BuzzFeed detailing how various funeral homes on the island had handled the past month.In several cases, about half of the bodies that the homes had received had been cremated.If we assume that the 911 cremations reported by Begnaud is similarly only half of the deaths, the tally is still not unusually high.Regardless, were still left with the question of where in the gray area those 911 deaths might fall.Part of the statement conveyed by Begnaud was obviously meant to tamp down speculation that the territorial government is covering up hurricane-related deaths by outlining the process by which questions get answered.The death toll is a political issue, but then it always is, as Trainors colleague Benigno Aguirre told us.Sometimes politicians want higher totals (in order to get more foreign aid, for example) and sometimes lower as in the case of Trump and, presumably, some Puerto Rican officials.We asked Trainor when we might have a final, accurate tally of precisely how many people died in the storm.The reality is, he said, we probably will never know.
Theresa May demands reforms as sex toy minister investigated:::::Theresa May has called for a binding code of conduct for MPs as one of her ministers is investigated following his admission he asked a former aide to buy sex toys.The Prime Minister has urged House of Commons Speaker John Bercow to act to ensure the standing of Parliament doesn't sink lower amid a sexual harassment scandal engulfing Westminster.In a letter copied to the leaders of all other Westminster parties, the Prime Minister told Mr Bercow: "I would be grateful if you would be able to use your office to assist me in doing all we can to ensure the reputation of Parliament is not damaged further by allegations of impropriety".Mrs May said the House of Commons "must now go further" than the 24/7 confidential hotline already in place for parliamentary staff.Image: Westminster has been engulfed by a sexual harassment scandal The Prime Minister raised the prospect of a code of conduct with "legal standing" as well as "a contractually binding grievance procedure available for all MPs".Mrs May suggested current disciplinary procedures for MPs' employees do not have the "required teeth" because "contractually an MP does not have to follow the procedure".She said: "I do not believe that this situation can be tolerated any longer.It is simply not fair on staff, many of whom are young and in their first job post-education."Image: Theresa May said current procedures lack 'teeth' The Prime Minister added: "It is vital that staff and the public have confidence in Parliament and resolving this employment irregularity on a cross-party basis can play an important role in this."The Westminster scandal broke following the revelation female staff in Parliament use a WhatsApp group to warn each other about senior figures from across political parties.Mrs May's actions follow reports she gets weekly updates about indiscretions by her MPs from Conservative Party whips, leading to calls for allegations to be reported to police.Earlier on Sunday, the Prime Minister asked the Cabinet Office to probe whether International Trade minister Mark Garnier breached the Ministerial Code after he confirmed allegations made by his former secretary, including that he called her "sugar t***".Married father-of-three Mr Garnier told the Mail on Sunday he did not contest the claims against him and conceded it could "look like dinosaur behaviour", but strongly denied sexual harassment.The former investment banker claimed his reference to ex-aide Caroline Edmondson as "sugar t***" was part of "an amusing conversation" based on TV comedy Gavin & Stacey, which uses the phrase.He also described asking married Ms Edmondson to buy sex toys as "good-humoured high jinks" after a Christmas lunch, with Mr Garnier claiming he told her he did not think it was a good idea.Ms Edmondson, who stopped working for the MP shortly after the incidents in 2010, disputed Mr Garnier's version of events, telling the newspaper: "He has lied."The MP described Ms Edmondson as a "disgruntled" former employee.Image: Stephen Crabb said he accepted 'any kind of sexual chatter like this is totally wrong' Meanwhile, former Cabinet minister Stephen Crabb admitted to being "foolish" by sending explicit messages to a 19-year-old woman he interviewed for a job in 2013.The Preseli Pembrokeshire MP, who stood for the Conservative leadership last year, told the Mail on Sunday: "We exchanged messages which talked about sex but none of it was meant seriously."We met for coffee and had a glass of wine once at the Commons but nothing more."I accept any kind of sexual chatter like this is totally wrong and I am sorry for my actions."The sexual harassment scandal has also seen allegations made against unnamed figures from other parties.Downing Street is said to be fearing the row could prompt an emergency Cabinet reshuffle, amid claims it also involves senior ministers.
Northern Ireland parties in late push to save Stormont:::::Northern Ireland's two largest parties have just hours left to reach agreement on restoring devolved government or face the return of direct rule from Westminster.Ten months after the power-sharing administration collapsed, the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein will resume negotiations on Monday in a last-ditch effort to save Stormont.Speaking to students at Bloomfield Collegiate Prize Day, DUP leader Arlene Foster MLA, said: "I do, of course, want to see the Assembly back up and running again, I have made no secret of it, because I believe that is what's best for Northern Ireland and for the people of Northern Ireland."On Sunday night, DUP sources told Sky News the party wanted to restore the devolved government in March and resolve outstanding issues out "in tandem."They said Sinn Fein would have to realise that an agreement will only be possible "when they drop red line demands".It is understood the DUP is urging the Northern Ireland Secretary to bring forward a budget to stabilise government, rather than "cobble together" an agreement.Image: James Brokenshire has said that 'time is marching on' for a Stormont deal Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire MP has publicly stated that they need a deal by Monday or Westminster, not Stormont, will set Northern Ireland's budget.But Sinn Fein says there can be no going back to direct rule when the current government at Westminster is propped up by the DUP.Sinn Fein negotiator Conor Murphy MLA explained: "The British government, without any regard for the demands of our peace process and the political impasse we were in at the time, struck a deal with the DUP."Part of that deal is that the DUP have given them a blank cheque in terms of Brexit legislation.The impact of Brexit will be felt most keenly in Ireland.The DUP know that so that creates added difficulties."Image: Martin McGuinness (L) and Ian Paisley at Stormont in 2007 It was January when Martin McGuinness resigned as Deputy First Minister, bringing to an end 10 years of power-sharing between the DUP and Sinn Fein.He died two months later and the two parties have so far been unable to resolve differences over an Irish Language Act and gay marriage.A return of direct rule could unsettle the Irish government just when the Prime Minister needs their support to secure a Brexit deal in Brussels.But the DUP will oppose Dublin having any role in the governance of Northern Ireland and Theresa May needs their support to survive at Westminster.It would not be easy keeping the DUP on board and the Irish government content if Stormont is facing its greatest crisis in a decade.
Gordon Brown 'feared he might go blind' when he was prime minister:::::Gordon Brown has described for the first time the dramatic moment he feared he would go blind when he was prime minister.He was already blind in one eye and suffered a loss of vision in the other after a blow to the head in a rugby match as a teenager.The sudden deterioration in his sight happened in 2009 and was reported at the time, but Downing Street sources described it then as "no big deal".It came at a low point in Mr Brown's premiership, after a failed coup against him by Labour plotters and amid speculation about his health and his failing eyesight.Now, in an extract from his memoir, My Life, Our Time, Mr Brown has candidly revealed what happened and how he planned for eye surgery."When I woke up in Downing Street one Monday in September (2009), I knew something was very wrong.My vision was foggy," he wrote."That morning, I was to visit the City Academy in Hackney to speak about our education reform agenda."I kept the engagement, doing all I could to disguise the fact that I could see very little - discarding the prepared notes and speaking extemporaneously."Image: Mr Brown kept the eyesight problems a closely guarded secret at the time As soon as the event was over, Mr Brown was driven to the consulting room of a prominent surgeon at the Moorfields Eye Hospital in London."To my shock, in examining my right eye, he discovered that the retina was torn in two places and said that an operation was urgently needed.He generously agreed to operate that Sunday," he wrote.On his way out, Mr Brown asked if an old friend, Hector Chawla, who had treated him in the past, could be invited to give a second opinion.He saw him the day the operation was due to take place."I was already prepared for surgery when he examined me and said he was convinced that the tears had not happened in the past few days.They were not new but longstanding," Mr Brown wrote."His advice was blunt.There was no point in operating unless the sight deteriorated further.Laser surgery in my case was more of a risk than it was worth."Mr Brown - who kept the new eyesight problems a closely guarded secret at the time - said he feels "lucky beyond words" that the retina has continued to hold."Even if I felt fate had dealt me a hand I would not have chosen, my time in and out of hospital - and the fight for my eyesight - gave me a perspective that I still feel helps me to be more understanding of difficulties facing others in a far worse position than me," he wrote.Image: Mr Brown admits he struggled in an era of 'touchy feely' politics In his book, Mr Brown also admits he struggled to communicate with voters in an era of "touchy feely" politics and Twitter."During my time as an MP I never mastered the capacity to leave a good impression or sculpt my public image in 140 characters," he writes."In a far more touchy-feely era, our leaders speak of public issues in intensely personal ways and assume they can win votes simply by telling their electors that they 'feel their pain'."I fully understand that in a media-conscious age every politician has to lighten up to get a message across and I accept that, in the second decade of the 21st century, a sense of personal reserve can limit the appeal and rapport of a leader.Image: Barack Obama and Gordon Brown in Washington in 2008 "I am not, I hope, remote, off-hand or uncommunicative.But if I wasn't an ideal fit for an age when the personal side of politics had come to the fore, I hope people will come to understand this was not an aloofness or detachment or, I hope, insensitivity or a lack of emotional intelligence on my part."Really, to my mind, what mattered was not what I said about myself, but simply what our government could do for our country."While he helped to secure a worldwide recovery plan following the crash, Mr Brown said his inability to communicate more effectively meant he was unable to persuade voters to back his vision of the way forward."My own biggest regret was that in the greatest peacetime challenge - a catastrophic global recession - I could not persuade the British people that the progressive policies I pushed for, nationally and internationally, were the right and fairest way to respond," he writes."We won the battle - to escape recession.But we lost the war - to build something better.I fell short in communicating my ideas.I failed to rally the nation around the necessary fiscal stimulus and my plans for radical change.":: My Life, Our Times by Gordon Brown is out on 7 November .
Union boss Len McCluskey warns Corbyn critics and predicts 2019 election:::::Union boss Len McCluskey has issued a chilling warning to Labour MPs opposed to Jeremy Corbyn, telling them: "Move forward with us, or move over.Get out of the way."The leader of the giant Unite union predicted a post-Brexit General Election in 2019 and claimed the political elite is "scared stiff" of a Corbyn victory.Mr McCluskey, whose union donated 2.4m to Labour's General Election campaign in June, is Mr Corbyn's chief cheerleader and a massively influential power broker in the party.His warning to the party's MPs to back Mr Corbyn or else suggests he and his union are prepared to back a de-selection purge of the Labour leader's critics.Speaking at a Unite conference at Aviemore, in the Scottish Highlands, Mr McCluskey forecast a 2019 General Election if the Government fails to reach a deal with Brussels on Brexit."If there's no deal I believe the Government will fall and we will have a General Election," he said."And I think there would be a real chance of Labour winning that election and Corbyn coming to power."Image: The union boss claimed the political elite is 'scared stiff' of a Jeremy Corbyn victory Mr McCluskey said he never believed claims after June's election, in which Theresa May lost the Tories' Commons majority, that there could be another election this year."The Tories exist for one reason only and that is to have power," he said."I knew she wouldn't give up power and the Tories wouldn't give up power.""My prediction, more a hope, is that we have a General Election in 2019."I believe that the issue of Brexit and the likelihood at the moment of no deal - and the powers that be will do everything to come up with a deal because what does look to be a certainty is if they come back with a no deal then Parliament will reject it."The DUP couldn't support it, because of the issue of the hard border in Ireland, there's a number of Tories who couldn't support it and Labour and the SNP would reject it and Theresa May would fall."Then I think we would be into an election in 2019."Image: Theresa May 'would fall' in the event of a no deal Brexit, the Unite chief predicted Mr McCluskey, a hardline left-winger branded "Red Len" by critics, claimed the political elite would "move heaven and Earth" to prevent the UK from exiting the EU without a deal."One thing that they are scared stiff of at the moment is a Corbyn Labour government," he said."If this was Tony Blair or Gordon Brown or Ed Miliband, they would be more relaxed."With Corbyn they are scared stiff that a Labour government under his leadership will actually change the power axis within our nation."He told his union's activists: "That's how close we are, that is what is within our grasp."We now have an opportunity to transform our society, so I'm hoping for 2019 and I do believe Brexit is the issue that could bring this Government down."Mr McCluskey said the Tory Government was "on its last legs" and said ministers were "stumbling around, reeling from every punch - usually self-inflicted, while the Prime Minister and her Cabinet cling to the ropes for survival".Before the General Election, the Unite chief said winning 200 seats would be a successful campaign for Labour, but he now claims many of the Labour MPs elected in June benefited from a "Corbyn bounce".And, after his warning to Mr Corbyn's critics get out of the way, Mr McCluskey said: "We have an exciting, real chance for change in this country, to reverse years of neglect and build a better tomorrow."
Labour frontbencher: 'No place' for suspended MP Jared O'Mara:::::A suspended Labour MP has "no place" in Parliament over his "reprehensible" views, a shadow minister has suggested.Shadow communities and local government secretary Andrew Gwynne claimed there is "no excuse" for comments made by Jared O'Mara, who is facing an investigation by Labour officials.The Sheffield Hallam MP had the party's whip withdrawn earlier this week amid a probe into his "comments and behaviour".It follows the emergence of a string of Mr O'Mara's historical online comments, together with claims he used transphobic slurs and called a woman he dated an "ugly b****".Speaking to Sky News' Sunday with Niall Paterson show, Mr Gwynne said: "I find those comments absolutely despicable."Let me make it absolutely clear there is no place in the Labour Party for homophobia, for sexism, for misogyny and for racism."Video: Gwynne: O'Mara's comments were 'despicable' Asked how Mr O'Mara was able to stand as a Labour parliamentary candidate in June, Mr Gwynne - who is the party's national elections coordinator - said: "As part of the investigation we need to look at how the procedures for selection and the choice of Mr O'Mara were adhered to by the party."That is part of the investigation because nobody holding those views, in my view, has a place in modern democracy."Also commenting on the row, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told the BBC the suspended MP had expressed "quite unacceptable language about women".She said: "Where you have that sort of language and where you have that sort of harassment and sexual micro-aggression, it demeans and diminishes all women."That's why it's important to take a strong line."Both Mr Gwynne and Ms Abbott denied having prior knowledge of Mr O'Mara's comments before they emerged this week.Image: Jared O'Mara beat former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg in June But the wife of former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who Mr O'Mara defeated for his Sheffield Hallam seat in June's General Election, insisted the party knew about his comments before he was elected to Parliament.Miriam Gonzalez Durantez told ITV: "The issue is not the comments he may have made."The issue is the Labour Party allowed a candidate to be presented as a progressive candidate when clearly he had deeply regressive views and they knew."They knew before the election because my husband knew and even I knew."So the issue there is the hypocrisy of now trying to claim that nobody knew about this."Mr O'Mara has described himself as "deeply ashamed" of his online comments and claimed he has been on a "journey of education" since making them.He strenuously denies claims he verbally abused a woman he met on a dating app earlier this year, branding the allegations "categorically untrue".
Government risks anger over 'plans to allow prisoners to vote':::::The Government is risking backbench anger amid reports prisoners are to be granted the vote.Justice Secretary David Lidington is ready to unveil plans to overturn the current blanket ban on prisoners voting in any elections, it has emerged.According to the Sunday Times, ministers have been informed of a proposal to allow those criminals who are let out on day-release to head to polling stations.Under current laws, prisoners are barred from voting in any elections, despite the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) consistently ruling since 2005 that the legislation must be changed.In 2011, MPs overwhelmingly voted to keep the ban in defiance of the Strasbourg court, while former prime minister David Cameron once said the idea of prisoners voting made him feel "physically ill".The Government was warned any move to partially lift the complete ban would again face strong opposition in the House of Commons.Image: All prisoners are currently banned from casting a ballot Prominent Conservative backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg told Sky News: "It is not a proposal I support while it seems an odd subject to raise now."It has no popular or Parliamentary backing and there is no pressure to act."I would have thought the Government had enough to do of a more important kind."Fellow Tory MP Peter Bone described the decision as "bonkers".But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott signalled moves to allow some prisoners the vote could attract Labour frontbench support.She told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: "The European Court of Human Rights has been saying for some years that we can't stop all prisoners having the vote."The Labour Party believes that we should indeed, in the end, we have to support the position of the European Court of Human Rights."In 2011, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was a teller for those MPs who voted to lift the ban.Image: The European Court of Human Rights has consistently told Britain to ditch the ban The Government's reported plans are said to involve allowing "hundreds" of prisoners, who are still on the electoral roll and allowed out on day-release, to vote.People drop off the electoral roll after 12 months, with prisoners not allowed to apply to rejoin it while they are still serving custodial sentences.A senior government source told the newspaper: "This will only apply to a small number of people who remain on the electoral roll and are let out on day-release."These are not murderers and rapists but prisoners who are serving less than a year who remain on the electoral roll."No one will be allowed to register to vote if they are still behind bars."Responding to the Sunday Times report, a Government spokesperson said: "We do not comment on speculation."Our policy on prisoner voting is well established - it remains a matter for the UK to determine, and offenders in prison cannot vote."
Michael Gove 'sorry' over Harvey Weinstein sex assault joke on Today programme:::::Michael Gove has sparked outrage by making a joke about sexual assault on the BBC's flagship radio news programme.The Environment Secretary was appearing on a 60th anniversary edition of Today, aired before a live audience.Asked by host John Humphrys about the challenge of facing an interview on the show, Mr Gove replied: "Sometimes I think that coming into the studio with you John is a bit like going into Harvey Weinstein's bedroom."Video: Hear Michael Gove's joke about sex assault.He is seen here with Lord Kinnock and John Humphrys.Pic: BBC The remark was met with laughter and some applause from the audience at London's Wigmore Hall.Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock, who was also appearing as a guest on the show, said: "John goes way past groping...way past groping.""You just pray that you emerge with your dignity intact," Mr Gove added.Apologies for my clumsy attempt at humour on R4 Today this morning -it wasn't appropriate.I'm sorry and apologise unreservedly Michael Gove (@michaelgove) October 28, 2017 He later apologised on Twitter, posting: "Apologies for my clumsy attempt at humour on R4 Today this morning -it wasn't appropriate.I'm sorry and apologise unreservedly."His remarks prompted a storm of criticism on Twitter, from both celebrities and the public.Singer Lily Allen simply called Mr Gove a "bonehead", while actor Stephen Mangan tweeted: "Morning.Here's a rape joke from Michael Gove to start your day."Morning.Heres a rape joke from Michael Gove to start your day.https://t.co/lvlMp087V7 Stephen Mangan (@StephenMangan) October 28, 2017 There were many calls for Lord Kinnock to apologise, too, with one listener writing: "Sexual violence is no punchline".Radio 2 presenter Jeremy Vine tweeted: "Neil Kinnock's reaction to the Harvey Weinstein joke by Michael Gove is the strangest thing about it."Neil Kinnocks reaction to the #HarveyWeinstein joke by #MichaelGove is the strangest thing about it #TodayAt60 https://t.co/4zr8M9k926 Jeremy Vine (@theJeremyVine) October 28, 2017 SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon led the chorus of criticism from politicians of Mr Gove's remarks.The First Minister of Scotland tweeted: "Women being abused and raped is not a laughing matter.And it doesn't make us 'humourless' to say so."Women being abused and raped is not a laughing matter.And it doesnt make us humourless to say so.https://t.co/zWXWAdVWmz Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) October 28, 2017 Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said Mr Gove was "not funny" adding: "Given current sensitivities (it) is beyond poor judgement - it's crass."Labour MPs Jess Phillips and Stella Creasy were also quick to condemn the Cabinet minister's comments.Ms Phillips tweeted: "Michael Gove just left the studio without his dignity."Ms Creasy posted: "This look didn't work for james cordengove joking about sexual assault just as crass too" Michael Gove just left the studio without his dignity Jess Phillips (@jessphillips) October 28, 2017 This look didnt work for james cordengove joking about sexual assault just as crass too.https://t.co/IMVB84ZD9I stellacreasy (@stellacreasy) October 28, 2017 Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson added her voice, tweeting: "No, @michaelgove it's not like that.I have never once feared for my personal safety in a media studio.Don't trivialise sexual assault."No, @michaelgove it's not like that.I have never once feared for my personal safety in a media studio.Don't trivialise sexual assault.https://t.co/8neWSdnWJZ Jo Swinson (@joswinson) October 28, 2017 The controversy comes just a day after the Prime Minister expressed her concern over reports of a culture of sexual harassment at Westminster.Jeremy Corbyn, speaking on Saturday, said there was a "warped and degrading culture" in the corridors of power and that MPs who abuse and harass women must be held accountable.:: Theresa May finds Westminster sexual harassment claims 'deeply concerning' Sunday's newspapers make new accusations: including against international trade minister Mark Garnier by a former secretary; while former Tory minister Stephen Crabb has admitted sending explicit texts to a woman who applied for a job.Mr Garnier disputes his behaviour constituted sexual harassment.Mr Crabb has reportedly admitted he was "foolish" and apologised, and also insisted there was no sexual contact.The Sun has also claimed a WhatsApp group of female employees at Westminster is used to warn members about MPs and other senior figures from across the political parties.Labour MP Jared O'Mara has been suspended by the party after a string of historical online comments emerged, together with new claims he used transphobic slurs and called a woman he dated an "ugly b****".On Tuesday, the Today programme apologised for failing to challenge a claim made by climate change denier Lord Lawson.The former chancellor said in an interview in August that global temperatures have not risen in the last decade, while recent evidence suggests world heat records have been broken in each of the last three years.
Corbyn: 'Warped and degrading' abuse culture thrives in Westminster:::::Jeremy Corbyn has accused Westminster of being home to a culture in which the abuse of women has for too long gone unchallenged.The Labour leader said: "It is a warped and degrading culture that also exists and thrives in the corridors of power, including in Westminster."He urged survivors of assault and harassment to report their experiences to authorities, arguing that the "problem doesn't stop with those who make unwanted advances on women" but "extends to a culture that had tolerated abuse for far too long".Mr Corbyn also said MPs who sexually abuse and harass women will be held accountable for their actions.His remarks come amid new reports of alleged sexual harassment by Westminster figures.Sunday's newspapers make new accusations: including against international trade minister Mark Garnier by a former secretary; while former Tory minister Stephen Crabb has admitted sending explicit texts to a woman who applied for a job.Mr Garnier disputes his behaviour constituted sexual harassment.Mr Crabb has reportedly admitted he was "foolish" and apologised, and also insisted there was no sexual contact.:: Is Westminster hiding the next harassment scandal?Video: Women share sexual harassment experiences Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of failing to act quickly enough following the revelation of homophobic and misogynistic comments by Labour MP Jared O'Mara.His Saturday speech, to Unite union's Scottish Policy Conference, followed comments made to LBC Radio that "there has to be a proper system of people, women in particular, being able to report if they've been abused in any way and have it dealt with in a timely and proper manner."Our party, the Labour Party, has a process of doing that both for employees of party officials, MPs and councillors, but also for party members who feel they've been abused in any way," he said.Downing Street has said any allegations will be taken "extremely seriously" and Theresa May has urged anyone with information about the "deeply concerning" claims of sexual harassment to come forward.Image: Theresa May has urged any women to come forward with accusations According to The Sun, female employees in Westminster have resorted to using a WhatsApp group to warn members about MPs and other senior figures from across the political parties who are known for sexual harassment.Theresa May was said to be unaware of allegations having been reported but said "serious action would be taken where it's necessary"."Any unwanted sexual behaviour is completely unacceptable, and that is true in any walk of life - including politics," a spokeswoman said.The statements follow a report in The Times which has identified, but not named, two Labour MPs and two Conservative MPs who have been accused of harassment or inappropriate behaviour.Their violations are said to range from inappropriate texts and unwanted passes to affairs with young researchers.Equalities Minister Justine Greening also demanded abusive behaviour towards women at Westminster be stamped out.She told Sky News: "There is no place in Westminster for this kind of behaviour.Women who experience it should be coming forward to be clear about what has happened to them."It is now long overdue that we stamp this behaviour out."
Is Westminster harbouring the next harassment scandal?:::::One politician described as "very handsy", another "not safe in taxis" and what about the unnamed parliamentarian who "needs a new researcher - can't be a woman"?These are apparently the experiences of female researchers and aides working in Westminster, and shared on a private Whatsapp group seen by The Sun newspaper, allegedly implicating cabinet ministers.No names have been made public - yet - but after the scandals in Hollywood and the entertainment industry, political parties will be braced for the floodgates to open.Impropriety in politics is of course nothing new, there have been numerous high-profile allegations over the years, some of which have resulted in investigations or even criminal trials.Image: Theresa May finds Westminster sexual harassment claims 'deeply concerning' But there is heightened concern that the way Parliament and politics operates, which is far from a typical workplace, means that inappropriate behaviour can easily go unchecked.One researcher, who worked for an MP until earlier this year, told me about being verbally bullied on a number of occasions, and described the support system as an "absolute joke".Staff in these situations could call a dedicated helpline for harassment claims, set up in 2014, or contact the MP's political party, she said.But colleagues who had contacted the helpline did not believe any action was taken, and as for contacting the relevant person in the party: "I don't think anyone ever did because we were all too worried that the MPs couldn't be trusted to keep things confidential."There is no HR when you work for an MP.Your MP is your HR system.Which means if the problem lies with them, you are absolutely stuck."You found out who the decent MPs were to work for and who were abusive by sounding it out with other staffers in the Sports and Social (a parliamentary bar)."This view is echoed by MPs who have raised cases of abuse in Parliament.Senior Labour MP John Mann, who has campaigned against child abuse, told Sky News he had been contacted by victims of abuse who had received "outrageous" treatment.Image: Allegations of harassment have increased since the Harvey Weinstein revelations On Monday, in the House of Commons, he threatened to name an MP who had been sent home from a foreign trip, while representing Parliament, for inappropriate behaviour.:: Theresa May finds Westminster sexual harassment claims 'deeply concerning' On Friday he said: "I know as well of two cases directly where people have felt unable to come forward, despite the fact that these cases might even have passed the criminal threshold.Certainly they're serious allegations, in one case with witnesses."These people ought to have the confidence to come forward because of appalling behaviour - we've seen it in Hollywood, how people have been getting away with things."Well I'm saying in Parliament, in the time I've been in and before, people have been getting away with similar things and that's not good enough."What's happened is absolutely astonishing in terms of the processes or lack of them in a workplace this would be wholly unacceptable."This is a workplace.It is unacceptable and it's about time we lanced this boil of sexual harassment and other bad behaviour in parliament with staff, volunteers, interns and so on."The cases I've seen the way they've been dealt with and the response has been outrageous."Theresa May's spokesman said the Prime Minister is clear that sexual harassment is "completely unacceptable" and should be raised with the police.But what happens when behaviour is sleazy or inappropriate, but falls short of the criminal threshold?The House of Commons authorities admit they have limited powers over "employment matters" such as bullying and harassment because MPs are self-employed.Image: John Mann says an independent office may need to be set up to handle complaints Conservative and Labour MPs admit that for staff - or even MPs - the prospect of raising these issues with their political parties is highly problematic.Whips offices, who keep tabs on these matters, will have a vested interest in not publicising these cases.Staff may also feel it would end their political career to raise it.Mr Mann said an independent office may need to be set up to handle complaints.One female Tory MP agreed, saying: "There are around 7,000 people working in parliament, that's the size of a village, it is inconceivable you wouldn't have some individuals who conduct themselves improperly."When I have taken things to the whips office in the past, their handling of it has been disgraceful."If you were to go to the whips and say a member of cabinet is saying something unacceptable your chief whip cannot separate the fact they must also be protecting the Government politics gets into all of it."It's not just about your reputation but the scandal that could follow.There is simply no proper mechanism to deal with complaints."If the Westminster harassment scandal does escalate, the spotlight will fall on cases which have been allowed to fall through the cracks.
Dover and Out: Niall Paterson takes in the Brexit views:::::The Port of Dover is something of a gift for lazy journalists looking to do a report on the progress towards Brexit (or lack thereof).It's not just the seemingly limitless opportunities for terrible puns and tortured analogies - "is the course set by Captain May leading us into a perfect storm" *yawn* / "(white) cliff edge Brexit" *semi-avoided in my report* / "clearish, blueish water between us and the EU" - well, I did end up using that one.It's also that this staunchly pro-Brexit constituency is one of very few places that could, in a matter of moments after we officially leave the European Union, grind to a halt if a deal isn't struck, especially if we fail to adequately prepare for that outcome.The town, indeed the country, relies upon goods moving on and off those lorries with ease.And, even before we've left the EU, this part of the world can grind to a halt with a mere handful of cancelled Channel crossings.Little wonder then that as "no deal" has moved from being a topic of discussion among pointy-headed policy wonks in the corridors of power to a phrase muttered darkly over pints up and down the land that the local MP, the Tory Charlie Elphicke, has demanded action is taken to prepare for that eventuality.Image: Dover could grind to a halt if a deal is not struck "You can't know whether you're going to be able to end up with an agreement when you start a negotiation," he told me (on the white cliffs)."We all want to see a really positive deal between Britain and Europe.We want to see a positive relationship in the future as we go out into the world."But nevertheless we can't guarantee a deal, and that's why we need to be ready on day one, deal or no deal."That's why he has demanded the Treasury includes in the next Budget a billion pounds to prepare for leaving before agreement.No word yet on whether they agree.But take a guess.Some apparently influential commentators have suggested that if we start spending massive sums of money then that's the point that we will see large companies, and their tax take, leave the UK for pastures new.Certainly it's a risk.I'd say it's more likely that there will be capital spend on their part that they'd rather avoid, and perhaps there will be some significant overtures towards securing new continental HQs, and an anxious wait and see if there's progress.But if "no deal" remains on the table, surely it follows that we prepare for it?Video: Oct 24: EU says it's not too late to stop Brexit A more pertinent point in the context of Dover is that there is clearly a growing sense of frustration at the lack of progress in the UK/EU talks; and, concomitant to that, a diminution of the regard in which those negotiating are held.People who gladly queued up to vote Conservative now eagerly wait in line to criticise their strategy.It's all grinding to a halt, they told me.Theresa May is just desperate for a deal at any cost.Some even suggested that a combination of Labour and some Tory MPs were trying to wreck the process.It's clear that's by no means a majority opinion - despite the grumblings about the negotiations, those we spoke to generally believed our exit from the EU was going to happen, and some were remarkably sanguine about the prospect of no deal.Image: David Davis and Michel Barnier have been at the coal face of the negotiations But notice how the conversation is shifting.Transition is no longer a dirty word among even the most Brexity of Brexiteers.There's acceptance of the Commons getting a vote on the deal.Supporters of Brexit, once defined by their understandable triumphalism, are beginning to complain of establishment stitch-ups, of connivance between Remoaners in government and the opposition, and those most concerned now fear that we may stay in the EU rather longer than expected.Which of course raises the question of a second referendum.Given how the debate has progressed, the incremental detail added to both the UK's negotiating position and the Opposition's favoured negotiating strategy, is it really that unthinkable that at some stage people begin to consider it openly?My guess?Not entirely unthinkable, but certainly not any time soon.Labour of course has its own presentational problems given how many of its voters chose to leave, especially if the public perception grows that they are wreckers and not scrutineers.Image: Theresa May's future is intertwined with the Brexit process Still, there is but one politician who has tied their future, both short and long term, to the Brexit process.Theresa May understands better than most the nature of negotiations and the negative press that invariably emerges when neither side is (entirely understandably) willing to be entirely candid as to how discussions are proceeding.But her majority is paper thin; and that paper has pictures of the Queen printed upon it.A jolly (Sir Ivan) Roger?Waving not drowning?Sinking or swimming?Treading water awaiting rescue?Hey May, Mayday, M'aider?Tortuous the puns and analogies may be.So too these Brexit negotiations.
Collins wants more testimony from DNC and Clinton campaign officials:::::Sen. Susan Collins said Sunday that Hillary Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta and former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz "absolutely need to be recalled" to testify before Congress.| Jacquelyn Martin/AP Collins wants more testimony from DNC and Clinton campaign officials Sen. Susan Collins said on Sunday that officials from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clintons presidential campaign should testify again before the Senate Intelligence Committee about funding for the so-called Trump dossier.John Dickerson, host of CBS Face the Nation, pointed to reports that former Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta and former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz had privately testified to the committee that they didnt know who had funded the compilation of the dossier, reporting on alleged ties between President Donald Trump and Russia.Story Continued Below Sitting next to Podesta was the lawyer from the Clinton campaign who paid for the report, Dickerson added, in reference to Marc Elias, general counsel for her campaign.They absolutely need to be recalled, the Republican senator from Maine replied.Its difficult to imagine that a campaign chairman, that the head of the DNC would not know of an expenditure of this magnitude and significance, but perhaps theres something more going on here.Certainly, its worth more questioning of those two witnesses, she added.And the lawyer he more than anyone.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.In an interview on ABCs This Week, California Rep.

Gowdy hits grand jury leaks in Russia probe:::::"The only conversation Ive had with Robert Mueller, it was stressing to him the importance of cutting out the leaks with respect to serious investigations," House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy said.| AP Photo Gowdy hits grand jury leaks in Russia probe House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy said Sunday that special counsel Robert Mueller should crack down on leaks, pointing to reports over the weekend about grand jury charges having been filed in Muellers investigation into Russias meddling in the 2016 presidential election.It is kind of ironic that the people in charge of investigating the law and executing the law would violate the law, Gowdy told host Chris Wallace on "Fox News Sunday."Make no mistake, disclosing grand jury material is a violation of the law.So, as a former prosecutor, Im disappointed that you and I are having the conversation because somebody violated their oath of secrecy.Story Continued Below "The only conversation Ive had with Robert Mueller, it was stressing to him the importance of cutting out the leaks with respect to serious investigations," Gowdy said.Still, the South Carolina Republican said hes not pushing for Muellers investigation to be curtailed or shut down.I readily concede Im in an increasingly small group of Republicans, Gowdy said.Bob Mueller has a really distinguished career of service to our country.I dont think any of your viewers can think of a single thing he did as the FBI director that caused them to have a lack of confidence in him.Hes a pretty apolitical guy, Gowdy added.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.
GOP tax bill shrouded in secrecy:::::Rank-and-file House Republicans are increasingly alarmed by the secrecy shrouding the massive tax bill their party leaders plan to ram through Congress next month.Just days ahead of the legislations release, GOP members of the House Ways and Means Committee are still in the dark on numerous details being ironed out by the powerful tax-writing committees chairman, Kevin Brady (R-Texas), and his staff.And theyre blaming the panels top-down approach for the uncertainty.Story Continued Below There are a lot of open issues, said Rep. Jim Renacci (R-Ohio), echoing comments made by several of his colleagues on the committee.Heading into the weekend, question marks remained on at least two high-profile proposals to offset the cost of slashing individual and business tax rates: curbing federal deductions for state and local taxes and business interest as well as potential changes to taxing retirement savings.The uneasy feeling among members extends to their tax aides, whove been excluded from a recent series of hours-long member meetings with Brady and his tax counsels.Several personal office tax staffers to committee Republicans indicated that theyre grappling with how to brace their bosses for the coming lobbyist wave.Well-funded special interests are ready to pounce on the tax bill when Brady brings it out Nov. 1; aides are worried about the onslaught, particularly over any surprises in the legislation.You could potentially see some bombs in there, one aide said.Morning Tax Sign up for our tax policy newsletter and stay informed weekday mornings, in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Part of the logic behind restricting access to the text stems from an eagerness to keep lobbyists at bay for as long as possible.Theres also precedent; former Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp introduced tax reform legislation in 2014 after keeping final language under tight wraps until soon before the now-retired Michigan Republican released it.(And when he did, the bill bombed.)But lawmakers, even those on the tax-writing committee, simply dont always have the same level of understanding of the issues in play as their professional staff, the same aide said on condition of anonymity because of sensitivities around the talks.Aides arent expected to join the next series of Ways and Means Republican meetings, which are scheduled for Monday afternoon and all day Tuesday.Brady has said he plans to introduce the tax bill on Wednesday, and begin considering it in committee the following week.Chairman Brady and Ways and Means members will meet next week to discuss final details before they introduce the tax reform text, said a spokeswoman.Aides have been told theyd receive a briefing before the bill emerges, but that huddle could come as late as Tuesday night, another Ways and Means staffer said.Even President Donald Trumps chief tax negotiators havent been fully briefed, though Treasury Department officials were supposed to get looped in a bit more over the weekend, a Ways and Means aide said.The approach by House Republicans stands in stark contrast to the other end of the Capitol, where top Senate Republicans want to ensure all GOP senators feel they have buy-in from the start a desire to avoid retracing the steps that led to their failed Obamacare repeal attempt.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has convened meetings with Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and a handful of key Republicans on the Senates tax-writing panel, as well as GOP senators not on the committee, to gauge their needs, aides said.Its so complex and there are so many moving parts, said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas).Weve tried to learn our experience on health care and do better on taxes.Republicans on the Finance Committee have paired up with other GOP senators in a buddy system of sorts to ensure all GOP senators are included in the process.For instance, South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No.3 Senate Republican who sits on the Finance Committee, has been in touch with Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), who in turn has been lobbying to include her paid leave tax credit proposal in the overall GOP blueprint.Sen. Bob Corker, the retiring Tennessee Republican who has repeatedly raised concerns about the potential deficit-busting impact of a GOP tax bill, has also met privately with McConnell and Finance Committee Republicans to lay out his priorities, a spokeswoman said.Corker has also spoken with Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).Senate GOP leaders will also ensure their tax proposal, expected to be released sometime after House Republicans unveil their legislation next week, gets considered by the Senate Finance Committee another marked difference from the botched health care process.Cornyn, the second-ranking Senate Republican, sketched out an ambitious goal of passing its tax legislation by Thanksgiving giving GOP senators just under four weeks to move legislation overhauling the tax code even though the actual bill has not been released.We can be up and running in a day.We know where we want to go, insisted Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the chairman of the Finance Committee.Still, Hatch added of the GOP conference-wide lobbying effort: Everybody wants something.Theyre all over us on what they want.House and Senate Democrats, meanwhile, have been almost completely shut out of the discussions.Republicans plan to use powerful budget reconciliation procedures that circumvent Democratic filibusters, so broad bipartisan support wont be required.
Feinstein sends Russia inquiries to White House, Facebook, Twitter:::::Sen. Dianne Feinstein is working on legislation that would make it illegal for Americans to take help from foreign nationals to influence an election.| Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Feinstein sends Russia inquiries to White House, Facebook, Twitter Feinstein sent five letters to key players, including one asking Facebook and Twitter for copies of advertising that Russian buyers aimed at the U.S.The Senate Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein of California, on Friday launched several new investigative queries about Russian electoral meddling without sign-on from the panel's GOP chairman.The solo step from Feinstein follows something of a split between her and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), as they have begun pursuing separate avenues of inquiry regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election.Feinstein is working on legislation that would make it illegal for Americans to take help from foreign nationals to influence an election, while Grassley is zeroing in on an inquiry of his own into a Russian uranium sale approved by Hillary Clinton's State Department.Story Continued Below Feinstein sent five letters to key players, including one asking Facebook and Twitter for copies of advertising that Russian buyers aimed at the U.S. Another expansive request from Feinstein asks the White House to produce documents regarding President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, as well as the firing of FBI Director James Comey.Feinstein's other letters seek information from Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and Cambridge Analytica, a data firm engaged by the Trump campaign that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has said reached out to him last year amid his website's public posting of hacked emails from the Clinton campaign.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.The California Democrat earlier this month suggested that partisan pressures could hurt Congress' ability to come to a final conclusion on whether Trump associates colluded with Russian entities during the election, describing special counsel Robert Mueller as best positioned to address the issue."What happens in a political body and I am finding this as the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee everything has to be negotiated with the party in power, and it's very difficult to do an investigation under those circumstances," Feinstein told CBS' "Face the Nation" on Oct. 8.
Grassley slams 'ridiculous' delay in JFK document rollout:::::"Thx for kennedy files release Ridiculous that CIA wants to review to redact," Sen. Chuck Grassley tweeted Friday.| Alex Brandon/AP Photo Grassley slams 'ridiculous' delay in JFK document rollout 'Ridiculous that CIA wants to review to redact,' the Iowa Republican tweets.Sen. Chuck Grassley called it "ridiculous" that files relating to the 1963 assassination of former President John F. Kennedy were not fully released by Thursday's congressional deadline, expressing frustration that even after more than 50 years, intelligence agencies were still seeking more time for review."Thx for kennedy files release Ridiculous that CIA wants to review to redact," the Iowa Republican tweeted Friday."YeGods u had fifty yrs NOW CIA WANTS FURTHER COVERUP/POTUS STOP."Story Continued Below Grassley later quipped on Twitter that now that the latest batch of documents was made accessible, educational programming would be able to report on "real history.""Now w Kennedy FileS being released the HISTORY CHANNEL has opportunity for real history instead of BEING NONHISTORY CHANNEL," he said.President Donald Trump on Thursday delayed the release of some documents still unreleased by the National Archives pertaining to the Kennedy's assassination in Dallas.The White House announced that while some 2,800 pages would be released by Thursday's deadline, set by a decades-old law, others would continue to be reviewed and made public on a "rolling basis."Trump cited security concerns over the sensitivity of the information in withholding the remaining documents, which were due to be released in accordance with a law signed by former President George H.W.Bush on Oct. 26, 1992."I have no choice today but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our Nation's security," the president wrote in a memo.On Friday, the president tweeted that the "JFK Files are being carefully released.In the end, there will be great transparency.It is my hope to get just about everything to public!"A White House official told POLITICO Trump was holding back the full release largely at the behest of the FBI and the CIA.The CIA said Thursday they "welcome" the president's decision to allow agencies to continue reviewing documents.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time."CIAs current redactions were undertaken with the intent to protect information in the collection whose disclosure would harm national security including the names of CIA assets and current and former CIA officers, as well as specific intelligence methods and partnerships that remain viable to protecting the nation today," a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement.The Iowa senator's comments on Friday served as one of his more forceful calls for the release of the Kennedy files.Grassley earlier this month vouched for a Senate resolution that called for the federal government to release all the remaining documents relating to Kennedy's death.Americans deserve a full picture of what happened that fateful day in November 1963, Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement.The assassination of President Kennedy occurred at a pivotal time for our nation, and, nearly 54 years later, we are still learning the details of how our government responded and what it may have known beforehand.

GOP eyes end of Russia probes with Trump collusion unanswered:::::Republican lawmakers say theyre approaching the end of their investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election even though the most politically explosive issue whether associates of President Donald Trump colluded with the Kremlin remains unresolved.That will present Democrats who have spent a year amplifying suspicions about Trumps own ties to Russia with a wrenching choice: to join Republicans and set aside the most momentous aspect of their probes or to break from the GOP and end any chance of presenting a united front against a continuing Russian threat.Story Continued Below Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) has suggested his panels investigation will end early next year, emphasizing that he wants to wrap up by February, ahead of the first 2018 primary elections.His panel still has a long list of witnesses to interview, but Burr described the timeline as a "mathematical equation," one pitting the ability of the committee to schedule meetings against the calendar.And hes hinted its possible the report will find no evidence of collusion between Trump allies and Moscow.If theres evidence that there was something there, that will be laid out.If theres no evidence, how could anybody object to it?Burr said.Rep.

Mark Warner of Virginia to sketch out their panels conclusions and attempt to generally align their reports.Wildly divergent conclusions, he said, could embarrass the institution and could send mixed messages about the urgency of the Russian threat.Schiff said in an interview that he agrees with Conaway on the need for a meeting of the four committee leaders as well as his drive to come to a unified bipartisan conclusion.I think, frankly, it would be a good idea for the four of us to be collaborating as we go along rather than wait until the conclusion of our investigation, Schiff said.I second Mikes suggestion and actually think it would be worthwhile.But a kumbaya moment may be wishful thinking when it comes to questions about collusion.In the House, and possibly the Senate as well, bringing the Russia probes to a close is likely to trigger a partisan showdown.Some Republicans on the committees have publicly dismissed allegations that Trump allies might have helped Russias interference campaign.Theyve seen no conclusive evidence suggesting collusion occurred, and theyre weary after interviewing scores of witnesses who they say have shed little new light on the matter.Weve hit the point of diminishing returns long ago, said Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho.)Weve looked at lots of stuff.At some point in time, the jury needs to reach a verdict.Warner didn't rule out the possibility of a meeting with Burr, Conaway and Schiff, though he dismissed as "preliminary" an effort to stave off a partisan splintering."We're still operating in a very collaborative fashion," Warner said in an interview.Democrats, though, seem increasingly resigned to the fact that their probes may end without a conclusion on whether any Americans aided the Russian interference effort.Its quite possible that six months from now, there will be unanswered questions that we cant answer because the people we would need to answer those questions are in Russia, said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.).The probability that were going to produce a report that buttons down every question is pretty low.Warner has said hed readily accept it if the Senate investigation finds no evidence of collusion.[I]f theres not something there, Ill be the first to acknowledge that, the Virginia Democrat told The New York Times this week.The painful choice for Democrats is whether to attempt to forge a fragile compromise with Republicans that depicts what both parties generally agree on: that Russia orchestrated a massive interference campaign to undermine U.S. politics and stoke intense division.That would likely mean abandoning a definitive determination on collusion or punting to special counsel Robert Mueller, whos leading a criminal probe of possible crimes connected to the Russian plot.But even Democratic unity on those questions may be challenging."Im not signing on to any report unless its a bipartisan report," Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a member of the intelligence panel, said in an interview.Manchin also disputed the notion that "we're going to be that far apart" in the end."Its up to us to come together and say, 'OK, we agree,'" he added.Schiff and fellow California Rep. Eric Swalwell, two of the most outspoken House Intelligence Committee Democrats, say they too hope for unity but emphasized that despite the absence of a smoking gun, theyve seen compelling evidence of Trump allies intent to collude.We may not find the crime on videotape, but I believe we have already seen evidence of intent, Swalwell said.But our investigation is ongoing and we havent reached a conclusion.Swalwell pointed to a slew of storylines in which figures in Trumps orbit contacted Kremlin-associated Russians.Theres the secret meeting with Kremlin-connected Russians that the presidents son, Donald Trump Jr., organized in Trump Tower ostensibly to obtain documents unfavorable to Hillary Clinton, as well as attempts by two Trump business associates to seek Kremlin help for a Trump Tower development in Moscow just as the presidential campaign was beginning in earnest.There also are lingering questions about Trumps first pick for national security adviser, Mike Flynn, and allegations he secretly assured Russias ambassador that Trump would lift Obama-imposed sanctions on Russia.And theres the mysterious admission by a GOP operative, who claimed connections to the Trump campaign, that he sought help from Russians to expose thousands of emails deleted from Clintons private server.Weve certainly seen evidence of an intention by the Trump campaign to collude with the Russians, Schiff said.I would hope that, at the end of the day, well come to a common conclusion on that as well.I think its too early to say.Himes noted that new twists seem to emerge constantly, pointing to a Daily Beast report this week that a Trump campaign data firm, Cambridge Analytica, acknowledged approaching WikiLeaks to try to procure Clinton's deleted emails.Schiff, who complained in a recent Washington Post op-ed that the White House was pressuring Congress to conclude its Russia probes, may also find allies among Senate Democrats who say theres still a long way to go before theyll feel satisfied they turned over every rock in the investigation."I want to get actionable items in place that can secure our voting infrastructure by" the time that primaries begin next year, Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said in an interview."But I think we should follow the investigation where it takes us, irrespective of the timeframe."Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, also suggested he would have trouble signing on to any final report that left the collusion matter unresolved."The report has to be comprehensive," King said in a brief interview.How Republicans approach the issue of collusion, too, could determine whether Democrats join them.Barring any dramatic new evidence, Republicans like Rep. Peter King of New York would like to plainly state that lawmakers found no evidence of collusion.But they worry that might turn off some Democrats.Theyre too committed, King said.Theyre so dug in on this.
Capitol Hills sexual harassment policy toothless, a joke:::::Two female lawmakers and several congressional staffers are calling for an overhaul of Capitol Hills policies on sexual harassment, citing a culture of tolerance in a workplace long known as a boys club.The sexual harassment scandals involving major Hollywood and media figures are focusing new attention on Congress procedures, which critics say are woefully inadequate for deterring bad behavior in an institution filled with powerful men and young aides trying to advance their careers.Each congressional office operates as its own small, tightly controlled fiefdom with its own rules and procedures, which makes it that much harder to come forward.Story Continued Below Lawmakers and congressional aides are not required to undergo sexual harassment training a shortcoming even the office that handles complaints says should be changed.And victims must submit to as long as three months of mandated counseling" and mediation, as well as what one lawyer involved in such cases called a "cooling off period," before filing a complaint against an alleged perpetrator.That's assuming they're even aware of how to lodge a grievance.One former staffer who said she was sexually harassed by a colleague years ago told POLITICO she didnt know where to turn at the time.Shed never heard of the Office of Compliance, or OOC, the entity that exists to handle harassment complaints and enforce workplace protection laws for the legislative branch.When she called a congressional committee that deals with administrative issues to inquire about filing a complaint, she said, she was turned away without any guidance.I didnt even know it existed as a resource, the ex-staffer said of the compliance office.You dont have an HR Department on the Hill.Theres no one place that you go.Nobody on the Hill has any idea how you report and deal with sexual harassment.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Some officials are trying to change that.Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) next week will introduce legislation calling for an overhaul of the compliance office, which she said is constructed to protect the institution and to impede the victim from getting justice.On Friday, she will release a video recounting her experience years ago as a congressional staffer, when the office's chief of staff "held my face, kissed me and stuck his tongue in my mouth," she said.Many of us in Congress know what its like, because Congress has been a breeding ground for a hostile work environment for far too long, Speier continued.Its time to throw back the curtain on the repulsive behavior that has thrived in the dark without consequences.In an interview Thursday, Speier called the OOC toothless and a joke.She said it encumbers the victim in ways that are indefensible.Theres no accountability whatsoever, she said.Its rigged in favor of the institution and the members, and we cant tolerate that.The call to overhaul the OOC comes as 40 percent of female congressional staffers say theres a sexual harassment problem on Capitol Hill, according to a July survey conducted by Roll Call.The survey found that one in six female aides said theyd personally been sexually harassed in their offices, and only 10 percent were aware of structures that existed to report misconduct.OOC Deputy Executive Director Paula Sumberg defended her office."Any current staffer who has not heard of the Office of Compliance has somehow missed our emailed Annual Notification of Rights, our quarterly eNewsletters, and information about us on the House intranet, Sumberg said in an email.But even the OOC appears to acknowledge flaws in the system.In recent years, it has recommended that Congress make sexual harassment training mandatory.And the OOC recently urged Congress to raise its profile, noting that some training seminars for staffers don't mention the office as a resource for workplace disputes.Multiple staffers, including some whove worked on Capitol Hill for years, said there is a dearth of information about the OOC.So it's not readily apparent where to turn when a colleagues or even a boss actions become inappropriate.That was the case for former staffers in former Rep. Tim Murphys office.Aides who called POLITICO to detail a hostile work environment slammed doors, cursing, timed bathroom breaks and verbal abuse said they were either unaware of the OOC or told it was pointless to complain.Others feared retaliation.Even some lawmakers arent apparently aware of, or at least inclined to rely on, the OOC.In 2014, a group of female staffers accused Kenny West, the chief of staff to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), of making inappropriate comments toward them.But Meadows turned to his friend, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), for help.Meadows asked Gowdys chief of staff, a woman, to interview his aides to determine whether West had acted inappropriately, according to an Office of Congressional Ethics report.Gowdys staffer recommended Meadows fire the staffer, though Meadows kept him on payroll for months after that, the report said.A similar situation played out in the office of Rep. Eric Massa (D-N.Y.) in 2010, after he was accused of making unwanted advances toward a junior male staffer.A more senior aide in the office brought the matter to Rep. Steny Hoyers office, which instructed the aide to report the matter to the Ethics Committee.A House Administration Committee spokesman said Thursday that harassment on the Hill is "a serious issue" and that the panel is "currently evaluating what additional resources might be made available" to further help lawmakers and aides.She also argued that the Office of House Employment Counsel provides training, including sexual harassment awareness training, as does the Office of the House Chief Administrative Officer.President Donald Trumps former campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, painted a harsh picture of the reality facing women on Capitol Hill after a video emerged last year of Trump bragging about his sexual advances on women."I would talk to some of the members of Congress there when I was younger and prettier, them rubbing against girls, sticking their tongues down women's throats who were uninvited, didn't like it," Conway told MSNBC in October 2016.The comment was meant to defend Trump from lawmakers aghast by the Access Hollywood video.Conway's spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on which members she was talking about.Speier and Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) are looking to pre-empt such situations with legislation that would mandate sexual harassment training for every congressional office.Executive branch employees must undergo such training, but it is optional for congressional workers.Speier has introduced her bill every year since 2014, to no avail.One year, she came close to getting it passed when House appropriators agreed to tuck her bill into an appropriations measure only to see it stripped from a Senate spending package.Lawrence, who used to investigate harassment issues for the federal government, said she always checked whether training had been provided."This is a first step, and I know this is one that can make a difference," she said.When Speier introduces her bill again this year, the legislation will go beyond sexual harassment training and seek to overhaul the lengthy process Hill victims must go through before filing a complaint.As it stands now, after an incident but before filing a complaint, victims are required to go through 30 days of counseling with an OOC employee.Following that process, they have 15 days to decide whether they want to pursue the next step: 30 days of mandated mediation.After mediation, victims must wait another 30 days to file a complaint.The OOC allows anyone filing a complaint to ask to shorten the counseling period and doesnt require them to be in the same room as the accused during mediation, but Speier put little stock in those measures.Can you imagine a victim whos been sexually harassed who attempts to file a complaint and then is told theyve got to go through three months of biting their tongue and continuing to work in that kind of environment?she asked.Youve just been sexually harassed and youre told you have to be counseled for 30 days.Are you kidding me?Les Alderman, an attorney who has represented multiple congressional employees in harassment and discrimination cases, said that OOC officials do their best to do exactly what the law says they should.But he warned that the law that created the office has major downfalls.For one, Alderman said, the 30-day counseling period a harassment victim must undergo before pursuing a complaint is confidential.Alexis Ronickher, an employment rights lawyer at Katz, Marshall & Banks whos worked with sexual harassment victims in congressional offices, said that means victims can be sanctioned and their cases jeopardized if they say publicly that theyre filing a complaint against a lawmaker or fellow staffer.Its the strap of silence in my opinion that helps foster a broken system.The fact that you cant tell anyone that you filed a request for counseling or that youre in mediation, that everything that goes on there has to be confidential, she said.It creates an environment in which people dont talk about whats happening and women who are being sexually harassed cant come together and say, Im coming forward; you should come forward.Ronickher said it's not the Office of Compliance's fault as much as the 1995 Congressional Accountability Act, which governs how the office operates and the rules governing complaints.The GOP-controlled Congress created the OOC in 1995 amid the scandal involving then-Sen. Bob Packwood's rampant sexual harassment.Ten women told The Washington Post about the Oregon Republicans lewd behavior.The furor grew as Senate Republicans including then-Ethics Committee chairman and now-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) resisted holding hearings.Former Nevada Sen. Richard Bryan, then the ethics panel's top Democrat, recalled a drumbeat of complaints that eventually forced committee Republicans to join his call to act against Packwood.This wasnt just one woman there was a pattern, Bryan said in an interview.OOC fielded 49 requests for counseling during fiscal 2016, according to its most recent annual report, including six in the House and two in the Senate.Of those requests, 15 dealt with harassment or a hostile work environment.Despite the waiting periods, Sumberg said the OOCs process for dispute resolution is faster than that of other federal agencies.The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which polices harassment cases for those agencies, can take as long as 180 days to act on a discrimination charge, according to its website.We probably have the fastest administrative process for bringing a sexual harassment complaint in the entire federal government, Sumberg said by email.Alderman, the attorney who works with harassment and discrimination victims, noted another key difference between the OOCs process and the EEOCs work in other federal agencies.After an accuser has successfully navigated the system and won a complaint, the EEOC requires the posting of information about the perpetrators of discriminatory behavior, so that hopefully public notice and shame occurs.No such publicizing of a perpetrators past record is required in Congress.Its a system, Alderman said, that helps repeat offenders keep on repeating.POLITICO is taking a deeper look at Capitol Hill's sexual harassment policy.To share your stories confidentially with a reporter, please contact rbade@politico.com or eschor@politico.com.You can also anonymous share information with our reporting team using these tools.
Republicans spoil for a fight over Russia probe budget:::::Republicans trying to hobble Robert Muellers sprawling probe into President Donald Trump and Russia matters are about to get a new weapon: the special counsels budget.Lawmakers havent yet seen the Russia investigators first spending report, which must go through a Justice Department review before being made public.But theyre already setting up a fight over how much the probe is costing taxpayers and the fact that theres no end in sight.Story Continued Below For them to say to us, Vote for an open-ended appropriation into a Mueller witch hunt, I think youll see significant objection there, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) told POLITICO.Muellers public budget is expected to contain only top-line figures covering broad categories like staff salaries, travel, outside contracts, supplies and equipment.But money will become a recurring fight as the investigation drags on, because Mueller is required to produce public expense reports every six months giving opponents repeated opportunities to paint him in a negative light.Partisan complaining about the expenses that pile up during lengthy Washington investigations is a familiar ritual.As President Bill Clinton faced impeachment in the House in 1998, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) called Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr a federally paid sex policeman spending millions of dollars to trap an unfaithful spouse.Outcry over spending of taxpayers' money also cropped up during the Iran-Contra investigation, whose outlays ultimately exceeded $47 million.Taxpayers of this country should be absolutely up in arms about it, then-Sen. Steve Symms (R-Idaho) said during a CNN appearance in 1992, six years into that probe.Complaints about spending over the Russia probes date to before Muellers appointment in mid-May.Trump himself took to Twitter just one day before he fired FBI Director James Comey kick-starting the whole special counsel process to say: The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?He went after the cost issue again on Friday morning, tweeting, "It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump.Was collusion with HC!"Critics have only gained momentum as Muellers probe has advanced.King in a July interview called for legislation imposing both a deadline and budget constraints on Mueller; otherwise, the Republican congressman warned, Trump could face a never-ending investigation that could go on for two presidential terms.Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) tried in August to offer an amendment to the House budget resolution that would have halted Muellers funding just six months into the job.No fishing expeditions, he told Fox News as he tried to sell the measure.While DeSantis couldnt overcome a procedural technicality and never got a floor vote, conservatives say theyre just getting started.The right-leaning watchdog group Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit earlier this month seeking Muellers budget documents.Several Republicans said in interviews theyd be keeping tabs on the special counsels spending through their oversight capacity, and they will hold out the threat of attaching language to DOJs annual spending bill or other must-pass legislation that places clear restrictions or prohibitions on Muellers authority.We still have power over the Department of Justice, warned Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), another Judiciary Committee member.As a practical matter, Congress cant go after Muellers day-to-day spending directly.His budget is being drawn out of a permanent Treasury Department account that is not subject to the annual appropriations process, and the DOJ regulations used to appoint Mueller state he shall be provided all appropriate resources to do his work.Mueller is subject to some oversight.He had to produce a budget proposal to DOJ earlier this summer for the next fiscal year.And an internal DOJ audit office must review the first 4 months of his spending receipts.Mueller isnt under day-to-day DOJ supervision, but Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general overseeing the investigation after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself, does have final say on some of the major decisions related to the Mueller probe, including his budget.Peter Carr, a Mueller spokesman, said the internal DOJ review must be completed before the special counsels spending report is made public.He declined to comment when asked about a timeline for its release.While firm details on how much Mueller has spent to date remain under wraps, sources familiar with the special counsels budget process say they expect the report to count up the salaries of 11 government attorneys who have been detailed from across other parts of DOJ, as well as five more people hired from outside government who are being paid using the scale for senior staff serving in a U.S. attorneys office.Mueller himself is earning the same $161,900 salary as a U.S. attorney.The special counsels spending report also will likely count any rent for office space in a Southwest Washington, D.C., office building whose exact location remains a closely held secret that his team has been using since the summer, according to sources familiar with Muellers budget process.Politically, Mueller, a former FBI director appointed by President George W. Bush, can count on some degree of bipartisan support from lawmakers who say they expect hell lead a budget-savvy investigation.Id be inclined to approve it, said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a key member on both the Senate Appropriations and Judiciary committees.He seems to be a pretty frugal guy.Conyers, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee since before the Clinton impeachment hearings, said in an interview earlier this week that he had no concerns about Muellers spending unless its something totally outrageous.The special counsels Republican budget critics, Conyers added, represent the few people who are sensitive about it.Whatever figure he comes up with, they wont like it too much, he said.Given Muellers mandate lawmakers note hes examining the authenticity of the presidential election several Democrats said he should have some running room to spend what he needs to.In view of the amount of money that we spend as a nation in any given year, clarifying what happened under these very serious circumstances I think is important today and its important for historys sake, said Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee.Were talking about the believability of any election in this county and were talking about undue influence by a nation that has never been known to support the principles of liberty or justice and theres a lot at stake here.Hes going to do what he can to acquit himself well.Hes got no ulterior motives.No fish to fry.He doesnt have any aircraft carriers hes got to buy from some contractor friend, added Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), a senior House Judiciary Committee member.Nadler also said hes not expecting Mueller to be held too tightly to subsequent budget requests because of unexpected circumstances that might arise given his wide-ranging investigation into the Trump campaign and the election.Any Republican bid to meddle with Mueller via his budget will come with political risks, according to lawmakers, several longtime congressional observers and attorneys who have worked on special counsel investigations.Charlie Houy, the former Democratic staff director on the Senate Appropriations Committee, acknowledged ample precedent for Congress to try to gain some control over the spending on a special counsel probe.However, he added, it would be real tricky to not be charged with trying to impede the investigation.That in itself should cause cooler heads to urge caution.Lawmakers who try to micromanage the probe could also be accused of messing with the justice system itself, said Randall Samborn, a Chicago-based lawyer who served as spokesman for then-U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald during the George W. Bush-era special counsel probe into who leaked the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson.Could you only imagine what would happen, whether its this investigation or any criminal investigation conducted by DOJ or the FBI, if the Hill started getting involved in setting the budget on a per-investigation basis?Samborn said.You could not conduct a confidential secretive grand jury investigation and have the accountability while its under way being scrutinized by partisan politics.Itd be the death knell of such an investigation.Considering his reputation running the FBI, several sources who have worked for previous special counsels said they expect Mueller will get the leeway he needs to do his work.But Julie Myers Wood, a former lead prosecutor during Starrs investigation, predicted the good will wont last forever.If the inquiry starts to drag on, I would expect significant attacks on the cost, both in terms of direct cost to the taxpayer and also in terms of the cost of the time it is taking the executive branch to respond to his queries, she said.The Starr investigation as well as the work of three other independent counsels who ran the case remains the most expensive in U.S. history costing more than $73 million, according to audits done by the Government Accountability Office.That single Clinton probe, which started in 1994 with an examination of the Clintons real estate deals in Arkansas took several unexpected turns over seven-plus years and ended up covering the suicide of White House attorney Vincent Foster, irregularities in the White House travel office, allegations of misuse of confidential FBI files, false statements by a top White House attorney and finally the presidents sexual affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.The investigation drew harsh political criticism for many reasons, including its spending: Over the full course of the probe it had more than 225 employees from the Justice Department and other federal agencies, including at least 65 consultants and outside advisers, according to a final report released in 2002.While the bulk of Starrs spending was detailed in summary format, on at least one occasion some of the embarrassing budget specifics did go public.House Democrats in 1998 released to the Los Angeles Times internal documents showing spending of $370 a month for a parking space for the independent counsel, a $32,380 bill to survey an Arkansas community where potential jurors would be seated in a trial of the state's governor, and $30,517 for a psychological analysis of the evidence connected to Fosters suicide.Despite the criticism, Starr senior counsel Paul Rosenzweig said there was never a serious effort to strip the independent counsels spending.The politics of trying to do so would be terrible optics, he said.Six separate investigations during the Clinton administration ran up costs of more than $140 million.President Ronald Reagan faced eight different probes, including Iran-Contra, for a total of more than $84 million, according to a POLITICO review of government audits and reports on their spending.In all, there have been 21 completed independent counsel and special counsel investigations dating back to the Carter administration.Their total price tag: $231 million $339 million when adjusted for inflation.Twelve of those cases concluded with no indictments.Just two of the 21 cases ended with the successful prosecution of a federal official who was named as the primary initial target: Reagan White House aide Michael Deaver, who was sentenced to three years of probation and fined $100,000 in 1988 after being convicted on three counts of perjury stemming from a conflict-of-interest investigation; and Clintons secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Henry Cisneros, who pleaded guilty in 1999 to a misdemeanor charge for lying to the FBI about payments made to his former mistress.Clinton pardoned Cisneros in January 2001, on his final day in office.The dearth of successful convictions, King said, is one of the main reasons he said hes raising alarm about the Mueller probes spending.Not many people on either side of the political aisle would point to one [special counsel investigation] and say its a satisfactory result, King said.Theyre messy.Theyre ugly.Theyre not conclusive.And theres division over them that runs in perpetuity, as long as we remember them in our history.

CNN legal analyst: Charges filed in Mueller probe means it will last 'well into 2018':::::CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Friday that news of the first charges reportedly being filed in special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into Russian election interference means the probe will last well into 2018.If anybody thinks the Mueller investigation is going to be wrapping up in the next couple of months, this decision today pretty much guarantees the Mueller office will be up and running well into 2018, Toobin said on CNNs Anderson Cooper 360.Jeffrey Toobin: If anybody thinks the Mueller investigation is going to be wrapping up, this decision guarantees it will go well into 2018 pic.twitter.com/iCftwFzBA6 CNN (@CNN) October 27, 2017 In an interview with Fox News on Thursday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the White House believes Muellers probe is getting closer to conclusion.I have not spoken with anybody at the Department of Justice on that front, but I think that we are seeing that it is getting closer to conclusion, Sanders told Bill Hemmer.Reports said Friday night that a federal grand jury has approved the first charges in Muellers probe.CNN reported that the charges are sealed under a federal judges order, with sources telling the network that those charged could be taken into custody as soon as Monday.Toobin called the news a major landmark in the course of this investigation and said the indictments will likely be aimed at garnering cooperation in the probe.In white-collar investigations, usually the first indictments are against individuals that you hope will plead guilty and cooperate against others, Toobin said.You dont indict the big fish first, you indict smaller fish in hopes of getting the big fish.Mueller's investigation is also looking into alleged collusion between President Trump's campaign and the Kremlin.When asked Thursday if Trump still has confidence in Mueller, Sanders replied that Trump has confidence that they are going to close this up soon.Every day we find out more and more details about why the president has been right all along and why the Democrats have been wrong all along and I think that each day were getting closer and closer to closing the loop on this on our front, Sanders said.Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May to oversee the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.
First charges filed in special counsel Mueller's Russia probe: report:::::A federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., has reportedly approved the first charges in special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.CNN reported Friday that the charges are sealed under a federal judges order, with sources telling the network that those charged could be taken into custody as soon as Monday.ADVERTISEMENT It is unclear what the charges are, according to the network.A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment to The Hill.Mueller is investigating alleged ties between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials, and several congressional committees are also probing the matter.The U.S. intelligence community concluded in a report made public in January that the Kremlin sought to disrupt the 2016 election and sway the race in Trump's favor.The White House did not immediately respond to The Hill's request for comment Friday night about reports of charges being filed in the special counsel probe.But soon after CNN reported the charges, Trump posted a video on Twitter quoting an opinion piece in the New York Post suggesting that his former Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonBlumenthal: Trump-tied data firm reaching out to WikiLeaks significant Tillerson eliminates key State Department sanctions office: report Intel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it MORE may have colluded with Russia and sought to frame Trump as a "traitor."The Trump administration has appeared eager in recent days to shift attention to congressional probes regarding Clinton, after months of news coverage focused on possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.After The Washington Post reported this week that the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee funded the research contained in a controversial dossier alleging ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, Trump and his allies have sought to cast Clinton as the one with connections to Moscow."It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump.Was collusion with HC!"Trump asserted in a tweet Friday morning.After reports emerged Friday night about charges in the special counsel's Russia probe, Fox News host Sean Hannity, one of Trump's most vocal supporters, called the development a "distraction" on Twitter and questioned when Clinton would face charges.Mueller's investigative mandate includes any matters that may arise from the probe into Russian interference, and he has appeared in recent months to expand the scope of the probe to include possible financial crimes.The special counsel has appeared to take increasingly aggressive steps in recent months as part of the investigation, most notably against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.In July, the FBI conducted an early morning raid at Manafort's northern Virginia home, and later subpoenaed his spokesman and one of his former lawyers.According to CNN, lawyers working on Mueller's probe were seen entering the courthouse where the grand jury is convened.But after some activity, no announcements were made.Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May to oversee the investigation.Because Rosenstein oversees the special counsel conducting the probe, he would have been notified of any charges before they were filed, sources told CNN.The Justice Department declined to comment to The Hill.Updated: 10:56 p.m.

Video catches Trump on the golf course:::::President Trump was spotted hitting the golf course Saturday afternoon as he spends his fourth weekend in a row at his golf club in Virginia.Trumps motorcade arrived at Trump National Golf Club shortly after 10:50 a.m.Pool reports stated Trump was greeted by one protester holding a sign reading "impeach" as he arrived.The president has no public events scheduled for this weekend.His staff says he regularly takes meetings or does work while at his golf clubs and only occasionally confirms that Trump is golfing.Before leaving the White House Saturday, Trump boasted on Twitter about newly-released GDP numbers and thanked former President Jimmy Carter for his nice remarks after Carter said the media have been harder on Trump than any other president.Trump has been largely silent about the major news stories of the weekend, including a white nationalist rally in Shelbyville, Tenn., as well as the news that special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation will hand down its first indictments on Monday.

Clinton, Trump and the Russia dossier: What you need to know:::::The revelation that Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonBlumenthal: Trump-tied data firm reaching out to WikiLeaks significant Tillerson eliminates key State Department sanctions office: report Intel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it MOREs campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) helped fund an explosive dossier about President Trump has roiled the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.Republicans are on the offensive, claiming the new funding revelations as evidence the investigations into whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia were fixed against them from the start.Democrats are trying to keep the focus on the contents of the memo and say it doesnt matter who paid for it.The saga took another bizarre twist on Friday when the conservative news outlet Washington Free Beacon said it paid the same opposition research firm used by the Democrats for dirt on Trump and other GOP candidates about six months earlier.Here is a look at what we know about the controversial document at the center of the Russia investigation after the latest turn of events.What is the dossier?The 35-page opposition research document compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele has the look of an official government intelligence report.It carries the title: U.S. presidential election: Republican candidate Donald Trump Donald John TrumpIntel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it Overnight Tech: Twitter bans ads from Russian media | Dem says she was targeted by Russian bot | House Judiciary to hold hearing on net neutrality Democrats dig for Russian connection and uncover environmentalists MOREs activities in Russia and compromising relationship with the Kremlin.ADVERTISEMENT The document was passed around in Washington during the 2016 election, but was not widely known about until CNN reported that former FBI director James Comey had briefed President Trump and former President Obama on its existence.Shortly after that, BuzzFeed published it online.Citing senior Russian government officials and intelligence officers, the dossier claims that Russia has been cultivating, supporting and assisting Trump for at least five years.Steele writes that Trump and his inner circle accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin on Hillary Clinton.Steele also alleges that Trump has deep financial ties to key Russian figures that the Kremlin could use to blackmail him, and it contains a series of lewd allegations about the president.Trump has called the memo fake and disputes all of the allegations.Comey described the memo as salacious and unverified in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee.Some of the allegations appear to have been debunked, like a claim that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen travelled to Prague during the election to meet with a Russian official.The specific claims about campaign collusion have not been verified and are under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller and his team.But the broad outline of the memo that the Russians sought to interfere in U.S. politics through email hacking and disinformation campaigns has been confirmed by U.S. intelligence agencies.Who paid for it?The Washington Post reported this week that Clintons campaign and the DNC funded the dossier.The transaction passed through Democratic lawyer Marc Elias of the law firm Perkins Coie.Elias contracted the work out to opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which had the connection to Steele, the former British spy.While none of the principals have denied that the Clinton campaign and DNC funded the dossier through payments to Perkins Coie, everyone involved is claiming they did not know about the project.Clinton has said she did not know about it.Current DNC chairman Tom Perez Thomas Edward PerezClintons top five vice presidential picks Government social programs: Triumph of hope over evidence Labors 'wasteful spending and mismanagement at Workers Comp MORE, who was elected in April of this year, deflected to past DNC leadership.Former DNC chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) said she had no knowledge of it.CNN reported that both Wasserman Schultz and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta testified in a closed-door briefing with congressional investigators that they knew nothing about it.Notably, Elias is Podestas lawyer and was present for that meeting with lawmakers, raising questions about whether he should have interjected.The story took on another layer of complexity on Friday, when the conservative news outlet Washington Free Beacon told congressional investigators it hired Fusion GPS the opposition research firm used by the Democrats for opposition research on Trump and all of the GOP candidates in September 2015.The Free Beacon insists that the work was separate from the dossier that it had no connection to the British spy or the Democratic law firm and that none of the information it gathered ended up in the Steele memo.The Clinton campaign and the DNC are believed to have taken over the project in April 2016, once Trump became the nominee, and oversaw the compilation and completion of the dossier from there.Democrats insist that the content of the memo is more important than who paid for it.But their involvement has given ammunition to Trump and Republicans to claim that Muellers investigation is a political witch hunt based on Clinton-backed opposition research.They argue that Donald Trump Jr. was put through the ringer for trying and failing to secure Clinton campaign dirt from a Russian lawyer in 2016.The dossier is evidence the Clinton campaign successfully secured and published opposition research from a foreign spy based on Russian government sources during the campaign, Republicans say.Who put it together?The document was produced by Fusion GPS, a Washington strategic intelligence firm cofounded by former Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson in 2012.In 2016, the firm hired Steele to dig into any connections between Trump, then a Republican presidential candidate, and the Russian government.The firm has produced research for Democrats battling Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and Planned Parenthood, in addition to other clients.But it has attracted particular scrutiny for its work for a U.S. law firm that defended Prevezon Holdings, which until May was locked in a legal battle with the U.S. government over allegations the companys executives fraudulently obtained a $230 million tax refund from the Russian treasury.Also working the case defending Prevezon was Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who attended the infamous Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 before which Donald Trump Jr. was offered damaging information on Hillary Clinton.Veselnitskaya is known for her work lobbying against the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 U.S. law aimed at punishing human rights abusers in Russia.Bill Browder, a proponent of the Magnitsky Act, has accused Fusion GPS of taking money from the Russian government and contributing to a campaign against the law in the spring and summer of 2016.The Senate Judiciary Committee is now investigating whether the firm violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).Simpson met with Senate Judiciary Committees staffers in August.The firm maintains that its actions were lawful.Still, the developments have provided fodder for Republicans, and those seeking to discredit the firm have cited its alleged ties to the Russian government.What is the FBIs involvement?In late 2016, Sen.

GOP plans tax blitzkrieg:::::Congressional Republicans are feeling enormous pressure to deliver a win on tax reform before Christmas Day.After a humiliating defeat on ObamaCare repeal, GOP leaders are desperate for their first major legislative victory of 2017 and are doubling down on their ambitious timeline to overhaul the U.S. tax code.Speaker Paul Ryan Paul RyanBudget vote raises red flag for GOP on tax reform Dems yearn for days of GOP deficit hawks Ryan: FBI will hand over documents related to Trump-Russia dossier MORE (R-Wis.) reiterated this week that House Republicans will pass their tax bill out of their chamber before the Thanksgiving recess kicks off on Nov. 16.ADVERTISEMENT Sharing that sense of urgency, Senate Majority Whip(R-Texas) said the usually deliberative, slow-moving upper chamber needs to pass tax reform before senators sit down for their Thanksgiving dinner, too.That could put pressure on senators to remain in Washington and work through part of the weeklong Thanksgiving recess.Senate Majority Leader(R-Ky.) has warned colleagues to expect to be working on weekends this fall.If both chambers can pull it off, it would give House and Senate tax negotiators several weeks to work out their differences and put a bill on President Trumps desk by Christmas.Leaders, however, are under no illusions about how difficult this will be.Republicans said theyre already being bombarded by an onslaught of lobbyists and special-interest groups hellbent on protecting their favored tax breaks.This weeks narrow 216-212 budget vote also underscored the pitfalls ahead for the tax push.Nearly a dozen Republicans from New York and New Jersey opposed the budget over objections that the tax plan calls for scrapping the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, which would force taxpayers in those districts to pay more.And Republicans are already behind schedule.A memo that GOP leadership had been circulating to K Street last month, titled Optimistic Timeframe for 2017 Enactment of Tax Reform, showed the House Ways and Means Committee marking up their tax bill on Oct. 30.This week, Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady Kevin Patrick BradyUS wins trade case over 'dolphin safe' tuna labeling Overnight Finance: House adopts Senate budget, taking step to tax reform | GOP worries Trump feuds will endanger tax plan | Trump talks NAFTA withdrawal with senators | Treasury calls for looser oversight of insurers The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (R-Texas) confirmed hell roll out his bill on Wednesday and begin marking it up in committee on Nov. 6, a week after the memos timeline.We need to get this done.I think we have to get this done.Its going to be tough.Big is difficult, Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), the chief GOP vote counter, told The Hill in an interview in his office.He conceded that, yes, a major overhaul of the tax code and across-the-board tax cuts is complicated and will be pushed through the House with a fragile majority.But Scalise argued that Republicans have no choice but to deliver on one of their top campaign promises, especially in the wake of the Senates dramatic failure to repeal and replace ObamaCare.I think looking at what happened with health care, its important that both the House and Senate get this done, said Scalise, who added that leadership is committed to addressing colleagues concerns about the SALT deduction.Rep.

Deb Fischer Debra (Deb) Strobel FischerTrump talks NAFTA withdrawal with GOP senators Schumer sees path forward with White House after this tax bill fails Trump: Meeting with GOP senators a 'love fest,' except for Corker, Flake MORE (R-Neb.)told the president the legislation must clearly provide tax relief for the middle class and Trump agreed.Democrats have criticized the GOP plan by arguing that it would cause taxes for a third of middle-income families to increase.A senior GOP aide dismissed concerns that the legislation is moving too quickly and that some lawmakers might feel jammed, like they were during the health-care debate when the bill crafted by leadership was kept secret until shortly before a floor vote.The aide noted that members of the Senate Budget Committee received a briefing from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinOvernight Finance: House adopts Senate budget, taking step to tax reform | GOP worries Trump feuds will endanger tax plan | Trump talks NAFTA withdrawal with senators | Treasury calls for looser oversight of insurers New Treasury sanctions target North Korean military, labor camps Trump picks interim replacement to lead IRS MORE and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn last month and that senior administration officials have been in regular contact with the Finance Committee for months.A second Senate GOP aide said the Senate bill will reflect the goals outlined in the tax framework that administration officials and congressional leaders released last month but will also reflect the desires of lawmakers who are working to fill in its details.Cohn was back on the Hill this week meeting with members of the bipsartisan Problem Solvers Caucus on how to solve the SALT conundrum.During that meeting, Dent returned to the idea of tying a major infrastructure package to tax reform, a sweetener to help bring moderates along.A source in the room described Cohn as receptive to the idea.But in internal deliberations, Ryan and his leadership team have quashed the idea of merging the two policy issues, sources said, arguing it would further complicate and delay an already challenging piece of legislation.When you try to cultivate 218 votes in the House and 50 votes in the Senate, theres gonna be a lot of negotiation, said Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.), a member of Ryans leadership team who also serves on the powerful Ways and Means Committee, which is writing the tax bill.When youre looking at the tax code itself, its 70,000 pages; thats very complex.You touch one thing, it affects 100 other things, so its too complex to do both tax reform and infrastructure in the same bill.Freshman Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, called a joint tax reform and infrastructure bill a bad idea.Tax reform is a very complex issue.Infrastructure needs and funding for it is a complex issue.We can barely get one complex issue done at a time, Biggs told The Hill.Sticking another complex issue right on top of it is a bad idea.Naomi Jagoda contributed.
Indictment in Mueller's Russia probe to be served Monday: report:::::An indictment in special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election will reportedly be handed down on Monday.NBC News reported the development on Saturday, citing a U.S. official familiar with the matter.A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment to The Hill.JUST IN: Office of the Special Counsel will serve up an indictment Monday in connection with Russia probe, an official confirms to NBC News NBC News (@NBCNews) October 28, 2017 Confirmed: US official with knowledge tells NBC News an indictment will be made public Monday in the special counsel's Russia investigation.Ken Dilanian (@KenDilanianNBC) October 28, 2017 It is not known who will receive the indictment or what the charges are.ADVERTISEMENT CNN first reported Friday night that a federal grand jury had approved the first charges in Muellers probe.The network reported that the charges are sealed under a federal judges order.The reports of charges being filed mark a significant milestone in Muellers investigation into alleged ties between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials.Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May to oversee the investigation.Earlier this week, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the White House believes Muellers probe is getting closer to conclusion.I have not spoken with anybody at the Department of Justice on that front, but I think that we are seeing that it is getting closer to conclusion, Sanders told Fox Newss Bill Hemmer.
Five interesting revelations from the newly released JFK files:::::Thousands of previously withheld records surrounding the investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy were released to the public Thursday evening, shedding some light on what has been the subject of intrigue for more than 50 years.Thursday marked the federal government's deadline to release the 3,100 unseen files, a deadline that was set by Congress in 1992 under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act.The documents have been held in the National Archives, and the majority are already public.The array of documents released ranged from fuzzy images of photos snapped by U.S. intelligence and hand-written notes that are hardly legible to information on CIA-planned mob hits on former Cuban leader Fidel Castro and memos surrounding Kennedy's killer, Lee Harvey Oswald.ADVERTISEMENT By no means do the records offer any bombshell revelations, but several documents give the public a peek into what happened in Dallas in 1963 and surrounding events.Here are five interesting things from the newest release of JFK files.Former CIA director: LBJ thought Kennedy assassination was payback for assassination of Vietnam president A document released Thursday quotes Richard Helms, former CIA director under Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon, saying: "President Johnson used to go around saying that the reason President Kennedy was assassinated was that he had assassinated President Diem."The document was from the 1975 deposition at Langley.CIA considered using mafia to kill Castro Robert Kennedy once told the FBI that an "intermediary had been hired by CIA" to consult mobster Sam Giancana about hiring a gunman for $150,000 to kill Castro in Cuba.The account is detailed in an FBI memorandum from 1975.The memo is part of an 83-page report that also said the CIA considered delivering a poison pill to kill Castro."Attorney General Kennedy stated that the CIA should never undertake the use of Mafia people again without first checking with the Department of Justice because it would be difficult to prosecute such people in the future," the report says."Mr. Kennedy further advised that because of this matter it would be very difficult to initiate any prosecution against Giancana, as Giancana could immediately bring out the fact that the United States Government had approached him to arrange for the assassination of Castro."Memo from Hoover details Soviets' 'shock and consternation' after Kennedy death A memo from former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover quotes a source within the USSR saying the Soviets were shocked by the news of Kennedy's death.The source said the news sparked "great shock and consternation and church bells were tolled in the memory of President Kennedy.""According to our source, officials of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believed there was some well-organized conspiracy on the part of the 'ultraright' in the United States to effect a 'coup,'" the memo said.The source said Soviet leaders instructed agents to immediately gather information on President Johnson following news of Kennedy's death.The FBI received an Oswald death threat the day before his murder Hoover, in a Nov. 24, 1963, report, said a man called into the FBI's office in Dallas saying he would kill Oswald just a day before he was shot and killed.Hoover says in the report the call was "from a man talking in a calm voice," saying he was a member of a committee to kill Oswald.Hoover points to Jack Ruby as Oswald's killer."There is nothing further on the Oswald case except that he is dead," Hoover says in the report."Ruby says no one was associated with him and denies having made the telephone call to our Dallas office last night."Hoover also said in the memo he had evidence of Oswald's guilt and was concerned there would be doubt by the public that Oswald was behind Kennedy's assassination.Kennedy considered creating bounty system that valued Castro at 2 cents The Kennedy administration in 1962 proposed creating a bounty system that would pay Cubans for killing communists and that valued Castro's life at just 2 cents.The proposed system is detailed in a report from the White House, and would have offered rewards ranging from 2 cents to $1 million.Officials planned on dropping leaflets by air over Cuba that would have described the prizes for specific communist leaders."One final leaflet may be deemed advisable and that one announcing a 0.02 reward for the delivery of Castro," the memo said.
#MeToo Unites the Women's Convention:::::Nearly everyone at the Women's Convention had a story.One woman told a packed conference room that she had been abducted and raped as a child, and her parents hadn't noticed.Another told a group of potential Emily's List candidates about how she had escaped her abusive husband.A third described being told she was "too pretty" for her corporate job.The attendees had gathered to discuss immigration, health care, voting rights and racial justice.But the recent wave of allegations of sexual violence against women became the issue that united them all."Th e conversation around sexual assault and violence against women of course puts some new energy into the movement," says Linda Sarsour, one of the national co-chairs of the Women's March ."It also allows people to find courage, and when you find courage on an issue like sexual assault, you will find courage to talk about immigration, you will find courage to talk about poverty."The Convention offered an element of healing.It featured panels on "self-care" and "safe spaces," and a free yoga class for anybody who needed a break.Attendees cried easily and often, but without embarrassment: there were few men around to make it awkward.But the Women's Convention wasn't a therapy session.Throughout the three-day weekend in Detroit, the #MeToo campaign and the unfolding series of sexual allegations against high-profile men worked like gasoline on an already roaring fire.Rage over the allegations fueled the political indignation that had brought all these women to Detroit in the first place.Actress Rose McGowan opened the Convention on Friday morning with a rousing speech about sexual abuse, her first since she first came forward with allegations against Harvey Weinstein."In the face of unspeakable actions from one monster, we look away to another, the head monster of all right now," she said.Later that night, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York urged women to run for office, arguing that electing more women is the only way to truly change policies around sexual violence."Just imagine if Congress was 51% women," she said."Do you think it would be so hard to change workplace rules that are stuck in the Mad Men era?"The next day, keynote speaker Rep. Maxine Waters of California pulled no punches: "Keep your nasty comments away from us," she said."Keep your hands off our backs and our goddamn bodies.We're not going to take it anymore."And among the ordinary women who assembled to plan a takeover of the 2018 elections , there was a sense that the wave of sexual allegations was the final straw in their frustration."T hese women-led protests and movements and the elevating of discourse about harassment and sexual violence against women are definitely connected," says Shireen Ghorbani, a 36-year old communications professional who plans to run for Congress in Utah's 2nd district."W e have to create more space where women are in decision making rooms."" I think every woman has a Me Too story," says Val Montgomery, 45, who works in finance for a telecommunications company."I wear jackets every day.I try not to put off any sexual orientation at all.I dont go out with the boys club.When they make jokes about certain situations, I leave the cafeteria."Of course, hashtag activism often has questionable impact, and its not yet clear whether #MeToo will go the way of #RapeHasNoUniform or #YesAllMen.But even if the hashtag eventually fades, a collective rage has been unleashedand that rage is propelling women into civic engagement in unprecedented numbers.If we can get more people at the table who have been at the receiving end of harassment and sexual violence, says Ghorbani, then I think were going to see some solutions we haven't seen before.
Donald Trump Slams Russia Investigation As Charges Near:::::In a Sunday morning Twitter spree, President Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party of using an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election as a "witch hunt for evil politics.""Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?)...the Uranium to Russia deal, the 33,000 plus deleted Emails, the Comey fix and so much more.Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia,.... "collusion," which doesn't exist," Trump wrote on Twitter."The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics, but the R's ...are now fighting back like never before.There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out.DO SOMETHING!"Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?),....- Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2017 It was not immediately clear who Trump was telling to "do something."But the series of tweets come after CNN reported that a federal grand jury had approved the first charges filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who's investigating Russian electoral interference and any potential links between Russia and the Trump campaign.The charges could be made public as early as Monday, CNN reported.Trump also said that the conversation about Russia was a distraction to prevent Republicans from passing tax reform ."All of this "Russia" talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform.Is this coincidental?NOT!"he wrote.
The Women's Convention Was a Crash Course in Campaigning:::::The women were making to-do lists: Call your neighbor and ask her for money.Open a campaign bank account.Get the party's voter file.Find the right doors in your district.Knock on them.They sat cross-legged on the floor in overpacked rooms, listened quietly, took notes in neat handwriting, then closed their notebooks and stowed them in their purses.When they got back to Illinois or New York or Utah or Indiana, they'd unpack their notebooks, open the lists and start crossing things off."I look at my list that I gotta do, if it's make 10 phone calls, fill out four forms, start a campaign bank account, notify seven people," says Val Montgomery, 45, who works in finance at a telecom company and plans to run for Illinois state representative next year."My goal every single day is to do two items.""This election made me feel like obviously anyone can hold elected office, literally anyone!"says Shireen Ghorbani, 36, who works in communications and is running for Congress against Republican Chris Stewart in Utah's 2nd district."I think women have a right to be pissed off right now."Ten months after the Women's March mobilized the largest protest in U.S. history , the Resistance is getting down to brass tacks.When more than 4,000 women gathered in Detroit's Cobo Convention Center for a three-day Women's Convention , many of them were there to learn how to run for office themselves.The convention is an attempt to transform the woman's movement's momentum into votes, seats and majorities. "Marching is just not enough," says Linda Sarsour, one of the national co-chairs of the Women's March, in an interview."In the short term, we have to win in 2018."Women are rising to the challenge.More than 20,000 have approached Emily's List about running for office in the year since Trump's election; normally the group has fewer than 1,000 requests at this point in the cycle.The Convention had so many panels on the practical logistics of political organizing that it was impossible to attend them all: they were scheduled at the same time, sometimes in rooms too small to accommodate the lines of women waiting outside to get in.The panelists gave practical advice: which technological tools to use (ActBlue and GroundGame were two suggestions), how much money to raise (more than you think), what works (direct text messaging) and what doesn't (boring social media posts).At nearly every political organizing panel, the moderators asked for a show of hands to see who was considering running.It was usually about half the room.Women who didn't raise their hands looked sheepish.Some women who started the weekend not sure if they would run were giving interviews about their likely candidacy just hours later.Some of the women planning to give it a shot describe their candidacy as a duty, not an aspiration. "I almost feel like its a little bit selfish not to run," says Charlesetta Wilson, 39, who is strongly considering running for Michigan House of Representatives from her Detroit district."Even though I may have to sacrifice my privacy and things like that, its for the better of the whole, its for the better of the community."Still, desire to run is one thing: practical guidance is another.Some of the advice they got was obvious: be yourself, watch out for embarrassing social media posts, ask your friends and family for money.Other tips were specifically aimed at women who had no political experience and may not be able to hire paid staff.Jessica Morales Rocketto, a Clinton campaign veteran who recently became the political director of the Domestic Worker's Alliance, had some good advice: learn Excel, because voter files will be useless without it.Master peer-to-peer texting, since many people don't have landlines anymore.If you don't want to run, call city council and ask if there are any appointed positions you can fill."People are way too focused on social media as a tool," Rocketto said, adding that candidates too often use social media for boring posts like "Happy Pacific Islander Day" instead of actual commentary on the issues.Facebook is worthwhile, she says, but Snapchat is probably a waste of time.Some experts emphasized the importance of appropriate physical contact (handshakes, shoulder grabs) in connecting with voters.Others reminded women that time, not money, was their most important political resource.There was advice on how to vet themselves to pre-empt surprises from their opponents (check your taxes!)and how to manage family life during a mudslinging campaign. "The biggest problem is that your spouse or partner's gonna get really mad," Emily's List President Stephanie Schriock told a crowd of would-be candidates."Youll be fine, you're tough as nails.Theyre gonna freak out."For some women, the nuts-and-bolts approach helped them think of electoral politics as something tangible, a process they could actually participate in."I've always had vague political aspirations," says Michele Oberholtzer, a housing advocate who is considering a run for Michigan State House."But I didn't have the tools to even know where to start."For others, the Convention provided a step-by-step guide to achieving what now seemed to be almost a calling. "If not me, who?"says Maureen Martin, 60, who plans to run for county commission in her rural county in southeastern Michigan."How would someone else have more ability than I have right now?Its an obligation, its a responsibility."
President Trump's Approval Ratings Just Hit a New All-Time Low:::::President Donald Trump's approval ratings have fallen to their lowest point since the start of his presidency, a new poll finds.Just 38% of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as President, while 58% disapprove, according to the latest NBC/WSJ poll .The previous low-water mark came in May, when the poll found Trump's approval rating was 39%.Prior to the latest poll, Trump's approval rating stood at 43%.Trump's approval ratings are also historically low compared to those of his predecessors, according to NBC News.President Barack Obama had a 51% approval rating during his first fall in the White House, while President George W. Bush was at 88% in the weeks following the 9/11 attacks.When breaking down Trump's approval ratings by topic, he received the highest marks for his handling of the hurricanes in Texas and Louisiana, the economy, and "his role as Commander in Chief."But he received a 33% approval rating for his handling of the shooting in Las Vegas earlier this month.NBC News notes that the voters who reported the biggest drop in their approval of Trump include independents, white Americans, and white Americans without a college degree.The lattermost group constitutes a key part of Trump's voter base.The poll was conducted October 23 through 26, in the midst of Trump's public dispute with the family of Sgt.La David Johnson, one of four soldiers recently killed in Niger.The margin of error is 3.3 percentage points.
Most Think US Politics Has Hit a 'Dangerous Low Point':::::Most Americans Think U.S.Politics Has Hit a 'Dangerous Low Point,' Poll Finds U.S. President Donald J. Trump listens during a Department of Veterans Affairs announcement of a new program using video and software technology to provide medical care to veterans at The White House August 3, 2017 in Washington, DC.U.S. President Donald J. Trump listens during a Department of Veterans Affairs announcement of a new program using video and software technology to provide medical care to veterans at The White House August 3, 2017 in Washington, DC.Photo by Chris Kleponis-PoolGetty A new poll shows that the majority of Americans think U.S. politics has reached a "dangerous low point."Among the 71% respondents who said America's politics had reached a low point, 31% said they believe this state is temporary, while 39% said they think it is the "new normal," the Washington Post -University of Maryland poll found.A 70% majority also said American political divisions today are at least as big they were during the Vietnam War.The poll also found that six out of 10 people think the Trump administration, specifically, is dysfunctional, and another eight in 10 think Congress is as well.Money in politics was the most cited reason for the dysfunction, with 65% of people saying they blame money "a lot" for current political problems.
Barack Obama Just Got Called for Jury Duty:::::Barack Obama may no longer be in the White House, but that doesnt mean hes done serving his country.The former president was just called for jury duty.Chief Judge Tim Evans of Cook County, Ill., said Obama is scheduled to appear for jury duty next month, the Chicago Tribune reported.Adjustments will also be made to accommodate his security service, Evans said.Obviously we will make certain that he has all the accouterments that accompany a former president.His safety will be uppermost in our minds, Evans told the Tribune.Oprah Winfrey and Mr. T have also served jury duty in Cook County, where Chicago is located, according to the Tribune.Although its not a place where the public can earn a lot of money, it is highly appreciated.Its crucial that our society get the benefit of that kind of commitment, Evans said.Jurors in Cook County are paid $17.20 per day of service, according to the court.A date or location has not been released for Obamas expected jury duty.
Website With GOP Ties Funded Research on Trump Dossier:::::(NEW YORK) A conservative website with strong ties to the Republican establishment triggered the investigation into Donald Trumps past that ultimately produced the dossier that alleged a compromised relationship between the president and the Kremlin.The Washington Free Beacon on Friday confirmed it originally retained the political research firm Fusion GPS to scour then-candidate Trumps background for negative information, a common practice known as opposition research in politics.Leaders from the Free Beacon, which is funded largely by Republican billionaire Paul Singer, insisted none of the early material it collected appeared in the dossier released later in the year detailing explosive allegations, many uncorroborated, about Trump compiled by a former British spy.During the 2016 election cycle we retained Fusion GPS to provide research on multiple candidates in the Republican presidential primary, just as we retained other firms to assist in our research into Hillary Clinton, wrote the sites editor-in-chief, Matthew Continetti, and chairman Michael Goldfarb.They continued: The Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele.Earlier in the week, reports revealed that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee continued funding Fusions work after the original GOP source lost interest.Trump this week called it a disgrace that Democrats had helped pay for research that produced the document.But the original source of the research remained a secret.The president himself hinted that he knew the Republican source earlier in the week, but he refused to share it.The White House had no immediate comment Friday night about the Free Beacons involvement.The Washington Free Beacon was initially founded as a project of the conservative nonprofit group Center for American Freedom, as an alternative to liberal news sites run by progressive nonprofits.The Center for American Freedom was organized as a 501(c)4 and did not reveal its donors, but Singer was the sole funder of the site as recently as 2014, according to a Republican political veteran familiar with the site.The veteran spoke on condition of anonymity to detail the newspapers financial background.The Free Beacon first retained Fusion to investigate Trump in the fall of 2015 and ended its relationship after Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in late spring of 2016, according to a person close to Goldfarb, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private discussions.The website and its leaders have strong ties throughout the Republican establishment.Goldfarb was deputy communications director on John McCains presidential campaign.Singer was backing Florida Sen. Marco Rubios presidential bid at the time of the Free Beacons involvement.And one of Singers closest associates, Republican operative Dan Senor, served as Speaker Ryans chief adviser during the 2012 president campaign.A representative to Singer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Rubio denied any knowledge of the Fusion research or the dossier this week.As far as whether it was my campaign, it wasnt and Ill tell you why, he told CNN.I was running for president.I was trying to win.If I had anything against Donald Trump that was relevant and credible and politically damaging, I wouldve used it.I didnt have it.The document, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, emerged this year as a political flashpoint in the broader debate over Trumps ties to Russia.A person close to Singer said the billionaire was not aware of Steeles involvement or the dossier until earlier this year when it was published.The person was not authorized to share internal discussions.Law enforcement officials have worked to corroborate the dossiers claims.James Comey, FBI director at the time, advised Trump about the existence of the allegations, and Steele has been questioned as part of an ongoing probe into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump camp.The U.S. intelligence community has determined that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election.Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the Russian interference and whether it was tied to Trumps campaign.The House Intelligence Committee will help verify whether the Free Beacon had any involvement with Steele or his dossier, according to Jack Langer, a spokesman for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes.The Beacon has agreed to cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee to help the Committee verify this assertion, Langer said.In a statement Saturday, Langer said an agreement had been reached that will secure the committees access to Fusion GPS bank records necessary for its investigation.The committee had sought the records through a subpoena.
Womens Convention: Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar on 2020:::::How do you run as a woman during a feminist revolution?Speaking to the Womens Convention in Detroit on Friday, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, two popular Democrats and potential 2020 presidential contenders, offered a glimpse of two different strategies.Gillibrands speech hit all the obvious feminist notes.She lingered on womens history, placing the current Womens March movement in the same lineage as Susan B. Anthony and the Suffragettes.She emphasized the importance of paid family leave and sexual assault policies, both causes she has championed in the Senate.And she stressed that more women in government would mean inevitable progress on issues like birth control, sexual harassment and family leave.Just imagine if Congress was 51% women, Gillibrand said to a standing ovation.Do you think wed be fighting for access to birth control now?Do you think wed still be fighting to end sexual assault in college campuses and in the military?Do you think our Dreamers would be political pawns?Do you think it would be so hard to change workplace rules that are stuck in the Mad Men era?The speech contained echoes of Gillibrands fellow New Yorker and former colleague Hillary Clinton, who ran a more explicitly female-focused campaign than any other woman presidential candidate.(Few women have ever run for President, and Clinton is still the only female candidate to win a nomination of a major party, or the popular vote.)Gillibrand ended her speech with a call to action for women and girls that mirrored Clintons concession speech shout-out to all of the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity.Gillibrand spun it forward: Not until every American woman and girl can reach their potential will America reach hers.If Gillibrands speech was one preview of how a female presidential campaign might campaign in 2020, Klobuchar presented herself as an capable contender who just happened to be a woman.Klobuchar referenced the recent spate of harassment allegations, but used the issue to discuss class distinctions.We make sure it isnt just famous people who are heard, she said.We protect the shift worker at the factory, the teacher at the school, the nurse at the hospital, all women deserve to be safe wherever they work and wherever they are.Klobuchar outlined a four-point agenda that focused more on broader economic prosperity than female representation.Speaking to an audience in Michigan, the Minnesotan anchored her pitch in the Midwest, where Clinton had trouble in 2016.The Midwest matters, she said, and next time we cannot leave the middle of the country behind.She then outlined an economic to-do list that involved lowering costs for prescription drugs, air travel and student debt.She urged government to take on the pharmaceutical lobby and endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warrens plan to refinance student loans.Both speeches embraced the economic spirit of Sen. Bernie Sanders 2016 campaign.Gillibrand condemned the soft corruption of money in politics and described health care as a right, not a privilege.Klobuchar called for an economic agenda for America and a manufacturing economy that leaves no people behind.They both called for tougher regulations on big corporations and more transparency about money in politics.How to approach the role of gender in politics is a critical choice facing many female politicians at a moment when women have emerged as the engine of the new left.The day after Trumps inauguration, nearly 5 million women flooded the streets for the Womens March, which became the largest demonstration in U.S. history.Stalwart progressive organizations like Planned Parenthood, upstart groups like Indivisible (whose base is 74% female) and self-organizing groups of concerned mothers helped stymie the Trump Administrations efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.A record 51 women ran in Virginias Democratic primaries for the House of Delegates, nearly double the number in 2015.And the Womens Convention in Detroit is hosting workshops and panels to coach even more women to run for office.This momentum, coupled with the raw anguish felt by many women after Clintons loss, suggests Democrats may decide to nominate another female presidential candidate in 2020.One likely contender is Warren, who has long captivated the left wing of the party.Gillibrand and Klobuchar are two other potential candidates.Both mentioned Warren in their speeches, endorsing both her legislation (to refinance student loans) and her rhetoric (the rigged system).No matter how you do it, playing the woman card is risky.It can mobilize some women but alienate others, and its not clear whether womens empowerment is a winning issue with anybody who doesnt already call themselves a feminist.According to an October Pew survey, 44% of American men and 33% of women say gender equality has been about right, while 13% of men and 8% of women say its gone too far.A feminist campaign is also unlikely to win over many Trump voters: 22% of Republican men say they think gender equality has gone too far.With more than three years to go and countless twists ahead, both Gillibrand and Klobuchar have plenty of time to perfect their messaging should they choose to run in 2020.But if they do make a bid, theyll have to figure out that impossible puzzle: how to make progress for women while transcending gender, how to be both female and human at the same time.
Why Billionaire Tom Steyer Wants Donald Trump Impeached:::::Donald Trump's latest Twitter dustup is with California megadonor Tom Steyer, who is funding a push to impeach the 45th president.On Friday morning, Trump appeared to have caught wind of the effort, criticizing the progressive activist on Twitter by calling him "wacky and totally unhinged."Wacky & totally unhinged Tom Steyer, who has been fighting me and my Make America Great Again agenda from beginning, never wins elections!- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2017 In an interview with TIME on Friday afternoon, Steyer doubled down on claims that he makes in an ad that aired during Fox & Friends on Friday morning, which may have brought his campaign to Trump's attention."He really is an immediate danger to the health and safety of America," says Steyer from Los Angeles."This administration doesn't have a clue."In the ad, Steyer himself accuses Trump of bringing America to the brink of nuclear war with North Korea and undermining the First Amendment by "threatening" to "shut down" news organizations , as well as potentially violating the emoluments clause .He says the "big one" is obstruction of justice, which he believes Trump committed when he fired James Comey from his job at the FBI.Like other Trump critics , Steyer argues that the question of whether the President meets the standards for impeachment "is not a close call."A spokesperson for Steyer says that "well over" $10 million is being spent on airing the ad in all 50 states.When asked whether he was attempting to get Trump's attention by airing it on a news channel the President is known to watch, Steyer says his team is simply attempting to reach Americans "of different political groupings" in order to energize a grassroots campaign to oust Trump from office.Being the target of the President's ire may help boost awareness of the effort however far-fetched it may be, especially while Republicans control Congress as well as awareness of Steyer himself, who is a mulling a run for office in California.The 60-year-old made his fortune in hedge funds, then made a name for himself as an environmental crusader after retiring from the financial world in 2012.In the last two election cycles, he poured more than $165 million of his personal fortune into supporting progressive candidates and causes, leading some to hold him up as a counterweight to the conservative Koch brothers.With California Gov.Jerry Brown nearing the end of his fourth and final term, the race to replace him is heating up.There will also be a contest for Sen. Dianne Feinstein's seat in 2018.Steyer says that he hasn't ruled out jumping into either race, as he criticizes the tacks Trump has taken on healthcare, taxes and immigration."I'm willing to do just about anything to try and contribute to getting us back on a growth path that is just and good for America," Steyer says."I haven't ruled out any of those races because I'm trying to figure out the thing that will make the biggest impact."Right now, he says, that's his impeachment campaign, which could also prove helpful groundwork: Given that Democrats sometimes struggle to differentiate their positions in California, campaigning against the Trump agenda and promising to resist it will no doubt be a central part of many 2018 contests.Running or not, Steyer will be part of the mix in 2018 through NextGen America, an organization fueled by his money that works to get out the vote and support progressive candidates in California as well as other states.When asked specifically about the language Trump used in his tweet, Steyer gave a hearty five-second laugh."I am not going to let anything bother me or dissuade me," he says.The ad began airing a week ago.When asked how long it will be running, a spokesperson for Steyer says, "There's no end in sight."
Donald Trump Gives Halloween Candy to Kids at White House:::::'You Have No Weight Problems, That's the Good News.'President Trump Gives Candy to Children President Donald Trump on Friday doled out candy to the children of White House reporters ahead of Halloween on Tuesday.Well, you have no weight problems, thats the good news, right?, Trump said to the costumed trick-or-treaters as he handed out candy.So you take out whatever you need.If you want some for your friends, take them.We have plenty.As the children surrounded Trump by his desk in the Oval Office, the President couldn't help but make jabs at his contentious relationship with the press , saying the reporters did a "good job" with their children, though he does not feel they do a good job with him."I cannot believe the media produced such beautiful children," he said.Later, addressing the kids, he added: "I bet you get treated better by the press than anybody in the world."
Momentum High to Pass Tax Cuts, Larry Kudlow Says:::::Momentum is high to pass legislation to cut taxes, economic analyst Larry Kudlow said Sunday on The Cats Roundtable radio program.Stressing that the business side of the economy is having its best showing in more than 10 years, Kudlow told the shows host John Catsimatidis on AM 970 in New York that, it's as though businesses are sniffing out tax cuts, and they're starting to pull the trigger on some investments.And that of course will lead to higher wages And I think the stock market loves it.Although Kudlow admitted that it is difficult to predict politics and there's going to be some issues regarding deductions, he said the confidence factor is helping the economy as the GOP seems to be coming together on the issue.Kudlow acknowledged, in terms of jobs, the bricks-and-mortar companies are losing ground and they're losing jobs as a consequence, but he emphasized that the Internet companies are actually creating more jobs then we're losing.He added that Profits once again are beating expectations in the third-quarter reports that are coming out and that three-percent growth for the second straight quarter has surprised many people.Kudlow emphasized that President Donald Trumps plan on the corporate tax rate and repatriation is very important for an even stronger economy so that all the overseas companies bring their profits back home.He cited an example of the potential of the plan, saying 700 US companies are registered in Ireland, which has a 12.5 percent corporate tax compared to ours, which is 40 percent, emphasizing that we have to bring those people home, bring their cash home, and invest it and put it to work here in the US.Related stories:
Bharara: Watch Trump Very Closely When Indictment Comes Down:::::Former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Sunday hell be watching for two reactions from President Donald Trump after reported charges are brought in special counsel Robert Muellers Russia investigation.In an interview on CNNs State of the Union, Bharara, who is a legal commentator for the outlet, said the nation already knows the president has strong reactions to public events even events that have been caused by his own actions.I would look for a couple of things, he said.One, whether or not Donald Trump has some reaction and talks in a way that could be used against him in the future, because Bob Mueller would do that.And the second thing I would look at is to see if the president of the United States is sending some kind of message to the potential defendant or other witnesses is he sending a message of intimidation some way, through himself or his cohorts, suggesting that people should not be talking and people should keep their mouths shut and whether or not he sends a message of reassurance.Bharara said theres been much speculation about whether or not Donald Trump would hesitate to use his pardon power to get out of legal jeopardy and trouble any allies of his are in, noting he did so with former Sheriff Joe Arpaio.And that's something I would watch very, very closely here, he said.Bharara served as a U.S. attorney in New Yorks Southern District but was one of the 46 U.S. attorneys the president fired after taking office.
Angus King: Collusion Denials Meant to Distract From Indictment:::::Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) on Sunday refuted President Donald Trumps tweeted assertion that its commonly agreed there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow.In an interview on CNNs State of the Union, King, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, denied the panel had come to that conclusion."It's certainly not commonly agreed in our committee, and we're the ones doing the investigation, he said.I don't think there's any basis for that statement.It's entirely possible that we may end up in the investigation at the end that there wasn't, but the contrary could also be true."King also dismissed calls by some Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., for Russia investigation special prosecutor Robert Mueller to step down because of an alleged conflict of interest.The fact that these charges are coming at kind of a crescendo at the very time there it appears they're also indictments, to be forthcoming, there is a kind of coincidence there that I don't think you can miss, King said.King added that the reported first indictment in Muellers probe may be just the beginning.Like everyone else in Washington, I'll be watching tomorrow to see what comes out of the Mueller investigation, he said.But I think it's important to emphasize that this, whatever it is, is really just the beginning.And I'm sure there will be additional evidence, assuming director Mueller uncovers additional evidence.He's going to follow the facts where they lead.
GOP Sen. Portman: Do 'Our Job,' Stop Focusing on WH Attacks:::::Setting "an example of bipartisanship and civility" is the "job" of American politicians, and "of course character counts," but focusing too much on attacking President Donald Trump keeps Washington "out of touch with the American people," Sen.Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said Sunday."Yeah, of course character counts," Sen. Portman told NBC News' "Meet the Press.""And I don't agree with every tweet as you know I've spoken up on occasion and yet if you're focused on the tweets and not focused on actually accomplishing what people are looking to have happen for them and their family, I think you are getting out of touch with the American people."Sen. Portman's comments suggest those criticizing Trump are engaging in the exact behavior they are ripping him for: Lacking civility or focus on the people in American politics.Back the president of the United States, he added."We've got to be sure that he succeeds, because when he succeeds the country succeeds," Portman told host Chuck Todd."So, I was not someone who at the end was able to vote for him."But when he was elected, I said, 'I'm going to work with him on tax reform, on addressing the opioid crisis' ...And I think that's our job: Our job is to actually get some things done here and help to influence the administration toward accomplishing things that people care about."Sen. Portman, as pressed by Todd, refused to blame President Trump or give a vote of no confidence, despite the fact Portman did not vote for him nor does he always agree with President Trump, especially amid foreign efforts to sow lack of confidence in our democracy."Look, he won and I think you would agree he won the election fair and square," Portman told Todd."He's duly elected, and we ought to instead focus on the outrage that the Russians meddled in our elections, not just this last election."They did it long before Donald Trump.They're going to do it long after Donald Trump, if we don't do something about it.So, we need to get to the bottom of it, and we need to go where the facts lead us."
Trump, Michael Moore Start Twitter War Over Broadway Show:::::Donald Trump and Michael Moore dueled on Twitter over Moore's recent Broadway show, with Trump taking a potshot at Moore's "The Terms of My Surrender" in the midst of a series of tweets about First Responders Day and the JFK files.Trump had not attended the production, at which Moore made a point of reserving a box seat at every performance for the president.But early Saturday evening, Trump tweeted, "While not at all presidential I must point out that the Sloppy Michael Moore Show on Broadway was a TOTAL BOMB and was forced to close.Sad!"While not at all presidential I must point out that the Sloppy Michael Moore Show on Broadway was a TOTAL BOMB and was forced to close.Sad!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 28, 2017 "Terms of My Surrender" closed Oct. 22, and while it's true the show was a middling performer at the box office, it wasn't poor sales that forced it to close.The production, announced as a limited, 12-week run, had always been scheduled to wrap up last weekend.Moore responded to Trump with a string of tweets, starting with "1) You must have my smash hit of a Broadway show confused with your presidency- which IS a total bomb and WILL indeed close early.NOT SAD."He proceeded to call attention to casualties in Afghanistan, the lack of response to Hurricane Maria and the news that Robert Mueller will soon serve the first indictment in his investigation of the Russian interference in the presidential election.1) You must have my smash hit of a Broadway show confused with your presidency-- which IS a total bomb and WILL indeed close early.NOT SAD https://t.co/URgXgzWWVk Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 29, 2017 2) Today, 1 U.S. service member was killed & 6 injured in our never-ending war in Afghanistan.You,our President, are not even aware of this Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 29, 2017 3) You ARE aware I'm a "B'way star" & I guess this bothers you more.SAD.Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 29, 2017 4) Prosecutor Mueller's GrandJury has just approved the 1st criminal indictments of your administration.R u trying 2 distract us from this?Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 29, 2017 5) 38 days after Maria, 3/4 of PR (our fellow Americans) have NO electricity.Yet u are more upset that so many ppl saw my B'way show.SAD.Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 29, 2017 6) They say Twitter "distracts" you from your presidency.But Twitter IS YOUR PRESIDENCY!It's all you know how to do.#LOSER!Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 29, 2017 7) And now, for this weekend, Im your latest distraction from your crimes.Ha!Raucous & joyous crowds every nite on Bway- & u missed out!Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 29, 2017 8) It was the highest grossing play (non-musical) of the summer, despite my offering $29 cheap seats + free student tix so ALL could afford.Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 29, 2017 9) As announced on May 1st, it was always a "12-WEEK-ONLY" run, due to my commitments to my upcoming primetime TV series & my new movie.Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 29, 2017 He finished with a last jab about the impeachment that he hopes will cut Trump's presidency short: "10) On Broadway, Donald, they call it a 'LIMITED ENGAGEMENT' -- just like we're planning on making your presidency."
Kasich: 'Not Plotting or Planning' Presidential Bid Right Now:::::Gov.John Kasich declared Sunday the inward looking wing of the GOP wont last because millennials will ultimately decide the direction of the Republican Party.In an interview on Fox News Sunday, the Ohio Republican acknowledged a debate is raging within the party on whether the country ought to look outward on issues involving trade, immigration and the nations relationship with its allies.Millennials, he argued, are comfortable with global outreach.The GenXers and the millennials are going to begin to overtake the baby boomers, he said.And it will mean a profound shift in the way both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party function.I think that this move towards nationalism or looking inward, a lot of loud voices I don't happen to think it's the bulk of the GOP, Kasich added.And we will have to see over time.That debate to some degree, is going to be settled by the demographics in the near future.Maybe not today, not tomorrow, but soon it's going to be decided by that new wave of new thinking by these young people who can bring a lot of energy to the Republican Party and the conservative movement.Kasich also sought to put a damper on talk about his immediate political plans, including a bid for the White House in 2020.All I want to do is contribute to bringing a calm voice that involves inclusion and everybody growing, he said.Where that's going to take me, I really don't know.But I can tell you, at this point, I'm not plotting or planning anything like a run for the presidency, he declared.That's just not where my head is right now.I am going to be a voice for the new generation, the next generation, and for what has traditionally been strong in the party.And I'm going to do my best to promote that.
Sen. McCaskill: Too Many Dems Fighting 'to Run for President':::::The ever-crowded and still-growing field of Democrats elbowing for position to oppose President Donald Trump in 2020 has created "angst" within the Democratic Party, and voters "want us to quit fighting with each other," Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said Sunday."It's hard when we are the minority party, that we have lots of folks that are leaders and want to be leaders," Sen. McCaskill told NBC News "Meet the Press" host Chuck Todd."We have so many people that are trying to position themselves to run for president I think it's hard to say who is the leader, and there's a lot of angst about that."Sen. McCaskill is considered a moderate Democrat and has expressed an interest in working with President Trump on tax reform for the benefit of her constituents, irrespective of the Democrats' political warfare against the White House."I frankly don't worry about any of that," Sen. McCaskill told Todd."That's not something that concerns me right now."McCaskill added, amid the political infighting, "we get kind of lost in the weeds.""There's cultural issues that Donald Trump was, I think, very smart to emphasize that have made it hard sometimes for us to relate," she said."...And the cultural issues divide cities and the rural areas.I've got to figure out a way to knit all that together.And after doing almost 50 town halls, I'll tell you this: They want us to quit fighting with each other.That's what they want."
Rep. Schiff Would've Liked to Know Who Funded Dossier Sooner:::::Before deflecting away from revelations the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee helped fund the foreign opposition research of Fusion GPS directed at President Donald Trump, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., admitted he "would have liked to know" about the funding source sooner."I certainly would have liked to know who paid for it earlier, but nonetheless, that's just one factor to be considered," Rep. Schiff told ABC's "This Week" host George Stephanopoulos.Rep. Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, then turned to desires to verify the findings of the opposition research, which President Trump rebuked as a "witch hunt for evil politics" in a Sunday tweetstorm."How much of the work is accurate?"Rep. Schiff, a frequent critic of President Trump, asked Stephanopoulos."How much of it is true?And my colleagues don't seem particularly interested in that question, but that is really the most important question for the American people."Rep. Schiff, undeterred on the potential political motivations of the foreign research aimed at sowing discord in American democracy, admitted after months of investigating there is no concrete evidence of the Democrats' alleged Trump campaign collusion with Russians beyond what is "highly suggestive of that," he said."The question we continue to investigate is, was the campaign coordinating in the Russian help?"Rep. Schiff asked."That remains to be seen."What Rep. Schiff refused to say is whether or not FBI special counsel Robert Mueller is targeting President Trump in his investigation of Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election."I can't comment on that, George," Rep. Schiff told Stephanopoulos."I can't answer that one way or the other....I can't comment on that at all."
Susan Collins: Given Dossier Funding, Podesta Should Be Recalled to Testify:::::GOP Sen. Susan Collins said Sunday shes seen no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow in the Intelligence Committees investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election.In an interview on CBS News Face The Nation, the Maine senator, a member of the intelligence panel, also said Hillary Clinton campaign officials ought to be brought back before the committee for questioning about the funding of opposition research against President Donald Trump."They absolutely need to be recalled, she said of former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and a lawyer from the campaign.It's difficult to imagine that a campaign chairman, that the head of the DNC would not know of an expenditure of this magnitude and significance, she said.But perhaps there's something more going on here.But certainly it's worth additional questioning of both two witnesses.Collins said in the intelligence panels Russia probe so far, theres been no evidence of collusion.I have not yet seen any definitive evidence of collusion, she said.Ive seen lots of evidence that the Russians were very active in trying to influence the elections."
US Official: White House Opposed Vote on Israel 'Annexation' Bill:::::US President Donald Trump's administration opposed a planned vote on a controversial Israeli bill that critics say would amount to de facto annexation of Jewish settlements surrounding Jerusalem, a US official said Sunday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu postponed a vote on the bill by a ministerial committee that was scheduled to take place on Sunday, with an Israeli official saying "diplomatic preparation" was needed.It was a signal that Netanyahu was under pressure not to move forward from the White House, which has been seeking ways to restart long-stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks."I think it's fair to say that the US is discouraging actions that it believes will unduly distract the principals from focusing on the advancement of peace negotiations," a US official said on condition of anonymity."The Jerusalem expansion bill was considered by the administration to be one of those actions."David Bitan, chairman of Netanyahu's governing coalition, told Israel's army radio on Sunday that "there's American pressure that says that it's a case of annexation."He disputed that the bill amounted to "annexation".According to Haaretz newspaper, Netanyahu told cabinet members on Sunday that the bill must be discussed with US officials before it can move forward.The bill would absorb major Israeli settlements currently in the occupied West Bank into Jerusalem by enlarging the city limits.Its opponents argue that it is a step towards full unilateral annexation of the West Bank settlements affected -- a move that would be sure to spark international outrage.For the vast majority of the international community, the status of Israel's settlements, built on land the Palestinians see as part of their future state, is to be decided in peace negotiations.The bill has drawn harsh criticism from Palestinians and those hoping to salvage the two-state solution.Settlements affected are Maale Adumim, Beitar Illit, Efrat, Givat Zeev, and the Gush Etzion settlement bloc.Intelligence and Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz, who has pushed for the bill, says it would add an additional 150,000 people to Jerusalem's population, strengthening its Jewish majority.Israel occupied the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, in the Six-Day War of 1967.It later annexed east Jerusalem in a move never recognised by the international community.It sees the entire city as its indivisible capital, while the Palestinians want the eastern sector as the capital of their future state.Barack Obama's administration's was heavily critical of Israeli settlement activity, but Trump has been far less vocal on the issue.His ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, is himself a supporter of Israeli settlements.Israeli officials say around 12,000 settlement housing units will be given various stages of approval this year, four times the number in 2016.
Sen. Corker: Nothing Should Be Off the Table on Tax Reform:::::President Donald Trumps controversial tweets on North Koreas leader and State Department efforts to end the buildup of the rogue nations nuclear arsenal have kneecapped diplomacy, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said Sunday.In an interview on CBS News Face The Nation, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a vocal critic of Trumps social media digs at North Korea leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillersons strategy said a military conflict is the last thing the United States wants to see.When our secretary of state is sitting down with a partner that matters most, China, trying to negotiate something that would resolve and keep us from going into military conflict with North Korea, which brings in South Korea, Japan, Russia and kneecapped by the president it hurts our nation, he said."It hurts our efforts.It leads us more fully towards the conflict that most of us would like to see resolved in another way.The tweets that are sent out mocking a leader of another country, raises tensions in the region."Corker also weighed in on the GOP tax reform plan, saying nothing in the current tax code should be untouchable.When groups start rallying against things and they succeed, everything starts unraveling, he said.We've got tough decisions to make, let's leave everything, the whole cafeteria of the code out there, so that let the tax writers do their job.If you start taking things off the table on the front end we're not going to get where we need to go, he said.
Christie: Trump Is Not Indictment Target:::::Gov.Chris Christie said Sunday hes heard nothing to indicate President Donald Trump is a target of special prosecutor Robert Muellers investigation of Russian meddling in the election or possible collusion with the Trump campaign.In an interview on CNNs State of the Union, the New Jersey Republican said the news has been good so far for Trump.I think the good news, from the presidents perspective, is hes not under investigation, Christie said.Elaborating on how he knew that to be true, Christie added: The last news that weve received publicly is that the president was told hes not under investigation.Weve heard nothing to the contrary.So Im making that statement off of the public information that weve already been given.In a separate interview on CBS News Face The Nation, Christie reiterated the assertion, declaring no one has told Trump he a Mueller probe target.
Trump: 'Do Something' About Dems' 'Witch Hunt for Evil Politics':::::President Donald Trump unleashed a flurry of tweets Sunday morning, decrying the Clinton-funded "fake dossier," "the Comey fix," and "the phony Trump/Russia collusion" as a "witch hunt for evil politics," finishing the tweetstorm with a call for Congress to "do something" about it.Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?),....Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2017 The tweets come on the heels of reports FBI special counsel Robert Mueller will be serving the first indictment from his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.Mueller's charges are sealed through a federal judge's order but will be revealed Monday, both the charges and who is charged, according to reports.Gov.Chris Christie, R-N.J., told ABC News' "This Week" the indictment will not come as a surprise to those involved, because "if you're the person, you know."Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., lashed out at Democratic colleagues on "Fox News Sunday," saying they have had tunnel vision against President Trump in the execution in the probe of Russian interference."[Foreign influencers] tried to attack the fundamentals of our democracy, and thats what I've spent 2017 focusing on," Rep. Gowdy told host Chris Wallace."That to me is an American issue.I wish the Democrats would help a little bit more, instead of reading the Moscow phonebook during the witnesses interviews trying to see if Jared Kushner knows a guy named Igor.I wish they'd help."Former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, put the onus on Bill and Hillary Clinton, as he wrote in a Fox News op-ed this weekend."At first, I assumed the liberal elites were simply driven by their inability to accept that the American people elected Donald Trump as their 45th president," Gingrich wrote."Now, I have another theory: The Trump-Russia story is meant to serve as a pure distraction aimed at masking real corruption by the Clinton political machine...."The great irony of all this though, is that the Clintons started the so-called Russian collusion scandal, and in the end, they may be the ones destroyed by it."President Trump followed up his series of tweets Sunday with his own conclusion the latest "'Russia' talk" amid the GOP's "big push" for tax reform is not "coincidental."All of this "Russia" talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform.Is this coincidental?NOT!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2017 Earlier Sunday, Trump tweeted a vow to renew his No.1 campaign promise of repealing and replacement of Obamacare "after tax cuts."
Gowdy: Dems No Help in Russia Probe, Only After Trump:::::Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., lashed out at Democrats Sunday for failing to help congressional Republicans investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election.In an interview with Fox News Sunday, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Democrats seem mostly to want to look at ties between Russia and President Donald Trump and campaign associates."They tried to attack the fundamentals of our democracy and thats what Ive spent 2017 focusing on," he said."That to me is an American issue.I wish the Democrats, a little bit more, instead of reading the Moscow phonebook during the witnesses interviews trying to see if Jared Kushner knows a guy named Igor.I wish theyd help.""Thats been my focus in 2017 is understanding that Russia tried to subvert our democracy, and itd be great if my Democratic friends helped a little bit."Gowdy also said the battle isnt only with Democrats, but with the Department of Justice, asserting he doesnt see much of a difference between the DOJ under former President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump in transparency and their willingness to share information with Congress.He pointed to the example of controversial opposition research conducted on Trump.Story continues after video.This is a really simple request.Did you rely on the dossier, and if so, did you vet it before you relied upon it?he said.You can answer that and 30 seconds, but it's taken three months for the Department of Justice, and only recently have they agreed to give us the information.The battle is not just with House Democrats, unfortunately it's also with the Department of Justice.If they relied on that dossier and they didn't corroborate it or vet it, then we have a serious issue and that's the next thing that House intel is trying to find out, whether or not the U.S. government relied on it, he added.
NBC/WSJ Poll: Trump's Approval Dips to New Low, 38 Percent:::::President Donald Trump's approval rating has sunk to a new low of 38 percent, according to the latest NBC News/The Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday."This is his worst showing of his young presidency so far," says Hart Research Associates' Fred Yang, a Democratic pollster who conducted the survey with Public Opinion Strategies' Bill McInturff, a Republican."Are we starting to see the fraying of the Trump base ...after this week of [Republican] infighting?"President Trump tweeted to the contrary Sunday morning, saying there is "anger and unity" after the revelations of the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee funding of the "fake dossier."Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?),....Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2017 The 38 percent approval rating, down from 39 percent in May, pales in comparison to the past administrations in the fall of their first year, according to the report: Barack Obama: 51 percent.George W. Bush: 88 percent.Bill Clinton: 47 percent.The poll results were decidedly partisan.While 58 percent overall disapprove of Trump's presidential performance, that number is just 17 percent disapproval among Republicans and a whopping 81 percent approve.Among Democrats, just seven percent approve, while 89 percent disapprove.The poll was conducted Oct. 23-26, surveying 900 adults with a margin of error of plus-minus 3.3 percentage points.
Trump Tweet Renews 'Repeal & Replace' Vow 'After Tax Cuts':::::President Donald Trump continued to pin the failures of raising healthcare premiums on his opponents via a Sunday morning tweet "the Dems own it" before adding a vow to "repeal & replace" Obamacare "soon after tax cuts."As usual, the ObamaCare premiums will be up (the Dems own it), but we will Repeal & Replace and have great Healthcare soon after Tax Cuts!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2017 The failure to make good on his No.1 campaign promise of reforming the ills and rising costs of U.S. healthcare has been a smudge on President Trump's administration, but it has turned focus to passing the "biggest [tax] cuts ever in the history of this country."Congress hopes to pass the Trump-led tax reform before year's end after the Senate has failed on numerous occasions to pass a repeal or a replacement of Obamacare this summer.The Senate, holding a narrow 52-48 Republican majority cannot lose more than two GOP senators in the vote, needing to get to 50 with Vice President Mike Pence's tiebreaker under budget reconciliation.Both the Senate and the House have passed a budget measure that will allow tax reform to be enacted by a simple majority in Congress and avoid a filibuster by Democrats.
EPA's Pruitt: Trump Admin Puts 'America First' in All Areas of Economy:::::The Obama administration declared war on coal and fossil fuels with its environmental regulations and participation in the Paris climate accord, Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt says.In an interview that aired Sunday with radio host John Catsimatidis on The Cats Roundtable, Pruitt hailed President Donald Trump for putting America first in all areas of our economy."In the past administration, they created tremendous uncertainty by adopting rules and regulations that were an over-reach, Pruitt said, adding: Declaring war on any sector of our economy just doesn't make sense at all.But that's exactly what happened with the past administration.According to Pruitt, the past administration declared war on coal [and] fossil fuels, despite the fact that those energy sources are tremendously important to us as a country to generate electricity, to keep costs low, and provide stability to our citizens.Pruitt also defended Trumps stance on the climate agreement signed last year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions around the world saying it wasnt an America-first policy."The Paris Accord was not good for this country.It was not an America-first approach," Pruitt said."Why would we as a country go to that type of meeting [in Paris] with the kind of [environmental] progress we've made and be apologetic?""[China and India] are polluting [but] don't [have to] take any steps until the future," he added."And sometimes not at all?That is just a bad deal for this country."The EPA administrator said past policies have only engendered an atmosphere that made the agency a political football."For the last several years, this agency has become kind of a political football, he said."We need to get back to improving air quality, improving water quality... Thats some of the best work we can do, he explained And that has been under-emphasized for the last number of years.Related Stories:
Puerto Rico Power Contract a Local Issue: White House:::::The Trump administration scrambled Friday to distance itself from the decision to award a $300 million contract to help restore Puerto Rico's power grid to a tiny Montana company from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's hometown.The White House said federal officials played no role in the selection of Whitefish Energy Holdings by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.The administration disavowed the contract amid a growing number of investigations and a bipartisan chorus of criticism from Capitol Hill.Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Zinke had given the president his personal assurance that he had nothing to do with what she described as "a state and local decision made by the Puerto Rican authorities and not the federal government."The interior secretary also issued a fiery denial on Twitter, saying "Only in elitist Washington, D.C., would being from a small town be considered a crime."Whitefish Energy Holdings is headquartered in Whitefish, Montana, which has a population of about 7,200.Zinke, a former Montana congressman, knows Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski.Zinke's son also had a summer job at a Whitefish construction site."I had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish Energy receiving a contract in Puerto Rico," said Zinke in a statement linked to a tweet."Any attempts by the dishonest media or political operatives to tie me to awarding or influencing any contract involving Whitefish are completely baseless."Zinke acknowledged that after the company's initial contract was awarded, he was contacted by the company, though he did not give the name of the individual who reached out to him.Zinke said he took no action and that all relevant documents would be disclosed to "appropriate officials.""I welcome any and all investigations into these allegations," Zinke said.The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general, an agency watchdog, confirmed Friday that federal auditors will review the Whitefish contract."As part of their standard procedure, they will conduct vetting to look for the presence of any inappropriate relationships," said Arlen Morales, a spokeswoman for the inspector general's office.The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is part of Homeland Security, said it has not approved any reimbursement requests from the utility for money to cover ongoing repairs to the island's power grid following Hurricane Maria.FEMA said in a statement that any language in the controversial contract saying the agency approved of the deal with Whitefish is inaccurate.The contract said the utility would not pay costs unallowable under FEMA grants, but it also said, "The federal government is not a party to this contract."The agency said its initial review raised significant concerns about how Whitefish got the deal and whether the contracted prices were reasonable.The 2-year-old company had just two full-time employees when the storm hit Sept. 20.It has since hired more than 300 workers.A price list attached to the Whitefish contract reviewed by The Associated Press sets rates for both workers and equipment to be paid by the utility: $20,277 an hour for a heavy lift Chinook helicopter, $650 an hour for a large crane truck, $322 an hour for a foreman of a power line crew, $319 an hour for a journeyman lineman and $286 an hour for a mechanic.Each worker also gets a daily allowance of $80 for food, $332 for a hotel room and $1,000 for each flight to or from the mainland.Multiple congressional committees have opened investigations into the deal, the terms of which have triggered questions from both Republicans and Democrats.Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, senior Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the Whitefish contract "raises every red flag in the book."Democrats also raised questions about the role of HBC Investments, a key financial backer of Whitefish Energy.The Dallas-based company's founder and general partner, Joe Colonnetta, has contributed thousands of dollars to Trump and other Republicans, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry, a former Texas governor, and Texas Sens.John Cornyn and Ted Cruz.Colonnetta also gave to Trump's inauguration.Whitefish spokesman Chris Chiames called Colonnetta's political donations "irrelevant."The company said it would cooperate with any information requests from federal authorities."We are very proud of the work we are doing to restore power to the people of Puerto Rico under very difficult circumstances, and we respectfully ask that others await the facts before jumping to misinformed conclusions," the company said in a statement issued Friday."We have one simple goal to restore power to Puerto Rico as quickly and efficiently as possible."Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority director Ricardo Ramos has praised the work performed so far, saying the company's was the only offer the utility received that did not require a down payment.The power company is $9 billion in debt and was already struggling to provide service amid ongoing power outages before hurricanes Irma and Maria hit last month."There is nothing illegal going on here," Ramos said Thursday.A federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico's finances said this week it had appointed a former military officer to oversee the work.Retired Air Force Col. Noel Zamot will be responsible for speeding up reconstruction efforts and overseeing coordination with the board, Puerto Rico's government and the federal government.It was not immediately clear whether Zamot would have the authority to void Whitefish's contract, although under the contract the utility can suspend or terminate the contract "for any or no reason" after providing written notice to Whitefish and compensating the company for actual expenses.About 75 percent of the U.S. territory remains without power more than a month after the Category 4 storm made landfall.Puerto Rico Public Affairs Secretary Ramon Rosario told reporters on Friday he wasn't familiar with the contract's details when asked why it includes a clause that prohibits an audit or review of "the cost and profit elements of the labor rates."Rosario said only that Puerto Rico's governor already has requested an audit and that the government will turn over all pertinent documents."There obviously needs to be transparency," Rosario said."If anyone did anything illegal, let them fry in jail."
AP: DeVos May Only Partly Wipe Away Some Student Loans:::::The Education Department is considering only partially forgiving federal loans for students defrauded by for-profit-colleges, The Associated Press has learned, abandoning the Obama administration's policy of fully erasing that debt.Under President Barack Obama, tens of thousands of students deceived by now-defunct for-profit schools had over $550 million in such loans canceled completely.But President Donald Trump's education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is working on a plan that could grant such students just partial relief, according to department officials who were not authorized to publicly comment on the issue and spoke on condition of anonymity.The department may look at the average earnings of students in similar programs and schools to determine how much debt to wipe away.If DeVos goes ahead, the change could leave many students scrambling after expecting full loan forgiveness, based on the previous administration's track record.It was not immediately clear how many students might be affected.A department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday.But the Trump team has given hints of a new approach.In August, the department extended its contract with a staffing agency to speed up the processing of a backlog of loan forgiveness claims.In the procurement notice, the department said that "policy changes may necessitate certain claims already processed be revisited to assess other attributes."The department would not further clarify the meaning of that notice.DeVos' review prompted an outcry from student loan advocates, who said the idea of giving defrauded students only partial loan relief was unjustified and unfair because many of their classmates had already gotten full loan cancellation.Critics say the Trump administration, which has ties to the for-profit sector, is looking out for industry interests.Earlier this year, Trump paid $25 million to settle charges his Trump University misled students."Anything other than full cancellation is not a valid outcome," said Eileen Connor, a litigator at Harvard University's Project on Predatory Student Lending, which has represented hundreds of defrauded students of the now-shuttered Corinthian Colleges."The nature of the wrong that was done to them, the harm is even bigger than the loans that they have.""Even more importantly, it is completely unfair that a happenstance of timing is going to mean that one student who's been defrauded is going to have full cancellation and the next is not," Connor said.A federal regulation known as borrower defense allows students at for-profit colleges and other vocational programs to have their loans forgiven if it is determined that the students were defrauded by the schools.That rule dates to the early 1990s.But it was little used until the demise of Corinthian and ITT for-profit chains in recent years caused tens of thousands of students to request that the government cancel their loans.In the last few months of the Obama administration, the Education Department updated the rule to add protections for students, shift more financial responsibility onto the schools and prevent schools from having students sign away their right to sue a school.That change was set to take effect in July, but DeVos has frozen it and is working on a new version.She argued that the Obama regulation was too broad and could cancel the loans of some students without a sound basis.DeVos has come under criticism for delaying consideration of over 65,000 applications for loan forgiveness under the borrower defense rule.The agency hasn't approved a single claim since DeVos took office in February.Jennifer Wang, an expert with the Institute of College Access and Success, said the Obama administration was providing full loan cancellations to students."It would be totally different from what was happening under the last administration," Wang said."It's not equitable; it's not fair for students.If she provides partial relief, it's that she only cares what's fair for schools and not students."Abby Shafroth, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, said the agency could be faced with lawsuits, especially from Corinthian students, whose classmates had received full forgiveness.
NBC News: Mueller's First Russia Indictment Will Be Served Monday:::::The first indictment from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election will be served on Monday, even though what charges are included and who will be served remains unknown, a source told NBC News on Saturday.The network, quoting an unnamed U.S. official with firsthand knowledge of the case, confirmed the news, and NBC reported the news with a second source.CNN was the first to report on Friday citing several sources, that the grand jury had approved initial charges, and that the charges are remaining sealed at this time through a federal judge's order.Saturday afternoon CNN reported that there could be "more than one person," and that the indictments themselves were handed up on Friday and that charges were filed.If someone is taken into custody or surrenders on Monday, that person would go before a judge in Washington D.C. to hear the charges, beginning the legal process."So far from all the attorneys that we've talked to who are associated with some of the people who are being investigated have either not called us back, and the few that we have talked to have said their clients have not been asked to surrender yet," said CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz."They have not been told if their clients are the ones that are facing the charges.All that is still a mystery.Right now it appears that Monday will be the big day.All of this is subject to change depending on what the special counsel decides to do."Keeping indictments sealed "is fairly common at the stage when you have an indictment that is issued or approved, as it may have been today," former U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade told MSNBC Friday."The reason is that law enforcement kind of wants its ducks in a row before they go out and arrest the defendant or even notify him," said McQuade."It may be that they dont arrest whoever this defendant is because they've worked out a relationship with his or her defense attorney to bring them in to appear on the case."Already, President Donald Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the president's first national security adviser, have long been central in Mueller's investigation, but neither man's representatives have responded for requests for comment.The news came one day after White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told Fox News the White House believes the Mueller investigation is coming to an end.She based her comment on reports concerning payments that the campaign team for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee had made toward research for a dossier showing Trump's contacts with Russians.The White House has refused comments on the news about the pending indictments.Trump himself has continued to deny that reports of collusion between his campaign and Russia are anything more than a "witch hunt."CNN reported on Saturday that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has oversight over the Russian investigation after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself, would have been told of charges before they were presented to the grand jury.The investigation is looking into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, as well as whether Trump himself obstructed justice by interfering with the case's investigation through his actions, including by firing FBI Director James Comey.Lobbying efforts done by Manafort, Flynn, and others have come under scrutiny, and Mueller's teams have subpoenaed documents and testimony from many sources, including people close to Manafort.
Dread, expectation hang over DC before Mueller sweep:::::(CNN) A mood of fateful anticipation is cloaking Washington, with possible arrests imminent after the federal grand jury in the Russia investigation approved its first charges.By taking one or more people into custody, a prospect first reported by CNN Friday, Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller would create a new, perilous reality for the White House, reflecting the gravity of the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election and alleged collusion by President Donald Trump's associates.Trump and his team deny any wrongdoing, and so far there is no conclusive evidence from Mueller's closely held investigation or several congressional probes of nefarious links with the Russians.At minimum, news of charges will complicate the White House's argument that the Russia drama is nothing but a drummed up Democratic plot born of despair at Hillary Clinton's shocking loss last November, and be a distraction from the Republican tax reform effort this week.More significantly, the charges could be the first step in a series of actions by the special counsel that strike at the heart of Trump's inner political and family circle, and could even put his presidency in jeopardy.But the immediate political fallout of whatever unfolds in the coming days depends on who is initially targeted by Mueller, their proximity to Trump, and how the President reacts to this threshold being crossed."The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics, but the R's ... are now fighting back like never before," Trump tweeted Sunday."There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out.DO SOMETHING!"...are now fighting back like never before.There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out.DO SOMETHING!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2017 The special counsel has taken up several strands of inquiry, including into the business affairs of Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, claims that members of the President's campaign team, like former national security adviser Michael Flynn, transgressed in their alleged contacts with Russian officials and whether the President's dismissal of FBI Director James Comey amounted to obstruction of justice.Sending a message to Mueller?Trump's Sunday venting posed an important question that may be answered this week: Will Trump be able to direct his anger in a way that does not put him in deeper legal and political jeopardy or anger the special counsel?On many occasions throughout the Russia episode, Trump's conduct has appeared to expose him to deeper risk, for example over the Comey firing that led to Mueller's appointment.The President's political vulnerability is becoming more acute as well an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll Sunday put his approval rating at 38% -- the lowest point of his presidency.Ty Cobb, the President's top counsel, sought to make clear that Trump's Twitter eruption Sunday was not an attempt to antagonize Mueller."Contrary to what many have suggested, the President's comments today are unrelated to the activities of the special counsel, with whom he continues to cooperate," Cobb told CNN's Jeff Zeleny.But given the timing of the Twitter response on a weekend dominated by CNN's reporting of impending arrests, Cobb's explanation was open to question.The President's anger appeared to represent a clear attempt to shape the political battlefield after a week in which the White House and allies sought to muddy the narrative on the Russia investigation.There is still rampant speculation in Washington that Trump could seek to dismiss Mueller, a move that could trigger a constitutional crisis and put Republican leaders in Congress in a dicey political position.The Wall Street Journal editorial board and some conservative columnists are calling on Mueller to resign, saying his history with the FBI makes it impossible for him to fairly investigate the bureau's involvement in the Russia drama.Should the first charges be focused away from the President, such as regarding business dealings unrelated to Trump, he could also use the moment to declare victory and say it's time to wrap up an investigation that couldn't find any collusion between Russia and the presidential campaign.JUST WATCHED Pheasant hunting with Donald Trump's sons (2016) Replay More Videos ...

Exclusive: First charges filed in Mueller investigation:::::Washington (CNN) A federal grand jury in Washington on Friday approved the first charges in the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller, according to sources briefed on the matter.The charges are still sealed under orders from a federal judge.Plans were prepared Friday for anyone charged to be taken into custody as soon as Monday, the sources said.It is unclear what the charges are.A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment.The White House also had no comment, a senior administration official said Saturday morning.Mueller was appointed in May to lead the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.Under the regulations governing special counsel investigations, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has oversight over the Russia investigation, would have been made aware of any charges before they were taken before the grand jury for approval, according to people familiar with the matter.Read More

Poll: 71% of Americans say politics has reached a dangerous low point:::::Story highlights Some 70% of those polled said divisions today are at least as big as during the Vietnam War era Fifty-one percent said President Donald Trump deserves "a lot" of the blame for the dysfunction Forty-nine percent place "a lot" of blame on news media for causing the dysfunction Washington (CNN) Amid a growing partisan gap between Democrats and Republicans, a new poll shows that 71% of Americans believe the country's politics have reached a dangerous low point in the Trump era.According to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released Saturday, only 29% said they believed this period in American politics is "similar to most periods of disagreement."And the majority of participants who said politics have reached a dangerous low point said the climate is a "new normal," not "temporary."Some 70% of those polled from September 27 through October 5 said divisions today are at least as big as they were during the Vietnam War era.For individuals polled who were adults during the Vietnam War, the percentage was higher than the average -- 77%.A majority of those polled, 51%, said President Donald Trump deserves "a lot" of the blame for the dysfunction in the American political system, below the share placing as much blame on money in politics (65%), wealthy donors (56%) or people with extreme views (56%), but above the share putting a lot of blame on either party (38% for Republicans, 32% for Democrats) or members of Congress (47%).In addition, 49% place "a lot" of blame on the news media for causing the dysfunction, and the same percentage say social media bears much of the responsibility.Read More
Collins: Top Democrats need to come back before intelligence committee:::::Story highlights Sen. Susan Collins said Clinton lawyer Marc Elias should be recalled to the Senate intelligence committee Collins said John Podesta and Debbie Wasserman Schultz should be recalled as well Washington (CNN) Sen. Susan Collins said Sunday that the Senate intelligence committee should bring senior Democratic Party operatives back for testimony after revelations about the party paying intelligence firm Fusion GPS for opposition research on Donald Trump last year.Some of that research became the now-infamous dossier of allegations about the now-President and Russia.In closed-door meetings with congressional Russia investigators in recent weeks, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz denied knowing who funded Fusion's opposition research, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN last week "They absolutely need to be recalled," the Maine Republican said on CBS's "Face the Nation.""It's difficult to imagine that a campaign chairman, that the head of the DNC would not know of an expenditure of this magnitude and significance, but perhaps there's something more going on here."A source familiar with the matter told CNN on Tuesday that the law firm Perkins Coie, as part of its representation of the Clinton campaign and the DNC, retained Fusion GPS and entered "into an engagement for research services that began in April 2016 and concluded before the election in early November."Read More

Church to relocate plaques of Lee and Washington:::::(CNN) In response to violent protests over the fate of a Confederate statue in Charlottesville, Virginia earlier this year, a 244-year-old Episcopal church in Alexandria is planning to move a set of plaques honoring former parishioners Robert E. Lee and George Washington.The plaques were hung on either side of the altar inside the church in 1870, shortly after Lee's death.There had been discussions about relocating the plaques in the past, for reasons that include their lack of religious purpose."After the events in Charlottesville, those conversations came more to the forefront, they became more intense," said Noelle York-Simmons, the Rector of Christ Church, a small colonial parish that was founded in 1773."It became clear to the Vestry -- the governing body of the Church -- that we needed to take these conversations more seriously."Because the plaques were installed as a pair, they're being removed as a pair as well.Emily Bryan, Senior Warden of Christ Church, spoke to congregants about the decision to remove and relocate the plaques.In a copy of her speech obtained by CNN, Bryan told parishioners that "the plaques in our sanctuary make some in our presence feel unsafe or unwelcome" but Bryan also added that the plaques "will stay very prominently be displayed, in a place that will better tell our history."Read More
Maryland investigating Kushner Companies over apartments:::::The Maryland attorney general is investigating one of the Kushner family's real estate businesses after media reports surfaced earlier this year about allegedly abusive debt collection practices and poor conditions at several of its properties.Kushner Companies said it is cooperating with Attorney General Brian Frosh, Maryland's top legal officer."We have been working with the Maryland Attorney General's Office to provide information in response to its request," Kushner Companies told CNN through a spokesperson."We are in compliance with all state and local laws."A Baltimore-based attorney is working with Kushner Companies on the matter, according to a person familiar with the attorney general's inquiry.A spokesperson for the AG's office declined to comment, citing a policy of not confirming or denying investigations.The inquiry does not mean charges will be filed.This spring and summer, media reports exposed allegedly coercive tactics and inadequate maintenance in multifamily housing developments run by Westminster Management or related entities.An affiliate of Kushner Companies, Westminster manages about 17 properties in Maryland, including developments in Baltimore, Middle River and Essex, according to its website.Kushner Companies has been under the microscope since President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, entered the political scene first as Trump's confidant during the 2016 campaign and now as a senior White House adviser.A Kushner financial disclosure form shows income of $1.6 million from Westminster.A White House spokesman declined to comment.Kushner, married to Trump's daughter Ivanka, stepped down as CEO of his family's namesake business in January and recused himself from certain policy issues since joining the White House.But those measures haven't fully shielded the company from allegations of conflicts of interest and criticism from political foes of the administration as well as more scrutiny from the press.In May, The New York Times and ProPublica detailed "poor upkeep" inside developments run by Westminster, including appliance failures, mold and mouse infestations.The report also documented unsavory debt collection tactics.In addition, The Baltimore Sun reported that Kushner-affiliated businesses were "the most aggressive in Maryland" in seeking civil arrests of tenants who owed the company money.Kushner Companies defended its methods.Responding to the Sun, the company's chief financial officer said the firm "follows guidelines consistent with industry standards" and state law when it files legal action.Westminster Management, "only takes legal action against a tenant when absolutely necessary," said Kushner Companies' CFO Jennifer McLean in a statement to the Sun.Related: Jared Kushner's White House role complicates family business In August, Democratic lawmakers cited the stories in a letter to Kushner Companies, requesting answers to questions on matters including alleged housing code violations and federal subsidies from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.They were seeking a response by September 8."If these reports are accurate, they raise very serious and troubling concerns about whether Kushner Companies and its subsidiaries are complying with HUD's housing quality standards to ensure the safety and health of their own tenants," wrote the lawmakers, who included Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee.In response, Kushner Companies issued a public statement reiterating that the company exercises its "legal rights under the relevant provisions of the Maryland law."But Kushner Companies did not provide specific answers or produce documents, according to Cummings, who wrote a letter last week asking oversight committee chairman, Republican Trey Gowdy, for help.In the letter to Gowdy, Cummings said his staff called Kushner Companies six times and were told "no information would be provided."In a separate matter, Frosh and the attorney general of the District of Columbia are suing Trump, alleging that his business interests violate the Constitution.The attorneys general are asking a court to block Trump from accepting foreign money.
Puerto Rico's power authority is working to cancel Whitefish contract:::::Puerto Rico's power authority is working to cancel a controversial contract it awarded to a small Montana-based utility company.Ricardo Ramos, the CEO of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, says he is "asking for a resolution" that would allow for the cancellation of the contract with Whitefish Energy.The $300 million deal with the two-year-old company has drawn widespread scrutiny.Whitefish, which was tasked with helping to restore power to parts of hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, had few employees before Hurricane Maria hit.Ramos said during a Sunday press conference that the contract is "not canceled as of yet," adding that it requires 30 days of prior notice.He said he will need to talk to the firm."The plan is not to demobilize them either, we will let them finish what they have started," Ramos said.Whitefish said in a separate statement that it's "disappointed" in the decision to terminate their agreement."The decision will only delay what the people of Puerto Rico want and deserve -- to have the power restored quickly in the same manner their fellow citizens on the mainland experience after a natural disaster," the statement reads."We only wish the best for the great people of Puerto Rico."The contract with PREPA marked the largest contract to be awarded since recovery efforts began more than a month ago.Whitefish is also based in the small hometown of U.S.Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, which has raised questions.Zinke has said he had nothing to do with the contract.A White House spokesman told CNN the decision to give the contract to Whitefish was made exclusively by PREPA.Related: How Whitefish landed Puerto Rico's $300 million power contract "The White House is not aware of any federal involvement in the selection," White House spokesman Raj Shah said.Whitefish did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday.The decision to cancel the deal Sunday came hours after Puerto Rico Gov.Ricardo Rossell publicly called on PREPA to do so.He said questions raised around the contract are "interfering with everything" and the distractions are not helping Puerto Rico rebuild.To help ensure transparency going forward, Rossell said that he will appoint a finance official to PREPA who will oversee the contracting process.He also asked Puerto Rico's Office of the Comptroller to conduct a review of how the emergency contract was awarded.In the meantime, Rossell said his team is working with the governors of Florida and New York to bring energy workers from those states to help Puerto Rico as quickly as possible.The controversy surrounding the Whitefish contract has spurred a probe by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general, who will also be looking at how the firm was selected.Related: Puerto Rico sees an opportunity to reimagine the island Last week, Rossell indicated he would be willing to move forward with the Whitefish contract if there was no evidence of misconduct.He also asked the inspector general to complete the review by Monday."If there is no wrongdoing, if it has been done correctly then we will push forward," Rossell told CNN at the time."If there is wrongdoing in this process or any process there will be hell to pay."Puerto Rico's already frail power infrastructure was all but destroyed after Maria tore through the island.As of Sunday, only about 30% of Puerto Rico's power generators were back online, according to PREPA data.Whitefish workers first arrived on the island on October 2.The company said Sunday that the contract "only sped up the repairs, and if it were not for that action, crews would just now be getting to the island to begin the process of rebuilding the system and restoring power."According to the firm, its efforts have restored power hospitals, businesses and residents of the north-central town of Manat, Puerto Rico.It's currently working to bring power to another 500,000 people in San Juan."We will certainly finish any work that PREPA wants us to complete and stand by our commitments," the company said.--CNN's Donna Borak, Rene Marsh and Greg Wallace contributed to this report.
Twitter suspends account of Trump ally Stone:::::Washington (CNN) Twitter suspended the account of President Donald Trump's longtime associate Roger Stone this weekend following a series of derogatory and threatening tweets from Stone to CNN personalities.Following a report from CNN that a grand jury approved the first charges in former FBI Director Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation, Stone sent irate messages to CNN anchor Don Lemon and contributor Ana Navarro, among others.After the tweets, Stone's account was suspended.He said on Facebook that he was told he was under temporary suspension, but had learned from press accounts that Twitter is banning him permanently.Twitter declined to comment on "individual accounts."The company's policy states suspension can occur in response to threats or harassment.Stone has known Trump for decades and is a reliable supporter of his political movement.He has also frequently used his platform to go after reporters and those critical of him and the President, Friday's insults being the latest example.For his part, Stone seemed to relish the attention the suspension got, writing , "I guess you have really arrived when your brief suspension on Twitter is national news."Stone's suspension comes more than a year after another high-profile Trump supporter, Milo Yiannopoulos, was banned from Twitter.Yiannopoulos was seen as an instigator of disparaging tweets directed at comedian Leslie Jones.Yiannopoulos, a self-described provocateur, is known for making offensive statements and railing against "political correctness."Twitter has grappled with how to police its platform for years.Like other social media sites, its critics say, the company has struggled to strike the right balance between allowing free speech and tamping down harassment and hate speech.Earlier this month, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey laid out new measures aimed at preventing the latter.The new policies came after an outcry over the brief suspension of actress Rose McGowan's account.Twitter says she was temporarily booted from the platform for violating policies against publishing private phone numbers.But the suspension came as McGowan was a leading voice among women speaking out against Harvey Weinstein , the disgraced movie mogul whom McGowan accused of rape.Weinstein denies any accusations of sexual assault.Many Twitter users decried the decision to suspend McGowan and sparked the widely used hashtag #WomenBoycottTwitter.

Angus King: No basis for Trump's claim that it's agreed campaign didn't collude with Russia:::::Story highlights King said it's certainly not commonly agreed upon in the Senate intelligence committee Trump took to Twitter on Sunday morning Washington (CNN) Despite President Donald Trump's claim that it is "commonly agreed" that his campaign did not collude with Russia during last year's election, Senate intelligence committee member Angus King said there's still plenty of investigating left to do."No, I don't think so," the Maine independent said when asked on CNN's "State of the Union" whether Trump's claim was correct."It's certainly not commonly agreed in our committee, and we're the ones doing the investigation," he said, referring to his panel's investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 election."I don't think there's any basis for that statement.It's entirely possible that we may end up in the investigation at the end that there wasn't, but the contrary could also be true."On Friday, Trump tweeted, "It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump.Was collusion with HC!"It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump.Was collusion with HC!Donald J.

White House economist and former Treasury Secretary spar over Trump tax plan:::::A high-profile economist and President Trump's chief economic adviser presented starkly different views on the president's tax reform proposal.Speaking on CNN's "GPS" with Fareed Zakaria on Sunday, Trump adviser Kevin Hassett defended his claims that lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% would lead to a $4,000 annual pay raise for the average American household.Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, also appearing on "GPS," called Hassett's claims "fake facts."He alleged Hassett cobbled together a "political brief" rather than an objective economic analysis.Hassett -- who floated the $4,000 figure in two reports put out earlier this month -- fired back.He accused Summers of lobbing personal attacks and insisted other reputable economists have backed up his analysis.Here's a breakdown of the issue.Hassett says lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate, which is among the highest in the world, will encourage U.S. companies to invest more of their money in their U.S. operations rather than investing it abroad.As companies buy more machines and other technology for use domestically, productivity will rise.That, in turn, can boost wages, Hassett argues.Reality check: Will Trump's tax plan really give you a $4,000 pay raise?Summers, like many economists on both sides of the aisle, agree corporate tax reform will have "some positive impacts."But Summers -- a Democrat who served as President Bill Clinton's Treasury Secretary and as an economic adviser for President Barack Obama -- says Trump's plan is poorly designed and could harm the middle class."The claims that this administration makes -- that the tax cut will pay for itself, that the tax cut will raise incomes [...] that the tax cut isn't skewed toward helping rich people -- those are fake facts, and I think they need to be called out," Summers said.For one thing, he said, if and when companies do bring earnings back from overseas, it's not clear how they'll use that extra money."Maybe the corporations will just keep the money and pay it out in the form of higher dividends or doing more repurchases of shares," Summers said.Related: Republican tax plan faces big hurdles ahead of 2018 Summers' own analysis suggests Trump's tax plan could boost income by around $1,300 per year -- not $4,000.He also said Hassett's analysis of the tax plan "was egregiously selective in the use of evidence."Hassett said it was Summers that used faulty math.He said a review of other countries around the globe found that when they cut corporate taxes, wages went up."They don't always do it, but they tend to go up," Hassett said.He also pointed to an analysis by Boston University economist Larry Kotlikoff, which estimated the Trump tax framework as a whole might raise household incomes by $3,500.--CNNMoney's Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report.
Christie: Mueller's targets should be concerned:::::Story highlights Christie said he saw no reason for Mueller to step down Trump later Sunday morning again denounced the questions about alleged collusion with Russia Washington (CNN) The news that a federal grand jury has approved charges in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe should concern those under investigation, New Jersey Republican Gov.Chris Christie said Sunday."I think anybody who's been advised by the special counsel's office that they're a target of the investigation -- which I'm sure he has done to those people who are -- should be concerned," Christie said in interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union."CNN reported Friday that a federal grand jury approved the first charges from Mueller's investigation and that anyone charged could be taken into custody as soon as Monday.Christie, a former US attorney, said leaks to the news media about the grand jury's actions could undermine the credibility of the process, which he said needed to remain confidential.While some in his own party, including Christie himself, have suggested that Mueller should resign from the Russia investigation if he has any conflicts of interest, the New Jersey governor said Sunday that he saw no reason at this point for Mueller to do so.Read More
Watergate and White House interference at DOJ:::::(CNN) A few years after President Richard Nixon resigned, Attorney General Griffin Bell gathered Justice Department lawyers in the department's elaborate Great Hall to address their independence in the post-Watergate world."The partisan activities of some attorneys general ... combined with the unfortunate legacy of Watergate, have given rise to the understandable public concern that some decisions at Justice may be the products of favor, or pressure, or politics," he said in the September 6, 1978 address Resulting Justice Department rules limited White House involvement with law enforcement decisions.The reforms emerged from Nixon's use of the department to conceal his administration's involvement in the break-in at the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate building.Those decades-old reforms were invoked again on Friday, after news that President Donald Trump personally intervened to try to lift a gag order on an undercover FBI informant sought by Republican members of Congress in an investigation of Russian nuclear industry efforts to gain influence in the United States during the Obama administration.It was only the latest chapter in ongoing controversy over White House intervention at DOJ since Trump took office.He has routinely injected himself in politically charged law enforcement matters, including those related to the probe of the Russian government's influence in the 2016 presidential election and potential ties to his campaign.Speaking on CNN's "New Day" Friday, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, deemed the recent disclosure part of a pattern of intervention and "politicization," which included the May firing of FBI Director James Comey, who was overseeing the investigation into Russia's election interference."There were rules in the wake of ... the Nixon improprieties that presidents would not interfere or intervene in ongoing investigations," Blumenthal said."Those norms seem to be violated."Former Sen. Rick Santorum, a Pennsylvania Republican, countered on CNN's "Newsroom," "Donald Trump has every right as President of the United States to advise the Justice Department as to his opinion on these things.I don't have a problem with this at all.It's about providing more information, not less.And I think that's a good thing."Separately on Friday, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told "New Day," "He believes, as many others do, frankly, that the FBI informant should be free to say what he knows."CNN reported Thursday that Trump told his staff to work with the Justice Department to allow a former undercover FBI informant to testify.Republicans on Capitol Hill are investigating the circumstances surrounding the sale of a uranium mining company to Russia's Atomic Energy Agency, Rosatom.The deal was approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a panel composed of representatives from several US government agencies, including the State Department, which at the time was led by Hillary Clinton.A source familiar with the matter told CNN that the DOJ move to allow the informant to speak to members of Congress was made independent of any communications from Trump.Trump's constant interactions with the Justice Department, FBI and US attorneys -- against the backdrop of special prosecutor Robert Mueller's Russia investigation -- cannot help but recall the Watergate era.Nixon Attorney General John Mitchell was convicted and served time in prison for his role in the scandal.Bell, in his 1978 speech, said he worked for almost two years to develop rules to make DOJ "a neutral zone," with the foundation being that the White House should steer clear of law enforcement decisions and the daily operations of the career staff involved in investigations and prosecutions.Bell, who served in the Jimmy Carter administration and died in 2009, noted that under the Constitution, the attorney general is responsible to the president and the president to the public.So, he said, "true institutional independence is therefore impossible."But he emphasized, "the president is best served if the attorney general and the lawyers who assist him are free to exercise their professional judgments."To be sure, not all interactions between the attorney general and president since then have been true to that principle.But at least it has been the ideal."What must be avoided, in fact and in appearance," Bell said, "is pressure from any source that is intended to influence our legal judgment."As he began his address nearly four decades ago, Bell told the audience he was using a prepared text, "because it's an important subject, something that I hope will be left here for years to come."
House GOP concedes on property tax deduction:::::The House hasn't even released its tax reform bill yet, and Republican lawmakers are already making a big concession over one of their most controversial proposals.Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has decided to only partially repeal the state and local tax deduction, bending to concerns of colleagues from high-tax states."At the urging of lawmakers we are restoring an itemized property tax deduction to help taxpayers with local tax burdens," Brady said in a statement this weekend.The news was first reported by Bloomberg.Today, anyone who itemizes their deductions on their federal tax return may deduct their state and local property taxes, as well as their state and local income taxes or general sales taxes.In their bid to pay for the trillions in tax cuts they want, as well as simplify the tax code, Republican leaders have proposed repealing most itemized deductions.The state and local tax deduction -- aka SALT -- is the biggest among them.Repealing it fully could bring in more than $1 trillion in revenue over a decade.Brady's concession on property taxes may help some of the moderate-income people who benefit from the deduction today.The majority of the SALT deductions claimed by those who make less than $50,000 come from property taxes, according to a report from the Government Finance Officers Association.By contrast more than 70% of the SALT deductions from those making more than $200,000 are due to income.Related: Millions in middle class will feel it if GOP kills this tax break But it's not clear from Brady's statement if there would be any limits on who may take the property tax deduction.For instance, if it's available only to people who itemize, then chances are many wouldn't take it.That's because his bill would nearly double the standard deduction.And that would drastically reduce the number of itemizers, since you only itemize if your deductions combined exceed your standard deduction.Impossible to satisfy all demands Brady's decision, just a few days before he's due to unveil the House tax reform bill, speaks volumes about the political and policy challenges ahead for lawmakers: how to meet the Republican goals, while garnering enough support to pass a bill.A group lobbying to keep all of the state and local deduction intact was quick to call foul at Brady's concession, noting that his home state of Texas has no income tax and is heavily dependent on property taxes for revenue."[His] partial elimination plan for the state and local tax (SALT) deduction would insert the heavy hand of Washington into state and local finance decisions, dictate winners and losers among states, and unfairly penalize taxpayers in states that rely significantly on income taxes," Americans Against Double Taxation said in a statement.Leonard Lance, a New Jersey Republican congressman who has been a lead negotiator in the SALT debate, called the announcement a "step in the right direction" but argued there's more work to be done."I will need to see legislative text to determine if this proposal is in the best interest of New Jersey," Lance said in a statement."We already send more than enough money to Washington."Related: Is now really the time for massive tax cuts?Separately this weekend, the National Association of Home Builders made clear it wouldn't support the GOP tax plan as is because it doesn't do enough to support homeownership."This plan is particularly disappointing, given that the nation's home builders warned that the proposal would severely diminish the effectiveness of the mortgage interest deduction and presented alternative policies that would retain an effective housing tax incentive in the tax code," the NAHB said in a statement.The group said it believed it had a deal with lawmakers to include a homeownership tax credit that could be taken by anyone -- even if they don't itemize.But "we were told by the House leadership that the credit will be removed from the bill."But the House bill -- which is supposed to be released Wednesday -- is just the first word, not the last, on any tax legislation.As the negotiations begin over tax reform, first in the House and then the Senate, there's no telling yet where things end up.Brady said in his statement he hopes members of Congress will further examine the NAHB proposed credit "before tax reform heads to the president's desk."CNN's Kevin Bohn, Lauren Fox and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.
Fusion GPS, House intel panel reach agreement on subpoena:::::(CNN) Fusion GPS, the research firm behind the dossier containing allegations about President Donald Trump and Russia, its bank and the House intelligence committee have reached an agreement over the panel's subpoena of Fusion's financial records.The agreement comes amid revelations that Perkins Coie -- the law firm representing Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee -- and the conservative Washington Free Beacon separately paid the firm to conduct research on Trump.In a statement Saturday, the House intelligence committee said the agreement "will secure the committee's access to the records necessary for its investigation," while a lawyer for Fusion GPS said "it helped the company honor its legal obligations and protect its First Amendment rights."Fusion GPS asked the US District Court for the District of Columbia earlier this month to stop its bank from turning over financial records subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee as part of its investigation into Russia's attempts to influence last year's election, including allegations in the dossier of collusion by Trump's presidential campaign.The firm argued in its court filing that the release of the financial records would reveal the names of its clients and therefore violate its and their First Amendment rights to free speech and free association.It also claimed the subpoena, authorized by intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes, a California Republican, was too broad.
Trump. Cambridge Analytica. WikiLeaks. The connections, explained.:::::Washington (CNN) There is a web of connections between the Trump campaign, the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks and the public disclosures it injected into the presidential campaign.Federal investigators are examining some of these relationships and whether any of them were part of an effort to coordinate with Russia's election-meddling campaign.This week, a new thread emerged: Multiple sources confirmed to CNN that the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, contacted WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in summer 2016 to ask for access to emails from Hillary Clinton's private server.Sources told CNN that he asked for the emails because he wanted to catalog them on a searchable database that would be made available to the Trump campaign or a pro-Trump PAC.There is no evidence WikiLeaks ever hacked or possessed the emails sought by Nix.But the contact alone raises new questions about Cambridge Analytica's potential role in Russia's efforts to undermine Clinton's campaign.It's a messy situation and, with so many unanswered questions, such as what Cambridge Analytica knew about Wikileaks' Russia connection when it sought Clinton's missing emails.Still, it's important to consider the broader context.The timeline below tracks how things unfolded, based on all we know.March 10, 2015 -- Clinton acknowledges using private email server Soon-to-be Democratic presidential candidate Clinton publicly acknowledged for the first time that she used a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state.She also said she deleted about 30,000 emails about personal matters unrelated to her work for the Obama administration.The deleted emails, which have never seen the light of day, later became a flashpoint of the campaign.June 16, 2015 -- Trump launches presidential campaign Trump announced that he is running for president , ending months of rampant speculation."I am officially running for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again," he told a crowd at Trump Tower.When he declared his candidacy, Trump was in the middle of the GOP pack, trailing in polls to former Florida Gov.Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio and others.July 2015 -- Russian hackers breach DNC systems Hackers working for Russian intelligence services "gained access to" the Democratic National Committee's computer networks as part of the Kremlin's campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential race, according to the US intelligence community assessment that was published after the election.March 2016 -- Another group of Russian hackers breach DNC systems Another group of Russian hackers -- separate from the group that hacked the DNC in 2015 -- breached the DNC's computer systems, according to a US intelligence report published after the election.The US intelligence community says Russian intelligence related stolen materials from the DNC to WikiLeaks for public release.CNN reported this year that Russia gave WikiLeaks the emails through an intermediary.March 19, 2016 -- Russian hackers gain access to Podesta's emails Russian hackers gained access to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's personal Gmail account by sending a phishing email.The US intelligence community determined in early 2017 that Russian intelligence later gave WikiLeaks hacked emails from Democratic "political figures," an oblique reference to Podesta.CNN reported this year that Russia gave WikiLeaks the emails through an intermediary.May 3, 2016 -- Trump becomes presumptive Republican nominee After Trump's victory in the Indiana primary , his main remaining rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, suspended his campaign.By bowing out, Cruz cemented Trump's position as the presumptive GOP nominee.June 2016 -- Mercer family endorses Trump The Mercer family, led by Republican megadonor Robert Mercer, begins supporting Trump's candidacy and starts donating to pro-Trump efforts.The family previously backed Cruz in the GOP primaries.The family financially backs Cambridge Analytica, which started working for Trump over the summer of 2016.Some members of Cambridge Analytica staff were incorporated in the Trump campaign's data operation team.June 9, 2016 -- Trump tweets about Clinton's deleted emails Responding to a quip from Clinton, Trump posted on Twitter : "How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up--and where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted?"This tweet came the same day that Donald Trump Jr., Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met a group of Russians at Trump Tower.Trump Jr. was told before the meeting that one of the Russians would offer incriminating information about Clinton.June 15, 2016 -- DNC claims it was hacked by Russian intelligence The DNC and CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm it hired to investigate the breaches, revealed publicly for the first time that its servers were penetrated.CrowdStrike said it "identified two sophisticated adversaries on the network" that were associated with Russian intelligence services.Trump dismissed the notion that Russia was behind the hacks, saying "we believe it was the DNC that did the 'hacking' as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader.Too bad the DNC doesn't hack Hillary Clinton's 33,000 missing emails."July 19-21, 2016 -- Republican National Convention is held in Cleveland Trump officially became the presidential nominee for the Republican Party during the Republican National Convention, which was held in Cleveland.During the convention, a handful of Trump campaign advisers briefly met with then-Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.Between July 21 and July 31, 2016 -- Cambridge Analytica CEO emails WikiLeaks Alexander Nix, the chief executive of data firm Cambridge Analytica, emailed Assange seeking access to emails from Clinton's private server so he could turn them into a searchable database for the campaign or a pro-Trump political action committee.There is no evidence that Clinton's deleted emails were ever hacked or that WikiLeaks ever had possession of them.The Wall Street Journal reported that the email was sent in late July 2016 at some point following the Republican National Convention.This was around the same time Cambridge Analytica started working for the Trump campaign as part of its three-pronged data operation based in San Antonio, Texas.Right-wing firebrand Steve Bannon was a member of the Cambridge Analytica board when Nix sent the email, according to The New York Times.Bannon later became CEO of the Trump campaign and stepped down from the data analytics company.He took a top White House job in January but left over the summer.July 22, 2016 -- WikiLeaks releases about 20,000 hacked DNC emails WikiLeaks posted on its website nearly 20,000 emails that were stolen from the DNC servers.Many of the emails were sent by senior DNC officials.Some of the emails suggested that the DNC favored Clinton over Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primaries, leading to allegations that the primary was rigged.July 25-28, 2016 -- Democratic National Convention is held in Philadelphia Democrats held their convention in Philadelphia and formally selected Clinton as their nominee.The gathering was roiled by the WikiLeaks disclosures, which were released days earlier.The emails upset Sanders supporters, and forced DNC chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wassermann Schultz to quit her post July 25, 2016 -- Trump says it's a "joke" that Russia hacked the DNC Trump weighed in on the DNC leaks, saying on Twitter : "The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me."July 26, 2016 -- NYT reports that the US believes Russia hacked the DNC The New York Times published a report that claimed US intelligence agencies told the White House that they were highly confident that the Russian government was responsible for hacking the DNC.This was the first public report suggesting that the US government agreed with the DNC's assessment.July 27, 2016 -- Trump publicly asks Russia to hack Clinton's deleted emails At a news conference , Trump publicly called on the Russian government to hack Clinton's private email server and reveal the deleted emails.Trump's campaign later said his comment was a joke."if it is Russia -- which it's probably not, nobody knows who it is -- but if it is Russia, it's really bad for a different reason, because it shows how little respect they have for our country, when they would hack into a major party and get everything," Trump said."But it would be interesting to see -- I will tell you this -- Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.Let's see if that happens.That'll be next."July 29, 2016 -- Trump campaign pays $100,000 to Cambridge Analytica The Trump campaign made its first of five payments to Cambridge Analytica, cutting a check for $100,000, according to records from the Federal Election Commission.August 8, 2016 -- Roger Stone says he was in touch with Assange During a speech in Florida , former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone claimed to be in touch with Assange and predicted upcoming WikiLeaks releases: "I actually have communicated with Assange.I believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation but there's no telling what the October surprise may be."He later clarified that while he was in contact with Assange, it came through an intermediary.August 14-17, 2016 -- Stone exchanges messages with Russian hackers Stone exchanged direct Twitter messages with Guccifer 2.0, a self-proclaimed hacker who published stolen materials from the DNC earlier in the summer.(These DNC releases were separate from the DNC emails published by WikiLeaks.)The Twitter messages were about the contents of some of the stolen DNC materials that Guccifer posted online earlier that summer.Stone denies any wrongdoing or collusion.Months after these Twitter messages, the US intelligence community announced that Guccifer 2.0 was actually run by Russian intelligence operatives as part of the Kremlin's effort to meddle in the election.August 18, 2016 -- Trump campaign pays $250,000 to Cambridge Analytica The Trump campaign made its second of five payments to Cambridge Analytica, cutting a check for $250,000, according to records from the Federal Election Commission.August 21, 2016 -- Stone predicts upcoming trouble for Podesta Without specifically referencing emails, Stone predicts that Podesta will soon be in hot water."Trust me, it will soon the Podesta's time in the barrel," he tweeted .Stone later claimed that he wasn't talking about the upcoming WikiLeaks releases but was alluding to an expose he was planning on his own.September 1, 2016 -- Trump campaign pays $5 million to Cambridge Analytica The Trump campaign made its second of five payments to Cambridge Analytica, cutting a check for $5 million, according to records from the Federal Election Commission.The massive payment -- the largest from the campaign to the

questioned the recent US intelligence statement that the Russian government was interfering in the 2016 election."I think it's probably unlikely," Trump said."I think maybe the Democrats are putting that out, who knows?But I think that it's pretty unlikely."King's show is broadcast on RT, the Kremlin-controlled news network that targets English-speaking audiences.The US intelligence community says the Kremlin promoted its election-meddling campaign on RT.The Trump campaign said it didn't know King's show was broadcast on the Russian network.September 9, 2016 -- Stone exchanges more messages with Russian hackers Stone exchanged direct Twitter messages with Guccifer 2.0.The emails were about the contents of some publicly released DNC materials.Stone denies wrongdoing or collusion.Months after these Twitter messages, the US intelligence community announced that Guccifer 2.0 was actually run by Russian intelligence operatives as part of the Kremlin's effort to meddle in the election.September 16, 2016 -- Stone predicts WikiLeaks will release Clinton emails Stone says in a radio interview that WikiLeaks will release new Clinton emails."I expect Julian Assange and the WikiLeaks people to drop a payload of new documents on Hillary on a weekly basis fairly soon.And that, of course, will answer the question of exactly what was erased on that email server."October 2, 2016 -- Stone alludes to future WikiLeaks releases Stone appeared to predict that WikiLeaks would soon post damaging materials about Clinton.He posted : "Wednesday @HillaryClinton is done.#WikiLeaks."Nothing materialized on the date Stone referred to, but two days after that date, WikiLeaks started releasing Podesta's emails.October 3, 2016 -- Stone again predicts upcoming WikiLeaks releases "I have total confidence that @wikileaks and my hero Julian Assange will educate the American people soon," Stone tweeted , four days before WikiLeaks began releasing Podesta's emails.October 5, 2016 -- Stone says "payload coming" from WikiLeaks "Libs thinking Assange will stand down are wishful thinking.Payload coming," Stone tweeted , two days before WikiLeaks began releasing thousands of emailed hacked from Podesta's email account.October 7, 2016 -- US formally blames Russia for DNC hacks The US government broke its silence about the DNC hack.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the entire US intelligence community, announced that the Russian government was behind the hacked emails released by WikiLeaks."The US Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations," the statement said, adding that disclosures on WikiLeaks were consistent with Russian methods.October 7, 2016 -- WikiLeaks begins releasing Podesta emails Shortly after the announcement blaming Russia for the DNC hacks, WikiLeaks began posting thousands of emails stolen from Podesta's Gmail account.WikiLeaks went on to release new Podesta emails on a near-daily basis, creating waves of negative headlines for the Clinton campaign in the closing weeks of the election.Trump regularly cited the latest Podesta releases during campaign rallies in October and November.The US government later said Russia was responsible for the hacks.October 10, 2016 -- Trump says "I love WikiLeaks" At a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump expressed his admiration for the anti-secrecy website that was publishing dirt on his Democratic opponent, saying "This just came out.WikiLeaks!I love WikiLeaks."October 12, 2016 -- Stone says he has back-channel communications with Assange Stone further elaborated on his relationship with Assange in an interview with a local CBS station in Miami."I do have a back-channel communication with Assange, because we have a good mutual friend," Stone said."That friend travels back and

Conway confirms Trump wanted FBI informant's gag order lifted:::::Washington (CNN) In response to reporting that President Donald Trump personally pressed for an informant's gag order to be lifted, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said Friday that he wanted the informant to be free to speak out."He believes, as many others do, frankly, that the FBI informant should be free to say what he knows," Conway said on CNN's "New Day."CNN reported Thursday that Trump told his staff to work with the Justice Department to allow an undercover FBI informant who played a critical role in an FBI investigation into Russian efforts to gain influence in the uranium industry in the United States during the Obama administration to be free to speak with Congress.Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has called for the Justice Department to do the same.Conway, in the interview, pointed to Grassley's request."That's the proper channel here," Conway said.In an interview on Fox News, Attorney General Jeff Sessions repeatedly said he hadn't discussed the matter with the President."What I would say is that Senator Grassley has been direct with us for some time," Sessions said."We worked with Senator Grassley and are very happy to be able to approve his testimony before the Senate judiciary."White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said she was not aware of any specific involvement by the President, when asked by CNN's Jim Acosta about it Friday at a daily news briefing."The President has pushed for transparency, if that's what you are referring to, when dealing with Congress," Sanders said."I know that's probably something new, for a president to actually push for transparency," she said."But that's what he's done, and that was the purpose what he was trying to do in that process."The Justice Department has strict rules limiting the White House's involvement in criminal law enforcement matters.Any involvement by the White House counsel in the decision is unusual, particularly because it relates to the President's political opponents.Conway, however, defended Trump's interest in the politically charged case: "It's not unusual for a President to weigh in."Republicans want to know the circumstances surrounding the sale of a uranium mining company to Russia's Atomic Energy Agency, Rosatom, which was approved by the Obama administration in 2010.The deal had to be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a panel that is composed of representatives from several US government agencies, including the State Department, which at the time was led by Hillary Clinton.Conway went on to hit Clinton and the Democratic Party for helping fund a dossier of allegations about Trump and Russia, which she said was an improper attempt to use foreign intelligence to hit Trump."Now, we are faced with the possibility -- and it looks like the very real probability -- the DNC and the Clinton campaign paid a foreign agent for information to try to smear Donald Trump," Conway said.Conway slammed the Democrats for contributing funding to opposition research obtained from a foreign source, though the Trump campaign -- prior to Conway's involvement -- met with a Russian lawyer in an attempt to glean potentially damaging information on Clinton, according to Donald Trump Jr.'s own account.Likewise, CNN reported the head of a data analytics company linked to the Trump campaign contacted WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange about emails from Clinton's private server.Conway denied any firsthand knowledge of the effort."I only know what I read in the press on this, which is that he made that entreaty and Julian Assange says that he rejected it, never happened, and the Trump campaign has since spoken on this," Conway said.She went on to say the Trump campaign, which she helped lead through the end of the general election, "beat Hillary Clinton fairly and squarely.""I know nothing about that because I was the campaign manager, and I can't be bothered with any of that," Conway said of the Cambridge Analytica outreach to WikiLeaks."The campaign was not doing that."
White House reiterates Trump's claims that his sexual harassment accusers lied:::::Story highlights White House press secretary Sarah Sanders offered a very short answer Friday "We've been clear on that in the beginning, and the President's spoken on that," she said Washington (CNN) The White House stood by President Donald Trump's previous comments when asked Friday whether the more than a dozen women who have accused him of sexual assault were liars.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders offered a very short answer when asked if the White House thought the women were liars."We've been clear on that in the beginning, and the President's spoken on that," she said.The question came amid revelations in the media and entertainment industries and the realm of politics of stories of women coming forward to share encounters of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace.On the campaign trail, then-candidate Trump dismissed the accusations from the more than a dozen women.Read More
After long delay, State Department advances Russia sanctions:::::Story highlights The State Department had come under sharp criticism for missing the October 1 deadline Washington (CNN) The State Department, facing bipartisan scrutiny from Congress, issued long overdue guidance on which Russian individuals and entities will be subject to sanctions under recently passed legislation -- 25 days after it was due.The notice, required by the law, was due Oct. 1 and is meant to put potential stakeholders -- including US companies -- on alert in advance of the implementation in January.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sent the list to Congress Thursday, State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.The State Department had come under sharp criticism from lawmakers from both parties who questioned why the Trump administration had missed the deadline and whether the delay reflected reluctance from the White House to further sanction Moscow."Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has authorized the department to issue guidance to the public specifying the persons or entities that are part of or operating on behalf of the defense or intelligence sectors of the government of the Russian Federation," Nauert said."What that means is that Secretary Tillerson has signed off on this and it is now being held on Capitol Hill."Nauert said that the State Department was also reaching out to "key US industry stakeholders and our allies and partners" to explain the list.Read More
'We'll see!' How Trump answers tough questions:::::Washington (CNN) Just two weeks into Donald Trump's new presidency, he announced he was going to "look at" the unfounded claim that 3 million people voted illegally in the 2016 election.When pressed on it the next month, he said "we'll see," implying there could be even more illegal votes.Nine months later, we're still waiting for answers.And it hasn't been the only time.The President has been looking into everything from the North Korea crisis to peace in the Middle East, from health care specifics to immigration policy, from infrastructure plans to disaster relief in Puerto Rico.Trump has used this device on a position or action more than 100 times as President, according to a new CNN analysis of transcripts, speeches, tweets and statements compiled by Factba.se The answer is the same whether the subject is the fates of Cabinet officials, the future of trade pacts or pushes to pass major legislation -- he responds with a blanket, noncommittal "we'll see."Scroll down for the full list and see all the times Trump has said he's "looking into" something or that "we'll see."Obviously, Trump is not the first President to evade difficult topics.(All politicians do it.)But Trump has a unique way of dancing around taking clear positions and avoiding transparency.For example, Trump announced in April that he was "looking at" designs for the border wall with Mexico.But then he was "working it out" in June, "seriously looking" in July, "looking" in September and "looking" some more in October.It happens on major legislation, too."We're looking at that, and we're going to announce something very soon," Trump told The New York Times about a sweeping infrastructure plan -- back in April.No plan has been unveiled.Creating uncertainty and unpredictability has been a signature style of the Trump campaign and now the White House.Trump has remarked that he sees perceived unpredictability as an asset in negotiations.On some major issues, he's wiggled a kind of middle ground to avoid a final decision.Trump said "we'll see" about renegotiating the Paris climate agreement weeks after his decision to leave.He's said "we'll see" about the Iran nuclear deal after announcing his intent to decertify it.And on NAFTA, the fate of which still hangs in the balance, Trump has said "we'll see" what happens for several months.When Trump says he's "looking at" or "we'll see" about a government official, it's usually not a good sign.In April, he said "we'll see what happens" about former FBI Director Jim Comey, who was fired days later.In August, he said "we'll see what happens" with Steve Bannon, who was fired.In September, he was "looking into" Secretary Tom Price, who later resigned.But it hasn't been the end of the road for everyone.In July, he said he was "looking at" the fate of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and "we'll see" about Special Counsel Bob Mueller.Both are still in their jobs.Of course, this didn't start when Trump took the oath of office.Trump punted on everything from his relationship with Russia to gun violence during the campaign.And even before that, stretching back to when Trump was mulling a presidential run in 1999, the then-real estate mogul told NBC he was "looking at" a campaign for the White House "very seriously."The words come from a President who largely was not held accountable to shifting or ambiguous positions during the campaign.So will Trump change his ways any time soon?We'll see.Foreign policy National security Other Health care Economy Immigration Did we miss a Trumpian non-answer?Send a note to @ryanstruyk or @spetulla on Twitter.
Trump promises to release all JFK files:::::(CNN) President Donald Trump said Friday night on Twitter that he would release all documents related to President John F. Kennedy's assassination, a pledge that comes despite national security agencies' last-minute requests to keep some of the records secret.The President said he came to the decision after consulting with his chief of staff, John Kelly, as well as the CIA and other agencies, and would release all files "other than the names and addresses of any mentioned person who is still living.""I am doing this for reasons of full disclosure, transparency and in order to put any and all conspiracy theories to rest," the President tweeted.In a memo Thursday, Trump directed agencies that requested redactions to reassess their reasons for keeping the records secret, and said he would make a decision on those requests within 180 days.But it is unclear what his latest statement would do to that timeline.The White House has not provided a definitive timeline for the National Archives and Records Administration to release all the files; a White House official told CNN that the period of time has not been determined.Read More
Trump wants remaining State Dept. Clinton emails released:::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has made it clear to the State Department that he wants to accelerate the release of any remaining Hillary Clinton emails in its possession as soon as possible, according to three sources familiar with the President's thinking.This latest move for disclosure from the State Department comes at the same time the President called upon the Justice Department to lift a gag order on a key FBI informant in an investigation into Russian efforts to gain influence in the US uranium industry during the Obama administration.The sources described the President's interest in the release of the emails -- and the testimony of the FBI informant -- as rooted in a commitment to "transparency," with one source adding that "the law requires cooperation with Congress and the courts."After the initial publication of this story, one White House official confirmed the President expressed interest in the release of the Clinton emails, and later -- in a conversation with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- learned of the vast backlog of more than 13,000 outstanding FOIA cases.Those cases involve not just Clinton's emails but a multitude of topics -- some going back almost a decade.Trump then asked Tillerson to work to clear the backlog.In a memo to State Department employees, Tillerson said that the department will commit more resources and workforce to address the long queue of requests.Read More
Trump, GOP try to flip the script on Russia collusion:::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump and his allies in Washington are seizing on a pair of revelations about his former rival Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party aiming to flip the months-long narrative about potential Russian collusion.Republicans this week launched a multi-pronged attack -- from the White House, Capitol Hill and politicos around town -- on Democrats and their former nominee after reports revealed that the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee helped fund an opposition research effort that produced a controversial dossier that made allegations (including many salacious and unverified ones) about Trump and his Russian ties; and as new questions surfaced about the circumstances surrounding the sale of a Canadian-based uranium mining company during Clinton's time leading the State Department.Court documents connected with the case reviewed do not reference donations to the Clinton Foundation, nor attempts by US or Russian interests to influence the Uranium One deal decision.Since these allegations have resurfaced in the wake of recent reporting, Clinton and members of her staff have disputed accusations that anything improper occurred surrounding the approval of the Uranium One deal.Clinton said in an interview with C-SPAN this week that any accusations that she was bribed to approve the deal were "baloney" and that they had been "debunked repeatedly."The reaction from Trump and his Republican allies was swift and synchronized, serving to muddy the waters and draw attention away from the investigations and allegations the President and his allies still face."It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump.Was collusion with HC!"Trump tweeted, referring to Clinton.On Capitol Hill, congressional Republicans opened two fresh Clinton-related investigations into the uranium sale and the decision by the FBI not to pursue criminal charges against Clinton over her private email use.And throughout the week, Republican political operations from the RNC to Trump-aligned surrogates flooded the airwaves and reporters' inboxes with allegations that the real tale of collusion was on the other side of the aisle.Republicans, who have spent months on defense amid allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, jumped back into an attack posture."This is a major development and one of the first openings we've had on this issue in months," said an RNC official, who requested anonymity to candidly discuss the Republican strategy.The RNC official and a senior White House official said the revelations gave Republicans and the White House an opportunity to go on the offensive and divert attention from the investigations facing the President.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders did just that on Friday as she took to the White House podium and claimed: "All the things that the Democrats have accused the President of doing, they are actually guilty of themselves.""If any collusion took place, it would be between the DNC and the Clintons," Sanders said.A White House official said Sanders was referring to the Democratic-funded dossier compiled by a former British intelligence official, which leveled allegations about Trump and his associates' ties to Russia as well as to months-old allegations that a DNC contractor met with Ukrainian officials offering information that could be damaging to Trump's campaign.The DNC has vehemently denied any collusion with the Ukrainian government.The White House and its allies' argument: that the dossier -- initially funded by still-undisclosed Republicans during the 2016 primary campaign -- amounts to collusion because it included information sourced to Russian intelligence sources.The allegation is hardly as hard-hitting as those Trump and his allies have faced, particularly given that the federal investigation and the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Russian meddling and allegations of collusion were not triggered by the dossier.Trump, meanwhile, still faces the scrutiny of public investigators for his firing of FBI director James Comey -- which Trump has said was because of "this Russia thing" -- his campaign associates' meetings with Russian officials, including most notably his eldest son's meeting with a Russian lawyer he believed would furnish the Trump campaign with incriminating information on Clinton from the Russian government.The Daily Beast revealed earlier this week , and CNN confirmed, that the head of a data firm employed by the Trump campaign emailed WikiLeaks head Julian Assange hoping to gain access to 33,000 emails that had been on Clinton's server.US intelligence officials believe many of the hacked emails Assange released were obtained as part of a Russian hacking campaign.News of the email exchange comes amid federal investigations into whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.Brad Parscale, the Trump campaign's digital director, was interviewed Tuesday by the House intelligence committee as part of that inquiry.But the allegations Trump and his allies are now lobbing at Democrats don't have to pan out to be effective.A senior White House official said the allegations would at a minimum "demonstrate that this is a far more complicated matter than people lead on."The allegations and attacks against Clinton mark a return to the tried-and-true GOP attack playbook of raising suspicion about Clinton's actions."The news about Hillary Clinton and the DNC paying for the research behind the Russia dossier raises a lot of questions that I think are fair to ask from the RNC and from other groups," an RNC official said."There's at least a perception that Democrats and the Clinton campaign lied about this -- that this is very Clinton-esque."
Trump leaning toward banker Jerome Powell to run Fed:::::It appears President Trump is zeroing in on a choice for next Federal Reserve chair.Two sources told CNN on Saturday that Trump will likely name Jerome Powell to lead the central bank.Powell, a Republican, has been a governor on the Fed's board since 2012, and he was assigned to lead the bank's Wall Street oversight committee back in April.Trump has yet to make a formal decision, but the White House said he'd announce his choice next week.He could still change his mind, the sources said.His apparent lean toward Powell is a major development.For weeks there has been speculation about whether Trump would renominate current Fed chair Janet Yellen to another four-year term.Yellen was nominated by President Obama in 2013, and her current term expires in February 2018.During his campaign, Trump accused Yellen of making policy decisions aimed at earning political points for Obama.But since Trump was inaugurated, he softened his tone and has even praised Yellen's decision making.Yet, the pair stand at odds on several issues.Trump has promised to start peeling back the financial regulations put in place after the financial crisis of 2008.Yellen is generally not a fan of that idea.She argues they're key to the U.S.'s continued economic recovery, though she has suggested she'd be willing to take a second look at certain Dodd-Frank rules that apply to small banks.Yellen could not be immediately reached for comment on Saturday.Trump's pick for Fed chair is one of the most important decisions he'll make as president.The U.S. central bank leader is considered one of the most powerful posts in the world.On Friday, sources told CNN that the list of candidates Trump was considering was down to about three.The names included Yellen, Powell, and Stanford economist John Taylor Powell would be an unusual pick.Every Fed chair since 1979 has been an economist, but Powell's background is in investment banking.Powell is largely supportive of Yellen's approach to slowing raising interest rates as the economy improves.He's been backed by Mnuchin, who has spearheaded Trump's Fed chair search.

National Park Service Denies Permit for Huge Naked Woman Statue on National Mall:::::A permit to bring a 45-foot statue of a naked woman to Washington, D.C. was denied by the National Park Service.(Published Friday, Oct. 27, 2017) A group that wanted to bring a 45-foot statue of a naked woman to the National Mall was denied a permit because it would detract from historic monuments and could damage the turf, National Park Service (NPS) officials said."The proposed nearly 48-foot height of the statue introduces a visual element that would diminish the propertys significant historic features by altering the setting and historic character of the National Mall landscape," NPS spokesman Mike Litterst said in an email.Organizers of Catharsis on the Mall wanted the R-Evolution statue to stand near the Washington Monument, facing the White House, for 91 days between November and March.The permit was denied Wednesday, Litterst said.Catharsis organizers claimed in a statement that NPS issued them a permit and then revoked it.NPS did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether that claim was accurate.Catharsis spokeswoman Natalie White accused NPS of denying the permit to silence women."They don't want us to take action, they don't want us to say enough is enough, they don't want this symbol to remind women to stand up to the injustice this administration has forced upon them," she said in a statement.The park service also denied a permit for a memorial temple to stand on the National Mall for 119 days, Litterst said.The statue and temple "would likely cause significant damage to and require replacement of the underlying turf and soil," Litterst said.Rose McGowan Makes First Appearance Since Weinstein Claim Actor and director Rose McGowan made her first appearance in public since she accused film producer Harvey Weinstein of rape, giving a rousing speech against sexual harassers at the Women's Convention in Detroit.(Published Friday, Oct. 27, 2017) Catharsis on the Mall was granted a permit for an event Nov. 10-12 and will be allowed to assemble 30 other temporary structures, Litterst said.The arts festival was granted permission to light a fire on the Mall, Litterst said.This year will be the third year Catharsis on the Mall holds the ceremonial burning, Litterst said.A crowdfunding campaign was launched in October to bring the statue, and reached 73 percent of its $90,000 goal before NPS announced the permit was denied.The R-Evolution statute is intended to represent women free from domestic violence, artist and creator Marco Cochrane said.
Trump Administration Makes H-1B Renewal Process Harder:::::A Trump adminstration policy change could make the renewal process for H-1B visas more time consuming and complicated.Kris Sanchez reports.A Trump administration policy change could make the renewal process for H-1B visas more time consuming and complicated.Those seeking to renew their H-1B visa, which allows skilled workers from outside of the country to work in the United States for a certain period of time, will now face the same level of requirements for a renewal as they did for their initial application, according to U.S.Citizenship and Immigration Services.Visa holders seeking renewal will need to have a job with a sponsoring company, copy of their passport, proof of degree with transcripts, and a letter of current and previous employment.There is no longer a fast-track renewal process for the visa program, which grants roughly 65,000 visas every year.Rose McGowan Makes First Appearance Since Weinstein Claim Actor and director Rose McGowan made her first appearance in public since she accused film producer Harvey Weinstein of rape, giving a rousing speech against sexual harassers at the Women's Convention in Detroit.(Published Friday, Oct. 27, 2017) San Francisco Bay Area companies such as Google and Apple depend on the H-1B visa program to acquire highly-skilled workers from out of the country.President Donald Trump in April signed an order that asked the government to propose new rules and changes that would stop what he called abuses in the visa program used by U.S. technology companies."We are going to defend our workers, protect our jobs and finally put America first," Trump declared at the time.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Opinion Shifting Toward Athletes' Anthem Protests: Poll:::::AP reporters counted more than 200 NFL players who did not stand during the national anthem before their games on Sunday.(Published Monday, Sept. 25, 2017) Americans are split in a new poll on rules that would require professional athletes to kneel for the national anthem, a real shift in favor of their right to protest, NBC News reported.Fifty-one percent of respondents to an HBO Real Sports/Marist poll said they opposed leagues requiring that players stand, while 47 percent supported such rules.The four-point difference is within the Oct. 15-17 poll's margin of error, which makes it a statistical tie.But when the poll was conducted a year ago, a clear majority supported rules requiring players to stand, by a mark of 52 to 43.Since then, President Donald Trump threw a spotlight on the athletes following the example of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who began kneeling for the anthem in August 2016.
US Now Moving Toward Armed Drones, Lethal Force in Niger: Officials:::::In Washington, there is a search for answers about the ambush in Niger that killed four U.S. Service members.(Published Saturday, Oct. 21, 2017) The Trump administration is paving the way for lethal strikes against terrorists in Niger as the U.S. military pushes forward with a plan to arm the Reaper drones that fly over that country, multiple U.S. officials told NBC News.France has already decided to arm its drones in the region, U.S. documents show, and the move to arm U.S. Reapers has been under consideration for some time long before this month's ambush of a Green Beret unit that resulted in the deaths of four American soldiers.But that incident, details of which are still coming to light, is fueling an urgency within the Trump administration to take more aggressive steps against the terrorist groups that are operating in North and West Africa, according to intelligence and military officials.In the wake of the attack, the U.S. has been pressing the government of Niger to allow armed drones at the U.S. bases in that country, three U.S. officials said.Beset by poverty, weak governance and insurgent movements, the African region that includes Niger and neighboring Mali is considered by U.S. officials to be a fertile recruiting ground for Al Qaeda and ISIS.U.S. officials believe the militants who ambushed the Green Berets belong to a group that has pledged allegiance to ISIS.President Obama declined to allow armed drones to fly over the region, but the military has been pressing for some time to reverse that decision, officials said.Kelly 'Stunned' by Rep.'s Criticism of Trump's Call to Widow

Frederica Wilson and the agency was talking with Des Plaines police."We are aware of a social media posting generated in Des Plaines, IL and are in contact with local authorities, Croon said in an email.Screenshots of the Facebook post which appears to have been deleted along with the users account are being shared on social media, and some have claimed its creator is a former police officer.Croon said he did not know if the alleged author was a police officer.Des Plaines police did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls requesting comment.Chicago police referred questions to Capitol Police, citing a department policy to not comment on threats or security measures for public officials.Capitol Police said they do not comment on "ongoing investigations."The alleged post, which NBC 5 has not verified the authenticity of, contains an image of a glum-looking Wilson in one of her flamboyant signature cowboy hats.Need ten good men to help carry out a lynching, it reads.Must have own horse and saddle.Rope will be provided.The Chicago Tribune reports that 54-year-old Des Plaines resident Tom Keevers says he is receiving death threats after an "anonymous 'meme-maker'" twisted his words in a Facebook post.Calls to a phone number listed under Keevers' name were not immediately returned.The paper reports Keevers floundered through an interview in which he says he didnt write the post, could not remember threatening to lynch the congresswoman and that it was possible someone used his words to make a meme."Dont people get in arguments on Facebook all the time?"the Tribune reports Keevers as saying, before he doubled down on his initial defense: "I did not use those words."The post comes after a public tumult between Wilson and Trump surrounding the congresswomans claim the president botched a condolence call to the pregnant widow of a Green Beret killed in Niger earlier this month along with three of his comrades.Wilson said Trump told the slain soldier's widow her husband knew what he signed up for."Wilson accused Trump of being insensitive.The pregnant widow of Sgt.La David Johnson, Myeshia Johnson, said Monday the phone call she received from Trump before meeting her husbands body at Dover Air Force Base made her more upset as the president struggled to remember her spouses name, NBC News reported.She said thats when Trump told her that her husband "knew what he signed up for but it hurts anyways," "I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt.La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!"Trump tweeted in response.Calls and emails to Wilsons office were not responded to but a statement on her website stands by her assertion that Trump fumbled the phone call."Despite President Trump's suggestion that I have recanted my statement or misstated what he said, I stand firmly by my original account of his conversation with Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt.La David Johnson," the statement reads in part."Moreover, this account has been confirmed by family members who also witnessed Mr. Trump's incredible lack of compassion and sensitivity."Meanwhile, in Des Plaines, authorities continue to investigate the alleged Facebook threat."People threaten Donald Trump all the time and nothing happens," Keevers told the Tribune."I dont think a lot about what I write on Facebook."Threatening a member of Congress, which is a federal crime, can carry a prison sentence of up to five years.Keevers was honored by the FBI in 2003 for helping apprehend a bank-robbery suspect, the Tribune reported at the time.
Nurx, the 'Uber of Birth Control,' Aims to Help Women in the Nation's Contraceptive Deserts:::::Students at the University of California, Davis, can now purchase $30 Plan B emergency contraceptives, pregnancy tests, condoms and other personal care products from a vending machine.The idea came from UC Davis senior Parteek Singh, after a friend was unable to buy emergency contraceptives in time.(Published Friday, April 28, 2017) Often referred to as the "Uber of birth control," Nurx ships birth control directly to a woman's doorstep, bypassing the traditional visit to a clinic or physician typically necessary for getting or renewing a prescription.Available in 15 states plus Washington D.C., the app may simply be an extra modern-day convenience for some women, NBC News reported.But for others, it's the difference between having access to birth control and not.According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, nearly 20 million women in America live in so-called "contraceptive deserts": counties where the number of public clinics is not enough to meet the needs of the county's population.The group estimates that more than 19.7 million females ages 13 to 44 lack reasonable access to public clinics that provide birth control, defined as at least one clinic or provider for every 1,000 women.Trump Cannot Believe the Media Produced Such Beautiful Children
On who is target of Russia probes 1st charges, 'if youre the person, you know': Christie:::::Whoever is targeted in the first charges sought by the special counsel's Russia investigation likely already knows, said New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie, a former federal prosecutor.Interested in Russia?Add Russia as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Believe me, if youre the person, you know, Christie, a former U.S. attorney, told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on "This Week" Sunday.If youve been told youre a target, believe me, youre not sleeping well anyway.The team of special counsel Robert Mueller investigating Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election and possible links to the campaign of President Donald Trump has sought charges against at least one unidentified target, ABC News has learned.Sources tell ABC News an indictment announcement and arrest could possibly come as soon as Monday.CNN first reported Friday night that a federal grand jury approved the first charges in the investigation.ABC News "Depending on who disclosed this to CNN, it could be a crime," Christie told Stephanopoulos on Sunday, noting that grand jury proceedings are supposed to be secret."It would be a crime if prosecutors or agents leaked it."Christie said that when he was the chief federal prosecutor in New Jersey he emphasized to his staff the importance of keeping quiet about a grand jury's work."'We will prosecute you if we find out you leaked this stuff because we need to have the public have confidence that the grand jury system is secret and, as a result, fair,'" Christie said he warned his staff as U.S. attorney.The Republican governor and Trump ally also addressed the question of whether the president might issue pardons of anyone who could potentially be convicted in the Russia investigation."Ive never seen the president talk about" the possibility of such pardons, Christie said, adding that no one should count on a presidential pardon, which he said would be a big step."Quite frankly, I think to have those kind of conversations about pardons, if anybody is sitting around and saying, 'I dont have to worry about anything because the president will ultimately pardon me,' they should talk to Scooter Libby," he said.I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, a chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney in the George W. Bush administration, was convicted in 2007 of lying to the FBI and obstruction of justice in a CIA leak case.Then-President Bush commuted Libby's 30-month sentence, sparing him prison time, but didn't pardon him.Christie added of any who may be counting on possible pardons by President Trump, "They should talk to others who thought they were going to be pardoned and all the people involved in Watergate, and the pardons they thought they might be getting from President Nixon.Theyre still waiting."
Trump again calls Russia probe 'witch hunt' as possible 1st indictment looms:::::President Donald Trump in a series of tweets Sunday morning repeated his prior assertions that a federal investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential ties to his presidential campaign is a political "witch hunt."Interested in Donald Trump?Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The president's tweets came as special counsel Robert Mueller's team has sought its first charges in the probe, with a possible announcement of an indictment to come as soon as Monday.Sources tell ABC News the special counsel team has sought charges against at least one unidentified target.The president's lawyer handling the response to the Russia investigation said Trump's tweets Sunday are not related to the special counsel's activities.Contrary to what many have suggested, the presidents comments today are unrelated to the activities of the special counsel, with whom he continues to cooperate, lawyer Ty Cobb said.Andrew Harnik/AP, FILE Trump tweeted that there is Republican "anger" over a failure to investigate Democrats' helping to fund research into possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia that led to an infamous dossier.Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee have acknowledged that they helped to fund the dossier.It's unclear what is the source of Trump's suggestion that Democrats paid $12 million for the dossier.The Clinton campaign and the DNC paid law firm Perkins Coie $12.4 million during the 2016 campaign for representation, according to The New York Times.Perkins Coie hired another company for work that led to the dossier but it is unclear how much the law firm paid that company.Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?),....Donald J.

Two Navy SEALs under investigation in death of Green Beret in Mali:::::Two members of the Navy's elite SEAL Team Six are under investigation in the death of an Army Green Beret in Mali this past June, according to U.S. officials.The death is being investigated by the Navy's Criminal Investigative Service.On June 4, Army Staff Sgt.Logan J. Melgar was found dead in his room in embassy housing in Bamako, Mali.U.S. officials confirm that two Navy SEALS are under investigation for Melgar's death, and that the SEALS belong to the elite SEAL Team Six.U.S. Department of State One official said the death is being investigated as a homicide and that investigators are looking into Melgar's suspected asphyxiation.An investigation was immediately launched by the Army's Criminal Investigation Division.That investigation was transferred to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service on September 25."NCIS can confirm we are investigating the death of SSGT Melgar but beyond that, NCIS does not discuss the details of ongoing investigations," said Ed Buice, an NCIS spokesman.A U.S. official said Melgar's death is being investigated as a homicide.The news of the investigation into Melgar's death was first reported by the New York Times.Melgars death was not publicly announced by the Pentagon at the time of his death.Not every military fatality overseas is required to be disclosed publicly by the Pentagon.Typically the rule of thumb is that fatalities are required to be announced for named operations, such as Operation Inherent Resolve.Melgar was part of a small group of U.S. military personnel working in Bamako, Mali in support of the U.S. Embassy.The Lubbock, Texas, native enlisted in the Army in January 2012 as an 18X.In 2013, he started his Special Forces training, and was assigned to the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) in 2016, after he'd completed the Special Forces Qualification and Special Forces Engineer courses.Melgar conducted two deployments to Afghanistan as an engineer sergeant.
Top House Intelligence member 'can't comment' if Trump under investigation in Russia probe:::::The House Intelligence Committee's top Democratic member said he "can't answer" whether President Donald Trump is under investigation in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.Interested in Russia?Add Russia as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest "I can't answer that one way or the other," Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on "This Week" Sunday.Stephanopoulos pressed, "You wouldn't know whether Robert Mueller is investigating the president?""I can't comment on that at all," Schiff said.The House Intelligence Committee is investigating Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.The Senate Intelligence Committee and special counsel Robert Mueller are also leading their own investigations.Asked if the House Intelligence Committees investigation had become a side show because of partisan differences, Schiff said he believed the committees Republican chair, Rep. Devin Nunes, has created serious obstacles.It's not a side show.And we continue the hard work of getting to the bottom of what happened, Schiff said.We face serious obstacles, and many of them go back to our chairman, who, I think, all too often, has been willing to further the work and the viewpoint of the White House irrespective of what we're finding in the investigation.That unhelpful.Andrew Harnik/AP, FILE But nonetheless, there are plenty of us Democrats and Republicans that continue to interview the key witnesses, review the key documents, and make progress in the investigation, Schiff added.It is still my hope that notwithstanding all the turbulence created at the top of our committee that we can come to a common conclusion.Schiff also weighed in on the possibility of the president issuing pardons, saying he doesn't believe Trump's pardon power is as "absolute as people have been suggesting.""The president cannot pardon people if it's an effort to obstruct justice, if it's an effort to prevent Bob Mueller [or] others from learning about the president's own conduct," the California Democrat said."I don't think [the president's pardon power] is unlimited, and I think it would be highly problematic for the president if it's part of an effort to obstruct justice."Schiff added that the president's controversial pardon of former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio suggests Trump may not wait until an investigation is complete to pardon someone."The Arpaio pardon was a horrible precedent because that case wasn't even finished," Schiff said."The president was essentially sending a message, 'I won't even wait until the criminal cases are over to give a pardon.'"
Confusion coming with California's legal marijuana:::::Interested in Marijuana?Add Marijuana as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Marijuana news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Ready or not, California kicks off recreational marijuana sales on Jan. 1.And, mostly, it's not.Los Angeles and San Francisco are among many cities still struggling to fashion local rules for pot shops and growers.Without the regulations, there could be limited options in many places for consumers eager to ring in the new year with a legal pot purchase."The bulk of folks probably are not going to be ready Jan. 1," conceded Cara Martinson of the California State Association of Counties.In general, California will treat cannabis like alcohol, allowing people 21 and older to legally possess up to an ounce and grow six marijuana plants at home.Come January, the newly legalized recreational sales will be merged with the state's two-decade-old medical marijuana market, which is also coming under much stronger regulation.But big gaps loom in the system intended to move cannabis from the field to distribution centers, then to testing labs and eventually retail shops.The state intends to issue only temporary licenses starting in January, and it has yet to release its plan to govern the estimated $7 billion marketplace, the nation's largest legal pot economy.If businesses aren't licensed and operating in the legal market, governments aren't collecting their slice of revenue from sales.The state alone estimates it could see as much as $1 billion roll in within several years.Operators have complained about what they see as potential conflicts in various laws and rules, or seemingly contradictory plans.The state expects businesses that receive licenses will only work with others that hold them.But that has alarmed operators who wonder what will happen if their supplier, for instance, decides not to join the new legal market.Others say it's not clear what could happen in cities that don't enact pot laws, which they warn could open a loophole for businesses to set up shop.Some communities have banned recreational sales completely.Most banks continue to refuse to do business with marijuana operators - pot remains illegal under federal law - and there are also problems obtaining insurance.With recreational legalization fast approaching, "we don't have enough of anything," lamented Hezekiah Allen, executive director of the California Growers Association, a marijuana industry group.The route to legalization began last year when voters approved Proposition 64, which opened the way for recreational pot sales to adults in the nation's most populous state.Unlike the state, cities and counties face no deadline to act.However, the concern is that confusion and a patchwork of local rules could discourage operators from entering the legal economy, feeding a black market that could undercut the legitimate one.Local regulation is a foundation block of the emerging pot economy: A grower or retailer needs a local permit first, which is a steppingstone to obtaining a state license to operate.But those rules remain in limbo in many places.San Jose, the state's third-largest city, has a temporary ban on sales other than medical pot but officials this week proposed hearings to take another look at how to regulate the local industry.Kern County, home to nearly 900,000 people, has banned the sale of marijuana even as California legalizes it.Supervisors said they see it as a danger to citizens and also voted to phase out more than two dozen medical marijuana dispensaries.In Los Angeles, which by some estimates could be a $1 billion marketplace, voters have been strongly supportive of legal pot.But its proposed regulations hit snags, including a dispute over a proposal for so-called certificates of compliance, which operators feared would not meet qualification requirements for state licenses.Adam Spiker, executive director of the Southern California Coalition, an industry group, warned last month that L.A.'s draft rules could upend the emerging industry by failing to provide a prompt way to license suppliers, potentially forcing then to shut down.And he's dubious that the city will be ready to begin issuing licenses on Jan. 1."There's not a lot of calendar days left in the year," he said.San Francisco, another city that strongly supports legalization, still is debating local rules.Again, it's uncertain what will be ready, or when."What we want to do is bring everything into the daylight, regulate it, get fees for the cost of regulation and collect taxes as appropriate," said county Supervisor Jeff Sheehy.San Diego is among the cities ready to get the recreational market going.Phil Rath, executive director of the United Medical Marijuana Coalition, a San Diego trade group, said years of disorder in the medical market led to increased black market business.That provided a ready example of how not to manage recreational sales.San Diego moved promptly, setting up a system that will allow recreational sales at dispensaries permitted under the medical system, once they qualify for a state license.Industry experts say the distribution system - a sort of main artery where pot will be received from growers, sent out for testing, taxed, and eventually shipped to retail stores - is not robust enough to support the vast new market.The distributor model "was the subject of most of the political wrangling over the last two years," Allen said."That's the control point," he said, but "we don't have enough of them."
Virginia's governor's race draws big names from both parties:::::Big names in both major political parties are flocking to Virginia as the state's closely watched race for governor enters its final days.Virginia is the only competitive governor's race in the country, and the contest between Republican Ed Gillespie and Democrat Ralph Northam could be an early referendum on President Donald Trump's political popularity ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.Former Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. and U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California spent the weekend at get-out-the-vote rallies and black churches trying to rally Democrats around the statewide ticket."Virginia has the fate of our country in its hands," Harris, a rising Democratic Party star widely mentioned as a potential national candidate, said at rally Sunday at a Richmond cidery.Gillespie has an event scheduled Sunday evening with U.S. Sen.Rob Portman of Ohio and a Monday event with U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.Gillespie campaigned last week with New Mexico Gov.Susana Martinez.Gillespie, a White House adviser to President George W. Bush and former lobbyist, has run on lower taxes, tougher policies toward immigrants who are in the state illegally and preserving the state's Confederate statues.Northam is a pediatric neurologist who has pledged to continue many of the policies of current term-limited Gov.Terry McAuliffe.Northam has promised increased spending in public education, tighter gun rules and strong support for abortion rights.Both mild-mannered candidates will be looking for a high-profile surrogate to help boost turnout in an off-year election, when voter interest typically dips.Gillespie, who is viewed skeptically by some Trump supporters, has campaigned with Vice President Mike Pence but has not said whether he plans to invite the president to campaign with him.For Northam, Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring and lieutenant governor candidate Justin Fairfax, a key focus in big-name visits has been on boosting African-American turnout.President Barack Obama rallied with the ticket earlier this month, and Holder, the country's first black African-American attorney general, invoked civil rights icons to motivate Virginians to vote when he spoke Sunday."Too many people sacrificed too much to give everybody the right to vote," Holder said.Holder is chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which seeks to elect Democrats in statewide elections ahead of the next redistricting and has invested heavily in Northam's campaign.The next Virginia governor, to be elected on Nov. 7, also will have a major say in the state's next congressional redistricting.Gillespie helped quarterback a Republican wave in statehouse elections around the country in 2010 just before the last redistricting that has helped the GOP maintain a firm grip on the U.S. House.In Virginia, Democrats often complain of unfairly drawn districts in the last round, pointing out that Democrats hold every statewide office but Republicans have a majority in both state chambers and in congressional seats.Amber Caldwell, a Chester resident who showed up to hear Holder and Harris speak Sunday, said she's been particularly motivated to support Northam because of the importance of redistricting."It determines everything," she said.
Hillary Clinton on Comey letter anniversary: 'Oh is that today?':::::Hillary Clinton demonstrated this weekend that she may have lost the 2016 presidential election, but she hasn't lost her sense of humor.Saturday marked the one-year anniversary of when, with 11 days until Election Day, former FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to members of Congress informing them that the FBI learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation into then-Secretary of State Clinton's use of a private email server."Oh is that today?"Clinton tweeted in response to FiveThirtyEight Editor-In-Chief Nate Silver's tweet that Clinton would have won the 2016 election if not for Comey's letter.Oh is that today?https://t.co/AYy7CtYRWj Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 29, 2017 "I would have won but for Jim Comey's letter on October 28," Clinton said during an appearance on "The View" in September."That stopped my momentum."The new messages Comey was referring to in his letter were discovered through a separate FBI investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner of New York.The emails came from Weiners now estranged wife, Huma Abedin, who is one of Clintons closest aides and worked in the State Department under Clinton.Trump and his supporters praised Comeys decision to announce the new email review, while Democrats were flabbergasted.Comeys letter was viewed by leaders in the Justice Department as a break in a long-standing tradition of avoiding actions that could influence an elections outcome.On Nov. 6, 2016, Comey wrote a second letter to members of Congress, alerting them that the review of the newly discovered emails was complete and the FBI found nothing criminal that would change its July conclusion that Clinton shouldnt be charged.

correspondent, Pierre Thomas.Good morning, Pierre.PIERRE THOMAS, ABC NEWS SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: George, good morning.The special counsel's team in recent days sought charges against at least one unidentified target.Sources say an indictment announcement and arrest could come possibly as early as on Monday.But the spokesman for the special counsel's office is declining to comment.And we don't yet have any specifics on who would be charged or what those charges might be.What we do know is that the special counsel's team has been investigating whether there was collusion between associates of then candidate Donald Trump and Russian officials in connection with the 2016 presidential election.Mueller is also looking into the financial dealings of a number of key Trump associates, including former campaign manager Paul Manafort and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.Sources close to Manafort say they've been given no indication any charges against him are imminent.And we've gotten no response from people -- response from people close to Michael Flynn.While it's unclear how significant these first charges will be, it does send a clear message that prosecutors believe a crime has been committed, and it shows everyone involved probably needs to take stock that this is a serious matter, George.STEPHANOPOULOS: Which means all eyes will be on that courthouse tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. Pierre Thomas, thanks very much.Let's bring in our senior White House correspondent, Cecilia Vega.Cecilia, the White House appeared to be blindsided by this.CECILIA VEGA, ABC NEWS SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, George, absolutely.And there was certainly a scramble behind the scenes at the White House this weekend.We know the president's legal team has been busy meeting and making phone calls.And from what we've been told, the lawyers of -- the president's lawyers and his aides still have no idea who this is.They don't have a name.So, there's a lot of guessing happening behind the scenes right now.But, look, are people nervous?Aides have obtained lawyers.We know the president has been picking up the tab for some of that.Everyone that I have been speaking to expects to be brought in, in some capacity, at some point for things like interviews and whatnot.But even with this big development, I don't expect the standard response on this to change.They maintain that this is a witch-hunt.That's something the president talks a lot about.And as it relates to that -- who funded that controversial Russian dossier that is back in the news, they say the focus should be on Democrats and Hillary Clinton.Now, we all remember the president's former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski.He called the speculation about Mueller's charges -- quote -- "insane."So, that gives you a good idea about what they're thinking.But, so far, George, from the president himself, no public reaction, no tweets -- not yet anyway.STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, not yet this morning.OK, Cecilia Vega, thanks very much.Let's bring in our chief legal analyst, Dan Abrams.And, Dan, why would something like this be kept secret?DAN ABRAMS, ABC NEWS CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: Well, typically, the reason you keep it secret is, you don't want the defendant to know.You don't want the defendant to try to destroy evidence.You don't want potential co-defendants to act out.It is specifically targeting the person who is going the be arrested and saying, we don't want this person to know.STEPHANOPOULOS: And when we find out who that person is, that will reveal a fair amount about Mueller's strategy.ABRAMS: Right.The big question becomes, is the strategy going to be first go for a little fish to try to get that person to turn, right?Typically, that's the way you would do something like this.You're looking at a big-time investigation.You first try and indict, put pressure on a smaller fish, in an effort to get that person to turn, and then testify against a bigger one.STEPHANOPOULOS: But this -- but this is complicated by the fact that, in this case, the president has pardon powers.ABRAMS: Yes.And, as a result, the rules go all out the window.Right?The fact that the president can pardon any of these people, at least on any federal crime -- it doesn't mean necessarily on a state crime -- but on the federal crime -- means that they can be thinking, feeling, you know what, if I get indicted, that's OK.I'm not going to respond to the pressure from the federal authorities, the way that someone ordinarily would, because I know that I'm ultimately going to get pardoned.That's going to be a really big question, both for Mueller's team and for the potential defendants.STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, Dan Abrams, thanks very much.Let's bring in a man who has prosecuted cases, the governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie.Thanks for coming in this morning.GOV.CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) NEW JERSEY: My pleasure, George.STEPHANOPOULOS: So, what's your reaction to this news?CHRISTIE: I want to respond to one thing that Dan said, that is a normal course of things.But when you're going after the smaller fish to get the bigger fish, you usually don't charge them, that's usually stuff that is working behind the scenes, because what you want to do is keep that smaller fish having turned secret, because it helps them to be able to gather more information.Sometimes they can wear a wire for you, sometimes they can gather information for you that if they're quiet, you're going get it where if everyone knows they've charged, they're going to be treated like they're radioactive.No one wants to be near them.No one is going to talk to them.So, I think that what it appears is going on here is that, you know, he is approaching this as a normal case with discreet type of charges that may wind up intersecting at some point or may not and not keeping it all together for some big report like Ken Starr did, but rather to go ahead and begin to charge people as he moves along.STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you agree with Dan on why this is being kept secret right now?CHRISTIE: Well first off, it's supposed to be kept secret.I mean, you know, let's remember, too, Dan knows this, you know there are very strict criminal laws about disclosing grand jury information.Now, depending upon who disclosed this to CNN, it could be a crime.STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you think it was Mueller's team?CHRISTIE: Well, I would hope not, because listen, as a prosecutor I could tell you that was the thing that we emphasized the most with our prosecutors and our agents was let me tell you something, we will prosecute you if we find out you leaked this stuff, because we have to have the public have confidence in the fact that the grand jury system is secret and as a result fair.If you're leaking stuff out of the grand jury, which happens, but you shouldn't be doing that.So, but again, we don't know who leaked it to CNN, if it would be a crime if prosecutors or agents leaked it, defense lawyers leaked it, it might be less... STEPHANOPOULOS: And anybody who has been before a grand jury is allowed to talk about it.CHRSTIE: Absolutely.But the people who have been before the grand jury wouldn't know that there are charges.You go in there, you testify, you get out.And so I think what is really important to focus on here today is what we don't know.And what we don't know... STEPHANOPOULOS: A lot.CHRISTIE: ...is who the person is.We don't know what the charges are.We don't know anything except there's a report that someone says there will be charges on Monday and that there is a sealed indictment.And so once that happens, we'll have a lot more to react to.But the one thing that is clear here is, I heard someone say, are people nervous?Believe me, if you're the person, you know.I mean, you have already been told you're a target.Your lawyers have been -- if you've been asked to come into the grand jury, they have got to advise you of your status as to whether you're a target.If you've been told you're a target, believe me you're not sleeping well any way.STEPHANOPOULOS: But how about this notion, though, as Dan was pointing out, this notion the president has pardon power here, and some -- there's been some talk that the president might issue preemptive pardons of Mueller targets before a trial.Would that be appropriate?CHRISTIE: I have never seen the president talk about that.And quite frankly I think to have those kind of conversations now about pardons -- if anybody is sitting around and saying I don't have to worry about anything, because the president will ultimately pardon me, they should talk to Scooter Libby.They should talk to others who thought they were going to be pardoned, and all the people involved in Watergate, and the pardons they thought they might be getting from President Nixon.They're still waiting, right?So, that's a very important power to use.And I haven't heard the president say anything like that.And I think we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves, and certainly those people shouldn't be sitting around saying, hey, no problem.ABRAMS: They're looking at Sheriff Arpaio.CHRISTIE: Well, that's a different circumstance.ABRAMS: It is.But I think that's what led people to say, wait a sec, this is a president who is ready, willing, and able to use his pardon power.CHRISTIE: But much different circumstance.The charges surrounding Sheriff Arpaio had absolutely nothing to do with the president or people around the president.STEPHANPOULOS: Because you agree, the president pardoning somebody here would be pretty explosive.CHRISTIE: Listen, it's a big step.And I think the other important thing for people watching this morning to remember is that the last public word we had on any of this was that the president himself was not under investigation.STEPHANOPOULOS: How do we know that?Because we know that the White House chief of staff, former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus has been questioned by Mueller.We know that Sean Spicer has been questioned.We know that they were questioned about the possibility of obstruction of justice.So you would assume that that means there's some kind of an investigation of the president.It may come to nothing, but we don't know.CHRISTIE: I don't think you can assume that, George.I just don't.And I used to love -- when I was U.S. attorney, I used to say to people all the time, the greatest part of my job was only I know what I know.And everybody speculates.And everybody outside speculates.And some of it is educated speculation, like Dan and I are involved in here this morning, because have experience in this.But in the end, I think we both would be willing to admit, we have no idea.STEPHANPOULOS: How about Robert Mueller?Back in August, you said he's a good man.You worked with him when you were prosecutor.He was FBI director.But on Friday, you seemed to suggest that it might be appropriate for him to step aside.CHRISTIE: What I said was if certain facts turn out to come out regarding his involvement with this in other manners, he has got to continue to evaluate that.So let me be really clear about it, he has an obligation as a special counsel, and I think a heightened obligation, to be evaluating all the time, new facts that come in, and do they put him in a compromised position.And if they do he has to recuse, because the public already is nervous about this, because the attorney general of the United States has recused himself from it.The justice system is not working as it normally does.And so if there are any questions about Director Mueller, he has to really... STEPHANOPOULOS: But you haven't seen that yet.CHRISTIE: No.No.And that's not what I said on Friday.What I said on Friday was, if certain facts develop on whether it's his relationship with Director Comey or other issues, then he has got to think about that.STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me ask you a final question -- you're also the chair of the president's opioids commission.The took your recommendation to declare a public health emergency, but he's facing some criticism for not coming forward and saying I need this much money.CHRISTIE: Well, I think it's going to be the subject of negotiation with congress.You know, there's lots of bills out there -- there was a $45 billion proposal that was part of the Graham-Cassidy legislation.And so I think the president has got to sit down with congress now and congress has to put this money in.The public health emergency fund has only $57,000 in it.So, it's time to fund that.I would say that you're going see this president initially ask for billions of dollars to deal with this.And the other thing people didn't notice as much, George, I want to bring up briefly is, he talked about changing the Medicaid rules, and said he's going to, that is going to open up thousands of Medicaid beds across this country for poor people who need drug treatment to get it.That is going to be game changing on the ground in individual states like mine and others.So money is being committed.And now it's congress' job.I heard Congresswoman Pelosi say, where is the money?I said, well, I read the constitution.You appropriate, not the president.So get appropriating.Let's see what the president will sign.STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Christie, thanks very much.CHRISTIE: Thanks, George.STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's bring in the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee Congressman Adam Schiff.Welcome back to This Week, congressman.REP. ADAM SCHIFF, (D) CALIFORNIA: Thank you.STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to begin with this question that Governor Christie raised here, the idea that the president is not under investigation.Is that your conclusion?SCHIFF: I can't comment on that, George, I can't answer that one way or the other.STEPHANOPOULOS: One way -- you wouldn't know whether Robert Mueller is investigating the president?SCHIFF: I can't comment on that at all.STEPHANOPOULOS: What is your reaction to this news that there may be a sealed indictment?SCHIFF: Well, you know, there are two people I think just from press reporting that it is likely to be, either Mike Flynn or Paul Manafort.We haven't been informed of who it is, and I don't think it would been appropriate for Bob Mueller to tell us.If it is Paul Manafort, and he has apparently told others that he expects to be indicted, it may help us answer one very central question in the investigation, and that is, we know that the Russian government, through intermediaries, was reaching out to the Trump campaign, reaching out to Paul Manafort and others, and offering information on Hillary Clinton they thought would help the Trump campaign, and that the campaign was willing and accepted that idea.We also know from The Washington Post reporting that contemporaneous with that, Paul Manafort is reaching out in the other direction Russia, to the Kremlin through oligarchs like Oleg Deripaska, offering information on the campaign in exchange for money, money he believed was owed him for work in Ukraine for a pro-Russia party.The question is, who gave what to whom as a result of these overtures.But the fact that these requests are moving in opposite directions, and what information, of course, would Mr. Manafort have to offer the Russians?Well, what would the president do on sanctions?That would be the most important information the Kremlin would want.So, if it is him, it may ultimately help us answer those questions.STEPHANOPOULOS: How about this question of the president's pardon power and whether or not it would be appropriate for him to issue preemptive pardons before a trial?SCHIFF: Well, the Arpaio pardon was a horrible precedent, because that case wasn't even finished, and the president was essentially sending a message I won't even wait until the criminal cases are over to give a pardon.Now, I don't think the president's power is all that absolute, as people have been suggesting.The president cannot pardon people if it's an effort to obstruct justice, if it's an effort to prevent Bob Mueller and others from learning about the president's own conduct.So, there are limitations.If it were truly unlimited, it would have the effect of nullifying vast portions of the constitution.The president could tell Justice Department officials and other law enforcement to violate the law and that if they did, and it was ever brought up, they were brought up on charges, he would pardon them.And one principle of constitutional interpretation is you don't interpret one power as nullifying all of the others.So, I don't think it's unlimited.And I think it would be highly problematic for the president if it's part of an effort to obstruct justice.STEPHANOPOULOS: I think we also learned this week that the DNC and the Clinton campaign, through their attorney, helped fund this Fusion GPS effort to create this dossier, this so-called dossier on whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians.We also know that the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website, had been paying Fusion GPS as well.And this has now become a subject for congress, congressional investigations, along with another investigation into the Obama administration's approval back in 2010 of a Russian investment in the U.S. uranium industry.The White House pointed it out in saying that this is a sign that there's collusion on both sides.SCHIFF: Well, here's I think the significance of who paid for Fusion GPS.We have known for really a long time that it began as a Republican effort.It was later picked up by the Democrats.So none of that is all that surprising.I think that is a factor to be considered in weighing the credibility of what Fusion GPS produced, who was paying for it.STEPHANOPOULOS: Shouldn't it have been disclosed earlier?SCHIFF: I can't answer that.I certainly would have liked to know who paid for it earlier, but nonetheless, that's just one factor to be considered.It doesn't answer the ultimate question, which is how much of the work is accurate, how much of it is true?And my colleagues don't seem particularly interested in that question, but that is really the most important question for the American people, and that is how much of this allegation that Christopher Steele makes and the reports that he hears, are true about the Russian government wanting to help the Trump campaign?Now, a lot of that has been corroborated.STEPHANOPOULOS: That's my -- I wanted to ask you that question.There are some things in that dossier that have been proven untrue.For example, Michael Cohn, according to his passport wasn't in Prague during the summer of 2016.What do you believe in the dossier has been corroborated?SCHIFF: Well, the most significant thing to me is that Christopher Steele may have found out even before our intelligence agencies that the Russians were, in fact, aiming to help Donald Trump in the election.That has now been borne out by ample evidence from not only -- from individual sources, but also from the social media campaign, for example, very demonstrably pro-Trump, anti-Clinton.So, that central conclusion has been borne out.Now, the question we continue to investigate is, was the campaign coordinating in the Russian help?And that still remains to be seen.There's certainly evidence that is highly suggestive of that in terms of the meeting in Trump Tower, but a lot more work needs to be done.I do want to say this on the uranium one situation.If the president weighed in with the Justice Department to get that investigation going by ordering them to lift this gag rule... STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, the White House has said Don McGahn did contact the Justice Department.SCHIFF: Well, that's not only unethical, but it's a violation of Department of Justice rules.And if members are congress are willing to essentially cover for that or even worse, become complicit in that, and that was the word Jeff Flake used in what I think is the most significant speech in congress in the 17 years that I have been there.If we allow ourselves in congress to become complicit in unethical conduct by the president in taking apart our system of checks and balances brick by brick intervening in the Justice Department with the gag rule, by interviewing U.S. attorneys in New York who may oversee potential prosecutions of the president's interests, by picking someone, confirming someone nominated to head the criminal division of the Justice Department who just happens to be the lawyer for Alpha Bank, we become complicit in that kind of conduct.We will have to answer to history.STEPHANOPOULOS: It does appear that Republicans and Democrats on your committee, the House Intelligence Committee, are now working at cross purposes.Has the congressional investigation, particularly in your your committee, simply become a side show?SCHIFF: It's not a side show.And, you know, we continue the hard work of getting to the bottom of what happened.But, look, we face serious obstacles, and many of them go back to our chairman, who, I think, all too often, has been willing to further the work and the viewpoint of the White House irrespective of what we're finding in the investigation.That unhelpful.But nonetheless, there are plenty of us Democrats and Republicans that continue to interview the key witnesses, review the key documents, and make progress in the investigation.It is still my hope that not withstanding all the turbulence created at the top of our committee that we can come to a common conclusion.But it has been tough, I won't deny that for a minute.STEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Schiff, thanks for your time this morning.SCHIFF: Thanks, George.STEPHANOPOULOS: We'll be right back with The Roundtable.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) STEPHANOPOUOS: We're back with The Roundtable.I'm joined by our chief political analyst Matthew Dowd; Katie Walsh Shields, she served as deputy chief of staff in the Trump White House, now advising his super PAC, America First Priorities; Roland Martin, host and managing editor of News One Now; Democratic Strategist, former Clinton campaign adviser Karen Finney; and Brian Kilmeade, the co-host of Fox and Friends, also has a new book out "Andrew Jackson and the Miracle of New Orleans."You see it right there.Welcome to all of you.Matthew, let me begin with you.So, we're all in a bit of a quandary right now.We don't know exactly what Robert Mueller has done, but it's pretty clear that it's real now.MATTHEW DOWD, ABC NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah, another boring week in politics, as it unfolds.I think the whole thing it's totally dependent on who this person is, right?And we have no idea.It could go in any different direction, the conversation was.It could be big.It could be little.It could be the start of baiting somebody bigger.We have no idea.And we have no idea what his game plan is in the course of this, and whether it finally reaches Donald Trump.It's not a good thing, obviously, for any White House to have to deal with this kind of thing.Anything like this takes them off their game, takes them off where they want to go.Takes them off any message they want on tax cuts or tax reform or anything like that.So, we'll see it unfold.But it does guarantee one thing, I think, that this is going to go far into 2018, which is problematic for the Republicans to have an investigation going on.STEPHANOPOULOS: And Kate, you left the White House before this really heated up, before this investigation really heated up.And is it your sense now that they have figured out way to compartmentalize the investigation, as the Clinton administration had to learn to do in his second term?KATIE WALSH SHIELDS, AMERICA FIRST PRIORITIES: Yeah, absolutely.I mean, they're focused on tax cuts.I mean, that's what they'd tell you and that's what we see up on the Hill and that's what we see about to come out of the White House.I mean, they're going to make sure they get tax cuts for the American public.And I think that you're going to see the president hasn't spoken about this in the last 48 hours since this apparent leak has came out that there will be something on Monday.And I think you'll see the White House continue to talk about helping the American public, not about Russia.STEPHANOPOULOS: We have seen that discipline from the president.In fact, he just tweeted about Obamacare, but not the Russian investigation.But earlier in the week, Karen Finney, you did see a lot of these questions and tweets from the president saying collusion now between the Clintons and the Russians.And also, we did learn that the Clintons' lawyer, Mark Elias did fund this Fusion GPS dossier.KAREN FINNEY, FORMER CLINTON CAMPAIGN ADVISER: Well, again, that dossier was -- came from an American company, that we had -- had originally been funded by Republicans, as you mentioned earlier.I think what's important, though, is less who founded it and what was in the dossier.And as you heard Adam Schiff just talking about, a number of the things in the dossier have been verified.But regardless, I think, again, with this announcement about Mueller, what's important is we also know that there are multiple other reasons that there is an investigation.I mean, there is this question of obstruction of justice in the firing of Jim Comey.There are these the questions about Carter Page and Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort and their communications and meetings with the Russians.We also learned this week that Cambridge Analytica, the company that was basically the data company for the campaign reached out to Julian Assange of WikiLeaks.We also learned this week -- I mean, this is the other problem with this investigation, the more it goes on, we learn -- it keeps growing, and that is part of the problem.As we also learned that, some folks at the Kremlin actually weighed in on the memo that was part of the June 16 memo.STEPHANOPOULOS: That was The New York Times report, Brian Kilmeade.I guess the bottom line there is that, according to Democrats, this is not fake news.BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX AND FRIENDS: There's a lot there.First off, to your question, I think if someone is marched in Monday, tomorrow, and it is something to do directly with the campaign, I think it's one thing.Number two, if it's something about Paul Manafort and what he did in the Ukraine before Donald Trump was even a candidate, then people will say, my goodness, is this going to be widespread and is this going to be confusing.And it's going to be rough shot, grape shot, looked at in the entire battlefield.So, to the GPS situation, we found out it's not a candidate, we found out it was Paul Singer and his Free Beacon.We found out that he was only looking at two candidates in particular.And he stopped the investigation as soon as Donald Trump locked up the nomination.As soon as he did that, he goes, OK, let's see what happens from the Republican perspective.Then we find out that somebody else picks up the investigation, makes it international.There's a Russian element.There was no Russian element to the Free Beacon-financed opposition research.That' a major difference.And then we're supposed to believe that John Podesta has no idea that $6 million to $9 million is flying out of the campaign?He said he didn't know?And his lawyer when he's saying he didn't know, Mark Elias says, oh, yeah, I actually approved that.So, you're the lawyer sitting next to a client who is pretending he doesn't know.That's unbelievable.DOWD: I just -- as Karen knows, and probably Roland knows, I've been highly critical of Hillary Clinton for a long period of time in all of the manifestations of everything... ROLAND MARTIN, NEWS ONE NOW: I think all of us know that.(LAUGHTER) DOWD: I have to say.I have to say, we need to give up the David Copperfield or Harry Houdini award for misdirection in this thing.This reminds me of the uranium deal whole story, which has been debunked along the way, all along th way.This is a whole other story.There is no similarity between what Robert Mueller is investigation in collusion and what the Russians wanted to do and a dossier paid for in part by the Democrats in order to... KILMEADE: But Matt, why would you think that?The FBI indictments could have been handed out.DOWD: There's no Russian relationship between the dossier and the Democrats.MARTIN: Here is what is laughable.We literally watch a campaign of folks chant lock her up, that we can have a president under investigation, and we are here right now.This is the real test as to whether or not Republicans actually put patriotism above partisanship.Will conservative media actually folks speak truth or want to defend Trump at any and all costs.I love it how people are complaining about players who take a knee and the flag, but then want to excuse what Russia has done.That is the real issue here.And what Mueller is doing is doing what a prosecutor should do, get to the truth.Remember, Whitewater started with one thing and ended with another.This is what happens when you go through a federal investigation.(CROSSTALK) KILMEADE: Why do you think that patriotism has something to do with admitting Trump is wrong?He doesn't think he is -- he doesn't think he's wrong.They don't believe he's wrong.There is no evidence he is wrong.So what is patriotic about saying something is wrong?MARTIN: Brian, this is a guy who will knowingly lie and not admit the truth, so whether he says that is irrelevant to me.The bottom line is this here, when you have a foreign country that is clearly, undeniably involved in our election, not just... (CROSSTALK) MARTIN: No, no, no.One second.One second.Excuse me.Excuse me.I'm not talking about that, I'm speaking of Facebook ads.I'm speaking of bots.I'm speaking of all of that.We all -- Brian, all Americans should -- all Americans should want the answer and not feeding partisanship.(CROSSTALK) FINNEY: There's one other thing, though, there's a pattern that we have seen time and time again in this administration.You start, you know, you'll see the president tweet about or say something, this week, it was, we need to release all of Hillary's emails, and we need to -- you know, kind of throwing the the smoke screen back on Hillary -- by the way, at some point, Donald Trump is going to have to be accountable for Donald Trump actually being the president.But then what ends up happening is -- and just before the news broke on Friday that Mueller was -- is close to actually bringing charges, I thought, what is it that's about to come out?Because this pattern we have seen before, every time there is about to be a new revelation in this investigation, leading right into that, we've got all this blowing of smoke and oh, it's about Hillary, or, oh, Obama wire-tapped me in Trump Tower.STEPHANOPOULOS: You saw it coming?FINNEY: Of course.KILMEADE: But Karen, you have it absolutely reversed.What happened over the last two or three days?Revelations now are out, thanks to Fusion GPS coming forward, prior to releasing their tax records, saying... FINNEY: It's been over a year.KILMEADE: No, they didn't, because it was denied by John Podesta.It was denied by the DNC chairman.(CROSSTALK) DOWD: Two shows in Vegas, misdirection.(CROSSTALK) DOWD: I'm sorry if you're frustrated.KILMEADE: The truth and timeline is actually important.All right, so let me finish and I will tell you the fact.You're ready for the facts.The facts is Tuesday, Wednesday, we get the revelations because GPS did not want to hand over their records about who financed their international probe in Trump Tower -- excuse me, into Russia.And then Tuesday, Wednesday it turns out $3.6 million for the Democrats -- because let me finish -- and then $6 million from Hillary Clinton's campaign, which he never admitted to before.So, this happens -- so this happens... (CROSSTALK) MARTIN: I just love this filibustering... (CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS: Hold on a second.I'm stopping this.There are two facts.Two facts about the dossier that we know.We know that it had nothing to do with the intelligence community's findings that Russia interfered with the election, absolutely nothing to do with that.And number two, we know that nothing in the dossier came out during the campaign, so it had no effect on the campaign.DOWD: Let me add one other fact, every single intelligence agency said not only did Russia interfere in our election, they were interfering on behalf of -- to get Donald Trump elected and Hillary defeated.The argument mat that has to be made on the dossier is that somehow Hillary Clinton and the Democrats contributed to her own defeat by what the Russians wanted by doing that.STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, we've got to take a quick break.When we come back, millions have taken to social media with the hashtag Me Too to share their stories of sexual harassment and assault.Powerful men facing the consequences.I'll speak with the activist who started the movement and a congresswoman who is trying to prevent sexual harassment on Capitol Hill.And we'll be back with The Roundtable as well.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) STEPHANOPOULOS: From those first accusations against Harvey Weinstein... (BEGIN VIDEO CLPI) KAREN SIVAN, REPORTER, KTTV: He stood in the doorway and he tried to kiss me.ASHLEY JUDD, ACTRESS: They said, he's in his room.And I was like, are you kidding me?That's his pattern of sexual predation.That was how he rolled.(END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: An explosion of stunning, sad, and shameful stories.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REESE WITHERSPOON, ACTRESS: A lot of feelings I've been having that anxiety about being honest and guilt for not for not speaking up earlier.ROSE MCGOWAN, ACTRESS: I have been slut-shamed.I have been harassed.I have been maligned.And you know what?I'm just like you.GABRIELLE UNION, ACTRESS: Literally hundreds of thousands of people, men and women, talking about being a part of this unfortunate club.(END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: Those voices tarnishing and taking down powerful men.The fallout spreading from Hollywood to corporate America to the media and Capitol Hill.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JACKIE SPEIER, (D) CALIGORNIA: The chief of staff held my face, kissed me, and stuck his tongue in my mouth.It's time to throw back the curtain on the repulsive behavior that, until now, has thrived in the dark without consequences.(END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: The question now, will this Me Too movement spark real change?I'm joined now by the woman who founded the Me Too movement a decade ago, Tarana Burke; and Democratic Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence.She has introduced legislation that would require all congressional offices to enroll in training to prevent sexual harassment.Thank you both for joining us this morning.And Tarana, let me begin with you.As I said, you founded this movement a decade ago, yet it's exploded over the last two weeks.Why did it take off now?And do you think it is going to produce real change?TARANA BURKE, FOUNDER, ME TOO MOVEMENT: Absolutely.I think it took off now obviously because of the magnitude of the names that are involved in the current sexual harassment scandal, so we have Hollywood actresses.We have producers.We have television hosts.And so, people are going to pay attention because pop culture is now right in the center of the controversy.STEPHANOPUOLOS: That's what is clearly what we have seen.And we also saw your colleague, Congresswoman Jackie Speier, share her own story.She calls Capitol Hill are breeding ground for a hostile work environment for far too long.Two questions, have you witnessed this during your tenure?And what difference will your legislation make?REP. BRENDA LAWRENCE, (D) MICHIGAN: One of the things that I found through my experience in private sector, being an equal employment opportunity investigator where I investigated claims of sexual harassment, is that you have to set a tone.You have to establish this benchmark of zero tolerance.And if we are making sexual harassment training optional, then what are we saying as an organization?Because we require all federal employees, it's mandatory, but on the Hill and the Capitol, it's optional.So, this is the first step of setting the tone of zero tolerance for sexual harassment.There are some people who actually believe that what I'm doing is OK. What the training does is says, it's not OK, that you, if you feel like you have been sexually harassed, you do have a process to go through.One of the things my colleagues, Congresswoman Speier, have said, is that we need to look that process, because it's not one that -- allows a person who feels like they've been sexually harassed to have a responsive and proactive response.STEPHANOPOULOS: And you see that.And you know this from your work in corporate America as well that women are afraid to come forward.We have heard from so many, including one after the Diane Sawyer interview that actually Ashley Judd called in to GMA.Listen.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) UNIDENTIFID FEMALE: This guy controls my schedule.If I don't make any money, I don't feed my kids.I have no face in this, I have no name.You know about me.But I'm still scared that he's going to find out or someone's going the find out that I've said something and then I lose my job, and I can't lose my job.(END AUDIO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: That's got to be the biggest obstacle.BURKE: It is.This is about power and privilege, right.Ultimately, sexual violence is about power, and sexual harassment is about the intersection of power and privilege.People feel helpless.There's always a question about why do the women not complain?Why don't they come forward?Because this is a great example of why.People's livelihoods are at stake, right.People's lives are at stake.And so you have to make a choice between do I deal with this uncomfortable thing that reduces my dignity or do I feed my children?STEPHANOPOULOS: One of the other things we've seen, as you talked about the high profile people that have come forward, the White House was of course asked about this, this week as well, because of the allegations against President Trump.Let's show that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Obviously, sexual harassment has been in the news.At least 16 women accused the president of sexually harassing them throughout the course of the campaign.Last week, the president called these accusations fake news.Is the special White House position that all these women are lying?SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECREATRY: Yeah, we've been clear on that from the beginning and the president has spoken on it -- John.(END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: All these women are lying, according the the White House.And I think a lot of people have questioned -- you see so many men fall, yet the president elected after all these revelations were known.LAWRENCE: Well, the good thing about Me Too is the sense of awareness, and it's giving reassurance and comfort to women to speak out, because it's going to be on the back of women and those who are sexually harassed to stop it, because as long as we are silent, it continues.And I -- I think it's -- it is very powerful.For the person who sits in the White House, to have behavior that he has admitted, and it's been documented, that is clearly sexual harassment, that is unacceptable behavior.And we're going to have to step up.I'm so proud of the Me Too movement.But it's a shame, because this has been going on for years.It takes high-profile women to bring attention to this, because what about the woman in the fast food restaurant who the only way she can feed her children -- it's that job or starvation for her family?And they're being subjected to this, as well.STEPHANOPOULOS: What is the most important thing to happen now?BURKE: There are a couple of things that have to happen.We have to have stronger legislation and stronger policy, that those things have to be enforced.And we also have to have ally-ship.It's on the backs of women.But it's on the backs of men.Men have to stand up.They have to be -- they have to be outspoken.It's like when you see something, say something.STEPHANOPOULOS: It's everyone's responsibility.Thank you both very much.BURKE: Thank you.LAWRENCE: Thank you.STEPHANOPOULOS: When we come back, Jeff Flake joined Bob Corker when he announced he was leaving the Senate with tough words for President Trump.What does it mean for the president and the GOP agenda?The Roundtable takes on that question next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JEFF FLAKE, (R) ARIZONA: Reckless, outrageous, and undignified behavior has become excused and countenanced as "telling it like it is."SEN. BOB CORKER, (R) TENNESSEE: I think the debasement of our nation will be what he'll be remembered most for, and that's regretful.FLAKE: There were those of us who had hoped for a pivot I think have agreed now it's just not going to come.And so it's up to us to stand up and say this is not acceptable.CORKER: He's obviously not going to -- to rise to the occasion as president.QUESTION: Do you think he's a role model to children in the United States?CORKER: No.QUESTION: You don't?CORKER: No, absolutely not.(END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: Big swipes at President Trump from two Republican senators calling it quits, so is that a sign that President Trump is actually tightening his grip on the GOP?The roundtable takes that on next.And for the latest politics any time, download the ABC News app and sign up for breaking news alerts.We will be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Well, I think all of us realize that, if we fail on taxes, that's the end of the Republican Party's governing majority in 2018.I can't imagine how he could be successful with Nancy Pelosi running the House.They would try to impeach him pretty quick.And it would be just one constant investigation after another.So, it's important that we pass tax reform in a meaningful way.If we don't, that's probably the end of the Republican Party as we know it.(END AUDIO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: Unvarnished words there from Senator Lindsey Graham actually on Brian Kilmeade's radio show.He's joining us here on the roundtable.(CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS: But I want to start with Katie Walsh Shields.So, you brought this up as well.You know the White House well.You worked there.And tax cuts really have become the glue that is holding the Republican Party together right now.KATIE WALSH SHIELDS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF: Absolutely.But it falls in line with everybody the president has done the last seven months.We're going to announce -- I think it was forecasted that we have 3 percent GDP in the third quarter.We've had that the last six months.It's the best nine-month stretch for the economy in three years.Unemployment is at an all-time low.The Dow is at an all-time high.So, it coincides with everything the president has been working on for nine months.And I think, when this gets done, we will have a very good story to tell in 2018.ROLAND MARTIN, HOST AND MANAGING EDITOR, "NEWSONE NOW": I'm waiting for that tweet: "Thank you, President Obama, few setting me up with a great economy."(LAUGHTER) MARTIN: You know what I'm saying?You can't deny it.(CROSSTALK) MARTIN: But here's the thing with what Graham said that people have to understand.And Democrats are running around saying, oh, my God, the possibility here.The fact of the matter is, the Republican Party is not imploding.When you control 31 governor's mansions, when you control legislatures, House, Senate, and the White House, more importantly the judiciary, you're not imploding.Yes, you have these internal fights, but this is about power.This is not about principles or character or moral and values.They want to maintain power.Trump is the vessel that allows them to do so.And so they will fall in line.Jeff Flake, that wasn't courageous, what he did.STEPHANOPOULOS: He was going to lose.MARTIN: Courageous is to still run.Courageous is to say, I'm going campaign around Arizona and speak the truth, and, if I lose, that's fine.I'm not giving anybody props for giving a speech and cutting and running.No, you stand up and you stay in the office and you challenge them.That's how you do it.But people have to stop thinking the Republican Party is dead.They're not.And when you see things happening in North Carolina, what is sadistic, what they're doing, what is undemocratic, in Wisconsin, those states, we ignore what is happening in these states.Texas, five times they have lost in the federal courts over voter I.D., costs $3 million.It's real what they're doing in states.STEPHANOPOULOS: And that corresponds to Congress as well.Let me bring this to Brian Kilmeade.The president does command strong majorities in the House right now.They're staying behind him right now, most Republican senators as well.The problem is, no one really knows what is inside this tax bill.BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS: Right.And I think -- what I think is encouraging if you're a Republican is the fact that the House and Senate and White House have been meeting behind closed doors before they rolled it out.So, they know a lot of details.They're timing it for the right time when they come out.There's some disagreements.But back to your original question, the reason Lindsey Graham is talking in cataclysmic fashion, because he knows it's going to pass.Know why?Not because of President Trump.It's because each individual lawmaker is on the clock in 2018, whether you're going to be up in a little while, or you're going be up in 2018 or 2020.They have to do something, or else they have nothing to run on.So, they're not doing it for President Trump.They're not even doing it for their party.They're doing it for their own careers.That's why I think it will get done.KAREN FINNEY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: And that's the problem with the Republican Party, I think, that is bearing out this year.I mean, they control everything.They can't get health care done.There wasn't even a plan.It's like the emperor is not wearing any clothes.And if they can't even get this tax thing done, then they really have nothing to run.And I agree with that.KILMEADE: So, you kind of agree with me.FINNEY: At the same time, however, I think that this is a moral test the for the Republican Party.And I think they are going to fail, unfortunately, because in order to get this tax deal done, from everything that we have heard, it is going to add to the deficit.Now, the Republicans have always said, we don't -- that's something that they didn't want to do.So, it's not going to actually bring tax relief to the middle class.It is actually, from what we know, going to help the top 1 percent.I think it's if you make over $733,000 a year, you are actually going to benefit from this plan.And so what does that say about what the Republican Party is really all about?MATTHEW DOWD, ABC NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: To me, so, I -- be careful what you wish for.This is just like much of the pressure that the Obama administration put on the Democrats in Congress in 2009, said, you have got to pass something.We need to have something to run on.They pass Obamacare, and they lose almost every single office.And this -- this tax bill to me right now, all the polls show it's very unpopular, the elements that we know.Eighty percent of the benefits of this tax bill go to the top 1 percent of the country.So, it's not going to help the working class, those voters that are going to decide this election.But I think, fundamentally, Lindsey Graham is wrong about one thing.One, the Republicans hold all the levers of power in this.I think he's wrong that the Republican Party, whether or not they pass this tax bill, is dead.The Republican Party as we know it, the party of Ronald Reagan, the party of George W. Bush, is gone.The party now is the Donald Trump party.Eighty percent or 85 percent of the Republican voters, regardless of what the Republicans say in Washington that walk around the halls of the Capitol Hill and say what they think the Republican Party is, that party is long gone.And they have to come to terms with the idea, this is the Trump-Steve Bannon party that is more welcoming to somebody like Roy Moore than it is to somebody like Jeff Flake.MARTIN: And, George, what they have to accept is that you have this alliance, alliance of white conservative evangelicals aligning with white nationalists, white supremacists like Gorka and like Bannon.And what is interesting to me is, I'm looking at all these Trump voters, and I'm going, at what point will you wake up and realize you're getting screwed?Not just... WALSH SHIELDS: They're not getting screwed.MARTIN: One second.One second.They're getting screwed when you look at Affordable Care Act, because they're benefiting from it.They're getting screwed when this man stood up and talked about the opioid crisis, and the most he did this week was hold a press conference to say, we're going to have a few more ads.They're going to screwed on the tax deal as well.Look, broke is broke.And some of the brokest, poorest counties in America, two-thirds of them are in Republican districts.They're going to get screwed.Watch it happen.WALSH SHIELDS: Roland, I don't know how you possibly say these people are getting screwed.Unemployment is at an all-time low.National Association of Manufacturers has come out and said, if this tax cut goes through, more people will hire -- jobs.In 2 -- I'm sorry -- in 2003, I think, in President Bush's tax cut, in the next five years, 7.8 million jobs happened.(CROSSTALK) FINNEY: But then we take a big dip.(CROSSTALK) MARTIN: And those same people -- and those same people... WALSH SHIELDS: When these people have jobs, when their -- when their pocketbooks are better, when, hopefully, we pass repeal, replace, and their premiums go down again, these people will vote for the president again.(CROSSTALK) MARTIN: That means nothing if you're dying from opioids.(CROSSTALK) FINNEY: We're going take a big hit in the economy.There may be an initial bump.WALSH SHIELDS: Based on what, Karen?Based on what?Who is telling you that?FINNEY: There have been a number of studies that came out this week that looked at -- actually, quite frankly... (CROSSTALK) WALSH SHIELDS: I have not seen one.(CROSSTALK) FINNEY: I will bring them up right here.(CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS: I have got to interrupt, because President Trump actually has tweeted about Russia and the dossier.FINNEY: Well, there you go.STEPHANOPOULOS: It didn't -- it didn't last."Never seen such Republican anger, unity as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton-made fake dossier.Now $12 million."(LAUGHTER) STEPHANOPOULOS: So much for the discipline.KILMEADE: Right.You know, I would like to get back -- so let's talk about tax reform.(LAUGHTER) (CROSSTALK) KILMEADE: I have just got to say a couple of things.Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka, white supremacists, I have never met Steve Bannon, but Sebastian Gorka, absolutely not.I don't think Steve -- I think that's a -- that is a -- that is statement that I think is repugnant (CROSSTALK) MARTIN: Excuse me.(CROSSTALK) MARTIN: Now, look, Brian, Brian, Brian, Brian, when you say Breitbart is the home of the alt-right, which aligns with white supremacists, I'm trying to -- and what we saw in Charlottesville, don't you dare try to cover this thing up.KILMEADE: I'm not covering anything up.They're not white supremacists.And you have got to watch that term.That is a term that is a new buzz term.(CROSSTALK) MARTIN: No, actually, white supremacist is not a new buzz term.It's older than America.(CROSSTALK) MARTIN: ... the beginning of America.KILMEADE: Can I just finish up on the tax reform?Matt, I'm not -- I don't know what you mean the little people are getting screwed.I will give you -- from what we know.. (CROSSTALK) DOWD: I didn't say that.I said 80 percent of the benefits of the tax bill are going to the top 1 percent.KILMEADE: Well, but the top 10 percent... (CROSSTALK) KILMEADE: I will give you an example.I will just give an example of how -- from what we know, George -- and you're right, we don't know everything.From what we know, if you make $12,000 a year right now, you're being taxed.Under his plan, under -- you're not taxed up until $24,000 a year.So, that right there helps people that are trying... (CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS: No one who makes $12,000 pays an income tax.(CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS: They're not paying taxes.(CROSSTALK) KILMEADE: There's now multiple tax codes.DOWD: I think the Trump people and the Republicans can talk about the stock market and they can talk about the job rate.But there's no relationship between the perception of Donald Trump and the perception of the Republicans and what is going on in the economy.There's no relationship.Donald Trump -- Donald Trump is disapproved of by 60 percent of the country.(CROSSTALK) WALSH SHIELDS: President Trump -- President Trump was the same guy in the last 25 years, he would argue, as he is today.And he was elected November 2016 between people wanted... (CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS: We're going hit the computer.We're out of time.(LAUGHTER) STEPHANOPOULOS: But I know you guys have a lot more to say.(LAUGHTER) STEPHANOPOULOS: Thank you very much.We will be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) STEPHANOPOULOS: The roundtable is still talking here, but we're out of time.(LAUGHTER) STEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks for spending part of your Sunday with us.Check out "World News Tonight."And we will see you tomorrow on "GMA."

Dowd: GOP must 'come to terms' with being Trump, Bannon party Video:::::Transcript for Dowd: GOP must 'come to terms' with being Trump, Bannon party I think all of us realize that if we fail on taxes, that's the end of the Republican party's governing majority in 2018.I can't man how he could be successful with Nancy Pelosi running the house.They would try to impeach him pretty quick.It would be one constant investigation after another.So it's important that we pass tax reform in a meaningful way.If we don't, that's probably the end of the Republican parent as we know it.Unvarnished word there is from Lindsey graham, actually on Brian kilmeade's show.We want to start with Kate Walsh shields.You know the white house well.Tax cuts have become the glue that is holding the Republican party together right now.Absolutely.It falls in line with everybody the president has done in the last few months.We have had 3% gdp in the last six months.Unemployment at an all-time low.The Dow at an all-time high.I think when this gets done, swrooel a very good story to tell in 2018.I'm waiting for the tweet, thank you, president Obama few setting me up.Here's the thing with what graham sid that people have to understand.Democrats are running around saying, the possibility here.The fact of the matter is, the Republican party is not implo imploding.You control 31 governor's mansions.House, senate, the white house.The judiciary.You're not imploding.Yeah you have internal fights.This is about power.Not principles, character, morals, values.They want to maintain power.Trump is the vessel that allows them to do so.So they'll fall in line.Jeff flake, that wasn't courageous what he did.He was going to lose.Courageous is to still run.I'm going campaign and speak the truth, if I lose, that's fine.I'm not giving anybody props for giving a speech and cutting and running.You stay in the office and challenge them.The Republican party is not dead.You see what is happening in North Carolina.Hat is sadistic.Undemocratic.Wisconsin.We ignore what is happening in these states.Texas, five times they lost in federal courts over voter I.D.It's real what they're doing in states.Let me bring this to Brian kilmeade.The president does Chand strong lead this is the house.No one really knows somewhat many the tax bill.I think what I think is encouraging if you're a Republican is the fact that the house, senate, white house, have been meetding behind closed doors.They know a lot of details.Back to your question, the the reason Lindsey graham is talking in cat cliz mingic fashion is he knows it will pass.Not because of president trump.It's because each individual lawmaker is on the clock.In 2018.Whether you're going on to be up in a little while, or 2018, or 2020.Nay have to do something.Or else they have nothing to run on.They're not doing it for president trump.Not doing it for their party.They're doing it for their own careers.That's why I think lit get done.That's the problem with the Republican party that is pearing out this year.They control everything.They can't get health care done.There wasn't plan.It's like the emperor wasn't wearing any clothes.If they can't get this tax thing done they have nothing to run.I agree with you.At the same time, however, I think this is a mort test the for the Republican party.And I think they'll fail, unfortunately.In order to bet the tax deal done, from everything we have heard, lit add to the deficit.The Republicans have said that's something hay didn't want to do.So it won't bring tax relief to the middle class.It will help the top 1%.Think it's if you make over $733,000 a year, you'll benefit from this plan.And, so, what does that say about what the Republican party is really all about?To me, so, this be careful what you wish for.This is like much of the pressure that the Obama administration put on the Democrats in congress in 2009 and say, you have to pass something.They pass Obamacare and lose almost every single office.This tax bill, the polls show, the it's very unpopular.80% of the benefits go the top 1% in the country.It's not going to help the working class.The voters who will decide this election.Think Lindsey graham is wrong about one thing.The Republicans hold all the levers of party.I think he's wrong that the president party is dead.The Republican party as we know it.The party of Ronald Reagan.George W. Bush, is gone.The party is now the Donald Trump party.80% of the Republican voters.Regardless of what those in Washington say what they think the Republican party is, that party is long gone.They have to come to terms with the idea, this is the trump, Steve Bannon party that is more welcoming to someone like Roy Moore than it is to someone like Jeff flake.George they have to accept you have this alliance of white conservative nationalists.What is interesting to me, I'm look at the trump voters.I'm going, at what point will you wake up and realize you're getting screwed?Not just -- one second.One second.They're getting screwed when you look at affordable care act because they're benefiting from it.They're getting screwed when this man talk about the opioid crisis and the most he did this week was to have a press conference.Broke the broke.And some of the brokest, poorest counties in America, two-thirds of them are in Republican districts.They're going to get screwed.Watch it happen.I don't know how you can say that.Unemployment is at at an all-time low.In 2003, I think, president bush's tax cut, the next five year, 7.8 million jobs happened.In those same people -- These people have jobs.When their pocketbooks are better.Hopefully, we pass repeal and replace.Their premiums go down.That mean nothing if you're dying of opioids.We're going take a big hit in the economy.Based on what?Who is telling you that?A number of studies came out.Actually, frankly -- I've not seen one.I'll bring them up here.I have to interrupt.President trump has tweeted.It didn't last.Never essential such Republican anger and unity as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made fake dossier.Now $12 million.So let's talk about tax reform.I have to say calm of things.Steve Bannon and se baas Ya Gorka white supremacissupremacists?I don't think so.That is a statement that I think is -- Excuse me.Brian, Brian.When you say Breitbart is the home of the alt-right.I'm trying to -- we saw in charlottesville, don't you dare try to cover this thing up.I'm not covering anything up.They're not white supremacists.You have to watch that term.It's a new buzz term.Actually, it's not a new buzz term.It's owned America since the beginning of America.I don't know what you mean the little people are getting screwed.I said 80% of the benefits of the tax bill are going to the top 10%.The top 10%.That's what the -- I'll give you an example.An example of how from what we know, George, you're right.We don't know everything.If you make $12,000 a year right now, you're being taxed.Under his plan, you're not taxed up to $24,000 a year.Is there no one makes $1,000 and pays an income tax.There a multiple tax codes.I think the trump people and the Republicans can talk about the stock market.The job rate.There's no relationship between the perception of Donald Trump and the perception of the Republicans and what is going on in the economy.Donald Trump is disapproved of by 60% of the country.President trump was the same guy in the last 25 years, he would argue as he is today.Decide elections in -- We're going hit the computer.We're out of time.I know you have a lot more to say.Thank you very much.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

thing.This is going far into 2018.Which is a problem for the Republicans to have an investigation on.And Kate, you left the white house before this investigation heated up.Sit your sense they have figured out way to compartmentalize the investigation?As the Clinton campaign did?Yes.They're focused on tax cuts.They're going to make sure they get tax cuts for the American public.The president hasn't spoken about this in the last 48 hours since this leak came out.I think you'll see the white house continue to talk about hole.ING the American public.We have seen the discipline from the president.He just tweeted about Obamacare.Not the Russian investigation.Earlier in the week, Karen finney, you saw the tweets saying collusion now between the Clintons and the Russians.And also, we did learn that the Clintons' lawyer, mark Elias did fund dossier.It came from an American company.That we had -- had originally been funded by Republicans.As you mentioned earlier.I think what's important, though, is less who founded it and what was in the dossier.And as you heard Adam Schiff talk about, a number of the things in the dossier have been V verified.I think regardless, with the announcement about Mueller, what's important is we know there are multiple other reasons there is an investigation.There is a question of obstruction of justice in the firing of Jim Comey.The questions about Carter page.Michael Flynn.Paul manafort.Their communications and meetings with the Russians.Cambridge analytica.They reached out to Julian assange this week.The more it goes on, we learn -- it keeps xwroeing.That is part of the problem.As we also learn that, some folks at the Kremlin actually weighed in on the memo that was part of the June 16 memo."The New York Times" report.According to Democrats, it's not fake news.There's a lot there.To your question, if someone is marched in Monday, tomorrow, and it is something to do directly with the campaign, I think it's one thing.If it's something about Paul manafor the T and what he did before becoming part of the trump campaign.So, I would -- to the gps situation.We found out it's not a candidate.It was Paul sirng and his free baeken.We found out he was looking at two candidates in particular.He stopped the investigation as soon as Donald Trump locked up the nomination.As soon as he did that, he goes, okay, let's see what happens from the Republican perspective.Then we find out that somebody else picks up the investigation, makes it international.There's a Russian element.There was no Russian element to the free beacon-financed research.Then we're supposed to think that John podesta has no idea that $6 million to $9 million is going out of the campaign, his lawyer says, oh, yeah, I approved that.You're the lawyer sitting next to a client pretending he doesn't know.As Karen knows.Roland knows.I've been highly critical for Hillary Clinton for a long period of time.I think all of us know that.I have to say, we need to give up the David copperfield or Harry houdini award for misdirection in this thing.This reminds me of the uranium deal that's been debunked all along the way.There is no similarity between what Robert Mueller and what the Russians wanted to do and a dossier paid for in part by the Democrats in order to -- Matt, why would you think that?There's no Russian Yan relationship between the dossier and the Democrats.Here is what is laughable.We literally watch a campaign, of folks chant lock her up, that we can have a president under investigation, and hewe're here right now.Will Republicans put patriotism above partisanship.Will conservative media folks speak truth or defend trump at any and all costs.I love how people are complaining about players taking a knee and the flag and excusing what was done.Get to the truth.Whitewater started with one thing and end with another.This is what happens when you go through a federal investigation.Why does patriotism have smz too with trump admitting he's wrong?In is a guy who will knowingly lie and not admit the truth.So what whether he says it, it's relevant to me.The bottom line is this, when you have a foreign country that is clearly, undeniably involved in our election.No, no, no.One second.Excuse me.Excuse me.I'm not talking about that.I'm speaking of Facebook ads.Bots.All of that.We all -- Brian, all Americans should -- all Americans should want the answer and not failing partisanship.Brian lp let Karen get in here.There's a pattern that we have seen time and time again in this administration.You start, you know, you'll see the president tweet about or say something, this week, it was, we need to release all of Hillary's e-mails.Throwing the the smoke screen back on Hillary.By the way, at some point, Donald Trump is going to have to be accountable for Donald Trump the president.Just before the news broke on Friday that Mueller was -- is close to actually bringing charges, I thought, what is it that's about to come out?This pattern we have seen before.Every time there is about to be a new revelation in this investigation, leading right into that, we've got all this blowing of smoke and oh, it's about Hillary.Or, oh, Obama wire-tapped me in trump tower.You saw it coming?Of course.You visit absolutely reversed.What happened over the last three days.Revelations are out, thanks to fusion gps coming forward, prior to releasing their tax records, saying -- It's been over a year.No, they haven't.It was denied by John podesta.The DNC.Two shows in Vegas.Misdirection.Hold on.I'm sorry if you're frustrated.I'm not frustrate FPD truth is imprtant, Brian.Let me finish.I'll tell you the facts.Tuesday, Wednesday, we get the revelations because gps did not want to hand over their records about who financed their international probe into Russia.Tuesday, Wednesday, $3.6 million from the Democrats.And $6 million from Hillary Clinton's campaign.I want to get two facts.So this happens.I love this filibustering scam.He's petty cute, Brian.I do consider myself cute.Brian, hold on a second.I'm stopping this.There are two facts.Two facts at the dossier that we know.We know that it had nothing to do with the intelligence community's findings that Russia interfered with the election.Absolutely nothing to do with that.Number two, we know that nothing in the dossier came out during the campaign.So it had no effect on the campaign.Every intelligence agency said not only did the Russians interveer, they were intersphering to get trump elected and Hillary Clinton defeated.The argument mat that has to be made is that somehow Hillary Clinton and the Democrats contributed to her own defeat.Millions have taken to This transcript has been

Questions surround first charges in Muller probe Video:::::Transcript for Questions surround first charges in Muller probe We're going get reaction from Adam Schiff and New Jersey vernor Chris Christie, a trump ally, who was also a federal prosecutor.First from our ABC team.Reporter: The special counsel's team sought charges against at least one unidentified target.An indictment announcement and arrest could come possibly as early as Monday.A spokesman is E declining to comment.We don't yet have any specifics on who would be charged or what those charges might be.What we do know is that the special counsel team is investigating whether tluz tl was collusion between officials for then candidate Donald Trump.Mule sir looking into the financial dealings of a number of key associates, including former campaign manager Paul manafort and former adviser Michael Flynn.No response from people close to Michael Flynn.While it's unclear how significant these first charges will be, it does send a clear message that prosecutors believe a crime has been committed.And shows everyone involved probably needs to take stock that this is a serious matter, George.It means all eyes will be on the court hours tomorrow morning at 9:00 A.M. Let's bring in our seen your white house correspondent, Cecilia Vega.They seemed to be blind sided?Yes.We know the president's legal team has been busy meeting and making phone calls.And the president's lawyers and aides still have no idea who this is.There's a lot of guessing Happ happening behind the scenes.Are people nervous in aides have obtained lawyers.The president is picking up the tab for some of that.Everyone I've been speaking to expects to be brought in at some point for interviews and what not.Even with the big development, I don't expect the standard response on this to change.They maintain this is a witch hunt.The president talks about that a lot.And as it relates to who funded the controversial Russian dossier back in the news, they say the focus should be on Democrats and Hillary Clinton.We remember the president's former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, he calls the the speculation about Mueller's charges, quote, insane.That gives you a good idea of what they're thinking.So far, from the president himself.No public reaction.No tweets.Not yet any way.Let's bring if chief legal analyst Dan Abrams.Why would something like this be kept secret?Typically, because you don't want the defendant to know.To try to destroy evidence.You don't want potential co-defendants to act out.It is specifically targeting the person who is going the be arrested and saying, we don't want this person to know.And when we find out who that person is that will reveal a fair amount about Mueller's strategy.The big question is, is the strategy to first go for a little fish to try to get that person to turn.Typically, that's what you would do.You first try to indict.Put pressure on a smaller fish in an effort to get that person to turn and testify against a bigger one.But this is complicated by the fact that in this case, the president has pardon powers.And as a result, the rules go out the window.The fact that the president can pardon any of these people on the federal crime means they can be thinking, feeling, you know what, if I get indicted.That's okay.I'm not going to respond to the pressure from the federal authorities.The way that someone ordinarily would because I know that I'm ultimately going to get pardoned.That's going to be a really big question both for Mueller's team and the potential defendants.Thank you, Dan.Let's bring in a man who has This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Lawmaker introduces Congressional Sexual Harassment Training Act Video:::::Transcript for Lawmaker introduces Congressional Sexual Harassment Training Act They said, he's in his room.I was like, are you kidding me?That's his pattern of sexual predigs a.That's how he rolled.An explosion of stories.A lot of feelings I've been having about anxiety and not being honest.The guilt for not speaking up earlier.I have been slut-shamed.I have been harassed.I have been maligned.And you know what?I'm just like you.Literally hundreds of thousand os of people, men and women, talking about being a part of this unfortunate club.Those voices tarnishing and taking down powerful men.The fallout spreading from Hollywood to corporate America, the media and capitol hill.The chief of staff held my face, kissed me, and stuck his tongue in my mouth.It's time to throw back the curtain on the repulsive behavior that, until now, has thrived in the dark without consequences.The question now, whether this me, too, movement spark real change?I'm joined by the woman ho founded it a decade ago, tarana bur Burke.And rep Brenda Lawrence.Thank you both for joining us.Tarana, let me begin with you.You founded this a decade ago.Tths exploded.Why did it take off now?Do you think lit produce real change?Absolutely.I think it took off now obviously because of the magnitude of the names involved.In the current sexual harassment scandal.We have Hollywood actresses.Producers.We have television hosts.And so, people are going to pay attention because pop culture is now right in the center of the controversy.That's what is clearly we have seen.We saw your colleague, congresswoman Jackie Speier share her own story.Have you witnessed this during your tenure?And what difference will your legislation make?One of the things I found through my experience in private sector.Being an equal employment opportunity investigator.I investigated claims of sexual harassment.You have to set a tone.You have to establish a benchmark of zero tolerance.The we're making sexual Har rasment training option nal, then, what are we saying as an organization?We require all federal employees, it's mandatory.But on the hill and the capitol, it's option nal.There are some people who actually believe what I'm doing is okay.What the training does is says, it's not okay.That you, if you feel like you have been sexually harassed, you do have a process to go through.One of the things my colleagues, kopgwoman spears have said, is that we need to look that process.It's not one that -- allows a person who feels like they've been sexually harassed to have a responsive and proactive response.You see this.You know this from your work in corporate America.Women are afraid to come forward.We have heard from so many.Including one called in to "Gma" after the ash hi Judd.This guy controls my schedule.If I don't make any money, I don't feed my kids.I have no face in this.I have no name.You know about me.I'm still skab scared that he's going to find out or someone's going the find out that I've said something and then I lose my job.And I can't lose my job.That's gotta be the biggest obstacle.It is.This is about power and privilege.Sexual violence is about power.Sexual harassment abis about the intersection of power and privilege.There's always a question about why don't women come forward?People's livelihoods and lives are at stake.Do you deal with this uncomfortable thing that dereduces my dignity or do I feed my children?The white house was asked about this.Let's show that.Obviously, sexual harassment has been in the news.At least 16 women accused the president of sexually harassing them throughout the course of the campaign.Last week, the president called these accusations fake news.Is the special white house position that all these women are lying?Yeah, we've been clear on that from the beginning.The president has spoken on it.John?All these women are lying, according the the white house.I think a lot of people have questioned.You see so many men fall.The president elected after all these revelations were known.The good thing about me too is the sense of awareness.It's giving reassurance and comfort to women to speak out.It's going to be on the back of women and those who are sexually harassed to stop it.Because as long as we are silent, it continues.And I -- I think it's -- it is very powerful.For the person who sits in the white house, to have behavior that he has admitted and it's been documented, that is clearly sexual harassment.That is unacceptable behavior.And we're going to have to step up.I'm so proud of the me too movement.Was it's a shame.Because this has been going on for years.It takes high-profile women to bring attention to this.Because what about the woman in the fast food restaurant?Ho the only way she can feed her children.It's that job or starvation for her family.And they're being subjected to this, as well.What is the most important thing to happen now.A couple of things have to happen.We have to have stronger legislation and policy.Those things have to be enforced.We have to have ally-ship.It's on the backs of women.But it's on the backs of men.Men have to stand up.When you see something, say something.It's everyone's responsibility.Thank you both very much.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100%

Russia investigation seeks first charges Video:::::Transcript for Russia investigation seeks first charges New developments overnight in Washington.Sources confirming to ABC news that special counsel Robert Mueller and his team have field the first indictment in the Russia investigation.Who could be the target?David Wright is at the white house.Good morning to you.Reporter: Good morning, Dan and Cecilia, this white house is girding for battle this morning.They know that the first indictment is likely to drop tomorrow in the Russia probe.And like us, they're not sure who is about to be charged.Call it ruche Yan roulette.The first criminal charges imminent in the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion by trump associates.We didn't win because of Russia.We won because of you.Reporter: ABC news has confirmed that a senior prosecutor from Robert Mueller's office, who specializes in fraud cases, was at the federal courthouse in Washington Friday, where the grand jury was in session.Mueller's team field papers with the court.And sources tell ABC news an arrest could come as soon as tomorrow.But who?The special counsel's office declines to say.ABC news reached out to former trump campaign chair Paul manafort's legal team.They say he has no indication that any charges against him could be imminent.We reached out to former national security adviser Mike Flynn's team.No spont.The president himz as long dismissed the investigation as a politically motivated witch hunt.The whole Russia thing was an excuse for the Democrats.Reporter: His allies are on the warpath.Former campaign director Corey Lewandowski on "Fox & friends."The speculation is so insane.We should be focused on the lied of the Clinton administration.Reporter: Roger stone took to Twitter to call out CNN.His language so derogatory, and in some cases, homophobic, that Twitter suspended him.In an interview with "The new York Times" before news of the indictm-nt broke, the white house lawyer said the president is not worried.The president has no concerns in terms of any impact as to what happens to them on his campaign or on the white house.Reporter: Again, that interview given before news of this indictment broke.As for Roger stone, he's taking his Twitter suspension as a badge of honor.Texting our own Katherine folders overnight saying sometimes the stark truth offends some people.And stone vowed terminator style, I'll be back.Dan and Cecilia?I'm sure he will.He will.David, thank you.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
Rep. Adam Schiff on Russia investigation Video:::::Transcript for Rep. Adam Schiff on Russia investigation Get to it.Let's bring in congressman Adam Schiff.Good morning.The it your conclusion that the president is not under ind vest gags?I can't comment.I can't answer it one way or the other.You wouldn't know if Robert Mueller is investigating the president?I can't comment on that at all.What is your reaction to the news there may be a sealed indictment?Well, I think two people from press reporting it is likely to be.Either Mike Flynn or Paul manafort.We haven't been informed.I don't think it would be appropriate for Bob muler to tell us.If it is Paul manafort, it may help us answer one very central question in the investigation.That is, we know that the Russian government, through intermediaries, was reaching out to the trump campaign.To Paul manafort and others.Offering information on Hillary Clinton they thought would help the trump campaign.That the campaign was willing and ak cemented that idea.We know from "The Washington post" reporting, contemporaneously to that, Paul manafort is reaching out to Russia.Offering information in exchange for money.Money he felt was ohhed to him for working for a pro-russia party.The fact that these requests are moving in opposite directions, and what information would Mr. Manafort have to offer the Russians?What would the president do on sapgss?That would be the most important information.If it is him, it may help us answer those questions.How about this question of the president's pardon power?And whether or not it would be appropriate for him to issue preemptive pardons before a trial.Well, the arpaio pardon was a horrible precedent.That case wasn't finished.The president sent a message, I won't wait until the criminal cases are over to issue a pardon.I don't think the president's power is all that absolute.The president can't pardon people if it's an effort to obstruct justice.If it's an effort to keep Bob Mueller and others from that.It would have the effect of nullifying vast portions of the constitution.The president could tell people to violate the law.If they did and it was brought up, they were brought up on charges, he would pardon them.One principle of constitutional interpretation is that you don't have one power override all the others.I think we also learned this week that the DNC and the Clinton campaign, through their attorney, helped fund this fusion gps effort to create this dossier, this so-called dossier on whether the trump campaign was cluding with the Russians.We know that the Washington free beacon was paying fusion gps as well.This has now become a subject for congress.Congressional investigations.Along with another investigation back in 2010 in the U.S.Uranium industry.The justice department saying will is collusi there is collusion on both sides.We have known it began as a Republican effort.It was later picked up by the Democrats.So none of that is all that surprising.I think that is a factor to be considered in weighing the credibility of what fusion gps produced.Who was paying for it.Should it have been disclosed earlier?I can't answer that.I certainly would have liked to have known who paid for it earlier.Nonetheless, that's just one factor to be considered.It doesn't answer the ultimate question, how much of the work is accurate if how much of it is true?My colleagues don't seem interested in that question.That is the most important question for the American people.How much of this allegation that -- steel makes the the reports that he hears, are true about the Russian government wanting to help the trump campaign.A lot of that has been corroborated.I wanted to ask that.There are some things in the dossier proven to be untrue.Michael KO Cohen according to his passport wasn't in Prague.What do you believe to be proven?Christopher steel may have found out before our intelligence agencies that the Russians were, in fact, aiming to help Donald Trump in the election.That has been borne out from ample evidence from individual sources and the social media campaign.Very demonstrably pro-trump, anti--clinton.That central conclusion has been borne out.The question we continue to investigate is, was the campaign coordinating in the Russian help?That remains to be seen.There's certainly evidence that is highly suggest I have of that, in terms of the meeting in trump tower.I want to say this on the uranium one situation.If the president weighed in with the justice department to get that investigation going by ordering them to lift the gag rule.The white house said don mcgan did.If members are congress are willing to cover for that or worse, become complicit in that, and that was the word Jeff flake used, in what I think is the most significant speech in congress in the 17 years I have been there.If we allow ourselves to become complicit.By intervening with a gag rule.Interviewing U.S.Attorneys in New York who may oversee potential prosecutions of the president's interests.By picking someone, confirming someone nominated to head the criminal division of the justice department who happens to be the lawyer for alpha bank, we become complicit in that kind of conduct, we'll have to answer to history.It does appear Republicans and Democrats are work at cross purposes.Has the congressional inve gags, in your committee, become a side shoe?It's not a side show.We continue the hard work of getting to the bottom of what happened.We faced serious obstacles.Many of them go back to our chairman.Who, I think, all too often, has been willing to further the work and the viewpoint of the white house.Irrespective of what we're finding in the investigation.That sun helpful.Nonetheless, many of us continue to review the documents, interview the witnesses.It's still my hope that we can come to a common conclusion.But, it has been tough.I won't -- I won't deny that for a minute.Congressman Schiff, thank you for your time this morning.Thanks, George.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
One-on-one with Gov. Chris Christie Video:::::Transcript for One-on-one with Gov.Chris Christie Thank you, Dan.Let's bring in a man who has prosecuted cases.Governor Chris Christie.One thing that dad said.That is a Normal course of things.When you're going after the smaller fish to get the bigger fish, you usually don't charge them.That stuff is working behind the scenes.You want to keep that smaller fish having turned secret.It helps them to be able the to gather more information.Sometimes they can wear a wire for you.Sometimes they can gather information where, if they're quiet, you're Goin get it.If everyone knows they're charged, they're going to be treated like they're radio active.No one wants to be near them.He's approaching this as a Normal case with discreet type of charges that may wind up intersecting.May not.Not keeping it all together for a big report like Ken Starr did.To you agree with Dan on why this is being kept secret?First off, it's supposed to be kept secret.Let's remember, too, Dan knows this.There are very strict criminal laws about disclosing grand jury information.Depending upon who disclosed this to CNN, it could be a crime.Do you think it's Mueller's team?I would hope not.We emphasized that.Let me tell you something.We'll prosecute you if we find out you leaked this stuff.We have to have the public's confidence many the fact that the jan jugrand jury system is secret and fair.If you're leaking stuff, it happens, but you shouldn't be doing it.We don't know who leaked it.If defense lawyers leaked it, it could not be -- Anybody been before the grand jury can talk about.Right.But the people that went before the grand jury wouldn't know there are charges.I think what is important is what we don't know.We don't know who this person is.Whathe charges are.We don't know anything except that there's a report that someone says there will be charges on Monday and there is a sealed indictment.Once that happens, we'll have more to react to.The one thing that is clear here, I heard someone say, are people nervous?Believe me, if you're the person, you know.I mean, you have already been told you're a target.Your lawyers, they have to advise you of your status as to whether you're a target.If you're told you're a target, believe me.You're not sleeping any way.How about this notion that the president has pardon power.There's been some talk that the president might issue preemptive pardons of Mueller targets.Before a trial.Would that be appropriate?I have never seen the president say anything like that.If anybody is sitting around thinking I don't have to worry about anything, because the president will pardon me, they should talk to scooter Libby.Others who thought they were going to be pardoned.All the people involved in watergate.And the pardons they thought they were going to be getting from president Nixon.They're still waiting.Right?That's a very important power to use.I think we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves.Certain lirks those people shouldn't be sitting around saying, no problem.They'ring look at sheriff arpaio.It's a different circumstance.I think it is.But they're saying he's ready, willing, and able to use the pardon power.The president pardoning someone here would be explosive the.It's a big step.I think the other important thing for people to remember is that the last public word was that the president himself was not under investigation.How do we know that?We know that the white house chief of staff, former white house chief of staff reince Priebus has been interviewed.I used to love.When I was U.S. Attorney, the greatest part of my job was, only I know what I know.Everybody speculates.Everybody outside speculates.Some of it is educated speculate speculation.Like Dan and ire involved in.We have experience.I think in the end, we would both be willing to admit, we have no idea.How about Robert Mueller?On Friday, you seemed to suggest he could step aside.I said if certain facts come out regarding his involvement in other matters, he would have to look ate.He has an obligation and I think a heightened obligation to be evaluating all the time new facts that come in.Do they put him in a compromised position?If they do he has to recuse.The public is already nervous about this.The attorney general of the United States has recused himself from it.The justice system is not working how it normally does.If there are questions about director Mueller.You haven't seen that yet.No.No.I said on Friday if certain facts develop on whether it's his relationship with director Comey or other issues, he has to think about that.You're the chair of the president's open Youd commission.He took your suggestion to declare it an emergency.He's taking some criticism for not saying, I need this much money.It think it will be a subject of conversation with congress.I think the president has to sit down with congress and congress has to put this money in.The public health energy fund has only $57,000 in it it's time to fund that.You're going see this president initially ask for bills of dollars to deal with this.The other thing people need to know.I want to bring up briefly.He talk about changing the medicaid rules.Said he's going to.That is going to open up thousands of medicaid beds across the country for poor people who need drug treatment to get it.That will be game-changing on the ground in individual states like mine and others.So money is being committed.Now it's congress' job.I heard congresswoman Pelosi say, whether's the money?I said, I read the constitution.You appropriate.Get to it.Let's bring in congressman Adam Schiff.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
Grand jury reportedly approves first criminal charges in Russia investigation Video:::::Transcript for Grand jury reportedly approves first criminal charges in Russia investigation Good to be here.A live shot of the white house and tart with the breaking news that is almost certainly causing reverberations right there in that building.Very little doubt about that.We are talking about that reported bombshell on the Russia investigation.CNN says a grand jury has approved the first criminal charges in the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.We've got team coverage and we start with ABC's senior justice correspondent Pierre Thomas in Washington leading us off.Pierre, good morning to you.Reporter: Dan, good morning.CNN is reporting that Mueller's special counsel team brought charges before a grand jury.We know attorneys from Mueller's office were at the federal courthouse here in D.C. Friday including one of his senior prosecutors who specializes in fraud cases.We've learned that there was a filing in court on Friday but we have no further reportable details.CNN's not reporting who might have been charged or what the charges could be.So this is a very unusual situation and it's unclear how significant these -- this potential action might be, Dan.What we know is Mueller's team has been investigating whether there was collusion between the trump campaign and Russian officials in connection with the 2016 presidential election and he's been investigating the financial dealings of a number of key trump associates including former campaign manager Paul manafort and Michael Flynn.Sources close to manafort say they have been given no indication any charges against him are imminent.We reached out to people tied to Flynn and got no comment but this is a reminder Mueller's investigation is sweeping, complicated and those who are being investigated are in legal jeopardy.Absolutely, Pierre.Thank you.Given the near daily drip on this Russia story it is easy to lose context of it all.Let's bring in ABC's Gloria Riviera with a look at what led up to these charges.Gloria, good morning.Reporter: Good morning.As you know president trump has long dismissed the Russia probe as a witch-hunt but new reports indicate the special counsel's investigation could be turning a new corner.Reportedly issuing the first charges that could implicate the president's own associates.President trump has long dismissed the Russia probe as nothing more than a political distraction.The whole Russia thing was an excuse for the Democrats losing the election and it turns out to be just one excuse.Reporter: And that message continues to the white house.Our position hasn't changed since day one.And I think we are seeing now that if there was any collusion with Russia it was between the DNC and the Clintons and certainly not our campaign.Reporter: Questions mounting over separate reports by CNN and "The Wall Street journal" saying the first criminal charges have been filed in independent counsel Bob corker's investigation into the alleged ties to the Russian government.The indictments are still sealed under orders from a federal judge.ABC news has not independently matched that reporting.The news comes at a time when we're also learning more about who was behind that infamous intelligence dossier alegging T tie S. The Washington beacon hired fusion gps to provide research on multiple the candidates but insists it did not pay for the dossier and did not have any dealings with the former British intelligence officer who ultimately produced the dossier citing Russian sources.Might have started with a Republicans early on in the primaries.I think I would know but let's find out who it is.I'm sure that will come out.Do you know who those Republicans are?I think I would have -- if I were to guess, I have one name in mind.Reporter: The house intelligence committee says it is working with the free beacon to verify its claims it had no involvement with the dossier and man who produced it.Thank you.Cecilia, I want to bring you in on this since you cover the white house every day.What do you think -- how are they reacting to this news about the first charges from Mueller.Certainly the public front is everything is calm, business as usual, one aide last night was tweeting it's quiet night at the white house.And certainly they're not going to back down from this claim that this is a witch-hunt that is the narrative.The president wag tweeting saying there is no collusion between the Russians and me.That is the public reaction.I can tell you from speaking to a lot of sources people are nervous in that they're lawyering up.The president has picked up the tab for some of those lawyers.This is an investigation certainly circling in and closing in on some aides close to the president and know these questions and know this investigation is not going away so privately people are definitely starting to feel this.Lots of lawyers involved.For more on all this let's bring in ABC news political commentator cokie Roberts in Washington.Cokie, let me ask you how nervous do you think the white house should be?Well, once these special prosecutors going it's very unsettling for white houses and grand juries leak and we start to learn lots of information and unfortunately though for the principles they don't leak enough.And so what you have is a lot of speculation and a lot of finger-pointing without a lot of facts and that goes on for months and months and months often and that can be very disspiriting to a white house because they're trying to get something done and they're constantly having to worry about this investigation and I think that's likely to go on for a long time.It 1er7b8 is on their mind if the president's tweets are any indication, cokie.But I want to ask you about something else that was in the news and has been at the top of all of our newscasts here.Those files that were just released in the JFK assassination.You have some personal experience with that.What do you think will come of all this?Well, my father was on the Warren commission an I do remember actually him being on the phone talking to Lyndon Johnson and saying, we need to name a blue ribbon commission, otherwise the American people will never feel like we've investigated this crime of the assassination.Now, of course, what happened was just the opposite, they were hoping to bring everything out and let the American people feel comfortable about the fact that they knew who the assassin was and now we've had these 40, 50 years of not knowing or of people feeling like there's something being hidden and by not having all -- every single one of the papers released on Thursday, what you have is the conspiracy starting right up again.Just stirring the pot of the Kennedy conspiracy people.Cokie, let me ask you about another story a little more current.A lot of people have been talking about this tiny company out of whitefish, Montana, that got hired to restore power in Puerto Rico.Some people are pointing out that the owner of the company has political ties to people in trump's orbit.How big a story do you think this is?I don't think this one goes terribly far.After a major disaster all kinds of funny things happen because there's a whole lot of money being thrown at a problem and people get rich off it.After the BP oil spill in Louisiana, the cynics were referring to spill yonaires and this one is likely toable off, not something we would have recommended on an ethical basis, but I don't think it's likely to rise to a major story.Not shady, our political guru cokie Roberts, thank you, cokie.Great to have you with us this This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Trump again calls Russia probe 'witch hunt' as possible 1st indictment looms:::::President Donald Trump in a series of tweets Sunday morning repeated his prior assertions that a federal investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential ties to his presidential campaign is a political "witch hunt."Interested in Donald Trump?Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The president's tweets came as special counsel Robert Mueller's team has sought its first charges in the probe, with a possible announcement of an indictment to come as soon as Monday.Sources tell ABC News the special counsel team has sought charges against at least one unidentified target.The president's lawyer handling the response to the Russia investigation said Trump's tweets Sunday are not related to the special counsel's activities.Contrary to what many have suggested, the presidents comments today are unrelated to the activities of the special counsel, with whom he continues to cooperate, lawyer Ty Cobb said.Andrew Harnik/AP, FILE Trump tweeted that there is Republican "anger" over a failure to investigate Democrats' helping to fund research into possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia that led to an infamous dossier.Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee have acknowledged that they helped to fund the dossier.It's unclear what is the source of Trump's suggestion that Democrats paid $12 million for the dossier.The Clinton campaign and the DNC paid law firm Perkins Coie $12.4 million during the 2016 campaign for representation, according to The New York Times.Perkins Coie hired another company for work that led to the dossier but it is unclear how much the law firm paid that company.Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?),....Donald J.

NHS Airbnb-style scheme 'not ruled out' by minister:::::The idea of NHS hospital patients recuperating in Airbnb-style accommodation has not been ruled out, health minister Philip Dunne has said.Southend Hospital had been linked to a trial where hospital patients could be discharged to people's spare rooms.The hospital distanced itself from the idea following criticism by politicians and health groups.But Mr Dunne told BBC Radio 5 live he "wouldn't immediately reject it" as "one's got to trial different things".The pilot scheme, proposed in Essex, would have seen some 30 hospital patients staying in local residents' spare rooms instead of in hospital while they waited to be discharged.The idea followed warnings about delays in discharges from UK hospitals.As part of the trial, healthcare start-up CareRooms said it would recruit "hosts" whose properties had spare rooms or annexes with a private bathroom.Southend Hospital later said the pilot would not be supported until certain criteria had been met.'New care models' However, when asked by the BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaar if the idea deserved a look, health minister MP Mr Dunne said: "Well, I wouldn't rule it out."This is not national policy, anything innovative needs to be very carefully scrutinised and assessed before we proceed with it."But I wouldn't, just as an immediate knee jerk, say that new models of care in the community are necessarily wrong."Image copyright PA Image caption The idea followed warnings about delays in discharges from UK hospitals Mr Dunne added that the idea had involved "people who may have had minor procedures who need a bit of help".It could also include B&B owners who were already medically trained and could offer accommodation, he said.But Tom Abell, deputy chief executive of Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said: "While we welcome and encourage new ideas and innovation, there is no intention and there never has been for the hospital to support this pilot at this time."A 'sticking plaster' The idea first emerged last week, when it sparked widespread debate.Labour's shadow health minister Justin Madders said the scheme would be a "sticking plaster" for wider NHS issues, while shadow social care minister Barbara Keeley warned there were "clear safety risks".Ex-Labour minister Lord Clark warned that "vulnerable patients" would be allocated to homes where the host had no "medical expertise".However, Dr Harry Thirkettle, co-founder of CareRooms, said the idea could help patients who either live alone and do not have support leave hospital sooner.He said that some people may find the scheme preferable to staying in hospital.An NHS England spokesman said it was "good to hear innovative ideas from NHS staff", but the idea was "a long way from being implemented" and would need to be very "carefully assessed" before being tested.

before Mr Garnier was a government minister.Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said recent newspaper reports about inappropriate behaviour by MPs and ministers were "totally unacceptable if true".Asked about the working culture at Westminster, he said: "Things have got better in recent years but there is still some way to go."There are mums and dads who have daughters who are politics students hoping to get a job in Westminster, and they must be able to be confident that if they get that job, their daughter will not be subject to some of these behaviours that we have been seeing."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Diane Abbott: "Making sexual harassment a joke is one of the reasons it's not been dealt with" 'Undermining and demeaning' Shadow Home Secretary Dianne Abbott told the Andrew Marr show the culture for women in Parliament had improved since she was elected in 1987, but said there was "still a long way to go".She also criticised Conservative Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was forced to apologise on Saturday after he likened being interviewed by BBC presenter John Humphrys to "going into Harvey Weinstein's bedroom"."I heard it and I didn't think it was funny - particularly in Parliament, making sexual harassment a joke is one of the reasons it's not being dealt with," she said."You've got to realise that it's undermining and demeaning for women and undermines and demeans the institution."Ms Abbott said Labour had set up a new process for dealing with complaints of sexual harassment, but she stressed that it was an issue for all parties to deal with.Referring to Sheffield Hallam MP Jared O'Mara, who has been suspended by the Labour Party while it investigates misogynistic and homophobic comments attributed to him, she said: "That language and that tone is unacceptable".Labour MP Liz Kendall told BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics she knew of people in her own party who had not reported harassment "because they were urged not to".She backed the creation of a new independent reporting system.Conservative MP Anna Soubry called for an urgent statement from Commons leader Andrea Leadsom on what can be done to ensure complaints are dealt with properly.She told the Sunday Politics previous attempts by Conservative whips to set up a new grievance procedure had been frustrated by an inability to "get all the agreement that was necessary".'Sexual chatter' Meanwhile, former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb was reported by the Sunday Telegraph to have admitted sending "explicit" messages to a 19-year-old woman after a job interview at Westminster in 2013.The married MP, who admitted meeting the woman "a few times," was quoted by the paper as saying he had been "foolish" but that there had been no sexual contact."I accept any kind of sexual chatter like this is totally wrong and I am sorry for my actions," the MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire said.Mr Crabb resigned last year as work and pensions secretary following reports of a similar incident.He did not respond to requests from the BBC for a comment.Image copyright BBC Sport Image caption George Riley has reported on major sporting events for Radio 5 live Elsewhere, the Sunday Times is reporting that BBC Radio 5 live sports broadcaster George Riley has been suspended, following claims that a number of women have complained about his behaviour.Mr Riley has not commented and the BBC has not confirmed or denied the report.A BBC spokesman said: "We can't comment on individuals but treat any allegations seriously and have processes in place for investigating them."
Gay men to receive Scottish government apology:::::Image copyright Getty Images The first minister is to apologise on behalf of the Scottish government to gay men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences.Nicola Sturgeon will make the apology at Holyrood on 7 November to coincide with new legislation giving an automatic pardon to those affected.The legislation was promised by Ms Sturgeon when she presented her programme for government in September.The law will also allow the removal of such crimes from criminal records.A Scottish government spokesman said that Ms Sturgeon would apologise to those convicted prior to 2001 under discriminatory laws against same-sex sexual activity that is now legal.'Historic wrong' He added: "The apology will be made on behalf of the Scottish government for the treatment of homosexual men under previous governments and will coincide with the introduction of legislation to provide people convicted under these laws an automatic pardon."The bill will right a historic wrong and give justice to those who found themselves unjustly criminalised simply because of who they loved."The legislation was first confirmed by Justice Secretary Michael Matheson in October last year.He announced plans for automatic pardons just days after similar legislation was scuppered at Westminster.Image caption The legislation was first confirmed by Michael Matheson in October last year That happened after a private member's bill by the SNP's John Nicolson, which would have pardoned all men living with UK convictions, was "talked out" of the Commons.The UK government failed to support that private members bill in favour of bringing forward its own plans.Under its Policing and Crime Act, gay and bisexual men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences in England and Wales received posthumous pardons.Those who are living can be pardoned after the secretary of state agrees the conduct is no longer criminal.Tim Hopkins, director of the Equality Network, said: "The apology is important because it shows that it was the discriminatory laws that were wrong, and not the consensual relationships that were made criminal by those laws."We look forward to seeing the detail of the bill."If it implements the policy announced by the Scottish government, it will be a hugely important statement that Scotland regrets the discrimination of the past, and now considers its LGBTI people to be fully equal citizens who deserve equal respect."It will also be of direct practical importance to people who currently have one of these convictions show up on criminal record checks for jobs or volunteer posts."
MPs who abuse women 'must be held to account':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn said the abuse of women had been "normalised" in society MPs who abuse or sexually harass women "must be held to account", Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said.Mr Corbyn spoke out against "a culture where the abuse of women has often been accepted and normalised," including at Westminster.Conservative MP Justine Greening said anyone who felt they had been sexually harassed should contact the police.Mr Corbyn has also rejected claims he was too slow to suspend a Labour MP for misogynistic and homophobic comments.On Wednesday, Sheffield Hallam MP Jared O'Mara was suspended by Labour while the party investigated online remarks he made from 2002 to 2004.Labour had initially said it would not be suspending the MP while the allegations were investigated.It comes as Downing Street described allegations of sexual harassment in politics as "deeply concerning".'Warped' culture In a speech at the Unite union's Scottish policy conference, Mr Corbyn said in the wake of allegations about movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, the issue of sexual harassment was not one confined to Hollywood."As the leader of the Labour Party, I want to make it absolutely clear that our party will not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment," he said.He encouraged any women who had been abused or harassed by MPs to speak out, adding that the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) had adopted new "robust" procedures to deal with the issue in July.The party had established a sexual harassment hotline for any party members, he said, but added that "more must be done".Image copyright PA Image caption Jeremy Corbyn was addressing the Unite union's Scottish policy conference, in Aviemore Misogyny and sexism were "widespread problems across society," he said."Sexual abuse and abusive treatment of women by men is not confined to any one industry, workplace or institution."The problem doesn't stop with those who make unwanted advances on women."It's a warped and degrading culture that also exists and thrives in the corridors of power, including in Westminster."'Long overdue' His speech comes amid reports that female researchers and aides in Parliament have been using a WhatsApp group to share information about alleged abusive behaviour by MPs from both the main parties.And on Saturday, the Times reported that four male MPs, including a minister, have been accused of harassing or propositioning young women inappropriately.Ms Greening, the Women and Equalities minister, said: "There's no place in Westminster for any of this kind of behaviour."Woman who have experienced it should be coming forward to be clear about what's happened to them.It's now long overdue that we stamp this sort of behaviour out."The prime minister's official spokeswoman said any report of sexual harassment were "deeply concerning" and urged anyone with information to contact the authorities.
Child maintenance bank account loophole to be closed:::::Image copyright PA Parents will no longer be able to use a legal loophole to avoid paying child maintenance, under new laws to be brought in within months.If a parent owes maintenance, payment can currently be taken only from a bank account held solely by them.A "small minority" are avoiding payments by having a joint account with a partner, the government says.It says new rules mean money can be taken from joint accounts, which could mean an extra 390,000 being collected.Unpaid child maintenance backlog in UK is 3.8bn Safeguards will be put in place over deducting money from joint accounts, the Department for Work and Pensions said.These include taking from a joint account only when the paying parent does not have their own account - or there is not enough money in their own account.Bank statements will be reviewed to establish which funds belong to the paying parent, and both account holders will be given the right to make their case before any money is taken.'Terrible problems' However, family and divorce lawyer Vanessa Lloyd-Platt said that in practice there would be "terrible problems" in distinguishing between which money belongs to what party in a joint account.She added: "Can you imagine, if you've gone into a new relationship - you've got married again, and you've got a joint account with your new partner or new wife - that could cause that marriage to be disrupted terribly."Earlier this year, figures from the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme showed a UK backlog of more than 3.8bn in uncollected child maintenance payments.About 1.2 million people were owed child maintenance, the figures showed.Dalia Ben-Galim, policy director at the charity Gingerbread which helps single parents, said the new law is "a welcome step forward" but said other loopholes in the system need to be addressed.For example, she said it is hard for the Child Maintenance Service to connect with HMRC to track a parent's additional sources of money such as rental income or dividend payments if the spouse is a company director or if the ex-partner is self-employed and does self assessment tax.Maya, a mother of one daughter, told BBC Radio 5 live that she once went two years without receiving maintenance payments from her ex-husband.She said the new rules could help since previously there had been no guarantee she would receive her money on time, even though the Child Support Agency was able to take it directly from her former spouse's employer."At the end of each month, I'd be keeping my fingers crossed, thinking 'has he paid?Has he paid?'"she said.Men and women have shared their experience with BBC News: 'No justice' Felicity in Stockton-on-Tees has been fighting for child maintenance for six years."The father of my children has a limited company and he pays himself a salary of 150 per week.So he has to pay the bare minimum child maintenance for his two children, whilst he pays all the profit from his company to his wife, the director of his company.No justice!"'It's ruining me' Billy in south-east England says that when he was on CSA his payments were manageable."Now I'm paying close to 600 a month for one child who resides in Cumbria.This is a third of my net income.I love my child dearly and will always pay my way but I don't believe this a fair payment and it is ruining me financially."'Not enough for lunch money' One woman from east London has two children with her ex-partner."I was told in 2007 he should pay 64 per week.He didn't pay and as he was self-employed CMA could not retrieve the payments.Two years ago I was told he was on benefits, that money could not be taken from him, and over 15,000 was wiped off the debt.Now I receive 6.72 per week.That does not even pay for lunch money for one child a week.So after 10 years of fighting and phone calls my ex basically pays nothing towards the children."'My ex cheats the system' Another man from Shrewsbury, who did not want to be named, is a father of three and hopes closing the loophole will work both ways."One daughter lives with my ex-wife and her partner.My ex cheats the system.She claims benefits - meaning she pays 8 a week in child maintenance - whilst living off her partner's wages.I'm a full time nurse.The CMA wants 300 per month from me."Caroline Dinenage, minister for family support, housing and child maintenance, said: "Our priority is for children to get the support they need."Only a small minority of parents try to cheat their way out of paying towards their children, and this new power will be another tool to tackle those who do."

UK 'won't recognise' Catalan independence:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Theresa May and Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy in 2016 The UK will not recognise the Catalan parliament's declaration of independence, Downing Street says.Theresa May's official spokesman said the declaration was based on a vote that had been declared illegal.The Scottish government said it understood and respected Catalonia's position.The Catalan regional parliament has voted to declare independence from Spain, while the Spanish parliament has approved direct rule over the region.The UK prime minister's spokesman said in a statement: "The UK does not and will not recognise the unilateral declaration of independence made by the Catalan regional parliament."It is based on a vote that was declared illegal by the Spanish courts.We continue to want to see the rule of law upheld, the Spanish constitution respected, and Spanish unity preserved."Catalan MPs backed the independence motion 70-10 in a ballot boycotted by the opposition.Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had told senators direct rule was needed to return "law, democracy and stability" to Catalonia.Calls for dialogue 'refused' Scotland's Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, Fiona Hyslop, said: "We understand and respect the position of the Catalan government."While Spain has the right to oppose independence, the people of Catalonia must have the ability to determine their own future."Today's declaration of independence came about only after repeated calls for dialogue were refused."Ms Hyslop added that direct rule was not a solution and that Spain's decision to impose it "should be of concern to democrats everywhere".She called on the EU to resolve the crisis peacefully and democratically.Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said the dispute had been turned into a "binary choice" between independence and direct rule."It is not what the majority in Catalonia and Spain actually want," she said."They want a sensible, political dialogue about finding a resolution."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Boris Johnson spoke to reporters in Lisbon UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson earlier offered his support to the Spanish PM.After a meeting with Portugal's foreign minister in Lisbon, he said: "We don't think, as far as we understand the matter, that the referendum on independence was well-founded in law."Therefore we remain very clear in our view that we should uphold the constitutional integrity and sovereignty of our Spanish friends and that's really our commitment and our pledge."
Hurricane Irma: Aid rule change to be considered:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Caribbean islands were hit by Hurricane Irma last month British overseas territories damaged by hurricanes could access aid in future under new plans, the BBC has learned.Some small Caribbean islands that were hit by Hurricane Irma last month were deemed too wealthy to qualify for aid.But on Monday the body that sets international aid rules will consider allowing countries to return to the list of poorer, eligible recipients.Middle-income countries cannot currently re-register for aid if they suffer an unexpected economic decline.Another option that will be discussed is an "emergency waiver".This would allow a country to be included on the list of eligible official development assistance (ODA) recipients for a short period after a crisis.But this proposal is expected to face opposition from some members of the the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) development assistance committee when it meets on Monday in Paris.Last month, the British overseas territories of Anguilla, Turks and Caicos and the British Virgin Islands were badly damaged by Hurricane Irma.But there was controversy after the BBC revealed that Britain's 13bn aid budget could not be used to help repair the islands.All three had gross national incomes higher than the benchmark set by the World Bank for countries to be eligible for ODA.'High level meeting' International Development Secretary Priti Patel, who will attend Monday's meeting, has been pushing for the international rules to be changed to reflect the vulnerabilities of small island states.She has discussed the options with Angel Gurria, the secretary general of the OECD, and this week she told MPs that he had been "broadly supportive" of her ideas.The development assistance committee is made up of 30 countries, and changes to the rules have to be agreed by consensus.Image copyright PA Image caption British troops took part in hurricane clean-up operations OECD sources suggested there would be opposition from some countries who feared that a special case was being made for British overseas territories.Others fear that money going to small islands could divert ODA funds from tackling long term poverty in developing countries.So officials expect the most likely outcome from Monday's "high level meeting" of the committee is for the members to support in principle the idea of creating a new mechanism for countries to return to the ODA list, while also asking for more information about how any rule changes might work."I doubt it will be done in one day," said one source."The decision will probably be to dig a little deeper and look at the conditions and the research."Key questions would be: What criteria would be used to decide whether or not a country should be eligible for ODA again?How could they ensure that any rule change helps all countries and not just British overseas territories?And how could the rules ensure that ODA is not unduly diverted away from poverty reduction?The OECD is understood to be looking at the way other international organisations have made their rules more flexible to deal with emergencies.These include how the World Bank decides which countries are eligible for International Development Association assistance, and how the World Trade Organization waives intellectual property rights to allow poor countries access to medicine licences when there is a health need.Aid list At the moment countries eligible for ODA must have a gross national income of less than $12,235 per capita.That currently includes Antigua and Barbuda, Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba.But Anguilla and St Kitts & Nevis were taken off the ODA list in 2014, the British Virgin Islands in 2000, and the Turks and Caicos in 2008.Under the new proposal, there would now be a process whereby these countries could be restored to the ODA list.
Brexit: EU bank may not fully repay UK until 2054:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Alexander Stubb tells Today it will take more than 30 years for UK to get 3bn EIB investment back Billions of euros of British taxpayers' money could remain locked into an EU bank for more than thirty years after Brexit, the UK has been warned.Alexander Stubb, vice president of the European Investment Bank - in which the UK is a 16% shareholder - said it would not be fully repaid until 2054.He described Brexit as a "travesty" but denied the move was a punishment."The EIB has leveraged the economy of the UK many, many fold over the years," he told BBC Radio 4's Today.The UK has 3.5bn euros (3.1bn) of capital at the bank and a House of Lords report said the UK's investment could be worth 10.1bn (8.9bn) euros taking into account reserves and profits.Established in 1958, the EIB uses capital provided by EU countries to make loans at low rates, often for major infrastructure projects.All 28 EU nations are shareholders in the Luxembourg-based bank, with the UK being the largest alongside Germany, France and Italy.Mr Stubb, a former prime minister of Finland, told the BBC that the UK's money could be tied up for decades in after it leaves the EU in 2019."Everyone on both sides of the negotiating table agree that we have to pay back the 3.5 billion euro, basically in cash, and that will happen over a long period, up until 2054, because that's when the loans are amortised."'Travesty' He insisted that no-one in the bank wanted to "punish" the UK for leaving and actually wanted to "alleviate the pain" of Brexit."I have a British heart pumping, I am married to a Brit, my children have dual nationality and I think Brexit is one of the biggest travesties that we have seen in the modern era," he said."So I will do everything in my power to alleviate the pain, but the economic facts are just such that there are no winners in Brexit - apart from perhaps a few lawyers.Unfortunately, we will see this in the coming years."The BBC's Ross Hawkins said Today had heard how delays in authorising new loans while the UK remains part of the EU could see fewer social homes built.One housing association, Stonewater, said it may build around 300 fewer homes because its application for 100m to build new properties had ground to a halt.Its executive director John Bruton told the programme: "The Bank has been waiting for assurances from the UK government before the application can be progressed."
Brexit: Baroness Anelay quits role after helicopter injury:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Baroness Anelay has been in the House of Lords since 1996 Conservative peer Baroness Anelay has stood down as a Brexit minister, citing health reasons.She told Conservative Home she was "calling time" on her ministerial career due to an injury she sustained in 2015 getting out of a helicopter.The peer, who joined the Brexit department earlier this year, will be replaced by former MEP Lord Callanan.Brexit Secretary David Davis said she had made an "invaluable contribution" to the process of leaving the EU.In 2015, Baroness Anelay badly injured her ankle in an accident getting out of a Black Hawk helicopter during a diplomatic trip to Bosnia-Herzegovina.'Optimistic' Writing for Conservative home, she said her retirement from government was prompted by the injury but she would remain an active member of the House of Lords."It was the Black Hawk helicopter that did it," she wrote."As a Foreign Office minister, I was touring Bosnia and Herzegovina, meeting victims of war and terror for whom British overseas power had been a ladder out of oppression."Unfortunately for me, that particular ladder hadn't materialised when it came to getting out of the helicopter.Image caption Martin Callanan becomes the Brexit minister in the House of Lords "One ill-judged leap later, and I sustained an uncomfortable injury that has called time on my ministerial career after two decades on the front bench."Although she voted to remain in the EU, she said she was "optimistic" about the UK's future outside the bloc and was "certain" the negotiations and the UK's future relationship with the EU would be successful.The peer, who was a history teacher and magistrate before joining the Lords in 1996, has served in a series of frontbench positions for nearly 20 years.'Nightmare' Her departure means there is no woman in the ministerial team at either the Department for Exiting the European Union or the Foreign Office.Lady Fairhead, the recently ennobled former BBC chair, is the only female minister in a Brexit-related department, having become minister for trade and export promotion earlier this month.Lord Callanan was a Conservative MEP for the North-East of England for 15 years.He became a peer in 2014 and was previously a minister in the Department of Transport.Labour peer Lord Adonis, a vocal opponent of EU withdrawal, cast doubt on the Baroness Anelay's reasons for quitting given that she only accepted the Brexit ministerial job in July.He tweeted: "Lady Anelay's accident was 2 years ago.The 'accident' causing her departure was Brexit."He suggested that her successor was "inexperienced" and would have a "nightmare" getting Brexit-related legislation through the Lords, where the government does not have a majority.
UK 'wants to leave Common Agricultural Policy in March 2019':::::Image copyright Getty Images The UK is seeking to leave the EU Common Agricultural Policy in March 2019, Scotland Office minister Lord Duncan has said.Speaking at a National Farmers Union Scotland conference, he said the UK was pushing to split subsidy payments from any transitional Brexit deal.Lord Duncan said this would mean farmers being paid from a UK pot.Scottish Brexit minister Michael Russell said the move could restrict the sale of farm produce to the EU.UK ministers have said the level of funding to farmers after the UK formally leaves the EU would be guaranteed until 2022.Clarification sought Lord Duncan said: "The secretary of state (Michael Gove) has been very clear that he believes farming and fishing should not be part of any transitional deal."We need to be able to negotiate that.It's not in our gift solely to say it and get it.We need to negotiate."What we believe is the earlier we can give to farmers and the fishermen opportunities outside of these common policies which all concerned are restrictive, bureaucratic and indeed unhelpful to the wider industries."The sooner we can give that the better."The Scottish government said it was concerned that the March 2019 deadline would give Scotland only 18 months to create a new farm subsidy framework.Mr Russell said: "This seems to go completely counter to what the prime minister has been saying and absolutely counter to what the expectation appears to be in Brussels."I was very surprised to hear it and I think it will require urgent clarification, because as far as I know there's no intention in the negotiations of trying to pick and choose from a transitional deal."That rather defeats the purpose of it."
MPs to debate 'scrap first-past-the-post' call:::::Image caption The 2017 general election ended in a hung parliament - as was the case in 2010 Another bid to scrap the UK's first-past-the-post voting system will be debated by MPs on Monday.More than 100,000 people signed a petition to adopt proportional representation for general elections.Campaigners argue that the current system is meant to deliver decisive results but the 2010 and 2017 general elections resulted in hung parliaments.The government says the 2011 AV referendum shows the public do not want to change first- past-the-post.Under first-past-the-post (FPTP), the candidate who receives the most votes in a local constituency wins a seat in the House of Commons.Tactical voting This means the number of seats each political party wins does not reflect its share of the vote nationally - in 2015, UKIP picked up 3.9m votes but only won one seat.Under proportional representation (PR), parties' seats in parliament would be allocated in proportion to the number of votes cast for them.Image caption The government argues that the current voting system is easily understood and provides a clear link between MPs and their constituents The e-petition argues that the current system makes Parliament "unrepresentative".The Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for change, says the argument that FPTP brings decisive results has been undermined by recent elections and points out that proportional systems are used in the Welsh Assembly, Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly.History of voting system changes 1910: Royal Commission recommends the Alternative Vote system be adopted for elections to the Commons, although some argue for the Single Transferable Vote (STV) 1918: MPs reject STV in a free vote but back AV for rural, single member seats.The changes are blocked by the House of Lords 1931: Minority Labour government attempts to introduce AV in a third of constituencies but loses power before it can become law, after which electoral reform becomes a cause mostly associated with the Liberal Party 1998: The Jenkins Commission recommends a proportional system should replace FPTP in Westminster elections 1998: Northern Ireland Assembly formed - members elected under Single Transferable Vote system, a form of PR 1999: Britons switch to the "closed party list" PR system to elect members of the European Parliament, having previously used FPTP 1999: First elections to Holyrood and Welsh Assembly using "additional member" system - FPTP constituencies and seats filled proportionally from regional party lists 2007: STV introduced for Scottish local elections 2011: AV referendum - 19m voters - 68% of those who took part - reject bid to switch to new system Why not use proportional representation?The Electoral Reform Society says the 2011 referendum should not be seen as a rejection of proportional representation - as PR was not offered as an option.Instead the referendum offered voters a choice between keeping the current system or switching to the Alternative Vote - under which voters could rank candidates in order of preference, and these preferences could be used to decide the outcome in places where no candidate wins more than 50% of votes cast.But in its response, the government says it has "no plans" to change the voting system and the 2011 referendum produced a "clear result" in which "the public voted overwhelmingly in favour of keeping the FPTP system".The government argues that PR voting would "weaken the direct constituency link which is a key feature of our Parliamentary system" and that it would be "more complicated for the voter".Any petition on the UK Parliament's website with more than 100,000 signatures is automatically considered for a debate in Westminster Hall, an annexe to the main Commons chamber which does not have the power to make law.
Abuse allegations deeply concerning, says No 10 after Sun claims:::::Image copyright PA Any allegations of sexual harassment and abuse in Westminster are "deeply concerning", Downing Street has said.It comes after the Sun newspaper reported claims female researchers and aides were using a WhatsApp group to share information about alleged abuse.Prime Minister Theresa May would urge anyone with information to contact the authorities, a No 10 spokeswoman said.The WhatsApp group has allegedly shared stories of MPs groping staff in lifts and at drinks parties.According to the Sun story, a minister was branded "Not Safe In Taxis" because of his behaviour.Helpline Senior politicians from the Conservatives and Labour are said to be named in the WhatsApp group but names have been redacted in the Sun report.The prime minister's official spokeswoman said: "Any reports of sexual harassment were deeply concerning and that is true in any walk of life including politics."Any allegations will be taken seriously.Reports are concerning but we can't pre-empt allegations before they come to light."A House of Commons spokesman said the Parliamentary authorities have a limited ability to intervene because staff are employed directly by MPs.But he said there was a 24-hour helpline available to raise concerns."The House of Commons takes the welfare of everyone who works in Parliament very seriously," the spokesman said.'Serious' The spokesman added: "Where Members are alleged to have breached the MPs' code of conduct it is possible for the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to launch an investigation."Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said all employers had to have systems in place to enable female staff, including those working for MPs, to report allegations of abuse.Speaking on LBC radio, the Labour leader said the issue was "very serious" and that Labour had a process of its own for responding to complaints from elected representatives and party members in a "timely and proportionate" manner."The prime minister has announced this morning that she supports, which I agree with her on, a process that the staff of any MP, of any party, can and should report these matters to the House of Commons authority," he said."Where there is an unequal power relationship in the workplace and women become vulnerable as a result of it, they have to be supported, they have to be protected."

Nicola Sturgeon seeks clarity over Brexit transition:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Nicola Sturgeon said urgent clarity was needed on the UK's transition plans Nicola Sturgeon has called for "urgent clarity" from Theresa May on transition plans as the UK leaves the EU.In a letter to Theresa May, the first minister said that the prime minister's proposal for a two-year implementation period had been "seriously undermined".It followed comments from Mrs May that there would be no transition deal unless a trading relationship with the EU was settled next year.Number 10 said it was confident "general terms" would be agreed soon.While the first minister said she had welcomed comments from Mrs May made in Florence last month that she would be seeking urgent agreement on a two-year transition, Ms Sturgeon said that subsequent comments made in the Commons by the prime minister had "seriously undermined" clarity on the issue and also the confidence of business.Ms Sturgeon wrote: "This relates in particular to your comments suggesting no transition can be agreed, or formalised, until there is agreement on the future relationship."I am therefore urgently seeking your assurances that you are committed to rapidly putting in place transition arrangements that will meet the needs of business."Image copyright PA Image caption Nicola Sturgeon said Theresa May had undermined confidence with her comments Businesses have pressed the UK government to agree the terms of transition with the EU by Christmas.She said she wanted confirmation that the prime minister was urgently seeking agreement on a transition arrangement of at least two years, with the aim of securing that agreement by the end of this year.She also said that it should be based on the current structure of EU rules.Scotland's first minister wrote that such an agreement should not be conditional on a deal before the UK's leave date of March 2019.She also expressed concerns that UK government negotiations would result in a "no deal" scenario.She added: "The Scottish Parliament gave a clear view this week that a no deal situation would not be acceptable and I believe that if the UK finds itself in that position, that no Brexit would be preferable to no deal - or indeed a bad deal - and that each of the Parliaments in the UK must have the opportunity to take a view on that."A UK government spokeswoman said: "The prime minister was clear in her speech in Florence that we want a time-limited implementation period to carry out the practical changes necessary as we move to our new partnership with the EU."Our proposal for an implementation period is very similar to what the EU set out in their April guidelines so we are confident of agreeing the general terms of the implementation period soon."
Top civil servant Sir Jeremy Heywood treated for cancer:::::Image copyright PA The UK's top civil servant, Sir Jeremy Heywood, has been receiving treatment for cancer.The Cabinet Office said Sir Jeremy, who has been cabinet secretary since 2012, was diagnosed in June.In a statement, it said the 55-year old had received treatment over the summer and the early autumn which "went well".Sir Jeremy, it added, had continued his "normal duties" during this period with the full support of his doctors and remained "totally focused" on doing so.As cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, Sir Jeremy is responsible for advising the prime minister and cabinet on the business of government, including the UK's withdrawal from the EU.The Cabinet Office said it would be making no further comment on "this private matter".Sir Jeremy, who is sometimes characterised in the media as the most powerful figure in the British government, has worked closely with four prime ministers during a 25-year career in Whitehall.Under Tony Blair he was principal private secretary before becoming permanent secretary at Number 10 to both Gordon Brown and David Cameron.
Referee Tory MP Douglas Ross to miss World Cup:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Ross missed a House of Commons vote as he was officiating at a Barcelona match in the Champions League Scottish Tory MP Douglas Ross has told football authorities he will no longer accept refereeing appointments when Parliament is sitting.It means he will not be in the running to officiate at next summer's World Cup in Russia.Mr Ross was criticised for missing a debate on Universal Credit to run the line at a Champions League match.He defended that decision in a letter to constituents saying he knew he would not be able to speak in the debate.Mr Ross told BBC Scotland that he had made "difficult, personal decision" on his job in football, but said his "number one priority was standing up for the people of Moray".'Ticked off' The MP, who has been a referee for 15 years and was first elected a Moray councillor 10 years ago, said he had not been prepared for the level of criticism he received for missing the debate earlier this month.Mr Ross was in Spain for the Barcelona v Olympiakos game on the same day as the Universal Credit debate was held at Westminster.Prime Minister Theresa May was forced to defend him after SNP MP John McNally raised the issue by brandishing a red card across the chamber.Mr Ross said: "I don't need to be ticked off by anyone to know that you don't want to be on the prime minister's radar for reasons such as this."You want to be on the prime minister's, anyone's, radar for good reasons."Image copyright EPA Mr Ross said SNP campaign leaflets accusing him of putting football before parliamentary work had meant constituents were aware that refereeing was a big part of his life.But he added that before the election he gave a commitment not to allow his football job to impact on his parliamentary duties.He said: "I only have one priority which is to stand up for the people of Moray."I had given a commitment to the people of Moray and I hope this sends a signal that I was genuine about that."Mr Ross, a former MSP, was also criticised in November last year for missing a Scottish Parliament committee meeting to run the line in a Champions League match in Portugal.It led to calls for him to stand down from his frontbench role as the Scottish Conservatives' justice spokesman.Mr Ross later went on to defeat the SNP's Westminster leader Angus Robertson at the general election in June.Earlier, in a statement given to online community newspaper Inside Moray, the Moray MP said he recognised he could no longer balance his football job with his political one.
Unpaid internships likened to modern slavery in Lords debate:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Research suggests unpaid internships have grown massively since 2010 Unpaid internships have been likened to a form of modern slavery during a Lords debate on whether to ban them.Lord Holmes asked how a country which "slammed the door on slavery in the 19th Century" could allow people to work for no financial return.Interns were "not owned by anyone" and could quit, said Lord Mitchell, but getting "no payments for their labours" could be equated with slavery.Baroness Brady said work experience had value but must be more skills-driven.Lord Holmes' private members bill, being debated for the first time on Friday, would prohibit unpaid internships of more than four weeks.Without government backing, it is unlikely to succeed.Ministers have previously opposed attempts to ban unpaid internships, arguing it could "undermine existing employment laws".An attempt in Parliament to ban unpaid internships was blocked last November.but new research by the Social Mobility Commission suggests there is strong public support for the bill.Three quarters of the 5,000 people surveyed said they backed a ban on unpaid internships lasting four weeks or more.'Discriminatory' Many interns already fall under the legal definition of a "worker", a person who has a contract or arrangement to do work, and are entitled to the national minimum wage.But Lord Holmes of Richmond said existing laws were clearly not working, given that more and more professions and trades were requiring unpaid work experience when it comes to securing a job.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Entry into many professional careers often requires candidates to have completed internships "Wilberforce slammed the door on slavery in the 19th century," the Conservative peer, a former solicitor and member of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said."We had the national minimum wage legislation in the 20th century."How can it still be in the fifth richest economy on the planet that in the 21st century we're still asking people to give up their labour for no financial return?"The bill, he argued, would ensure young people had equal opportunities to get into the workplace.'Not a job' Businesswoman Baroness Brady said work experience had a role to play in informing young people about career choices and the world of work but was "very obviously not a job".The Apprentice TV star, a former small business adviser to David Cameron, said employers had to think very differently about what its purpose was."They are not doing something an employer needs to have done for no cost."I think we need a change of mindset from those who might think of work experience programmes as something they can exploit to get something done for nothing, to a community-based approach."Businesses, she said, should be asking what can we do to "give the young person the support they need to make that transition into the workplace and get on the road and to have a career?"Ahead of Friday's debate, Tanya De Grunwald, founder of careers blog Graduate Fog, who campaigns for fairer wages for interns, said: "The bill is well-meaning but I think it's the wrong solution."The message should be that most unpaid internships are already illegal, with certain exceptions such as working for charities ... Our focus should be on enforcing existing minimum wage law."She said she would like to see universities doing more to make young people aware of their rights and for it to be made easier to report advertisements for unpaid internships to HMRC.In April, a report from the Institute for Public Policy Research found the number of internships had risen by 50% since 2010.Research by the Sutton Trust, which works to improve social mobility, found nearly a third of graduate interns are unpaid.It estimated a six month unpaid internship in London would cost someone 5,556.
EU preparing for no deal Brexit, says Michel Barnier's adviser:::::The European Union is preparing for the UK to leave without a deal, a senior official has said.Stefaan De Rynck said Brussels did not want a "no deal" scenario but it was braced for one.Mr De Rynck is an adviser to EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.He dismissed claims by David Davis that the EU would push talks on a deal to the wire saying the bloc did not want to "add risk" to the exit process by "playing with time".Davis warned over Brexit vote promise "Brexit is a process we want to manage in a calm and rational way," Mr De Rynck told a seminar at the Institute for Government think tank in London, adding that failing to reach a deal would harm both sides.He said: "There is a clear negative impact from no deal, I think that that is clear, for both sides but especially for the UK economy.But it is not a scenario people want to work towards."We are preparing for it, that is for sure, at 27 [the other 27 EU states] but it is not a scenario that we in the negotiation room want to bring in that negotiation room."He added: "On going to the wire, we would certainly want to avoid that."'Very quickly' As it stands, the UK will leave the EU in March 2019 whether it agrees a deal on the terms of withdrawal or not.Prime Minister Theresa May has said she believes the two sides will reach a deal but the UK must prepare for all eventualities.The so-called divorce bill, the amount the UK will pay to settle its liabilities when it leaves the EU, remains a major sticking point in negotiations.Hopes that negotiations would move on to Britain's future relationship with the EU this month were dashed after EU chiefs said more work was needed first on the divorce talks.Mr De Rynck said "sufficient progress is not far away" but the UK must set out how it believes the divorce bill should be calculated to end the deadlock over money."In terms of the guidelines for the future relationship as well as the possible transition, all of that can come very quickly," he said.Earlier this month, European Council President Donald Tusk said the rest of the EU was not preparing for a no deal outcome."EU27 is not working on 'no-deal' scenario," he said."We negotiate in good faith and hope for sufficient progress by December."
Youth crime disclosure rules wholly inappropriate, say MPs:::::Image copyright Science Photo Library Rules on disclosing crimes committed in childhood in England and Wales should be "radically revised", say MPs.The Commons Justice Committee said the system was "wholly inappropriate", denied children a "second chance" and may breach human rights laws.People do not have to disclose "spent" past convictions and cautions after a period of time but sometimes employers can ask that they are disclosed.The government has listed 942 crimes that are not exempt from disclosure.The coalition government brought in changes in 2013 that allowed old convictions to be "filtered out" of record checks by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) after 11 years for adults and five-and-a-half years for young offenders.Sexting In the case of cautions, they are "filtered" after six years for adults, or two for those under 18 at the time.But there are 942 offences which cannot be filtered, ranging from sexual and violent crimes to offences such as failing to display a certificate of registration in a residential care home.The justice committee's report said that that system operated "in a mechanical fashion, with no right of appeal against disclosure decisions".It pointed to offences such as "sexting".While under recent changes sexting does not appear on a DBS certificate - unless it is at the discretion of police - others who committed an offence before new guidance came in were left in an "unresolved" position, the committee said.Image copyright Getty Images The committee said: "We do not think that the difficult problem of sexual offending by children is assisted by giving them a record of a non-filterable sexual offence."We note the inconsistency between the current police response to 'sexting' by children, designed to prevent them from entering the criminal justice system, and the previous policy of taking formal action."While we commend this change in policing approach, we are concerned about the implications for children whose "sexting" offences pre-date the policy change, acquiring non-filterable criminal records as a result."It suggests the current system may "fall short" of the UK's obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.It is illegal to possess, take or distribute sexual images of someone who is under 18, including of yourself - figures released in July showed thousands of children had been investigated by police for sexting in the last three years in England and Wales.The committee recommends: That a rule which means multiple childhood convictions can never be "filtered out" of DBS checks should be removed.That the single database of 942 offences which cannot be filtered be replaced with customised lists of offences applying to different employment areas That police chiefs should be given discretion to withhold disclosure, depending on age and circumstances of the offender That people should be given the right to have an independent review of any police decision to disclose convictions or cautions That the time allowed for convictions to become "spent" under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 be reduced Committee chairman Bob Neill said the government's main aim in youth justice was to stop people being drawn into crime "but these laudable aims are systematically undermined by the current disclosure regime"."Mistakes made as a teenager can follow someone around for decades and create a barrier to rehabilitation, as well as profound problems with access to employment and education."In 2014-15, the total number of standard DBS checks was 31,753 - 8,268 of which related to people who were under 18 years old at the time of their offence.A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: "We have noted the committee's report and will publish our response in due course."The government says it will consider the recommendations of two other reviews - by the Labour MP David Lammy and by child behavioural expert Charlie Taylor after the Supreme Court rules on cases challenging the current disclosure regime next year.

Voting opens in Scottish Labour leadership race:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Richard Leonard (left) and Anas Sarwar are the two candidates to replace Kezia Dugdale as Scottish Labour leader Voting has opened in the contest to elect a new leader for the Scottish Labour Party.Anas Sarwar and Richard Leonard are the two candidates to replace Kezia Dugdale, who quit the post in August.Ballot papers have now been sent out to party members, registered supporters and voters in affiliated organisations such as trade unions.Voting will run until midday on 17 November, with the winner announced the following day.The race was triggered by the sudden resignation of Ms Dugdale on 29 August.The Lothians MSP said it was time to "pass on the baton" to someone else - although she later hinted about "a lot of internal problems" in the party.After a succession of prominent MSPs ruled themselves out, Mr Leonard and Mr Sarwar were the only contenders to put their names forward.Both men have stressed their ambition to be the next first minister of Scotland, and each has set out a package of policies which they would look to implement.Policy pledges Mr Sarwar's plan for "a Scotland where nobody is left behind" includes: An overhaul of the tax system to cut income tax for lower earners and a 50p rate for the top 2% A new Scottish Child Tax Credit of 10 a week Backing for the UK's permanent membership of the EU single market A guaranteed job, training place or further education for every school leaver Mr Leonard has set out a list of 10 priorities, with number one and his "overriding mission" to end poverty in Scotland.He also wants to: Strengthen the powers of local government Embark on a "massive" housebuilding scheme Increase child benefit for all children Promote public ownership with a national energy company tasked with cutting bills and tackling fuel poverty Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The contest was triggered by the resignation of Kezia Dugdale in August Mr Sarwar said the party was "approaching the finishing line of this contest, but the start of our journey back to government".He said: "I am determined to lead the Scottish Labour Party back to where it belongs - in power."Mr Leonard also said the party was "at a turning point" and could "once again become a party of real change".He said: "It is clear now more than ever that Scotland needs a united Labour Party committed to real and bold change.We need to win power - not power for its own sake, but power for a purpose."A series of local hustings events have been held up and down Scotland as the candidates sought to sway voters to their side.Both men pledged a "comradely" contest, but the campaigns have each had controversial moments during the campaign.Mr Sarwar had to relinquish shares in his family's firm after a row over workers not being paid the living wage, while Mr Leonard had to deny claims he was involved in a "plot" against Ms Dugdale.
Emails reveal Foreign Office alarm at Trump travel ban:::::Image copyright PA The UK government wanted to set up an internal warning system to monitor and react to decisions made by President Donald Trump, emails show.The emails reveal concerns about the impact of Mr Trump's travel ban on UK citizens and national security.Officials did not want to be caught out by similar orders issued by the US president "just as London is going to sleep", one official said.The emails were released to the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act.The BBC's Diplomatic Correspondent James Landale said: "These emails show just how concerned the Foreign Office was about the flow of unexpected announcements emerging from the Trump White House and the potential impact on the UK.""But we have to remember that this concern was also shared by other parts of the US administration that were at times equally blindsided by the president's early morning tweets," added our correspondent."So the emails do not reflect any particular deterioration in UK-US relations.They illustrate the kind of steps foreign governments have had to consider to cope with Mr Trump's unpredictable style of government."Most of the emails released to the BBC were between the British Embassy in Washington and the Foreign Office around the time of Mr Trump's executive order halting all refugee admissions and temporarily barring people from seven Muslim-majority countries.The order, signed on 27 January, was one of string of decrees, proclamations and orders issued by Mr Trump during his first weeks in the White House.It was signed hours after Prime Minister Theresa May became the first foreign leader to meet Mr Trump at the White House.Foreign Office officials feared the ban would prevent thousands of UK citizens with dual nationality travelling to the United States and discussed the likely impact of that on relations between Mrs May and the new president."BE (British Embassy) Washington have been trying to get clarity from State (The State Department) without luck so far," officials said in an internal Foreign Office email dated 28 January - the day after Mr Trump signed the order."If true, this would obviously mean thousands of dual nationals with British passports being banned from travelling to the US.Not great after the PM visit."Another email, on the same day, said: "The dual nationals angle will of course be really difficult for us.I'll come back to you when I have more on our response."In the end, the new restrictions did not apply to British citizens with dual citizenship, but officials were keen not to be caught out again by the actions of President Trump.Image copyright Reuters On 30 January, Kara Owen, director of the Americas desk at the Foreign Office sent an email around the Foreign Office, including to the deputy British ambassador to the US Patrick Davies, asking for a new warning system to be set up to look at the impact of Mr Trump's executive orders on British interests."Many of these orders will no doubt be issued just as London is going to sleep," she said."I would like us to establish a system for assessing impact of the orders on U.K. interests (if any) and offering quick advice on what to do about it to the right readership (including senior readers in FCO and Whitehall, press and private offices)."She added: "I would welcome any other predictions about EOs (executive orders) foreshadowed during the campaign and likely to touch on our interests - he is doing a lot of what he said he would."The documents also reveal the EU contacted the Foreign Office to check whether Britain was attempting to get a special deal for its citizens in the aftermath of Mr Trump's travel ban - and concerns about the impact on national security.In one exchange, the Home Office's international director, Richard Clarke, discusses "potential UK activism/adverse reaction" in response to the travel ban, with officials at the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism.Also released was a heavily redacted analysis of the first three weeks of the Trump presidency, including a section entitled "Video killed the radio star".The documents reveal civil servants expected a change in Theresa May's friendly outlook towards the US President should British citizens be banned from entering the United States."You might have seen that the PM didn't engage on the question on Trump's immigration policy saying they were for the US," said one official, referring to Mrs May's press conference in Turkey on 28 January, when she was questioned about the policy."Presumably that changes if Brits (ie dual nationals) are blocked from entering the US?," replied another official.The document warned that questions on whether the government explicitly supported US immigration policy were a "bear trap".The emails also show Foreign Office also struggled with the weight of communications from MPs in the aftermath of the US President's executive order.One official complained of "yet another UQ (Urgent Question to be answered in Parliament)", in reference to a question put by former SNP MP Stuart Donaldson requesting a statement on the impact on the ban on British citizens.In addition, the emails revealed which journalists and public figures the FCO paid particular attention to.Tweets from The Guardian's Anushka Asthana and Alan Travis, Steve Hawkes of The Sun and Jack Blanchard, then of The Mirror, were circulated with Foreign Office updates.
Tory MP Davies leaves Brexit 'belly-aching' seminar:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davies says there is a "wider discussion" to be had about universities A Welsh Tory MP left a university seminar because he "wasn't going to be lectured on freedom of speech", having raised concerns about universities "belly-aching over Brexit."David Davies defended Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris, who asked universities for names of professors teaching Brexit courses and the content of lectures.Mr Davies said later Mr Heaton-Harris "should have gone a lot further".The Westminster seminar was on a survey on public views concerning Brexit.The event was organised by Cardiff University.On Tuesday, it emerged Mr Heaton-Harris wrote to universities asking for the names of professors "involved in the teaching of European affairs, with particular reference to Brexit" and for a "copy of the syllabus".Of the eight universities in Wales, Cardiff, Bangor and Glyndwr confirmed that they were sent the letters whilst Aberystwyth said they had no record of having receiving it.The remaining four universities have yet to respond.In a tweet, Mr Heaton-Harris, a Eurosceptic MP and Conservative government whip, said: "To be absolutely clear, I believe in free speech in our universities and in having an open and vigorous debate on Brexit."Downing Street said Mr Heaton-Harris had written to universities in his capacity as MP for Daventry and not as a representative of government.Image copyright Conservative Party Image caption Chris Heaton-Harris says he believes in "open" debate on Brexit The issue was raised with Cardiff University's Vice-Chancellor, Colin Riordan, at the breakfast seminar meeting on Thursday morning.Monmouth MP Mr Davies, sat at the front, intervened in what one described as a "pretty polite exchange of views" but others said was a "rant".The Conservative MP defended his colleague's actions and argued that universities "shouldn't be promoting anti-Brexit views because they're publicly funded".After a comment from former Labour Leader Lord Kinnock, David Davies left, saying he had "had enough of this".'Eating croissants' Talking to BBC Wales after the event, Mr Davies said he "wasn't going to spend my morning with Lord Kinnock or being lectured by him on freedom of speech.""Free speech is an issue that universities need to address and it's absolutely time that they realised that they are publicly-funded organisations that shouldn't waste their time belly-aching about Brexit."They haven't got the time to sit there drinking coffee and eating croissants and lecturing people in Parliament about anti-Brexit bias," he added.A Labour MP present at the event said Mr Davies' departure "felt very staged", whilst another accused the Monmouth MP of having "turned up deliberately to make a fuss".Speaking in the Senedd on Tuesday, First Minister Carwyn Jones said Chris Heaton-Harris' letter was "as authoritarian a request as could possibly be made.""I suspect this gentleman would have a lot to teach Stalin," he added.
Legal challenge to DUP-Tory deal fails in High Court:::::Image copyright Press Eye Image caption Ciaran McClean stood unsuccessfully for the Green Party in West Tyrone in the general election A legal challenge against the deal between the Democratic Unionist Party and the Conservatives has failed at the High Court in London.The DUP agreed to support Theresa May's government in return for 1bn for Northern Ireland over five years.Ciaran McClean, a Green Party member, argued the pact breached the Anti Bribery Act 2010.Lord Justice Sales said the grounds relied on by Mr McClean were not "properly arguable in a court of law".Mr McClean launched a crowdfunding campaign to finance the case, which he brought independently of political parties, in July.Lord Justice Sales and Mr Justice Lewis heard the application for a judicial review on Thursday.Dominic Chambers QC, acting for Mr McClean, told the court the confidence and supply agreement was unlawful as it "purchased" the political support of the DUP.He said it was "unlawful because it makes provision for the expenditure of public funds for party political advantage".The application was contested by both the First Secretary of State, Damian Green, and the Attorney General.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Under the deal, the DUP guarantees its 10 MPs will back the government on legislation relating to Brexit and national security In a written submission to the court, James Eadie QC for the government argued that the criminal law of bribery does not apply to a confidence and supply agreement between political parties."The allegation that the agreement entails public expenditure which is unlawful is misconceived because the expenditure contemplated by the agreement will have appropriate parliamentary authorisation," he wrote.After the verdict, Mr McClean told the BBC that he is considering an appeal."We put the most serious charges to any government in modern times and the consequences of that could have been the fall of the government and the government finding themselves in the dock," he said."I don't think that was ever going to happen.But I think it was still right to get this aired."His solicitor, David Greene, is a senior partner at London-based Edwin Coe solicitors, who represented hairdresser Deir Tozetti Dos Santos, one of the claimants in the successful Brexit challenge in the Supreme Court.Following the judgement, lawyers representing the government were awarded full costs.Lord Justice Scales said it was "not appropriate for the burden of costs to be borne by the taxpayer".Under the confidence and supply arrangement, the DUP guarantees that its 10 MPs will vote with the government on the Queen's Speech, the Budget, and legislation relating to Brexit and national security - while Northern Ireland will receive an extra 1bn over the next two years.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Tory-DUP deal came two weeks after June's election resulted in a hung Parliament While rival parties in Northern Ireland have largely welcomed the additional funding, concerns have been raised that the deal could undermine the peace process and devolution negotiations, with the UK government dependent on the support of the DUP.The deal was also widely criticised by opposition parties in the UK.Labour branded it "shabby and reckless", while the Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones called it a "straight bung" and said it "kills the idea of fair funding".
National Action charges: Man accused of MP murder threat:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Police said the charge against Mr Lythgoe was related to Labour MP Rosie Cooper A man arrested as part of an investigation into the far-right group, National Action, has been charged with encouragement to commit murder.The BBC understands the charge against Christopher Lythgoe, 31, from Cheshire, relates to Labour MP Rosie Cooper.He is one of six men charged with being members of the banned group.A 22-year-old man, from Lancashire, who cannot be named, has also been charged with the intention of committing acts of terrorism and "threats to kill".All six are to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.National Action became the first far-right organisation to be banned in the UK in December 2016.It means that being a member of or inviting support for the organisation is a criminal offence carrying a sentence of up to 10 years' imprisonment.Ms Cooper said: "I would like to thank everyone involved in this case, especially the counter-terrorism police, for keeping me, my staff and the public safe."There remains an ongoing criminal investigation so it would not be appropriate for me to comment further."Who are National Action?By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent National Action became the first British neo-Nazi group to be banned last December after Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was promoting violence and acts of terrorism.Members and supporters applauded the murder of Jo Cox MP by a white supremacist - and the group had carried out a series of small, but confrontational, demonstrations in towns and cities throughout England.One of its most notorious events saw masked members - many of them very young men - gathering outside York Minster to make Hitler salutes.Since it was banned, detectives have been carrying out more and more investigations into the group which, to all intents and purposes, has organised itself in a similar way to the banned al Muhajiroun network - the extremist Islamist youth movement.Both have used social media to target young people, attracting them with a simplistic us-and-them message designed to make them angry.The charges follow a number of raids across England and Wales by counter-terrorism officers as part of a national investigation into the group.The others charged with belonging to a proscribed organisation are: Garron Helm, 24, of Seaforth, Merseyside Matthew Hankinson, 23, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside Andrew Clarke, 33, of Warrington Michael Trubini, 35, of Warrington A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police said the men were charged following "co-ordinated activity" by police.
UK foreign policy 'should put values above economics':::::Image copyright HoC British values should be put above "raw economics" in foreign policy, the new chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee has said.Tory MP Tom Tugendhat said he was not opposed to selling arms to countries like Saudi Arabia but it must be done in "a rules-based system".He said Britain's reputation as a fair place to do business underpinned the UK economy and must be defended abroad.He added it would be "great" to be PM, foreign or defence secretary one day.But he told the House Magazine his focus for the next few years was to chair the foreign affairs committee.'Very blunt' Mr Tugendhat, who has served in the Territorial Army in the Middle East, said: "The fundamental underpinning of our economy is the value that people place on Britain as a fair place to do business, on British law and values being fair, whether that be accountancy, whether that be legal service, whether that be finance."Therefore, we've got to be careful when we make foreign policy that we recognise that we've got to defend those values abroad above simple raw economics in a very blunt system."Image copyright PA But he said foreign policy should not be conducted in a way "that damages our ability to promote economic growth in the UK".The interview, carried out earlier this week, was published the day after Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon suggested to MPs that criticism of Saudi Arabia in Parliament was "not helpful" as he attempted to secure a deal with the country for a second batch of Typhoon fighter jets.Asked about arms sales to Saudi Arabia in light of the country's role in the conflict in Yemen, Mr Tugendhat said, "I certainly don't think it's wrong to sell arms."But we must be realistic as to what we're doing when we do sell arms.And part of that has to be within a context of, as I say, a rules-based system."Saudi Arabia has caused some issues for us in that, and other nations have too.But it's certainly not wrong to enable countries to defend themselves."'Difficult to translate' Of Boris Johnson's performance as foreign secretary, he said: "He's certainly got a lot of passion for the United Kingdom and has a way of expressing himself which certainly carries a lot of noise."He added that "cross-cultural humour" was very hard to do as it was difficult to translate."I think there are ways of doing diplomacy.I've done it in Afghanistan, in Iraq and Saudi [Arabia] and across parts of Africa and most of the Middle East, and I just think that it's very, very hard to make humour work in international environments, which is why very few serious politicians try it."Seen as a rising star of the Conservative Party, Mr Tugendhat was elected as chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, two years after becoming MP for Tonbrige and Malling.
MP Bob Blackman defends Tapan Ghosh's appearance in Parliament:::::Image copyright Youtube Image caption Tapan Ghosh (centre) appeared at two events hosted by MP Bob Blackman (right) A Tory MP has defended his decision to host Parliamentary events attended by a controversial Hindu nationalist.Tapan Ghosh's appearance at the events has sparked criticism, with a Labour MP attacking his "abhorrent views" about Muslims and pointing to his appearance with EDL founder Tommy Robinson.Bob Blackman, who hosted the functions, told the BBC's Asian Network he had been unaware of Mr Ghosh's remarks.Mr Ghosh told Asian Network he was not Islamophobic.Mr Ghosh, the founder of Hindu Samhati, a nationalist group based in India, appeared at two Parliamentary functions last week that were hosted by Mr Blackman, who is chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group for British Hindus.'Abhorrent' Raising a point of order in House of Commons on Thursday, Labour MP Naz Shah said it was "incredible" that he had been invited to Parliament."Mr Ghosh holds abhorrent views, is on record for calling upon the United Nations to control the birth rate of Muslims, praising the genocide of Rohingya Muslims in Burma and also said Muslims should be forced to leave their religion if they come to a western country," she said."Only this Monday Mr Ghosh was pictured with UK far-right extremist leader Tommy Robinson."It seems incredible to me that any member would think it would be acceptable to host a meeting with this individual, let alone invite him to our House of Commons."Responding in the Commons, Mr Blackman said he had hosted a Diwali celebration and the launch of a report into Hindu minority rights in Bangladesh and Pakistan, which Mr Ghosh attended.He said it was only in order to present evidence to this meeting "that that individual was invited to this House" by the National Council of Hindu Temples.Pressed later on Mr Ghosh's past comments, Mr Blackman told Asian Network: "I've had a chance now to study these various tweets and they're not ones I agree with."He did not make anti-Islamic remarks at the event.I can assure you had he voiced some of these comments I would've challenged him."Free speech Mr Blackman said he did not regret sharing a platform with him, saying it was "relevant to what we were discussing".When contacted by the BBC Mr Ghosh said he was not Islamophobic.The Muslim Council of Britain said: "It is astounding that a Conservative MP seems to have welcomed to Parliament with open arms a man who trades in propagating hatred against Muslims in India."Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was at the Diwali event Mr Ghosh attended, said she "fundamentally disagrees with Mr Ghosh's views on Islam".Mr Blackman said he was a "passionate believer of free" speech.Asked whether he would share a platform with a hard-line Islamist or anti-Semite, he told Asian Network presenter Nomia Iqbal: "It's an individual choice.Extremism is never acceptable in any guise or form but the way you combat it is is to take it on directly."He added: "I represent a community where everyone is a minority and the reality is we have to bring people together and that at times means having challenging discussions."Mr Blackman said he was conscious of the fact his Harrow East constituency is made up of more than 10,000 Muslims, adding that he was working to promote a new Muslim school in the area.
UK population to pass 70m in 2029, ONS projections say:::::Image copyright Getty Images The UK's population is set to exceed 70 million before the end of the next decade, according to the Office for National Statistics.The UK population was estimated to stand at 65.6 million in 2016.The ONS projections are now for a 3.6 million, or 5.5%, increase over the 10 years to 2026, with the 70m mark being passed in the middle of 2029.This is two years later than the ONS's 2014 projection that the UK population would pass the 70m barrier in mid-2027.The reason for the change is that since the 2014 study the assumption of net migration of 185,000 a year has been cut to 165,000 a year, while the expected number of children per woman has been cut from 1.89 to 1.84 - with growth in life expectancy trimmed for men from 84.3 to 83.4 and for women from 87.1 to 86.2.Andrew Nash, of the ONS Population Projections Unit, said: "Over that period 54% of growth is projected to result directly from net international migration.The other 46% is because there will be more births than deaths."Over the decade from mid-2016 projected growth in England's population is put at 5.9%, for Northern Ireland the figure is 4.2% while for Scotland and Wales the percentages are 3.2% and 3.1% respectively.The figures, which do not take into account any Brexit impact, puts projected UK population growth between 2015 and 2040 at 16%, compared with 10% growth for France and 4% for Germany, while Italy's population is projected to see a slight decline.The study also says that the numbers of people aged 85 and over with have doubled to from 1.6m in 2016 to 3.2m in 2041.Analysis, by BBC Home Affairs Editor Mark Easton The Brexit vote has made calculating the growth of the UK's population much more difficult.The level of net migration and, indeed, the potential emigration of young, fertile residents are dependent on the kind of post-Brexit agreement that emerges.Nevertheless, the Office for National Statistics has had a stab at it and concluded that the UK population will not grow as fast as previously thought.In 25 years' time, it believes there will be close to 73m people in the UK - some 2m fewer than they had thought before the EU referendum.Net migration will be lower and so will the fertility rate with fewer young foreign-born women coming to live in the UK.They also expect a slower rate of increased life expectancy than previously assumed.The impact of Brexit is dependent on the kind of deal that emerges and what happens to the UK economy as a result.Those factors will affect the numbers who wish to come and wish to leave.The ONS thinks, annually over the next 25 years, net migration will fall by about 20,000 compared with previous forecasts.But the uncertain nature of our politics makes these kind of projections fraught - particularly for those who use the data to make decisions about building roads and houses and transport infrastructure.
Cyber-crime: Security Minister Ben Wallace's claim about arrests unpicked:::::The Claim: Security Minister Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "There is some good news which never gets reported - nine out of 10 of the latest, most serious cyber-crime attacks have resulted in arrest or charges."Reality Check verdict: The relevant figure is slightly less positive to the one Mr Wallace cited on air.Between October 2016 and May 2017, the National Crime Agency (NCA) and regional organised crime units identified suspects in nine, and made arrests in seven, of the 10 most serious cyber-incidents under investigation.No-one was charged during the relevant period.We all know a burglary when we see one.Smashed window.TV gone.But large numbers of people - and entire organisations - don't necessarily realise when they've been a target or victim of a digital smash-and-grab.That's the public awareness challenge that makes combating the growth of this 21st Century crime so difficult.Put simplest, cyber-crimes and attacks fall into three broad categories: Personal crimes - such as a fraud committed through a bogus online shop or auction - but also bank card cloning and other identity-related scams in which your personal details are taken, sold in online market places and used, ultimately, to steal money.Attacks against organisations - such as this year's huge Wannacry attack which caused major disruption within the NHS.The criminals demanded payment in an untraceable online currency before they would hand back control of computers.Attacks possibly organised by a state against another state's institutions or infrastructure.The alleged involvement of Russian agents in the US president election would be an example of this kind of cyber-attack, if proven to be true.Starting at the bottom and working up, a few years ago the Metropolitan Police estimated that the annual number of online fraud offences nationwide would overtake all types of burglary by, at the latest, autumn 2017.That already looks spot on.In the year to June 2017, the police recorded just over 423,000 burglaries across England and Wales.The Office for National Statistics says there were 653,000 frauds - and all experts in this field think there are many more unreported incidents.Separate experimental data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, a rolling survey of our experiences, estimates there were 3.3 million frauds in the year to June - and more than half of those were "cyber-related".On top of all that, there were an additional 1.6 million incidents of "computer misuse", generally meaning hacking or virus attacks.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption GCHQ is one of the government agencies tasked with tackling cyber-crime If a hacker steals your personal data, that can be used by organised crime gangs to create fake bank cards in your name.Viruses can be used to hold machines to ransom or, without your even knowing about it, turn your PC into a "zombie" that becomes part of a global attack on a major institution.And that's where many of these individual crimes fit into a bigger picture.Since it was set up in October 2016, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) dealt with 590 "significant" incidents.The most well-known of these was the Wannacry attack, which prompted the Home Secretary to hold the first ever Cobra meeting (a government emergency response committee) dedicated to a cyber-attack.National priority So what about the response?The Home Office says cyber-crime is a national priority and the NCA plays the lead role in pursuing suspects and building the intelligence picture.It runs some investigations itself and assists others being led by detectives inside the country's regional organised crime units.But individual police forces are also under sustained pressure to up their game.While some have well-developed units, such as the Metropolitan Police's "Operation Falcon", others are struggling to recruit because they need detectives with highly specialist skills.One of the major problems is working out who is supposed to be investigating a particular incident because the crime gang behind an attack could be anywhere in the world.It's very difficult to count how many cyber-related criminals have been successfully prosecuted.Many suspects will be charged with fraud or theft offences but there's no breakdown on how many of those were related to online swindles.Only 55 people were convicted of computer misuse offences relating to hacking last year.During his interview Mr Wallace was referring to the NCA's list of the most serious cyber-incidents between October 2016 and May 2017.These are categorised by assessing the following factors: Threat and risk Public impact Financial harm Nature of the incident Victims Mr Wallace claimed: "We are getting there."Are we?The government believes it is, arguing that the NCSC is a world-beating body, backed up by expert investigators in the National Crime Agency, MI5 and GCHQ.But Parliament's Public Accounts Committee said in February that a skills shortage and "chaotic" handling of personal data breaches were undermining confidence in the government's ability to protect the UK from cyber-attacks.The MPs said ministers had taken too long to consolidate an "alphabet soup" of agencies - although some experts said the report was unfair and failed to take into account the resources now being thrown at this very modern threat.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter

Brexit: Is a last-minute deal possible?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davis tells MPs Parliament's vote on a Brexit deal may come after March 2019.The Brexit Secretary, David Davis, has suggested that Parliament might not get a vote on a Brexit deal until after March 2019.It's prompted criticism from some MPs, who are worried their votes will be meaningless because by that point, the UK will have already left the EU.Also significant is Mr Davis' claim that the European Parliament might have to wait to have its say too.According to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which the UK triggered seven months ago, the withdrawal agreement must be passed by a majority of members of the European Parliament.Even if a deal was done at "the 11th hour" as Mr Davis suggested when giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee, it would be too late for MEPs to debate it and vote it through.So the upshot of a last-minute deal could be no deal at all.The Brexit department later clarified that Mr Davis was talking about "hypothetical scenarios" and ministers are working to reach an agreement in "good time" before March 2019.It's not entirely clear what "deal" Mr Davis was referring to.The European Union has broken down the negotiations into two parts.The first focuses on the issues associated with withdrawal, such as the rights of EU citizens, the Northern Irish border and the UK's financial obligations.The second covers what our future relationship might look like, including areas such as trade, scientific research and consumer rights.The British government says it's not possible to separate the two parts, because in many respects, they're intrinsically linked.If the "deal" that Mr Davis was talking about this morning encompasses both, it must be ratified on or before 29 March 2019, which means an agreement would need to be reached in time for that.The future relationship part could be ratified after the deadline, but only if part one is rubber-stamped before the deadline.The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is hopeful of reaching a withdrawal agreement by autumn 2018 and the Brexit department said that was their aim as well.Technically it is possible to extend the Article 50 period, currently fixed at two years, if there's unanimous agreement from the 27 remaining member states.But that option would be a hard sell.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
The Houses of Parliament - a building catastrophe?:::::Image copyright Getty Images This autumn, MPs are due to debate whether they will have to leave the Houses of Parliament while it undergoes essential repairs.But could they be forced out of their iconic building by a potentially messy blockage?Turn on a gas alarm as a precaution, open a substantial iron gate and head down into a basement.The hum of machinery grows louder - and the smell grows stronger.Impressive but distinctly old-fashioned cylinders and pumps appear.An engineer accompanying me explains that these are "sewage ejectors", dating from 1888.An enterprising Victorian technology museum, you might be assuming, with working exhibits?But this is in fact the basement of the Palace of Westminster.And these Victorian antiques are all that stand between Parliament and an almighty stink.The engineer is Andrew Piper, design director for Parliament's Restoration and Renewal programme, which is planning a project lasting several years and will cost billions of pounds.Image copyright CIBSE Heritage Group Collection Image caption The original steam engine, once used to power the sewage ejectors, is still in working order He explains that "everything from the toilets, the rainwater outlets - it all comes down to this point" - before being ejected out to the main London drain.The ejectors were installed to stop London's sewage invading the buildings after heavy rainfall.And there they still are, working away, almost 130 years later.But, adds Mr Piper "we can't rely on these sorts of systems for much longer".So what happens if they suddenly fail?"If you can't use the toilets any more a building quickly becomes unusable.The end result would be potentially shutting the building down."The sewage system is just one of several growing hazards.Mr Piper and his basement maintenance team struggle with constant fire dangers.There are modern electrical cables crammed next to older asbestos-covered steam pipes.And a system of vents that could carry smoke or flames swiftly through the building.Image copyright UK Parliament Image caption Flooding in the basement of the Palace of Westminster in June 2017 The building that's meant to represent the British constitution is a kind of national monument to make do and mend, with lots of bits from different eras bolted on to each other and much left unwritten - like where all these cables and vents end up, and what they actually do.The Palace of Westminster, one of the best known buildings in the world, is in a truly terrible state.Some have known this for years.A joint committee, including MPs and peers, published a report last year which warned that the palace "faces an impending crisis which we cannot responsibly ignore"."There is a substantial and growing risk of either a single, catastrophic event, such as a major fire, or a succession of incremental failures in essential systems."Home from home So how has this happened?And what does the state of Parliament say about the state of our politics?Firstly, there's the belief that the building represents political stability.Maintenance has long been limited by MPs' insistence that nothing must stop them from sitting there.So any repairs have been crammed into recess times.And there's another layer to this psychological attachment, says Dr Caroline Shenton, historian and former parliamentary archivist.The palace, with its bars and restaurants, gym and post offices, becomes a kind of home from home for MPs and peers, giving a "daily sense of continuity and security".Add to that anxiety - in this increasingly angry, anti-politics era - about what public opinion and headline writers will say as the multi-billion cost of renewal emerges.Sheffield University's Prof Matthew Flinders, chair of the Political Studies Association of the United Kingdom, who has closely followed the Restoration and Renewal programme, says this failure to take a decision is a classic example of what political scientists call "elite blockage".The palace, he says, "casts a spell" on many who use it.It represents a kind of politics with "low expectations of public engagement" which "locks in by its design not only a two-party system but also a very masculine, adversarial kind of politics".Those who benefit leave it to others to take tough unpopular decisions in the future.Meanwhile "the building can't take it any more - we've reached a crunch point."Image copyright uk parliament Image caption The Palace of Westminster's cast iron roofs are 160 years old He would like the current problems to be seen as an opportunity - to open up the building and change the way we do politics.Public access could be greatly improved, especially for disabled people who currently struggle to enter.Others say a renovated palace would prove a huge asset as Brexit Britain tries to reinforce its international reputation.MPs are due to debate the latest restoration and renewal plan at some point this autumn.But those who have watched years of delay and disagreement don't expect swift action.So will it take a catastrophe - like the 1834 fire which destroyed the palace's predecessor - to force a change?"It's starting to look like that," says Dr Shenton.It might be that "the whole place just grinds to a halt"."In terms of British pride," warns Prof Flinders, "if we wait for a catastrophe to close down Parliament, it's going to be an absolute disaster."And as for the failure of those sewage ejectors - that would create an "elite blockage" like no other.Chris Bowlby presents Parliament - A Building Catastrophe?on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 23 October 2017 at 20:30 BST.You will be able to listen via the Radio 4 programme website or download the programme podcast.
Brexit: Why a transition period may not buy more time for talks:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davis updates Parliament on Brexit talks So the focus of the Brexit talks has shifted slightly as a result of the EU leaders' summit in Brussels.There is still plenty of tough bargaining ahead in the next few weeks, especially on the question of money.But there is also going to be more and more talk about preparing for a transition period - for what happens immediately after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.Plenty of people see transition as a way to buy a little more time to sort things out - to finalise negotiations on a future trade deal.But the UK government prefers to calls the transition phase a "period of implementation".It is not entirely clear what would be implemented.But the Brexit Secretary David Davis warned this week that without a final deal on a future partnership with the EU - at least in principle - the government would not want to trigger any kind of transition at all.Does it mean the two sides view the prospects for transition very differently?The EU27 - the other member states without the UK - have now agreed to start working on new guidelines for their negotiators.And both the EU and Theresa May (in her Florence speech) have said that any transition/implementation period would take place under "the existing structure of EU rules and regulations".There will be plenty of technical challenges: what happens, for example, to the UK's role in EU trade agreements with third countries?Those third countries might have their own opinions about that.But there is also the question of what happens during a transition period itself?It could mean roughly two more years to continue negotiations on the details of a future partnership with the EU on trade, security and a host of other issues.The Confederation of British Industry, for example, argues that in order to avoid a "cliff-edge" Brexit, negotiations on a trading agreement should continue during a transition.But UK government policy is rather different.It still argues that a deal on our "final relationship" with the rest of the EU can be completed before the UK leaves the EU at the end of March 2019.Most observers are convinced that, for practical reasons, that will not be possible - there is simply too much to do.Upping the ante But Mr Davis insisted in the House of Commons this week that if the broad outlines of a permanent deal are not in place when the UK leaves, a transition period will not be triggered.Asked by Conservative MP Rishi Sunak for reassurance that "what is meant to be a transitory state of affairs does not become a permanent bridge to nowhere", Mr Davis said: "We will try to get the nature of the implementation phase agreed as soon as possible, so that businesses can take that into account."He added: "But he's right that such a transition phase would only be triggered once we've completed the deal itself, we cannot carry on negotiating through that - our negotiating position during the transition phase would not be very strong."In other words, Mr Davis is saying - in stronger language than the government appears to have used before - that if there is no final deal by March 2019, at least in principle, then the UK would not want to trigger a transition period.The words "at least in principle" contain a fair amount of wiggle room.And the EU itself would be delighted if the outlines of a future agreement could be agreed so quickly.It says only that a withdrawal agreement (as opposed to a future trade agreement) has to be finalised in order for there to be a transition.And Article 50 simply says the withdrawal agreement must "take account of the framework for a future relationship".But Mr Davis appears to be upping the ante."No final deal" equals "no transition" equals "hard Brexit".As a negotiating tactic, it may be designed to keep the pressure on.But it may not be what many business leaders want to hear.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: How are the talks really progressing?:::::Image copyright Press association So it's come down to money.Who would have thought it?After five rounds of negotiations on Brexit, the EU remains insistent: there will be no discussions with the UK on a transition period, or on future relations, until financial commitments have been clarified.So what exactly is it about the money that is proving so difficult to resolve?It comes down to the detail (or lack of it) contained in Theresa May's carefully crafted speech in Florence.Overall, the speech was greeted across the EU with a considerable sense of relief.It suggested that progress was at least possible at a time when some countries were beginning to fear the worst.The prime minister opened the door for the UK to contribute roughly 20bn (17.9bn) to the EU budget in 2019 and 2020, so that no-one else would be out of pocket.And - crucially - she went on to say that "the UK will honour commitments we have made during the period of our membership".But EU negotiators - under clear instructions from the member states - want to know exactly what that means in practice.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The prime minister said the UK would "honour commitments" Looming large in the background is something called the Reste Liquider (RAL) - EU money that has already been committed to projects in the long-term budget but has not yet been spent.The RAL is currently running at an eye-watering 239bn, which could mean a UK share of more than 30bn.Much of it is due to be spent on big infrastructure or development projects that have been delayed.There are also pensions and contingent liabilities, such as loans to other countries, to consider.The EU isn't asking for a figure to be agreed - but for a guarantee within the negotiating process, probably in writing, that "honouring commitments" means "all commitments."'Time pressure' The UK position, on the other hand, is that the prime minister made a substantial gesture in her Florence speech, and it is in no position to move further unless it gets something in return."They are using time pressure to get more money out of us," the Brexit Secretary David Davis told the House of Commons this week."Bluntly, that is what's going on."It sounds like deadlock, but that's not necessarily the case.Three more rounds of negotiation have been suggested between this week's summit and another one in December.The hope is that a way will be found to move forward, even if it takes a moment of crisis to get there."The EU27 don't believe the UK is too far off 'sufficient progress'," says Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at the political consultancy Eurasia Group."They want Mrs May to be able to leave Brussels with a win that will enable her to strike a deal by December."That's why both sides have said they want to accelerate the negotiating process, and prepare for discussions about the future.If the language of the current draft of the summit's conclusions doesn't change much, the EU27 will agree to begin internal discussions about a transition period and the nature of a future relationship.They won't talk directly to the UK about these issues until December at the earliest.And only then if "sufficient progress" has been made on all the "divorce" arrangements, including money.It doesn't sound like much.But it's a start, and it is seen in Brussels as a carrot for the UK negotiating team.So what might the EU be likely to decide in internal discussions over the coming weeks?For EU officials involved in the negotiating process one thing about transition is clear: the more you keep things the same, the easier it will be to agree.That's why the internal deliberations among the 27 on transition could be concluded very quickly.They will probably offer to prolong all existing EU rules and regulations (the body of law known as 'the acquis') - or, to put it another way - to extend the status quo.That means that after Brexit - for "about two years" (ie for the length of a transition period) - the UK would be outside the EU's political institutions, but inside its economic arrangements.It also means the UK would have to accept EU budget payments, EU regulations and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.To put it in the formal language of the European Council's Article 50 negotiating guidelines: "Should a time-limited prolongation of Union acquis be considered, this would require existing Union regulatory, budgetary, supervisory, judiciary and enforcement instruments and structures to apply."Difficult to stomach The details of what that means are difficult for some Brexit supporters in the UK to stomach.But the prime minister, in her Florence speech, has already accepted that the framework for any transition (she prefers to call it an implementation period) would be "the existing structure of EU rules and regulations".Problems would arise, however, if the UK tried to argue for exemptions or exceptions.Take, for example, one idea that has been floated (forgive the pun): leaving the Common Fisheries Policy at the same time as the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.That doesn't really tally with the kind of transition that EU officials have in mind.Once you start unpicking the offer, all sorts of complications begin to arise.So it's not quite take it or leave it.But it's not far off.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Unpicking the agreement, such as leaving the Common Fisheries Policy, could lead to further complications There are other potential problems with a transition period that will need to be resolved.What, for example, does it mean for trade agreements with third countries, when it makes a difference whether products (or parts of products) are manufactured in the single market or not?But agreeing upon the terms of a transition will be much easier for the EU27 than agreeing on the outline of a final deal - on everything from trade to security.The 27 member states are a little more nervous about those discussions because differences of opinion are bound to emerge between them.Many countries have obviously been thinking hard about this already.One internal German government paper has been reported here.Finding a compromise But there is another issue that overshadows debate about Brexit in capitals across the EU - what exactly is it that the UK wants?Every change of emphasis in London adds to the confusion.As Finland's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Samuli Virtanen, put it this week: "It seems that at the moment the EU 27 is more unanimous than the UK 1.And that is one of the main problems here."But it all rests on finding a compromise on money.And that really has to happen before the end of this year.Otherwise time is going to start running out.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: How do other EU countries see a 'no deal'?:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that "concrete progress" was being made in talks so far European Union leaders are meeting in Brussels and at the top of their agenda is a review of the Brexit negotiations.They are demanding better clarifications from the UK over its financial commitments, and the impasse has led to a lot of talk of a "no deal" Brexit.We ask journalists covering the summit how their countries view the possibility of no formal agreement between the UK and the EU.Germany: Daniel Brssler, Sddeutsche Zeitung Brussels correspondent The German thinking now is that a "no deal" scenario is not what you want - of course it would have an impact on British-German trade.But my impression is that the German government thinks that a bad deal, from the European perspective, would be even worse.They are saying we need a fair deal.But if there is no deal we will survive it, it will be tough but the EU will survive it - and Germany has a lot of trade with the rest of Europe.So far the talks are not seen in Germany as having broken down - people think there is still time to make a deal, that enough progress might be made in December.But people see that there is a risk.Politicians see responsibility for this on the British side - and Brexit has already estranged us to a certain degree.There is a feeling of them and us, you can see a pretty strict mood in Berlin.People say we need a fair deal, but there is no mood to have a deal just to please the British.Denmark: Lotte Mejlhede, TV2 News correspondent I don't think any country in Europe wants a "no deal" result.Business people and politicians in Denmark are very interested in having a good future trade deal with the UK.Denmark has quite a lot of trade with the UK, and we have an issue with the fishing quotas.Some Eurosceptic politicians want to join the UK outside the EU, but in general the attitude is that we're better off staying in, and that's also because of our size - our population is 5.5 million, and it's quite hard to do big trade deals alone.When the UK leaves, the axis of the EU will be France and Germany.Now I think everybody is hoping for a deal.But we know businesses are also preparing for the worst-case scenario.Poland: Maciej Sokolowski, TVN24 News correspondent People in Poland were just waiting for the announcement on Wednesday by the British Prime Minister [Theresa May] that everyone living in the UK can stay there with the same rights as today.That's the most important thing for Poles living in the UK, the guarantee that they can stay.The change of tone was really important.There were rumours like: "Do we have to go back to Poland?"and "Do we have to leave our jobs now?"Brexit isn't the main topic now in Poland.Of course there's about a million Polish people in the UK, but Poles are not talking much about the money, or the Ireland issue.On freedom of movement - the UK isn't in the Schengen area, so it shouldn't be much worse after Brexit.But no-one knows now what no deal really means.We still see the UK as our biggest friend in the EU, with Hungary.So after Brexit it will be a political problem for Poland, being without our main friend in the EU.Spain: Adolfo Lorente, El Correo correspondent Ordinary people don't understand what has happened with the UK.The situation is very complicated.We read that the UK is very angry with the EU, that it doesn't want to pay the bill.People don't understand the economic impact, but it's very important for Spain - we export fruit, wine.Many Spanish people go to Britain to learn English or work.Now there is a lot of doubt - people ask "What is happening with Brexit?"and "What about exports and passports?"It's like the situation with Catalonia - Spanish people feel that they don't want to be with us, they want to be separate.But we think that being together, united, is better.Gibraltar is also a big issue for us.Patriotism in Spain is very high now.Theresa May's support for Spain over Catalonia in exchange for [Spanish PM] Mariano Rajoy's support over Brexit is a real possibility.Some diplomats here in Brussels smile and say it's possible.
London's role in the Russian Revolution:::::Image caption The Islington pub where Bolsheviks and Mensheviks argued fiercely during the 1903 party congress In August 1903, a small band of dedicated but argumentative political activists held a fractious conference in London.It consisted of Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky and about 50 other committed agitators who wanted to overthrow the autocratic rule of the Russian Tsar.Their quarrels might have seemed minor at the time, but they have rippled out across history.This was when the Russian revolutionary movement divided into the two rival factions of Bolsheviks and Mensheviks.And a key vote happened in a pub in Islington.The Bolsheviks, described as the 'hards' and led by Lenin, wanted a tightly centralised and disciplined political party; the Mensheviks or 'softs' favoured a looser, broader-based alliance with sympathetic forces.Over the following years, as issues and affiliations shifted, their differences fluctuated but were to become deeper.Fourteen years later, in the second (October) revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks took power, sidelining and defeating the Mensheviks, and went on to form the Soviet Union.At the 1903 congress in London, where the split emerged, Lenin's faction narrowly lost the vote on the nature of party membership.But then seven anti-Lenin delegates walked out over other disagreements, and with his opponents depleted, his side then won a crucial vote on the editorial board for the party's journal.Pub venues This outcome enabled Lenin to call his group the Bolsheviks, meaning 'majority' in Russian, while his rivals became the Mensheviks or 'minority'.The bitter dispute prompted uproar in the meeting.According to Richard Mullin, a researcher into early Russian Marxism, Lenin's notes indicate that the tumultuous session took place in the Three Johns pub in Islington.Image caption The Whitechapel building where Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky and others arrived for the 1907 congress "The 1903 London congress is regarded as decisive in the development of Bolshevism - it's hugely significant", says Neil Faulkner, author of A People's History of the Russian Revolution.But of course its significance is seen differently according to different political viewpoints."Most people on the revolutionary left would say this is the decisive break between revolution and reform," explains Dr Faulkner."A lot of liberal commentators would see it as the tiny seed from which ultimately grows the gulags and the labour camps of the 1930s."To avoid being monitored during their conference, the Russians moved from venue to venue over a fortnight, often using meeting rooms in pubs recommended by friendly British trade unionists.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Leon Trotsky met Lenin for the first time in London The first session in London occurred in a club in Charlotte Street in central London.Otherwise most of these locations are unknown today.The 1903 congress had actually started in Brussels, but after harassment from the Belgian police it moved to London.The British authorities showed more acceptance of exiled Russian revolutionary activities than did many other European countries.This comparative tolerance meant that some other key events in the history of the Russian revolutionary movement also happened in Britain.The 1907 party congress moved to London after being banned in Denmark, Sweden and Norway.This was a much bigger affair of more than 300 delegates, following an outbreak of major social unrest against the Tsar in Russia in 1905.The congress took place in the Brotherhood Church in Hackney, which has since been knocked down and replaced by a housing development.Those present included almost all the future leaders of the Bolshevik revolution, including Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin (a minor figure at the time), Zinoviev, Kamenev and Litvinov, as well as the prominent Russian writer Maxim Gorky.This was the last full congress of the party until after the revolution.Image caption Lenin briefly lived in Tavistock Place in Bloomsbury, central London in 1908 The participants first registered for the conference at a building in Fulbourne Street, Whitechapel, which still stands today.At the time it was a Jewish socialist club.Stalin and Maxim Litvinov (who later became Soviet foreign minister) stayed in a doss house nearby in Fieldgate Street, which has since been converted into a somewhat more salubrious block of flats.The conference saw further disputes between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks.One issue for discussion was whether to approve the use of bank robberies to help fund revolutionary activities.Most delegates could only afford the trip back to Russia when the impoverished party secured a loan from an eccentric soap manufacturing London businessman who was inspired by watching conference proceedings.A few years earlier Lenin had spent 12 months in London, in 1902-3.He mainly divided his time between researching and writing at the British Museum reading room, and editing a revolutionary journal, Iskra ("The Spark").'Lenin room' In the reading room he studied works on economics and on the Russian peasantry.Lenin was able to obtain books which would have been confiscated in Russia, and was rather impressed by the British state's commitment to the library, telling a friend: "The British bourgeoisie do not spare any money as far as this institution is concerned, and that is as it should be."On his various visits to London, Lenin generally stayed around the Bloomsbury area, so that he had easy access to the museum.In 1902 Iskra was produced in London and smuggled across Europe into Russia.Lenin was provided with an office and printing facilities by a supportive left-wing publishing company.Image caption The 'Lenin room' in the Marx Memorial Library This building is now the Marx Memorial Library in Clerkenwell.They have preserved what they call 'the Lenin room' with busts of him, old editions of the journal, and copies of Lenin's voluminous collected works.A map on the wall outside shows the smuggling routes used.For Lenin, the journal was crucial both for building up a network of revolutionary activists and also for spreading the political analysis he favoured.It was in London, in October 1902, that Lenin and Trotsky met for the first time.The pair discussed the political circumstances of Russia, but Lenin also showed Trotsky the sights of London.When they went past the Houses of Parliament, Lenin said to his companion "that is their famous Westminster".Trotsky later wrote it was obvious that by "their", Lenin didn't mean it was the British parliament, he meant it was the ruling class's parliament.Yet it was that parliament, and the system it represented, which gave Lenin, Trotsky and their comrades the political freedom to pursue their goals.Martin Rosenbaum is the presenter of The British Road to Bolshevism on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 on Monday, 16 October 2017.You can follow Martin Rosenbaum on Twitter as @rosenbaum6
Fires, floods and mice: What it's like to work in a crumbling Parliament:::::Image copyright Houses of Parliament The Palace of Westminster's famous towers, gilt and gargoyles exude grandeur.But descending into the basement which runs underneath the Houses of Parliament inspires a different kind of awe - alarm and anxiety.To go on a tour of the cavernous corridors below the building is to enter a seemingly never-ending network of claustrophobic passageways lined with huge tangles of protruding wires and pipes, taped up here and there, leaking, hot to the touch.Faults go unmended because the pipes are so entwined they cannot be safely dismantled, and boiling steam rushes through ancient plumbing all day and night because engineers are afraid if they switched it off they would not be able to get it back on again.The overall impression is of a temporary fix ready to give way to flood or fire at any moment.The team charged with keeping the whole thing ticking over says the basement gives the clearest image of how precarious the situation is.But increasingly the sticking plasters fall off and the failing fabric of the building gives way, making it difficult for the people who work there to do their jobs.What's it like inside Parliament?One assistant to a Conservative MP told the BBC that all the staff in her office on the lower-ground floor of the Palace had to relocate twice while asbestos was removed, and again after a pipe burst in the corridor.On one occasion, she was working in her office when a light fitting fell from the ceiling on to her desk.Image copyright Anonymous Image caption Staff have had to move offices repeatedly due to asbestos "They've taken the approach of just putting plasters on problems rather than overhauling it," she says, "so overall it's just a bit dodgy.""The walkway to the car park is usually so flooded underneath that the floor panels bounce around and your shoes get soaked."A Labour researcher recalled an occasion a few years ago when the toilets above Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw's office "leaked through and dripped onto papers, leaving horrid smells".The sight of mice running around is so commonplace that several parliamentary workers only mentioned it in passing, saying, "oh yeah, we've got loads" or "the place is riddled with them".A parliamentary spokesman said: "Providing a physical working environment that is as safe as we can possibly make it is an absolute priority."Image copyright Houses of Parliament Image caption Overloaded and unsafe wiring carries the constant risk of fire The Labour MP Meg Hillier has investigated options for the restoration of Parliament as chair of the Public Accounts Committee, but also has personal experience of doing battle with the dilapidated surroundings.She told the BBC of the "hole in the carpet which you have to remember where it is otherwise your foot goes through it".She added: "The plugs in my office buzz and spark - I take extra care to switch them all off before I leave because I'm terrified of a fire starting in there."The head of engineering on the estate, Andy Piper, says that if a fire were to start everyone could be evacuated, but at present he is not confident the building could be saved as it would not be safe for firefighters to enter.Warnings from history It's estimated that 60 small fires have started on the estate over the past 10 years, and 24 fire inspectors patrol the grounds on rotation.Caroline Shenton, author of several books on the history of the building, points out that concerns raised by MPs and architects in the 1830s about the condition of the accommodation went unanswered.Image copyright Hulton Archive/Getty Images Image caption Historians see parallels with the warnings that preceded the 1834 fire In 1834, a massive fire destroyed both Houses of Parliament and other buildings on the site."I do see a parallel because there had been years of attempts to change the accommodation, and the squabbles were exactly the same - over symbolism and expense," she says.Alexandra Meakin, a former clerk in Parliament and research associate at the University of Sheffield, summarises the situation as "desperate".She points out that most of the electricity and plumbing was originally put in after World War II and went out of date in the 1960s and 70s.Why has nothing happened?It's now been over a year since a specially convened committee recommended a complete relocation of all staff from the Palace of Westminster to allow major restoration works to take place.Image copyright Houses of Parliament Image caption Buckets catch leaks in the peers' Not Content lobby "Major" does not do justice to the scale of the programme - the head engineer at Parliament told the BBC there wasn't any comparable project in the UK."People liken it to restoring a cathedral or a stately home, but that doesn't come close - and those places would not have hundreds of people working there, as well as being the seat of government."Even if the government were to give the green light tomorrow, it would take several years just to move people out and get reconstruction started.So why wait?There are some who believe it's essential for MPs to remain in place at all costs, and would prefer repairs to take place around them.As Conservative Sir Edward Leigh put it earlier this year: "This is not an office block.If it were I would agree we should move out, but it is not."It is the centre of the nation and the nation should keep its debating chamber in this building."Image copyright PA Image caption Can the government find time to restore Parliament while it debates Brexit?Others are of the view that there are better uses for 3.6bn - especially with the social housing shortage in the spotlight.Another Conservative MP, Shailesh Vara, summarised it thus: "When we are writing to our constituents and saying that they cannot have an additional few pounds for whatever they are seeking money for, do we really want to go to the public and say that, nevertheless, we want to spend billions of pounds on our place of work?"Meg Hillier doesn't buy this argument, reasoning: "The public aren't going to have much confidence in us if we can't keep our own house from falling down."What next?From a procedural perspective, a motion approving the restoration has to be brought forward and passed in government time.There has been speculation ministers are shying away from bringing it forward as they face the not-insignificant task of legislating for Brexit.Former Parliamentary clerk Alexandra Meakin says: "Given the cost of the programme, and the fear of media hostility - particularly in the wake of the Big Ben furore - there is very little incentive for the government to hold the debate."A spokesman for the leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom denied this, telling the BBC: "Discussions are ongoing within Parliament and efforts to arrive at a consensus continue."As Parliament resumes after recess, this could be the session in which MPs finally take action.But in the meantime, as one member of House services put it: "We are prisoners of the building's historic and iconic significance."
Brexit: What would 'no deal' look like?:::::Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption UK Brexit Secretary David Davis and Chief EU Negotiator Michel Barnier say they both want a deal There's a lot of discussion at the moment about a 'no deal' Brexit.What does that actually mean?It seems to mean slightly different things to different people.But in the current context it basically means that there would be no formal agreement reached during the negotiations between the UK and the EU, which are taking place under the terms of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.These are the negotiations that are led by David Davis for the UK and Michel Barnier for the EU - the fifth round of talks is being held in Brussels this week.Even if there is no deal under Article 50, there would still have to be some kind of formal relationship between the UK and the EU in the long term - for trade, security and every other aspect of bilateral ties.But if the Article 50 process fails there is very little time to work on alternative strategies before Brexit in March 2019.When would we know if there was going to be a 'no deal' Brexit?This is an important question because the timing is critical.One scenario, being pushed by some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs, is that if the current negotiations make no progress - and the EU refuses to move on to talk about a future trade deal - the UK should announce that it will pursue a 'no deal' Brexit instead.Leave supporters believe that would free the UK from all EU structures in one fell swoop.If such a decision were to be made in, say, March 2018 there would still be a year before the UK is due to leave the EU.That's very little time to prepare for such a massive change, but it would be better than nothing.A more worrying scenario for many business leaders, and millions of citizens who are caught up in the Brexit process, is that something could go wrong at the very last minute - perhaps a deal that has been tentatively agreed but is subsequently rejected by one side or the other.Then the UK could crash out of the EU with neither side fully prepared for the consequences.This is the 'cliff edge' that gives many people in business and politics sleepless nights - a chaotic Brexit that would benefit no one.Are preparations for 'no deal' already taking place?Yes they are - on both sides of the Channel.The UK government has been careful to say that it is not seeking a 'no deal' outcome, but that it has to be prepared for all eventualities.The Prime Minister has tried to move away from an emphasis on her initial message that "no deal is better than a bad deal" - but when pushed she continues to defend that stance.So there is a combination here of prudent planning behind the scenes, and public statements which aim to have an impact on the negotiations - trying to hurry things up by warning of possible alternatives.For the EU, the President of the European Council Donald Tusk has been very clear, arguing that no deal would be the worst deal of all."A no-deal scenario would be bad for everyone," he said earlier this year, "but above all for the UK."Contingency planning is also happening elsewhere in the EU, though - within both governments and the business community.The Federation of German Industries (BDI) said last week that it was setting up a task force of major companies to make provisions for the "serious case of a very hard exit."Anything else, it said, would be nave.What would 'no deal' mean in practice?If the two-year Article 50 process came to an end with no agreement, the UK would leave the EU on 29 March 2019 with no deal in place.Again, much would then depend on how long both sides have had to prepare for this.The consequences of 'no deal' would affect almost every aspect of life, and it is impossible to say exactly how events would unfold.But here are a few examples: Money: With no agreement in place, according to a House of Lords report there would be no legal obligation for the UK to make any payment as part of a financial settlement.That would leave a huge hole in the EU budget.It would save the UK money in this instance, but it would antagonise the rest of the EU and further sour relations.Legal action, possibly via the International Court of Justice in The Hague, could not be ruled out.Citizens: Without a deal or other residency rights, the entitlement of EU nationals to reside in the UK, or of UK nationals to reside elsewhere in the EU, could technically disappear overnight.In theory, they could become third country nationals, subject to domestic immigration rules.Given the fact that this would affect more than three million EU citizens in the UK, and nearly a million UK citizens in the EU, it could well be that individual EU countries would try to strike deals with the UK to guarantee citizens' rights.Common sense should prevail, but that cannot be guaranteed.Trade: With no new trade agreement with the EU, the rules of the World Trade Organisation would apply.Tariffs would be imposed on goods that the UK sends to the EU, and on goods the EU sends to the UK.It would not be the frictionless trade - certainly to begin with - that the government hopes to promote.Tariffs on many industrial products would be 2-3%, but on cars they would be 10% and on many agricultural products between 20% and 40%.The trade in services would also suffer if nothing was agreed in advance.Under a pure 'no deal' scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each individual country.The financial services industry would be particularly vulnerable, and it accounts for a significant slice of the UK economy.Again it is worth emphasising that all these restrictions would apply to EU businesses wanting to trade in the UK as well.'No deal' is not a one-way street.Without any deal, and with no transition period negotiated, the UK would be free to sign trade agreements around the world as soon as it could finalise them.How might it try to go about this?There are a few pointers here.Customs: A government White Paper on customs, published yesterday, sets out options for a 'no deal' scenario in more detail.A customs bill will make provision for the UK to establish a stand-alone customs regime from day one, applying the same duties to every country with which it has no special deal.Image copyright Getty Images Traders would need to present goods to HM Revenue and Customs "inland as much as possible" to avoid congestion at ports, and consignments would need to be pre-notified to customs authorities, to try to ensure that trade continues to flow as seamlessly as possible.The White Paper promises to minimise disruption for business and travellers - but to give some idea of the scale of the challenge, HMRC estimates that about 130,000 businesses that export to the EU would be dealing with customs for the first time.'No deal' is not the government's preferred option; and the detail in the customs paper hints at how disruptive it could be.The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would, in particular, be a huge concern, with serious ramifications for the Northern Ireland peace process.Regulations: With no deal of any kind in place, the UK would suddenly cease to be a member of dozens of regulatory agencies that govern many aspects of daily life.In time, it would need to replace all of them with agencies of its own.Thousands of new employees would need to be recruited and trained - a process which should have already started if there were to be any chance of it being completed before Brexit.EU bodies that regulate the aviation industry and the pharmaceutical industry are often cited as prime examples.One of the main concerns associated with a 'cliff edge' Brexit is that there would be no time to put new measures in place, even if plenty of contingency planning had been done.In theory - under a worst case scenario - that could mean that planes would be grounded temporarily, and drugs could not be imported.But again, the hope would be that common sense would prevail, and that some kind of interim arrangements would be made to keep things moving.It would be in the interests of neither the UK nor the EU for chaos to ensue.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
SNP conference: Is the childcare pledge 'unmatched'?:::::The claim: Nicola Sturgeon told her party conference that the Scottish government's commitment to early years education and childcare was "unmatched anywhere else in the UK" as she fleshed out plans to expand childcare provision.Reality Check verdict: Overall, Scotland's planned childcare provision would be the most generous in the UK, as it plans to offer 1,140 hours a year, regardless of whether parents are in work.However, a pilot scheme under way in Wales is better for working parents as it offers 1,440 hours a year.When Nicola Sturgeon took to the stage at the SNP conference, she said she was committed to giving children in Scotland "the best possible start in life".She confirmed that the Scottish government would increase its offer of free childcare from 16 hours a week to 30 hours for three- and four-year-olds, as well as vulnerable two-year-olds, by 2020.And she pledged to double investment in early years education and childcare, from 420m to 840m a year, by the end of the current parliament."This is a commitment unmatched anywhere else in the UK," she said."And it's the best investment we can make in Scotland's future."The first minister's office confirmed that what she meant was that the universality of care offered to children north of the border would be better than that provided in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.Reality Check has looked into the claims.Image copyright Getty Images Parents of three- and four-year-olds and vulnerable two-year-olds in Scotland are currently offered 600 hours of free childcare a year.It works out at roughly 16 hours a week over 38 weeks of the year but families can choose to spread the hours over a longer period.The Scottish government wants to increase annual childcare provision to 1,140 hours by 2020.Funded childcare is currently offered to all families in Scotland - regardless of the employment status of their parents.That is where Nicola Sturgeon's plans differ from those in practice across the rest of the UK.England All families in England are currently offered 570 free hours a year.However, where both parents (or one in single-parent families) work more than 16 hours a week, they are entitled to 1,140 hours a year.Wales In Wales, a pilot scheme is under way where working families in seven authorities are offered 1,440 hours of childcare a year.That works out at 30 hours a week over 48 weeks.As in England, it is available only to families where both parents (or one in a single-parent family) work more than 16 hours a week.Every child in Wales is eligible for 10 hours of early years education a week, from the term after their third birthday.That is incorporated into the 30 free hours in the pilot areas.Northern Ireland Families in Northern Ireland can access between 12.5 and 22.5 hours of funded pre-school education a week over 38 weeks for all three- and four-year-olds.One of the key actions of the NI executive's draft programme for government was to "extend responsive, high-quality provision in early childhood education and care" for families with young children.However, Northern Ireland has been without an executive for 10 months, following a row between the DUP and Sinn Fein.The parties are in discussions to restore the government.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Poll tracker: Concern rises over handling of Brexit talks:::::After a pause for the Labour and Conservative party conferences the next round of opinion polls is hotly anticipated.They will be closely scrutinised in an attempt to gauge whether the problems that beset Theresa May's speech have any impact on how the public perceives her.And whether any of the parties have been able to attract new supporters with their conference policy announcements.A first post-conference poll from YouGov suggests little has changed in terms of voting intention but May's personal ratings might have taken a hit.But there are several more to come over the next few days which should give us a clearer picture.Throughout the summer, the Westminster voting intention polls were remarkably stable.Labour did not quite retain the level of support they had immediately after the general election but on average they held on to a narrow lead over the Conservatives.There was no perceptible movement for the smaller parties either.On leader satisfaction, Theresa May's rating improved a little.She still has a negative rating, meaning more voters disapprove of her or think she's doing a bad job than the opposite, but it has become a bit less negative.Opinium, Ipsos MORI and BMG all show a small improvement.And on the question of who would make the best prime minister, Mrs May has restored her lead over Jeremy Corbyn.Polls from YouGov, Opinium and Ipsos Mori all put the Labour leader behind by a gap of about 7-10% - although this lead has shrunk in YouGov's post-conference poll.Brexit split Despite some over-excited headlines, there's no clear evidence of a major shift in opinion about Brexit - at least in terms of whether people think the 2016 vote to leave was right or wrong, or how they'd vote in the event of another referendum.Over a period of many months there may have been a very slight shift in favour of remain.But the overall picture is that the country is still pretty much split down the middle.Where there has been movement is in the public's perception of how the government is handling Brexit negotiations.After Theresa May's Lancaster House speech in January, YouGov and ORB reported a marked increase in the number of people who said the government was doing well.By the time the general election was called a majority of respondents approved of the government's performance on this issue.Since the election, that trend has undergone a sharp reverse.In their latest poll, YouGov found that 61% of respondents thought the government was doing badly compared to only 21% who thought it was doing well.With "don't knows" removed, ORB reported 36% of people approving and 64% disapproving.As Professor John Curtice has pointed out, May's Florence speech has not had the same effect as her earlier one.
Organ donation opt-out plan: What do people waiting for transplants think?:::::Image copyright Julie Bartlett Image caption Heart failure left Julie exhausted and grey-skinned - a pump has brought the colour back to her cheeks and given her a good quality of life At home, Julie Bartlett has her bags packed and people on standby to drive her to hospital, just in case she receives a phone call saying doctors have a heart that is a match for her.If the call comes, she'll have a couple of hours to get to Harefield Hospital in west London - she can even rely on a police escort if she gets stuck in traffic."That call could be this afternoon.It could be never," she says, but she's optimistic that government plans for a new organ donation system of presumed consent in England might boost her chances significantly.While the policy content of Theresa May's conference speech on Wednesday might have been overlooked, one of the prime minister's announcements could potentially save many lives - about three people a day in the UK die because of a lack of organ donors.The Conservatives are proposing a consultation on changing the organ donation system in England from opt-in to opt-out, meaning people's organs could be used in transplants when they died unless they expressly said otherwise.Currently, anyone who wants to donate their organs after death has to "opt in" through the donor card scheme.There are currently 6,500 people waiting for an organ donation and it is hoped the new system would see more organs becoming available.What do people waiting for an organ, and recent recipients of life-saving transplants, think of the proposed changes?Life in limbo Last Christmas, former midwife Julie Bartlett was fitted with an LVAD - a mechanical pump for the heart known as a "bridge to transplant" - but what she really needs is a new heart."I could kiss Theresa May - although she's got that bad cold," she said."It was something that I have been waiting for, for a long a time - the sooner they do it, the better."In 2009, Julie was diagnosed with heart failure and never expected to see her first grandchild or go to her daughter's wedding.After it became end-stage heart failure and she was in a hospice, the option of the LVAD was presented to her."My quality of life is good now, but I have good days and bad days," she says.The LVAD means Julie is permanently attached to two lines, has to recharge batteries overnight and can shower only weekly because of the wound."There are limits, but I'm very blessed to have one and it's better than being bedbound in a hospice," she says.However, a new heart would transform her life.It would even free her to travel abroad, as while on the waiting list she must stay in the UK.Freedom While she waits for that heart, Julie lives in limbo.She believes families should have the final decision over donation, as they do under the Welsh "soft opt-out" system - where if the individual's family objects, their organs are not removed."Families need to share what their wishes are, so they are less likely to go against the person's wishes.It's a gift," she said.Image caption Matthew's new kidneys allow him to "do what normal boys do" The Victoria Derbyshire programme spoke to 12-year old Matthew Pietrzyk, who spent eight years on dialysis after he was born with failing kidneys which had to be removed.He and his mum Nicola told the programme that the transplant has not only "given him his life back" but had also transformed those of his brothers and parents.The family can now go on holiday and make plans without the fear of emergency hospital visits.Nicola said she can finally "be a mum" instead of a nurse.Matthew believes that the new opt-out scheme will "save lives".But another patient in need of a kidney donor is not so impressed with the proposals.Kerigh Palmer, from Hertfordshire, whose first kidney transplant failed this summer, said the change would be "pointless" because, under the system the government is proposing, families could still stop donations."The majority of possible transplants are blocked by family members," she says."I don't think doctors should be saying 'these are your loved one's wishes, now what do you want to do?'""It takes away the individual's choice."Image copyright Kerigh Palmer Image caption Kerigh Palmer does not think the new opt-out scheme goes far enough Kerigh's transplant story has been long and full of hurt.After her kidneys failed in 2015, her wife, Julie, offered to donate hers.But they weren't compatible so Julie donated to another patient, and Kerigh, 40, received hers from someone else.Julie's recipient's transplant was a success.Kerigh's, though, was not - complications during surgery meant it failed at the last hurdle.As she drifted in and out of consciousness after the operation, she heard the words: "We are very sorry that it did not work.""Is it true?"she asked Julie, who was lying in a hospital bed nearby."It was devastating.That person is living with my kidney effectively.We feel pretty bitter."Image copyright Kerigh Palmer Image caption Julie, left, saved another kidney patient's life.But the kidney Kerigh received did not transplant successfully Straight after the gruelling failed operation, she was back on dialysis twice a week."I'm trying not to think about what's happened, because I will depress myself."I'm thinking ahead to Christmas, because I love Christmas.I'm not thinking 'where's my next kidney coming from?'"But she admits it would be life-changing to have a successful transplant."I wouldn't be tied to the hospital, I could work full-time without having to work from hospital, I could go abroad on holiday, eat what I like, not have to second-guess everything I do."
What does the future hold for the Greens?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Greens told to look on the bright side after disappointing election At a meat-free conference in the pretty surrounds of Harrogate, Green Party members have been digesting their disappointing election result in June, when they polled around 525,000 votes - half their previous tally - and ended up with a vote share of just 1.6%.But while the mood among the few hundred delegates gathered in Yorkshire is reflective - it's certainly not despondent.Yes, party members admit, the snap election caught them off guard and they were squeezed by Jeremy Corbyn's resurgent Labour party, whose agenda encroached on territory previously claimed by the Greens.And there has been considerable debate about whether the party was right to stand aside 22 candidates in marginal seats to give Labour or the Lib Dems a clear run at trying to beat the Tories.One of those candidates told me she thought Green voters should have been able to choose the party they wanted to, and that anyone prone to making tactical choices would have done so anyway.Another described the decision as "surrender" - seeing as there was no real payback from Labour or the Lib Dems by coming out strongly for electoral reform.There are others though (including the leadership) who believe the hung parliament was, in part, a consequence of the Greens not fielding candidates in certain seats - and that it demonstrated a spirit of co-operation among parties.But generally - across the conference, there is a sense of optimism that the Greens do still have a place and a role."Speaking truth to power" was the slogan of co-leader Jonathan Bartley's speech.He said that from opposing fracking to being anti-austerity, the Greens had consistently set the agenda and their ideas were now "common currency".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Green Party stood aside for other candidates in 22 constituencies at the general election On issues such as tackling climate change, he said the Greens' "voice of truth" had never been more important.And there was his commitment to a second Brexit referendum - on the final deal agreed with Brussels, a passionate defence of free movement of people and a claim that Britain's future was better in the EU.But the party also wanted to make a case for a new economy - a Green economy - with people and the environment at its heart.His speech on Monday was a morale-boosting address - to rally the troops and reassure them the Greens are still relevant.
David Guetta, Theresa May and the politics of the conference playlist:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption David Guetta's Titanium was often heard at the Tory conference There's not much to do while you're waiting for political leaders to start their party conference speeches - so attention often turns to their choice of warm-up music.But now the parties have packed up for another year, what can we glean from their choices - particularly the Tories' apparent fondness for French DJ David Guetta?Straight after Theresa May's eventful speech, two of pop's big names, Calvin Harris and Florence Welch, followed the time-honoured tradition of complaining about their songs being used.But it was Titanium, a 2012 chart-topper by Guetta and Australian singer Sia, that was by far the most-played track at this year's Conservative conference in Manchester.Earlier this year, Guetta told the Financial Times he was "never into politics" - and his mother was a communist who disapproved of her son "chasing materialistic dreams".But it's the track's lyrics, not its writer, that caught the pundits' attention.Coverage of Mrs May's speech was dominated by her struggle to finish it (she had a cough and was interrupted by a prankster) and the PM has been dogged by questions about her leadership throughout the conference.So when Sia sings "I'm criticised but all your bullets ricochet, you shoot me down, but I get up, I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose, fire away, fire away," it seemed pertinent to some in the auditorium."You can always find meaning in songs political parties decide to play but [Titanium] is particularly poignant," said New Statesman journalist Anoosh Chakelian, pointing to the chorus line: "You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium.""[That] is May's position after losing her majority but staying in her job."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Did 2012 chart-topper Titanium sum up Theresa May's tricky speech?A less sympathetic verdict was offered by 23-year-old party member Sophie Jarvis, who said the Guetta track was more relevant to "2012 Ibiza"."To me it sounded like the playlist was put together by a 40-year-old thinking they're down with the kids," she says.During her ill-fated general election campaign, Mrs May was accused of appearing "robotic" - a criticism she rejected, although she did admit the campaign - which was characterised by repetitions of its "strong and stable" slogan - was "too scripted"."Theresa May repeatedly asserts she is not robotic," said Eliza Easton, a policy researcher who was at the conference."But Titanium, a song about a metallic woman unaffected by her challengers, is playing on repeat at the conference."A party spokesman did not confirm how the playlist was selected or whether the prime minister was involved.For the record, when Mrs May was asked in 2014 to choose her eight favourite songs on the BBC Radio 4 programme Desert Island Discs, her choices were mainly classical and did not include anything by David Guetta.Just before the PM's big speech, Home Secretary Amber Rudd told BBC Radio 5 live the Tories had got their "mojo back" - and the playlist was certainly upbeat.Besides Titanium, the most popular tune on the conference floor in Manchester was Journey's rousing 1981 hit Don't Stop Believing.Titanium and Don't Stop Believing suggest a theme, according to Spectator journalist Katy Balls."I think [the Conservatives] are trying to suggest they are resilient in times of difficulty, like now."Image caption Australian electronic music duo Empire of the Sun were chosen by Labour for its conference playlist The Tories' conference followed Labour's version in Brighton and the Liberal Democrats' in Bournemouth."Endless repetition of the same song is a common feature of these conferences," says Anoosh Chakelian, adding that Killers hit All These Things That I've Done was a particular favourite with the Conservatives during the David Cameron years.Katy Balls was also at Labour's conference in Brighton last week, and found the mood more positive."Labour tried to suggest they were ready for power," she says."A song I remember most is Empire of the Sun - We Are the People (Who Rule the World)."Beatles classic Here Comes the Sun ("the smiles returning to the faces...I feel that ice is slowly melting") was played before Jeremy Corbyn took to the stage in a speech where he said his party was now united and ready for government.Choosing the conference playlist for Brighton was a "team effort", says Mr Corbyn's spokesman, who did not confirm whether there was an intentional theme.As it turned out it was the songs sung from the stage in Brighton - Tom Watson with Oh, Jeremy Corbyn and the leader himself with a rendition of Happy Birthday for Diane Abbott - that caught the attention.
Do Tories think Corbyn could be next PM?:::::They used to see Jeremy Corbyn as an unelectable throwback to the 1970s - but that was before the general election.Do Conservatives now think he could be the next prime minister?"I am afraid I have to say yes.That doesn't appeal to me but I can see it."Like many Conservatives who were in Manchester this week Ron Allcock is struggling to get his head round the idea of the Labour leader as a credible opponent."He is grabbing all the headlines and people are now thinking 'well, he isn't a bad guy after all'.It's astonishing.Really astonishing."Image caption Ron Allcock says the party needs to do something "dramatic" What worries the 80-year-old Chelmsford councillor is that Mr Corbyn appears to have grown in confidence since the general election and that young people still appear to be flocking to his side."We have to think of something really dramatic to get their attention," he says.Everyone you speak to here admits they underestimated the Labour leader - but opinions are divided over how to fight back.Image caption Jane Hunt and Hilary Fryers think the Corbyn bubble will burst Some, such as Jane Hunt, whose dreams of unseating Labour's Lilian Greenwood in Nottingham South crashed and burned in June, believe the Corbyn bubble will burst."We need to get through the stage where Jeremy Corbyn is sexy.He is going through a phase where people think he is a Messiah almost.That will soon die off.It's built on absolutely nothing as far as I can see."Like others you speak to, she claims Mr Corbyn "hoodwinked" young people by promising to abolish tuition fees and "sort" their debts."I am afraid I think the students were absolutely conned and I think they will switch off from politics once they realise they've been conned.They'll be switched off for a generation and that's really unfortunate."It certainly cost her her own chances, she says, as students queued up outside polling stations to cast a ballot for her opponent, who got 10,000 extra votes.Mrs Hunt's friend, Hilary Fryers, from Market Harborough, agrees that Corbynmania is "built on sand" and will eventually crumble.Image caption Anthony Clarke says the election campaign was too negative Some Tories - including Theresa May's Parliamentary aide George Hollingberry - believe it was a mistake to attack Mr Corbyn on his record at the general election."It's not good just harping back to the 1970s, talking about Hamas, trying to do Jeremy Corbyn down, there's a message out there that people are listening to and we've got to tell them why it's dangerous, why it's wrong for the country and why they shouldn't fall for it," he told BBC Radio 4.Anthony Clarke, the election agent for former Bath MP Ben Howlett, who lost his seat to Liberal Democrat Wera Hobhouse in June, says many Tory voters were turned off by the relentless attacks on Mr Corbyn's character."You could argue that we would have done much better if we ignored him, sidelined him," he says.Image caption Diana Beech says Corbyn's polices need to be 'unpicked' But he has his doubts about whether the Labour leader will ever walk through the doors of Number 10."He is potentially quite a difficult opponent, for one reason or another.I still don't rate him as somebody who is capable of ruling this country."When we have got Brexit out of the way and everything has settled down I don't think he will be in that position."One thing everyone does agree on is that the party urgently needs to do more to attract younger voters."I think there is such a momentum growing out there, to coin a phrase", says Diana Beech, director of policy and advocacy for the Higher Education Policy Institute, and a Conservative Party member, "People feel disillusioned.They want change.I just think there is a growing momentum from the grassroots, helped by social media."But she does not think the party should try to ape Jeremy Corbyn's policies."I think the only way to bring it down is to unpick the economic arguments."Josh Rendall, of Chelsea and Fulham, pictured above, agrees."The party didn't appeal to under-40s at the last general election.There was no overall vision."What the prime minister has done this week is a good step forward but having Labour-like policies, I don't think really works for anyone."As for Mr Corbyn, he says: "I personally underestimated him."Just look at his conference speech last week, compared to the one a year ago or even two years ago.He was a man who had confidence, he wasn't flailing about.He was confident in himself and I think the party underestimated that."The Conservatives need better policies on housing and student finance, not just watered-down versions of Jeremy Corbyn's policies, he argues, in what is becoming an increasingly familiar refrain at this conference, "but I don't know what they are".
PM vows to renew the 'British Dream':::::Image copyright Getty Images A white picket fence, a good job, a nice car and a prosperous future for our kids - most of us have heard of the American Dream.But what about this side of the Atlantic?Theresa May promised to bring back the "British Dream" during her Conservative Party Conference speech - or the idea that "each generation should do better than the one before it".She said her domestic servant grandmother, who has three professors and a prime minister as grandchildren, was proof the dream could be real, but admitted it felt "distant" and "out of reach" for many people today.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson insisted Mrs May had set out a vision of "how to renew" the British Dream - but others watching the speech questioned what it was in the first place."The British Dream?What on earth is that?Never heard of it.What's in it?Unicorns?"David Hendy tweeted.Others began offering their own interpretations of the dream.Skip Twitter post by @Becca_DP the #britishdream is when u think 'it is a coat day' so u wear a coat and it turns out it was indeed a coat day and u are a good temperature beccadook (@Becca_DP) October 4, 2017 Report Despite the confusion, Mrs May is not the first politician to use the phrase.Former UKIP MEP Steven Woolfe, who grew up on a council estate in Moss Side in Manchester, previously claimed he was "living proof" of the British Dream.He described it as the chance to "succeed in your life, no matter your postcode, your gender or the colour of your skin".It echoes the original idea behind the American Dream, which was coined by the writer James Truslow Adams in 1931.He described the ideal of a land where life was "better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement".Who dreamt it up?Mr Johnson himself said in 2005, while editor of The Spectator and a shadow minister, that the UK had been "hopeless" at communicating any sense of a British Dream - compared with the Americans."We've all got to be as British as Carry On films and scotch eggs, and falling over on the beach while trying to change into your swimming trunks with a towel on," he wrote in the Telegraph.Mr Johnson went on to say the first practical step was ensuring everyone in the UK speaks the same language."We should teach English, and we should teach in English.We should teach British history."But Michael Howard, writing in the Guardian shortly after the 7 July 2005 bombings in London, saw the dream differently.Image copyright Working Title/BBC Image caption The success of fictional ballet dancer Billy Elliot has been likened to the British dream The then-Conservative Party leader thought it embodied the values of "decency, tolerance and a sense of fair play"."We need to break down the barriers that exist in too many people's lives - and minds - that prevent or deter them from making a success of life," he said.He nevertheless agreed with Mr Johnson that "no one" talked about a British Dream as they do in America.Two years later, the academic Prof George Rodosthenous, a specialist in musical theatre, observed in a journal article that the British Dream was "a term which needs urgently a definition".He was writing about the story of Billy Elliot - the fictional son of a coal miner who defies the odds to go to the Royal Ballet School in London - and defined it as "the desire to do better than one's own parents, the forbidden desire to dream and the action of dreaming".'British drawbridge' Professor Pamela Cox, social historian at the University of Essex, said the British Dream has come to stand for home ownership, having a secure job and a living standard higher than your parents.However, she believes it is "not a phrase that rolls off the tongue like the American Dream".Prof Cox said the one thing that holds back the British Dream is what she calls the "British drawbridge"."Elites are very good at pulling up the drawbridge behind them - things such as private schools and an inflated housing market."The British elite don't have much interest in sharing spoils.It's very much about keeping it for themselves."The American Dream is much more 'anyone can make it'.The British Dream is a different version - there is not a willingness for everyone to make it."
PM speech: Are fewer black people being stopped and searched?:::::Image copyright Getty Images The claim: Prime Minister Theresa May said that following a speech at the Conservative Party conference in 2014, government action had meant "the number of black people being stopped and searched has fallen by over two-thirds".Reality Check verdict: The number of black people being stopped and searched by police has fallen by two-thirds since 2010-11 but not since the 2014 conference.Also, black people still form a disproportionately large percentage of those being stopped and searched and the percentage has actually risen since 2013-14.As she delivered her keynote speech to the Conservative Party conference, the prime minister reminded Tories of what she sees as a key achievement - a reduction in the number of black people being stopped and searched, but all is not what it seems.Theresa May spoke about a young black man called Alexander Paul who spoke at the conference in 2014 about his experience of police stop-and-search tactics.She said: "Inspired by his example, we took action.We shook up the system, and the number of black people being stopped and searched has fallen by over two-thirds."The overall number of stop-and-searches fell dramatically between 2010-11 and 2015-16, which is the most recent year for which data is available.So, the number of black people being stopped also fell.This graph shows that the number of black people being stopped fell by two-thirds over the total period, but not since Mr Paul spoke at the conference in 2014.Disproportionately stopped But even though far fewer black people are being stopped and searched, they are still more likely to be stopped than any other ethnic group.When you look at the percentage of those stopped and searched who define themselves as black, little has changed.It was 15.2% in 2010-11, and fell to about 11% in 2013-14.Then it rose, and in 2015-16 was back up to 15.1%.The 2011 census found that 3.3% of people in England and Wales defined themselves as black - meaning black people are being stopped and searched nearly five times as often as you would expect them to be.So, while the number of black people being stopped and searched fell, their proportion of the total rose since Mr Paul spoke at the 2014 Conservative party conference.Just to be clear - these figures don't include stop-and-searches related to terrorism or that are carried out because police are trying to manage an incident that affects public safety - those fall under different legislation and are recorded separately.They would not have significantly changed the data.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: The people who are negotiating:::::The nature of Brexit will ultimately be decided by the governments of the 27 remaining EU nations and the UK.But the figures who negotiate the detail of the deal will be hugely important.Many would argue that Germany's Angela Merkel and the UK's Theresa May are the two most important people in the Brexit negotiations.But here are eight figures who will also be crucial to what happens.Of the four from the UK, three are within the Exiting the EU department.On the EU side, the figures represent the Commission (the EU's executive cabinet), the Council (the leaders of each member state) and the parliament of elected MEPs, who will have to approve the final deal.The EU negotiators A seasoned master of French and EU diplomacy, chief negotiator Michel Barnier will go head-to-head with UK Brexit Secretary David Davis.They used to be sparring partners in the 1990s, when they were rival Europe ministers with contrasting visions of the EU.Like Mr Davis, Mr Barnier does not owe his current status to his country's elite club of politicians.He did not attend the prestigious Ecole Nationale d'Administration, incubator of French political high-flyers.He has already given a clear indication of the tough stance he will take in negotiations - from guaranteeing the rights of Polish students and Romanian nurses in the UK, and British pensioners living in Spain.He is also adamant that the "sequencing" of the talks is key - the UK won't get to negotiate a trade deal until separation terms are agreed that preserve the integrity of the EU single market, and the UK settles its outstanding bills.Michel Barnier made his mark in French politics by organising the 1992 Winter Olympic Games in the French Alps.And for a long time he was regarded as a provincial - some called him "the ski instructor".He served as France's Europe minister and was briefly foreign minister.He stems from the Gaullist tradition.It was Charles De Gaulle who famously said "Non" to the UK joining the Common Market.Since 2010, Mr Barnier has been big in Brussels.As internal market commissioner he had oversight of the City of London at a sensitive time - in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.That role caused jitters in UK business circles, as Mr Barnier pushed through financial reforms.While some in the City disapproved of new EU regulations on bank capital reserves and bankers' bonuses, other officials found him more accommodating to City interests later on.And his opposite numbers in the Brexit talks will hope for the same pragmatism.Who is Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier?Sabine Weyand - one of "the Commission's best and brightest", according to its president, Jean-Claude Juncker - was picked as Mr Barnier's deputy chief negotiator in September.She studied at Cambridge University in the 1980s, and knows well the country whose exit from the EU she will be helping to engineer.But this German national is best known as a veteran at representing the Commission and its interests.And that makes her a formidable opposite number.She has 23 years' experience in trade relations and more than a decade at the Commission itself.One Brussels lobby group predicted Ms Weyand was unlikely to give much ground in trade talks on any UK hopes of a la carte access to the EU, particularly any weakening of the EU single market ideal of free movement.Those who have seen Ms Weyand in action speak highly of her as being far from a faceless cog in the Brussels machinery.Cecile Toubeau, whose group campaigns for sustainable transport inside Europe, came into contact with her at the time the VW emissions scandal blew up in 2015."She was very straightforward, she got to the point quickly, she understood the issues that we were bringing," says Ms Toubeau."She was open to what we said but I felt she was able to say, 'That's politically not something we can consider'."She was no-nonsense and honest - she really knew her stuff.She didn't need to look to her assistants for guidance."In its list of the most influential women in Brussels, the politico.eu website put Ms Weyand at number eight, calling her a "Commission problem-solver".She served in the cabinet of French former EU trade chief Pascal Lamy from 1999 to 2004, and later helped steer the EU's climate policies.She also monitored national governments' economic and financial performance in the Commission's Secretariat-General.In the run-up to the Brexit vote, Donald Tusk did all he could to find a deal to keep the UK in the EU.He was apocalyptic when he warned that the UK leaving could end "in the destruction of not only the EU but also Western political civilisation in its entirety".His efforts came to nothing and as the result emerged he tried to calm the waters in Brussels, saying "what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger".But in the wake of PM Theresa May's re-election without a parliamentary majority, he warned the UK to make up for lost negotiating time, tweeting: "We don't know when Brexit talks start.We know when they must end.Do your best to avoid a 'no deal' as result of 'no negotiations'."As president of the European Council, his challenge is to keep Europe's leaders united as they negotiate Britain's exit.Mr Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, is loathed by Poland's nationalist government that tried and failed to unseat him.But he has the respect of other European leaders for his handling of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the migrant crisis and the Greek debt negotiations.He has warned the UK not to expect to cherry-pick its way out of the EU and he has rejected British threats to walk away without a deal.But he has spoken of his aspiration for a "smooth divorce" with the two sides breaking up as "good friends".Mr Tusk is from Poland's Kashubian minority and grew up in Gdansk, the Baltic port city where anti-communist demonstrations, led by the Solidarity trade union, erupted in the 1980s.He was active in Solidarity while studying history at the University of Gdansk.As prime minister, Mr Tusk led Civic Platform (PO), which espoused free market policies.His government cut jobs in the state sector, pursued privatisation, cut taxes to woo foreign investors and tried to persuade Poles abroad to come home.Didier Seeuws, a hard-working diplomat with an eye for detail, was quickly tapped by Donald Tusk to head the Council's task force for the Brexit negotiations.While the Barnier-Weyand Commission task force will do the "heavy lifting" in the negotiations - dealing with the technical detail of Britain's exit from the EU - the Council team will be tasked with keeping the remaining 27 national governments happy and shaping the EU's longer term strategic relationship with the UK.Mr Seeuws will also have to bear in mind the views of MEPs - the European Parliament will have to approve the final deal.Mr Seeuws's team is said to have been meeting twice a week in preparation for negotiations - prompting unhappy comparisons with the UK side's state of preparation in some of the media.Mr Seeuws is respected for his role in handling the Greek debt negotiations - working through the night until dawn and overcoming divisions between heads of state to achieve a deal.From 2007 to 2010, the 51-year-old technocrat from the Flemish city of Ghent was Belgium's deputy ambassador to the EU, where he is said to have negotiated a breakthrough on the European patent system - following a 30-year deadlock.The ambassador he served under, Jean De Ruyt, told the BBC his political instincts were "always spot on" and that he "trusted his judgement and recommendations completely"."Apparently modest and obliging, he is capable of mastering the most complex of technical issues and understanding immediately the political stakes, but at the same time able to explain in simple words what has been discussed or decided."I have no doubt that Didier will often be able to reach a fair compromise when, as expected, difficult negotiations will reach a stalemate."Prior to this, Mr Seeuws served for several years as spokesman for the Belgian prime minister, none other than Guy Verhofstadt, the man chosen as chief Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament.Eventually, Mr Seeuws took up a job as right-hand man to Donald Tusk's predecessor at the European Council, Herman van Rompuy.He has since worked at the Council as head of transport, telecommunication and energy.The UK negotiators A former SAS reservist, who grew up on a south London council estate, David Davis is a political maverick who had carved out a career as a champion of civil liberties before his unexpected return to front-line politics as secretary of state for exiting the EU.Initially seen as an ultra-Thatcherite, he was elected to parliament in 1987, at the age of 38, after a career in management with sugar giant Tate and Lyle.Despite his Eurosceptic views, he served as a government whip under pro-EU Prime Minister John Major in the early 1990s, attempting to get rebel Tory MPs to support the Maastricht Treaty, which paved the way for closer European integration.He later served as Major's Europe minister, helping to negotiate some of the agreements with Brussels he is now charged with unpicking.His "hard man" image, working-class background and staunch right-wing credentials made him the front runner to replace Michael Howard as Conservative leader in 2005.He lost out to David Cameron, who made him shadow home secretary, where he carved out a distinctive niche for himself as a defender of traditional British freedoms.In 2008, he dramatically resigned his Haltemprice and Howden seat, and his frontbench role, to fight a by-election in protest at Labour's plans for identity cards and 42-day detention without charge.He won easily but rejected a job in the coalition government in 2010 to continue his civil liberties crusade from the backbenches, often in conflict with then Home Secretary Theresa May.He was involved in legal action against the government over Mrs May's data retention plans - dubbed the "snoopers' charter" by critics - when he got the call to join her cabinet.It was the first time in his long and colourful career that he had been put in charge of his own government department.Olly Robbins is the top UK official at the Brexit talks.At the start of the process, he was the top civil servant in David Davis's Exiting the EU department.But he has now moved to the Cabinet Office to work more directly for the prime minister, following reports of tensions with Mr Davis.The move was seen as a sign of Theresa May taking more control of Brexit negotiations.He cut his teeth at Gordon Brown's Treasury, helping to co-ordinate public spending policy, before going on to serve in senior behind-the-scenes roles for both Tony Blair and Mr Brown in Downing Street.By civil service standards, his rise was meteoric - he was Mr Blair's principal private secretary by the age of 31.He gained a reputation for being a skilled mediator in the frequent disputes between No 10 and the Treasury."In all my dealings with him, he really embodied the essence of the impartial civil service, and he's very popular," former Olympics minister Lady Jowell, told website Politico.After a spell as director of the civil service and as David Cameron's deputy national security adviser, Robbins became the senior civil servant in charge of immigration policy at Theresa May's home office.When Mrs May became prime minister she drafted Robbins in as her senior EU adviser, prompting speculation the government wanted to put the free movement of people at the heart of Brexit negotiations.Robbins generated some headlines in 2016 when he was ejected from a Home Affairs select Committee hearing by then chairman Keith Vaz for failing to give information about the UK Border Force's budget on time.He was also caught on camera "grinning sheepishly" as Mrs May handed her handbag to him at an EU summit in Malta.A career diplomat, with a reputation as a low-key but solid operator, Sir Tim Barrow was drafted into the role of UK ambassador to the EU following the resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers, who had accused the government of "muddled thinking" over Brexit.Sir Tim was Britain's ambassador in Moscow between 2011 and 2015, a turbulent period in relations between the two nations, and previously served as Britain's ambassador to Ukraine.The diplomat started his foreign office career in 1986 at the UK embassy in Brussels before going on to serve as a private secretary to Labour foreign secretary Robin Cook, advising on the EU, Russia and Middle East."It's the toughest negotiation in our lifetimes and I think he is up to it," Britain's former ambassador to Lebanon Tom Fletcher told BBC Radio 4's Today programme."I have seen him in Brussels.He knows the corridors, he knows the characters.But actually more importantly I saw him in Moscow where he was incredibly resilient as ambassador there, dealing with Putin in a very testing time in our relationship and Tim had a reputation of being bulletproof out there."BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said Sir Tim was less likely to be criticised by Brexit supporters than some other potential candidates for the job, as it "would be very hard to say that Sir Tim Barrow is an out-and-out pro-European".A fluent Russian speaker, Sir Tim was educated at Arnold Lodge in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, and Oxford University.As director general of David Davis's department, Sarah Healey is, in effect, second-in-command of the civil service machine tasked with delivering Brexit.She comes fresh from a similar role at the culture department and also led cross-government efforts to promote more women into senior civil service roles through job-sharing arrangements.Her previous claim to fame was as a contestant on University Challenge - she won the BBC Two quiz in 1998 and twice competed in the Champions of Champions competition for Magdalen College, Oxford.Healey studied modern history and English at Oxford and gained a postgraduate degree in social policy from the London School of Economics before embarking on a career in the civil service.Her former boss at the culture department, Tory MP Ed Vaizey, told the Times she was "incredibly sharp and intelligent", adding "there are no flies on her at all".She worked briefly for Iain Duncan Smith, when he was work and pensions secretary, and, before that, was director of strategy and funding at the education department under Michael Gove.She recently told a think tank conference that, as a student of history, freedom of information was an issue "close to my heart"."One of the things I reflected on when I took this job was that my children, if they were to take history degrees, would write essays on what we were doing so it was terribly important that they do have access to the archives of the time," she said.Profiles by Becky Branford, Paul Kirby and Brian Wheeler.Illustrations by Gerry Fletcher.
'No point trying to be cool' - the Tories seeking young voters:::::Image caption Around 200 people attended the Conservative Ideas Festival The Conservatives have a problem.More young people are voting than at any time in the last quarter of a century, but largely not for them - so what can the party do to change that?It's been labelled - perhaps unfairly - the "Tory Glastonbury".Around 200 activists, MPs, sympathetic thinkers and business people meet in the low September sunshine to discuss how the party can attract young voters.Just two years ago, the split in support between Labour and the Conservatives among 18 to 29-year-olds was fairly even, 36% to 32%.Fast forward to this June's general election and that small gap had become a chasm - according to pollsters YouGov - with Labour now on 64% to the Tories' 21%.In fact, unless you were touching 50, you were in a minority if you voted Conservative.'Panic mode' Addressing worried-looking party figures at the Big Tent Ideas festival in Berkshire, Lord Cooper - one-time director of strategy for ex-Prime Minister David Cameron - puts it starkly.Older Conservative voters, he says, are dying.And younger, more "open" voters are not going to decide when they hit 50 that "feminism and the internet and the green movement are a bad thing after all".Unless the party responds, he adds, "it is going to die".So what should they do?Image caption Bim Afolami says the party "realises that there is a problem" in not attracting enough young voters "Somebody famous and clever said the Conservative Party only knows two modes - complacency or panic," says one of the Tories' youngest MPs."And we're definitely in panic mode."Bim Afolami, an old Etonian and former banker, is 31 and has only been an MP for a few months, but his thoughts have already turned to this question."The party generally, collectively, realises that this is a problem," he says.With the Budget less than two months away, he says Chancellor Philip Hammond recently told a meeting of Conservative backbenchers that the party must address two of the key issues for younger voters - housing and student debt.Victoria Borwick - who represented the safe seat of Kensington until she became one of the 33 Conservative MPs swept away by Labour's better-than-expected showing in June - echoes the message."Every single MP should go back to their own area and see how they can build more housing for the next generation."'Not Glastonbury' It might be only 100 miles away, but the Big Tent Ideas Festival couldn't be further from Glastonbury.The music is Bach - perfectly rendered by a violinist.The buffet is delicate and refined.And there are more MPs in attendance than the young voters whom the ideas are intended to reach."This is not Glastonbury," Mr Afolami points out."It's more akin to (literature festival) Hay-on-Wye."The comparison is clearly unfair, but does it matter?The story goes that the brains behind the event, Conservative MP George Freeman, saw Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn cheered by thousands at Glastonbury over the summer and asked, "Why is it just the left who have all the fun in politics?"Image caption MP James Cleverly says young people were offered an "electoral bribe" by Jeremy Corbyn Conservative MP James Cleverly is unimpressed."Wow, a left-wing leader getting a good reception at a rock festival," he says, ironically."What kind of crazy world is it we live in that that kind of thing happens?"It's a bunch of young people who've just been given a massive electoral bribe."Mr Corbyn - who said before the election he would "deal" with student debt - will be punished for taking "younger voters for fools", Cleverly says."Being hip, being popular, being cool, that's really easy," says Cleverly."Until you have to make tough decisions.And when you have to make tough decisions, that veneer of coolness comes off real quick."So the better thing to do is to be right and be doing the right things for the right reasons rather than trying to be cool and popular and saying whatever thing is going to get good headlines or a big cheer at Glastonbury."Diversity What, then, can the party learn?Labour's general election campaign was praised for its use of social media and for reaching young people previously unmoved by party politics.Tobi Alabi - a south Londoner who was invited to attend the ideas festival, and was courted by Conservatives there, but isn't a supporter - says the party was an irrelevance for most of his friends.Labour, he says, related and appealed to young people.Image caption Tobi Alabi says the Conservative Party did not display diversity "That's something the Conservative Party didn't do.They didn't display diversity.They didn't display an appeal to young people.You have to tap into young people's interests."So - if they do that - could those young people won over by Jeremy Corbyn's Labour one day support the Tories?"Those people can be won back," says a hopeful Bim Afolami."Those are not people who have decided forever to vote for one person or one party."I think if we show them that we've got the right policies - but, more importantly, the right values - those are people that we can at least compete for in the future."Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.
Who's that girl? GCSE student wows at conference:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Newly-reformed GCSEs are leaving teenagers 'spaced out and stressed out', Lauren Stocks tells Labour delegates It was a moment that caught the Labour party conference off-guard.Sixteen-year-old Lauren Stocks had just received her GCSE results and wanted to talk about the toll that changes to the exams had taken on her and her classmates.In a passionate speech, she articulated the scale of the mental health problems that blight her generation."There's a statistic we were shown when I was about 13 or 14 that told me three in 10 people in every classroom suffer with a mental illness.Using strong language, she denied that to be the case."It's a good half."I could've walked into any food tech, history, art, maths classroom and just watched seas of spaced-out, stressed-out, depressed kids, in a battlefield where they can't afford pens and paper," she said, gulping hard."It is a disgusting sight," she told delegates, and urged parents of teenagers with newly-reformed GCSEs ahead of them to make sure they know they are loved.In under three minutes, Lauren delivered a speech conveying the impatience of youth.("I didn't make notes before I came on stage and my thoughts will be fairly scattered, so please go easy on me.")Her audience were on their feet, cheering Lauren for a speech that's since been shared thousands of times on social media.Image copyright Lauren Stocks Image caption Lauren has been a Labour party member since the age of 14 "It felt pretty weird," she tells the BBC."I was kind of in my own little world."To see everyone stand up - I really appreciated it."And the plaudits didn't stop there."My Snapchat blew up," she says.About 30 people from her old school contacted her to say they were really glad she had spoken up for them."I have suffered with many a mental health issue.I was worried it was just me but the response was overwhelming."Skip Twitter post by @braveteaching Crying, partly with pride that our schools have made the articulate & amazing Lauren Stocks & partly cos she has to spend her energy on this https://t.co/entxGdER5q Lucy Rimmington (@braveteaching) September 27, 2017 Report Some social media users though, with characteristic brutality, were less than warm, criticising her choice of hair dye and appearance.The impact of these negative comments is something her mum, Sarah Hilton, worries about a lot but Lauren less so."They're saying: 'That's not a girl'."When I checked last night, I was definitely female," she says, laughing it off.She also diplomatically brushes off the inevitable parallels being drawn with a famous 1977 Conservative conference speech by another 16-year-old, which was watched by a smiling prime minister-in-waiting - Margaret Thatcher."I haven't seen the speech but I have studied William Hague," she says."I don't have the best opinion of him."Image copyright Lauren Stocks Image caption Lauren's mum, Sarah Hilton, says her daughter has been educating her about politics Despite her years, Lauren is no stranger to public speaking.Now under-19 representative for North West Young Labour, she has been an activist for two years.Her interest in politics was first piqued at 12 as she idly watched YouTube videos of people discussing left-wing ideas.After a brief dalliance with the Greens, she joined the Labour party on 3 August 2015."I remember if as if it were yesterday," she says, almost wistfully.A few weeks later, Lauren received an email asking people to attend a Manchester food bank that leader Jeremy Corbyn would be visiting."I asked mum if I could go.I'd never been into Manchester alone before."My mum dropped me off at the food bank and after that they kept me involved," she says.After her experience of sitting the new GCSEs, she says students should be empowered and told what they can achieve, not threatened that if they fail, they'll be left watching Jeremy Kyle all day.This year's GCSE students in England were the first to sit exams which were numerically graded and tougher than in the past.The changes, introduced by former education secretary Michael Gove, resulted in a dip in results, but schools minister Nick Gibb said pupils and teachers were rising to the challenge.Exam regulators said the new qualifications had allowed students to better demonstrate their abilities and had better prepared them for further study.A Department for Education spokesperson said: "We recognise there are challenges facing the profession including a more demanding curriculum and higher expectations for pupils.Where staff are struggling we trust head teachers to take action to tackle the causes of stress and ensure they have the support they need."The government has also taken steps to reduce the burden of exams on young people including removing multiple, pointless resits and investing 1.4 billion in children's mental health services".Image copyright Lauren Stocks Image caption Lauren met veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner at the party conference Conference was, Lauren admits, a fast-paced eye-opener but also a chance to meet her heroes, Dennis Skinner ("soon-to-be Sir"), writer and activist Owen Jones ("I love him so much") and Laura Smith ("a rising star who I hope to see in Cabinet").For all her enthusiasm for politics and its people - and despite lobbying from her mum - she is not certain that's where her future lies.Lauren is now studying history, sociology and politics at college, and plans to stand for council in 2019.But beyond that, she says she has no political ambitions."If it's meant to be, it's meant to be."

Who lost seats to Labour?Labour's six losses were offset by 36 gains - 28 of which were from the Conservatives and two from the Lib Dems - including Nick Clegg's former seat of Sheffield Hallam.The party also took six Scottish seats from the SNP.3.Most of the changes were in Scotland and the north of England Although the political landscape of Northern Ireland has also shifted dramatically with the UUP and the SDLP losing all of their MPs.Changed seats All seats Please enable Javascript to view our results map Con Con Lab Lab SNP SNP LD LD PC PC UKIP UKIP Ind Ind DUP DUP SDLP SDLP UUP UUP SF SF Green More maps showing the changes from 2015 to 2017 are here.4.The SNP saw some huge majorities disappear The table below shows the largest majorities in the last general election in 2015 that have been overturned.Nine of the largest 10 previously belonged to the SNP - a 14,000-vote majority won by the party's former spokesperson on social justice, Eilidh Whiteford, in 2015 has been converted into a 4,000-vote majority for the Conservatives.Constituency (out of 650 so far) Result 2015 Majority 2017 Majority Banff & Buchan CON GAIN FROM SNP 14339 3693 Coatbridge, Chryston & Bellshill LAB GAIN FROM SNP 11501 1586 Ayr, Carrick & Cumnock CON GAIN FROM SNP 11265 2774 Angus CON GAIN FROM SNP 11230 2645 Stirling CON GAIN FROM SNP 10480 148 Ochil & South Perthshire CON GAIN FROM SNP 10168 3359 Rutherglen & Hamilton West LAB GAIN FROM SNP 9975 265 Kirkcaldy & Cowdenbeath LAB GAIN FROM SNP 9974 259 Midlothian LAB GAIN FROM SNP 9859 885 Canterbury LAB GAIN FROM CON 9798 187 Oxford West & Abingdon LD GAIN FROM CON 9582 816 Glasgow North East LAB GAIN FROM SNP 9222 242 Moray CON GAIN FROM SNP 9065 4159 Gordon CON GAIN FROM SNP 8687 2607 Battersea LAB GAIN FROM CON 7938 2416 Kensington LAB GAIN FROM CON 7361 20 Aberdeen South CON GAIN FROM SNP 7230 4752 Aberdeenshire West & Kincardine CON GAIN FROM SNP 7033 7949 East Lothian LAB GAIN FROM SNP 6803 3083 Warwick & Leamington LAB GAIN FROM CON 6606 1206 Reading East LAB GAIN FROM CON 6520 3749 Dumfries & Galloway CON GAIN FROM SNP 6514 5643 Foyle SF GAIN FROM SDLP 6046 169 South Down SF GAIN FROM SDLP 5891 2446 Colne Valley LAB GAIN FROM CON 5378 915 Mansfield CON GAIN FROM LAB 5315 1057 Portsmouth South LAB GAIN FROM CON 5241 1554 Stockton South LAB GAIN FROM CON 5046 888 Bristol North West LAB GAIN FROM CON 4944 4761 High Peak LAB GAIN FROM CON 4894 2322 Stroud LAB GAIN FROM CON 4866 687 Enfield Southgate LAB GAIN FROM CON 4753 4355 Caithness, Sutherland & Easter Ross LD GAIN FROM SNP 3844 2044 Bath LD GAIN FROM CON 3833 5694 Ipswich LAB GAIN FROM CON 3733 831 Renfrewshire East CON GAIN FROM SNP 3718 4712 Crewe & Nantwich LAB GAIN FROM CON 3620 48 Clacton CON GAIN FROM UKIP 3437 15828 Edinburgh West LD GAIN FROM SNP 3210 2988 Ceredigion PC GAIN FROM LD 3067 104 Keighley LAB GAIN FROM CON 3053 249 Leeds North West LAB GAIN FROM LD 2907 4224 Kingston & Surbiton LD GAIN FROM CON 2834 4124 Warrington South LAB GAIN FROM CON 2750 2549 Copeland CON WIN 2564 1695 Stoke-on-Trent South CON GAIN FROM LAB 2539 663 Sheffield Hallam LAB GAIN FROM LD 2353 2125 Middlesbrough South & Cleveland East CON GAIN FROM LAB 2268 1020 Dunbartonshire East LD GAIN FROM SNP 2167 5339 Cardiff North LAB GAIN FROM CON 2137 4174 Twickenham LD GAIN FROM CON 2017 9762 Walsall North CON GAIN FROM LAB 1937 2601 Peterborough LAB GAIN FROM CON 1925 607 Derbyshire North East CON GAIN FROM LAB 1883 2861 Lincoln LAB GAIN FROM CON 1443 1538 Southport CON GAIN FROM LD 1322 2914 Bedford LAB GAIN FROM CON 1097 789 South Antrim DUP GAIN FROM UUP 949 3208 Belfast South DUP GAIN FROM SDLP 906 1996 Weaver Vale LAB GAIN FROM CON 806 3928 Eastbourne LD GAIN FROM CON 733 1609 Brighton Kemptown LAB GAIN FROM CON 690 9868 Fermanagh & South Tyrone SF GAIN FROM UUP 530 875 Plymouth Sutton & Devonport LAB GAIN FROM CON 523 6807 Bury North LAB GAIN FROM CON 378 4375 Berwickshire, Roxburgh & Selkirk CON GAIN FROM SNP 328 11060 Vale of Clwyd LAB GAIN FROM CON 237 2379 Croydon Central LAB GAIN FROM CON 165 5652 Derby North LAB GAIN FROM CON 41 2015 Gower LAB GAIN FROM CON 27 3269
Theresa May: 10 reasons why the PM blew her majority:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Theresa May awaiting her constituency result in the early hours of Friday The post mortem on how Theresa May managed to lose her majority in Thursday's general election after expecting to secure a landslide victory is well under way.Here are 10 theories.First things first.Did she blow it?Yes.The Conservatives came first in this election with 318 seats, with Labour the next biggest party on 262 seats.The Conservatives got more votes that anyone else - 42.4% to Labour's 40% - and Theresa May's party got more votes than anyone since the record-breaking total John Major received in 1992.And yes, that means she got more votes than Tony Blair's New Labour landslide in 1997.So, you ask, in what sense did she blow it?Well, she had 331 MPs - more than the 326 needed to have a Commons majority - when she decided to call the election with the aim of increasing her majority.She also began the campaign with an undisputed opinion-poll lead in double figures and a landslide victory within her grasp.She ends it having to try to do a deal with the 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs to stay in power, and knowing that, the decision to call a snap election will go down as one of the biggest own goals in British political history.So how did it come to this?1) Deciding to call an election Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Reaction from Bristol: 'You're joking.Why does she need to do it?'Theresa May had been serenely racking up stunning approval ratings and huge opinion-poll leads.Her constant refrain was "Brexit meant Brexit" and it seemed a serious, tough, honest and non-flashy politician was what the British people wanted.Her honeymoon period felt like that of another self-consciously unshowy prime minister who came to power without an election - Gordon Brown.But unlike Mr Brown in 2007, she did not allow speculation about a snap election to run rife only to blow her reputation by deciding not to call one after all.She ruled out having an election.And then she changed her mind.She insisted she was acting in the national interest but others detected baser motives.Jeremy Corbyn said: "How can any voter trust what the prime minister says?".Nicola Sturgeon said it was a naked power grab and a bid to crush all opposition.The public, like Brenda in Bristol, seemed weary of politics and voting.2) The wrong type of campaign Image copyright Getty Images This was Theresa May's election - the Conservatives were some way off in the distance, if they were visible at all, at the start of the campaign.But was she the right kind of candidate to be placed front and centre like this?Katie Perrior, Mrs May's former director of communications thinks not.Writing in the Times, she said: "If you run a presidential-style campaign with a woman who doesn't like media interviews, then you have to accept that it's better to do them and run the risk that they go badly than look like you are running scared.Furthermore, if you want to brag that your candidate is a bloody difficult woman, then she has to show some empathy to remind people she is human after all."3) Dodging the TV debates Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Home Secretary Amber Rudd and senior politicians from six other parties took part in the debate.With huge poll leads at the start of the campaign it was quickly decided that Mrs May would not take part in anything as risky as a TV debate with her main challenger, Jeremy Corbyn, or risk meeting too many members of the public in big rallies.That decision backfired when Mr Corbyn decided to take part in a seven-way debate with other party leaders - he did not make a big deal of her absence, but everybody else on the stage did.The Green Party's Caroline Lucas said: "You don't say it's the most important election of our lifetime and not be bothered to show up."Mrs May might have performed badly in the debate, but she arguably took a far bigger reputational hit by not taking part, as it opened her up to accusations she was running scared, or that she was complacently assuming victory.4) Underestimating the opposition Image copyright Reuters Sporting history is littered with underdogs triumphing because they wanted to win more than their opponents, or put in more effort.The same sometimes goes for politics.In this election Mrs May seemed like she would be happy to say "strong and stable" from dawn until the sun set over the fields of wheat she "naughtily" ran through as a child.There was little in the way of a positive message to entice floating voters.Her campaign team did not seem able to conceive of the idea that anyone would take Mr Corbyn seriously.They underestimated how well his anti-austerity message would go over with voters worn out by years of frozen wages and public spending squeezes.Many commentators, on the left and right, who had written Jeremy Corbyn off as vote-losing liability have had to eat their words since the election.Just about everyone underestimated his appeal, once he was given a chance to air his views unmediated by a largely hostile press.5) Manifesto policies Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Anna Soubry has given a frank assessment of her party's campaign The turning point of the campaign, according to insiders, was Theresa May's U-turn on social care.Team May were apparently so confident of victory that they thought they could tackle the looming problem of social care costs - an issue parties scrapping to win elections have generally shied away from.But within hours the main thing many people knew about the Conservative programme for government was that it included a "dementia tax" that could lead to more people having to sell their homes to pay for care.The same went for means-testing the winter fuel allowance and ending the "triple lock" that guarantees a minimum 2.5% increase in the state pension.Mrs May might have got away with the rapid U-turn on social care - something that is almost unheard of the middle of an election campaign - if she had owned up to it but she continued to insist that nothing had changed.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May: This is the right way forward Anna Soubry, an anti-Brexit Tory MP said this was the moment that she lost her "strong and stable" reputation.Some Conservative MPs have suggested, off the record, that the 2017 manifesto was the worst the party has ever published.Ms Soubry said it was more a problem of "appalling" presentation - not properly explaining the social care changes, which would actually have benefited many less well-off people - and allowing people to think free school meals for poor children were being axed, when in fact the plan was to end the free lunches for all infants, which benefits the better-off.6) Not reacting to the Labour surge Image copyright Reuters Nick Timothy, pictured, who was forced out as Theresa May's policy adviser after the election result, suggests Team May were not even aware that there was a surge in Labour support as polling day approached.In his resignation statement, he said this was "because modern campaigning techniques require ever-narrower targeting of specific voters, and we were not talking to the people who decided to vote for Labour".Instead of pushing their message on the NHS and the energy price cap to get wavering Labour voters on side, they doubled down on what they thought was their strongest suit - Brexit and "strong and stable leadership" in contrast to a "coalition of chaos" under Mr Corbyn.7) May's personality Image copyright Getty Images People knew very little about Theresa May before the campaign started - she had been home secretary for a long time but had not courted publicity like some of her cabinet colleagues.An introvert, by Westminster standards, who does not like talking about her private feelings, she tended to come across as ill-at-ease on the TV sofa.Like Hillary Clinton in last year's US elections, she was not a natural on the campaign trail either.As Daily Mail sketch writer Quentin Letts pointed out at one event, she tended to look a bit miserable, or as he put it, a "glumbucket'.Mr Corbyn, on the other hand, looked like he was enjoying himself.At the end of the campaign, Mrs May had to rely on Boris Johnson, a natural political showman, to whip up the crowds.8) Negativity and the youth vote Image copyright Getty Images Theresa May spent a lot of time attacking Jeremy Corbyn's credibility and, as Nick Timothy has acknowledged, not enough time setting out her "positive plan for for the future".There are shades of Clinton here again, who focused heavily on attacking her opponent's fitness for office rather than explaining what she would do with power.Conservative attacks on Mr Corbyn's anti-terror record will have sounded alarm bells with older readers of Conservative-supporting newspapers.They may have meant less to anyone under 30, who were more interested in what the Labour leader had to say about their future rather than who he was holding meetings with decades ago.Labour countered Tory attack ads on Facebook with upbeat messages and celebrity endorsements.Labour's successful push to get out the youth vote was a decisive factor in some seats, although there is still some debate about the size of the surge in voting among 18 to 24-year-olds.The Tory campaign was widely criticised for being negative and uninspiring.9) Fox hunting and 'the same old Tories' Image copyright EPA Image caption Anti-hunting protesters marched on Downing Street It may simply have been a repetition of a longstanding Tory policy but Theresa May's vow to hold a free vote on bringing back fox hunting is thought by some to have harmed her efforts to seal the deal with Labour voters flirting with the Conservatives.It came up a lot on the doorstep, according to some reports, helping to "re-toxify" the Conservative brand among voters in traditional Labour areas, which Mrs May was banking on to win a big majority.Like the social care U-turn, or the pledge to bring back grammar schools, it may have given anyone flirting with backing the Tories for the first time in their lives a reason not to switch their vote.10) Events Theresa May wanted the election to be about Brexit but the terror attacks in Manchester and London changed the course of the campaign.Suddenly it was all about security and anti-terror policy.This should have put the former home secretary in a strong position, and her statements on the attacks struck a suitably prime ministerial tone.Labour's criticism of cuts to police numbers gave them a line of attack against Mrs May - but the pause in campaigning that followed the terrorist incidents resulted in a sombre and strangely off-kilter ending to the election.Here is a selection of your views: "Ignoring remain voters - too much focus on "no deal is better than a bad deal" and complaining that Remain voters were "citizens of nowhere" alienated the 48%.Playing so much to the UKIP vote backfired in many areas of the country.Evidence for this: the swing to Labour from Tories was much larger in Remain voting areas than Leave voting ones," Sue, York."Jeremy Corbyn was reckless and irresponsible in the promises he was making particularly to the youth voters.Promising to give 'free university' at a cost to the UK of 11.5 Billion a year, is an example of the 'money tree' that pays for all !Corbyn could afford to be reckless in his election promises because he didn't expect to win or be PM."Ron, Stoke-on-Trent."The Conservatives underestimated the collapse in the number of votes for the UKIP party.It must have been apparent that these votes would go somewhere and not necessarily all to the Conservative Party.Clearly some of these went to the Labour Party.The Labour Party will always have a strong backing in the cities and these extra votes from the UKIP party helped Labour get more seats.This should have been anticipated and calculated before Mrs May called the election so some of her advisers and backroom staff got it clearly wrong and miscalculated - or was it Mrs May just determined to call the election whatever?," Jeff "Definitely Fox Hunting swayed me.I left the Labour Party as a member when JC became leader.I didn't think he was electable (and he still might not be) and predicted a Labour wipe-out with him at the helm.But as the election went on I was slowly taken back into the fold by his positive campaign.I'd always agreed with his policies, just him as a leader I had doubts over.The more he engaged though the more I cheered, and once the manifestos where published it was game over for the Tories.But yes, the fox hunting was the initial game changer (as it was announced early on) - and then everything else just fell into place," Ian, Chester."I'm surprised that more hasn't been made of the proposed boundary changes, which would have reduced MPs from 650 to 600.If May had forced these through and then called the election she would have undoubtedly won a majority, as they massively favour the Conservatives.One report suggested that under the new boundaries Labour could be 10% ahead of the Tories and still not have a majority," Andrew, Loughborough."The Tories did not lose their majority over the stance favouring a hard Brexit.They lost seats because the majority accept that Brexit will happen and all the other issues of economic and social policy were more important issues in the election.Mrs May needs to ignore the pro Remain Major, Cameron and Clarke who are using the situation to try to reverse their defeat in the Referendum," Ian "You've laid out some good reasons but as you state, both the Conservative and Labour vote increased...... why?Because of a huge amount of tactical voting especially driven by social media.A lot of the "Remainers" had been horrified about the way that she'd embraced a Hard Brexit and even though Labour supported Brexit, they felt that not voting Tory would potentially hinder this outcome.Labour need to bear this in mind too.As a lot of people like me "lent" them their vote," Paul, Newcastle-under-Lyme "Was there any evidence to suggest that tactical voting also played a part in the demise of the Conservative majority?Were voters were more likely to vote for their second choice party if it meant stopping a Tory candidate from winning their constituency?Clearly this could have been a case in constituencies where non-contest agreements were forged e.g.Brighton Pavilion (Caroline Lucas), and in Twickenham where there was an absence of any campaign leaflets from any parties other than Lib Dems and Conservatives," John, London I am surprised by your list of reasons for the Conservative election results.For me this is very much about Brexit and Theresa May's stance.She was a remainer but since being elected has used a rhetoric which concerns much of the UK population.So this result is a protest against hard Brexit which will damage the UK economy beyond repair.It is also the young peoples's recognition that their vote matters.Had they voted in the referendum the result would have been remain, and they are angry and want their voices heard, Louise, Hampshire "The media, including the BBC, displayed an attitude of sneering contempt towards Jeremy Corbyn ever since he was elected Labour Party leader right up to the recent election campaign.Even the Guardian only endorsed Corbyn at the last minute, when it sensed which way the tide was running.This must raise serious questions about how 'free' our media really are, and who plots their editorial course.Time for another independent enquiry, perhaps?," John, Coventry "Another nail in the coffin of May's majority is her too-cosy relationship with Trump and particularly her failure to unreservedly condemn him for pulling the US out of the Paris Agreement.Saying that she was 'disappointed' was nowhere near strong enough," Ron, Cambridgeshire "It will be a rare day a Conservative calls another election without a 35 point lead in the polls.No wonder Labour is cambering for another election, Labour would rather enjoy another election in the next six months.Whereas, as a postman, I would not."Paul, Lincolnshire Everyone is tired of austerity, even those who are managing well.It's interesting how many of the affluent, metropolitan elite voted Labour, even though they were the ones who would be paying the bulk of the extra taxes.Whether they would have voted the same way if they'd thought he actually stood a chance of winning is a different question.Paul, London
Guide: 2017 political party conferences:::::Autumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.Conservatives - 1-4 October in Manchester Image copyright PA The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45."I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn," the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: "Building a country that works or everyon."The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to "let the British lion roar".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of "emerging plots" among some MPs.Labour - 24-27 September in Brighton Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In full: Jeremy Corbyn's 75 minute speech Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was "on the threshold of power".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the "political mainstream" because its polices were "what most people in our country actually want".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government "hanging by a thread".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting "Oh, Jeremy Corbyn" for a full two minutes before he had even begun.This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result.There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound.But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP - 8-10 October in Glasgow Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Opening her conference speech, Nicola Sturgeon says: "At the risk of tempting fate, I have come prepared" SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will "always make the case for independence" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The "essence of independence", she told activists, was being "in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at "close to cost price as possible".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to 840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be "truly transformational", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.Liberal Democrats - 16-19 September in Bournemouth Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Liberal Democrat conference: Sir Vince Cable's full speech The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of "hope and realism".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of "masochism", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP - 29-30 September in Torquay Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Bolton won the UKIP leadership contest with 30% of the vote UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: "Brexit is our core task.However it is not the end of the line."Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second.Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party - 7-10 October in Harrogate Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Greens told to look on the bright side after disappointing election Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the "hurt" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the "little guy" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change.He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in "community bonds".Plaid Cymru - 20-21 October in Caernarfon Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leanne Wood said Plaid Cymru had "the ambition to show a new way for Wales" Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference.She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a "rail revolution".The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat.Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting.
Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU:::::Here is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent.What's happening now?The UK has voted to leave the European Union.It is scheduled to depart on 29 March, 2019.Talks are currently taking place on three aspects of how Brexit will work - focusing on how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.The UK wants to talk about future trade relations - and a plan for a two year "transition" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.But the EU says they will not talk about the future until enough progress has been made on the other issues.What does Brexit mean?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.Why is Britain leaving the European Union?A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union.Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%.The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Find the result in your area What was the breakdown across the UK?England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%.Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%.Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU.Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave.See the results in more detail.What changed in government after the referendum?Image copyright PA Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May.The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum.Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU.She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out.Where does Theresa May stand on Brexit?Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want.Her key message has been that "Brexit means Brexit" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March.She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk.She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.How did the snap election change things?Image copyright Getty Images Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020).She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders.She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy.However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.What has happened to the UK economy since the Brexit vote?David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - and remains around 10% lower against the dollar and 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.The UK economy has continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017.Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3%, but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%.Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5% in the year to August 2017, according to official ONS figures.Brexit talks are under way They finally, officially, started on 19 June, 2017.Here's a picture from that first session: Image copyright Reuters The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month.Their first tasks are trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called "divorce bill", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border.You can find out more about the talks here.What is the European Union?The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list).It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other.It has since grown to become a "single market" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country.It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges.Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How does the European Union work?What is Article 50?Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU.It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009.Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure.What date will the UK will leave the EU?For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split.Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019.It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one.What's going to happen to all the EU laws in force in the UK?The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament.If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK.This "Great Repeal Bill" as it has been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny.Read a full guide to the bill.What is the Labour Party's position on Brexit?Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition.This is a considerably "softer" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.What do 'soft' and 'hard' Brexit mean?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, "hard" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if meant leaving the single market.At the other end of the scale, a "soft" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.What is the single market?The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place.Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market.In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country.It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it.The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices.But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a "level playing field".Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs.Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.Read more: A free trade area v EU single market What's the difference between the single market and the customs union?The customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU.It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area.In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods.It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Who is negotiating Britain's exit from the EU?Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit.Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary.These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it would be Mrs May, as prime minister, who would have the final say.Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.How long will it take for Britain to leave the EU?The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member.But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a "transition" period of up to three years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc.Why might Brexit take so long?Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task.It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along.The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.So why can't the UK just cut all ties in March 2019?The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a "cliff-edge" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight.They think it would harm the economy.What is the focus of negotiations between the UK and EU?The priority issues in negotiations are: 1) Agreeing what rights EU citizens already in the UK - and UK citizens living in the rest of the EU - will have after Brexit.2) Agreeing a figure for the amount of money the UK has to pay the rest of the EU "to settle its accounts", when it leaves.3) Working out what will happen on the border between Northern Ireland, when it is outside the EU, and the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU.The EU says it wants to make decent progress on these three issues before beginning talks about what the UK's relations with the EU will be like after Brexit.Mrs May set out her negotiating priorities in the letter officially triggering the process of leaving the EU on 29 March.Here's a guide to the key points.How are the talks going?There have been agreements on some technical points, but the chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said there had been no decisive progress on any of the main issues.The UK's Brexit Secretary, David Davis, insists progress has been made.The main sticking point at the moment is money - and the size of the bill the UK will pay to cover its outstanding obligations when it leaves.The UK wants this to be as low as possible.All the other countries in the EU want it to be as high as possible.Because when the UK leaves, there will be a hole in the EU budget and they will have to cover the shortfall.The UK government has published a series of papers setting out its position on issues such as future customs arrangements, and on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Government policy is now that the UK will leave the single market and the customs union on the day of Brexit, but that it will try to replicate existing customs arrangements during a time-limited transition period.What happens if there is no deal with the EU?Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care.Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could mean What happens to EU citizens living in the UK?It has yet to be agreed.All EU nationals lawfully resident in the UK for at least five years will be able to apply for "settled status" and be able to bring over spouses and children, under a 15-page proposal unveiled by Theresa May.Mrs May says she wants to give reassurance and certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland.But any deal on their future legal status and rights must be reciprocal and also give certainty to the 1.2 million British expats living on the continent after the UK leaves the EU - expected to be on 29 March 2019, she says.Michel Barnier, who is leading the Brexit negotiations for the EU, said the UK's proposals did not go far enough and he wanted the same level of protection citizens currently have under EU law.He has demanded more clarity and ambition from the UK government.The key points of the UK's proposals are: Those granted settled status will be able to live, work, study and claim benefits just as they can now The cut-off date for eligibility is undecided but will be between 29 March 2017 and 29 March 2019 Family members of EU citizens living abroad will be able to return and apply for settled status EU nationals in the UK for less than five years at the specified date will be able to continue living and working in the UK Once resident for five years, they can apply for settled status Those arriving after the cut-off point will be able to stay temporarily But there should be "no expectation" they will be granted permanent residence A period of "blanket residence permission" may apply to give officials time to process applications to stay in the UK The Home Office will no longer require evidence that EU citizens who weren't working held "comprehensive sickness insurance" Labour has said it would guarantee the rights of of EU citizens living in the UK to stay there on "day one" of a Labour government.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.What happens to UK citizens working in the EU?A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU.If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.What about EU nationals who want to work in the UK Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit.The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a "transition" phase of up to three years.However they will have to register.A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.What does the fall in the value of the pound mean for prices in the shops?Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shoppers will need to keep a close eye on how much they are spending People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened.This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen.The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.6%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Will immigration be cut?Image copyright PA Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a "sustainable" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year.The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote.This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries.There were still 246,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to March 2017, according to the latest estimates - some way above the government's target of 100,000.Could there be a second referendum?It seems highly unlikely.Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave.Will MPs get a vote on the Brexit deal?Yes.Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process.This vote is currently proposed as a "take it or leave it" one.Labour wants the vote to have the option of sending the UK team back to renegotiate.It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.Will I need a visa to travel to the EU?The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals.No agreement has been reached yet, however.If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Image copyright Reuters Will I still be able to use my passport?Yes.It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same.In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.Has any other member state ever left the EU?No nation state has ever left the EU.But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation.The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.What does this mean for Scotland?Image copyright Reuters Image caption Nicola Sturgeon says a new independence referendum in Scotland is likely Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was "democratically unacceptable" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain.Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held.She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021.Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.What does it mean for Northern Ireland?The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland is a key part of the Brexit talks.There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic.Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum.The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.The UK government has published a paper setting out its vision for a post-Brexit border.It wants to avoid returning to a "hard border" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts.There would be no CCTV cameras or number plate recognition technology at the border, or set back from it.Instead, the UK government is arguing for a wide-ranging exemption under which small and medium-sized businesses will not have to comply with any new customs tariffs.If the proposals are accepted, customs officials envisage using a mix of technology and physical checks to monitor the compliance of bigger businesses engaged in international trade.Critics say the proposals lack credible detail, with Labour deriding the plans for the border as "a fantasy frontier".Sinn Fein, which was part of the ruling coalition in the Northern Ireland Assembly before it was suspended, has called for a referendum on leaving the UK and joining the Republic of Ireland as soon as possible.The Conservatives have rejected Sinn Fein's call, saying there was no evidence opinion had shifted in favour of a united Ireland.How much has Brexit cost so far and how much will it cost by the end?There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.Various figures ranging from 50bn (44bn) to 100bn (88bn) euros have been bandied about but although the UK has agreed to meet its financial obligations, Brexit secretary David Davis has said: "We will not be paying 100bn."The UK could leave without any Brexit "divorce bill" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court.If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.How will pensions, savings, investments and mortgages be affected?During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called "triple lock" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit.This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low.There are few signs yet that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England enough to consider raising interest rates.But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Will duty-free sales on Europe journeys return?Image copyright Thinkstock Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an "upside" or "silver lining" of Brexit.As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the "customs union" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Will EHIC cards still be valid?Image copyright Thinkstock If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more here.Will cars need new number plates?Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could MPs block an EU exit?Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying?The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit.But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.Will leaving the EU mean we don't have to abide by the European Court of Human Rights?The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution.It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.There have been longstanding plans to repeal the act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights.What about the European Court of Justice?The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority.It is based in Luxembourg.It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects.The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade.It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the "direct" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit.But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided.There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The UK has set out some ideas in a position paper, which was criticised for being too "vague".The EU is insisting that its citizens in the UK should continue to enjoy the legal protection of the ECJ even after Brexit, guaranteeing their right to work and access to benefits among other things.This is a major sticking point in the negotiations, with the UK saying EU citizens living in the UK should be subject to British law only.Will the UK be able to rejoin the EU in the future?BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU.Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining.But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands.New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.Who wanted the UK to leave the EU?The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU.They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet.A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to leave?They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return.They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work.One of the main principles of EU membership is "free movement", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country.The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of "ever closer union" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a "United States of Europe".Who wanted the UK to stay in the EU?Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in.He said the deal would give Britain "special" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in.The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign.The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in.The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to stay?Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services.They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.What about businesses?Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world.Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU.Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound.Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Boris Johnson was one of the most prominent Leave campaigners Who led the rival sides in the campaign?Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU was headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose.It was backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who ran the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party.Who funded the campaign: Britain Stronger in Europe raised 6.88m, boosted by two donations totalling 2.3m from the supermarket magnate and Labour peer Lord Sainsbury.Other prominent Remain donors included hedge fund manager David Harding (750,000), businessman and Travelex founder Lloyd Dorfman (500,000) and the Tower Limited Partnership (500,000).Read a Who's Who guide.Who else campaigned to remain : The SNP ran its own remain campaign in Scotland as it did not want to share a platform with the Conservatives.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Britain Stronger

party ran its own campaign.The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition also ran its own out campaign.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Will the EU still use English?Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler.There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - "much to France's chagrin", she says.Will Brexit harm product safety?Probably not, is the answer.It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards.Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this page Which MPs were for staying and which for leaving?The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list.Click here for the latest version.How much does the UK contribute to the EU and how much do we get in return?In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out.Only France and Germany contribute more.In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to 4.6bn in 2014/15.According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was 8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was 5.7bn.Read more number crunching from Reality Check.If I retire to Spain or another EU country will my healthcare costs still be covered?David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans.This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen.At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS.After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment.In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note.If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.What will happen to protected species?Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least.After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap.The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied.The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.How much money will the UK save through changes to migrant child benefits and welfare payments?Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels.We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out.HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about 30m.But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted.Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of 6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his "emergency brake" was applied.The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts would have been phased in.New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided.The plan will never be implemented now.Will we be barred from the Eurovision Song Contest?Image copyright BBC/Guy Levy Image caption To participate in the Eurovision Song Contest countries need to be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, which is independent of the EU Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry.We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: "All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union.The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe.Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC."What will happen to pet passports?The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws.It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU."Has Brexit made house prices fall?Image copyright PA So far, the answer is no.But there has been anecdotal evidence of house prices falling at the top of the market in Central London and the annual increase in the price of property has fallen from 9.4% at the time of the referendum to 4.9% a year later.What is the 'red tape' that opponents of the EU complain about?Ged, from Liverpool, suspects "red tape" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection.According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related.The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs 4.7bn a year, tops the list.The working time directive (4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019.Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them.Brexit may also generate "red tape" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Will Britain be party to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership?Ste, in Bolton, asked about this.The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of 10bn a year.But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights.US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the TTIP agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.What impact will leaving the EU have on the NHS?Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS.This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was 350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead.The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses.The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as "scaremongering" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned.EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).Sally Miller bought a house in Spain nine years ago and plans to retire there in the next five years.She asked how Brexit will affect this.Image copyright Getty Images The BBC's Kevin Connolly says: The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations.We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.Jonathan Eaton is a Briton living in the Netherlands with his wife, who is Dutch.He asks what rights to benefits and housing he will have if he has to return to the UK.Image copyright Getty Images BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says: The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits.As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens.The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months.For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months.And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away.After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK.It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning.But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work.That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit.The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad.And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain.Will I have to buy a new passport and driving licence, and will my rights to use them freely across Europe be taken away from me after Brexit, asks Francis Lee.Image copyright Getty Images Kevin Connolly says: At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU.That will presumably change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire.That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU.Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all.The right to use them freely is an interesting question.When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country.If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa.And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK.Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.It is very clear that the PM and the government want to leave the tyranny of the European Court of Justice.Why has leaving the European Court of Human Rights (an organisation far more hated than the ECJ) been ignored, asks Barry Fryer.Image copyright Getty Images Kevin Connolly says: Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics.Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law.So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Adrian Wallis runs a small electronics company and wants to know about export tariffs after Brexit, and what they'd mean for his business.Kevin Connolly says: As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs.That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free.On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own.That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.Image copyright Thinkstock One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example.Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades.They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.What impact will leaving the European Union have on the UK's long term political influence in Europe, asks Peter Hoare.Norman Smith says: There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners.For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Are other countries likely to leave the EU and if so could we start a new free trade area, asks David John.Kevin Connolly says: Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent.When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Image copyright Getty Images Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations.And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland.But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.What will happen to the borders in Gibraltar and Northern Ireland, asks Nigel May.Kevin Connolly says: I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back.Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was "a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.Image copyright Getty Images The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too.The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.How will access to healthcare change for expats living in the EU, asks Veronique Bradley, who lives in Italy.Kevin Connolly says: Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union.After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.What will happen to EU nationals who lived and worked in the UK and now receive a British state pension, asks Peter Barz, a German citizen living in the UK.Norman Smith says: If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Image copyright Getty Images Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, "I paid in there", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Is it possible to be both an EU citizen and not an EU citizen, asks Declan O'Neill, who holds an Irish passport.Kevin Connolly says: I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.Image copyright Getty Images The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Is there a get-out clause for Article 50, asks Gillian Coates.Norman Smith says: I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.Image copyright Thinkstock However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Eric Degerland asks when UK passports are going to change.Kevin Connolly says: This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about.It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words "European Union" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.Image copyright Getty Images But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire.So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would.The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK?Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights.The EU demands that it does.This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed?Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property.Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in.So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU.Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK.
Theresa May's cabinet: Who's in and who's out?:::::Theresa May has formed her new government after the Conservatives lost their majority in the general election.The prime minister's room for manoeuvre in the reshuffle was limited when her party was left with 318 MPs and Labour had 262.Here's what we know so far.The list will be updated as new appointments are made.Prime Minister - Theresa May Image copyright Reuters Theresa May stays as prime minister despite not achieving the mandate for Brexit she had called the election for.The UK's second female PM took up the role after David Cameron resigned in the wake of the EU referendum result.She had previously been home secretary for six years.Theresa May: Full profile Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance First Secretary of State - Damian Green Image copyright AFP Damian Green has been promoted to a new role the prime minister did not have in her first cabinet - that of first secretary of state.As the same time he also replaces Ben Gummer as minister for the Cabinet Office after Mr Gummer lost his seat in the election.The move effectively makes the former work and pensions secretary, a friend and ally of Theresa May, her second in command.It could see Mr Green standing in for Mrs May at PMQs when she is not available.The role - which was previously held by George Osborne and, under Labour, Peter Mandelson - gives Mr Green seniority over other cabinet ministers.Chancellor of the Exchequer - Philip Hammond Image copyright PA Philip Hammond remains as chancellor of the exchequer.He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary.Mr Hammond, 61, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands steering Britain's economy through the post-Brexit period ahead.Sometimes mocked as "box office Phil" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending "axeman".Foreign Secretary - Boris Johnson Image copyright AFP No change at the Foreign Office as Boris Johnson keeps his job.Despite hints from some of the newspapers that Mr Johnson, 52, may turn his hand to trying to lead the party, he has categorically dismissed such claims.Mr Johnson said that while the public would be wondering about the future of the current government, Mrs May had got the biggest Conservative mandate anyone had achieved for decades."I'm going to be backing her, and absolutely everybody I'm talking to is going to be backing her as well."Home Secretary - Amber Rudd Image copyright Reuters Amber Rudd remains as home secretary despite only narrowly holding her seat as MP for Hastings and Rye.During the election campaign, she stood in for the PM in the BBC's televised debate in May.Ms Rudd was previously energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.The former investment banker, venture capitalist and financial journalist, aged 53, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get "a grip on her life".Secretary of State for Exiting the EU - David Davis Image copyright Reuters David Davis keeps his job of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or "Brexit secretary".The role was created in July to take the lead in negotiating the UK's exit from the EU.A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister.Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron.Mr Davis, 68, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest.Defence Secretary - Michael Fallon Image copyright AFP Michael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 65-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, Mr Fallon has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Secretary of State for International Trade - Liam Fox Image copyright AFP Liam Fox, 55, continues as the secretary of state for international trade.He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Mr Fox stood in the leadership race against Theresa May but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.He told reporters he was "delighted" to keep the job he has held since July last year."It's now time for the whole of the Conservative party to rally behind the prime minister and get a government in the national interest."Justice Secretary - David Lidington Image copyright PA Former Leader of the House of Commons David Lidington gets the job of justice secretary, replacing Liz Truss.He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moved across to aid the smooth running of the Commons in 2016.The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992.He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Leader of the House of Lords - Baroness Evans Image copyright PA Baroness Evans of Bowes Park keeps her job as the leader of the House of Lords.When appointed in 2016, it was her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Health Secretary - Jeremy Hunt Image copyright Reuters Jeremy Hunt remains in his post despite the problems within the NHS.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and at the time described the appointment as the "biggest privilege of my life".But in a tweet he admitted there were "challenges ahead, but also huge opportunities to make our NHS even better".Last year, Mr Hunt was locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which led to a series of strikes.Education Secretary - Justine Greening Image copyright PA Justine Greening has kept her roles as education secretary and minister for women and equalities.She is part of the most diverse Parliament yet as she openly defines herself as a lesbian.At London Pride in 2016, the 48-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying "I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!".Ms Greening replaced Nicky Morgan at education in 2016, leaving her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in 2011.She has been MP for Putney since 2005.Transport Secretary - Chris Grayling Image copyright Reuters Chris Grayling remains as transport secretary in Theresa May's cabinet.The former Leader of the House has been dealing with Southern Rail's disrupted services, the question of Heathrow's third runway and the high speed rail link, HS2.He also served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.Culture Secretary - Karen Bradley Image copyright Getty Images Karen Bradley has kept her role as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary.She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Environment Secretary - Michael Gove Image copyright EPA Michael Gove has made a comeback, with the prime minister bringing him back into cabinet and appointing him environment secretary.In the 2016 reshuffle he was sacked as justice secretary and before that he served under David Cameron as education secretary and chief whip in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition.Despite campaigning alongside Boris Johnson for Brexit, he withdrew his support for Mr Johnson to be Conservative leader and prime minister, choosing instead to stand himself.He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs, coming third.Mr Gove's surprise move to stand for the leadership effectively dashed his colleague's hopes of winning and prompted Mr Johnson's withdrawal from the contest.Work and Pensions Secretary - David Gauke Image copyright AFP A sideways step for David Gauke, with the PM appointing him as the new work and pensions secretary.He was previously the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who attends cabinet but does not have a ministerial role.Mr Gauke has been the MP for Hertfordshire South West since 2005.He is a qualified solicitor and worked for a leading City firm until he was elected.Communities Secretary - Sajid Javid Image copyright AFP Sajid Javid keeps his job as secretary of the department for communities and local government.He held this position in 2014 before being appointed to business secretary a year later.A former managing director of Deutsche Bank, Mr Javid has been MP for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire since 2010.He stood on a "joint ticket" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Northern Ireland Secretary -
