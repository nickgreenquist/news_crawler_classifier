Wolf kills cow in California for the first time in more than 100 years:::::A wolf killed a cow in California for the first time in more than one hundred years, the Sacramento Bee reports.A wolf killed a heifer on private property in Lassen County earlier this month, according to the California Fish and Wildlife Department.Based on GPS-collar locations, the wolf LAS01F was present at the site at midnight, 3:00 AM, and 6:00 AM on 10/13, the agency said in a report.While staff were investigating the site, the wolf was on a forested slope approximately 620 meters from the carcass.The location and nature of the bite marks and the significant associated tissue hemorrhaging are consistent with attacks by wolves, the report explained.Many of the bite marks penetrated tissues to a depth of approximately 1.5 inches.The wolf was part of the Lassen Pack, the Bee reported.The state has also looked into the deaths of another four calves owned by the rancher, Wally Roney, with one considered a "possible" wolf kill, the newspaper said.Roney reportedly attributes all five deaths to the pack.Though wolves were killed off in California in the 1920s, they have come back to the state in recent years.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Rare footage captures giant jellyfish living under Arctic ice:::::Biologists who explore the Alaskan Arctic ecosystem aren't just interested in polar bears.Some are also captivated by the "gelatinous species" hidden below the ice.Now, scientists have published rare footage of one of the Arctic's largest jellyfish drifting beneath the sea ice near Utqiavik, also known as Barrow, off the north coast of Alaska.Such videos aren't easy to get.From May to June each year between 2011 and 2014, the team of researchers drove onto the frozen Chukchi Sea with snowmobiles, sometimes nearly 2 miles (3 kilometers) from shore, and drilled holes into the thick sea ice.They sent a camera-equipped underwater vehicle into the water to have a look at the seafloor.[See Amazing Images of Jellyfish Swarms] The scientists captured footage of algae, crustaceans and several species of comb jellies (also know as ctenophores) under the ice.But the big surprise was finding adults of a species of jellyfish known as Chrysaora melanaster.The bell of this type of jellyfish can reach 24 inches (60 centimeters) across, with its two dozen or so tentacles extending up to nearly 10 feet (3 meters), according to the Census of Marine Life.The researchers counted 55 of these jellyfish, all of which appeared healthy and in their adult, or medusa, stage.They were often dragging their long tentacles along the seafloor, likely trying to pick up food with some apparent success.At least one of the jellyfish was seen carrying an isopod, a type of crustacean.The presence of adult jellyfish during the late spring and early summer suggests these C. melanaster medusas can survive the Arctic winter, according to the research published in the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series on Oct. 23.Like most jellyfish, this species was thought to live for only a few months.And scientists thought the species survived the winter only in the polyp stage of their life cycle.(Bottom-dwelling polyps settle on rocks or other surfaces and produce baby jellyfish in the spring.)"Life under sea ice is like living in a refrigeratoreverything slows down," study co-author Andy Juhl, a marine biologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, told his department's blog.Juhl and his colleagues think that thick sea ice in winter helps protect the medusas from rough seas, while the low temperatures help slow their metabolism so they don't need much food to survive."We believe that the prevalence of jellyfish and ctenophores living through the winter is greater than generally appreciated," the researchers wrote.The Arctic has been experiencing record-low levels of sea ice in recent years due to climate change.The authors of the new study noted that jellyfish populations could be more sensitive to these changes than scientists had thought."Understanding the implications of changing sea-ice conditions will become increasingly important as coastal Arctic seas become more open to transportation, commercial fishing, oil and gas exploration, and other forms of commercial exploitation," Juhl and his colleagues wrote.Original article on Live Science.
New dinosaur may have looked like a raccoon:::::Imagine this: a large, feathered reptile with bold stripes and a colorful, raccoon-like face.Sound like something youd probably see roaming around the world of Pokemon, right?Well its real, or at least it was.Its called a Sinosauropteryx, and it lived here on Earth some 126 million years ago.The very first Sinosauropteryx fossil was actually discovered way back in the mid 1990s, and it shook up the entire image of dinosaurs thanks to its apparent feathery coat.Now, a new research effort to learn more about the ancient species has given scientists a better understanding of exactly what it looked like, and man is it a weirdo.Using the preserved remains from three different Sinosauropteryx fossils, paleontologists from the University of Bristol were able to figure out the colors of the dinosaurs fancy feathers.They learned that its body was a light amber color, with lighter, off-white stripes that curled up and around the side of its streamlined head.With dark areas around its eyes and a lighter colored underbelly, it looks a whole lot like a raccoon, only in dinosaur form.The research is interesting not just because it gives us a good idea of what the dinosaur looked like, but also because it could offer great clues as to what the environment also looked like at the time.Assuming the dinosaurs pattern and coloring helped it blend into its surroundings, its not a stretch to think that the Sinosauropteryx spent its time in areas much like those of modern day animals that share similar color patterns, like gazelles.We knew before that its feathers were vibrantly patterned, but this study shows that it was countershaded and even striped, Dr. Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh told the New York Times.These findings breathe life into this dinosaur.
Mysterious object from deep space has entered the solar system:::::It was first seen just a month ago.A tiny blip of light was seen to be moving through the sky by the PanSTARRS1 telescope in Hawaii.The number-crunching which followed was automatic.The results were unusual.This object is in an odd position.Its moving very fast.And its in what appears to be a somewhat extreme orbit.Extreme enough not to actually be an orbit, in fact.Observations published by the by the International Astronomical Unions Minor Planet Center (MPC) suggest it could have come from deep space.Specifically, it could be a comet that has escaped another star.If further observations confirm the unusual nature of this orbit, this object may be the first clear case of an interstellar comet, the MPC declares.WHAT IS C/2017 U1?The PanSTARRS telescope spotted the object only after it was flung back out towards the stars by our Sun.Its not likely to ever return.It flashed past Earth at 24 million kilometres on October 14.Many eyes watched it closely, keen to determine exactly what it was.Their curiosity was piqued by where it had come from.Most objects orbiting our Sun do so along a common plane: the planets, dwarf planets and asteroids mostly swing around in roughly the same way.This one appears to have come down on the plane from 122 degrees, from the direction of the star Vega, in the constellation Lyra.And its path did not indicate the curved ellipse typical of clockwork-like returning comets.Best guesstimates make it a comet of about 160m diameter, with a surface reflectivity (albedo) of about 10 per cent.A WANDERER The object has just been through a close call (in Solar System terms): it came within 38 million km of our star before its momentum and the Suns gravity hurled it back outward.Normally such a close pass would be fatal.But C/2017U1 was travelling too fast for the Suns heat to consume it.It was moving at 26km per second when first observed.Astronomers are now attempting to refine their observations and data to pinpoint exactly where it came from.If it truly is of interstellar origin, the next task is to find which star it is likely to have come from.At the moment, it appears to have been somewhere in the direction of the star Vega.Its also likely to have been wandering, alone, in deep space for a very, very long time.Vega is a relatively close neighbour of our Sun at 25 light years distance.At the speed its travelling, it would take about 1.7 million years to cross the interstellar divide.This story originally appeared in news.com.au.
Deer crashes through Missouri hair salon's store front:::::Shoppers were left saying, oh, deer, when the four-legged animal smashed into a Missouri hair salon.The deer was caught on surveillance video crashing into Sports Clips Haircuts in Springfield.The salon posted the video on its Facebook page on Wednesday with the caption: Our four-legged buddy in Missouri just couldn't wait to treat himself to the MVP Experience he crashed right through the front door!The store added, "(Don't worry, the deer and the folks inside were unharmed!)Shoppers were seen coming out of other stores in the strip mall and checking to see what the commotion was.The deer sprinted out of the door while a man held the door for it.Its unclear how, or why, the deer was in the area.
Rare Revolutionary War sword to go on display for the first time:::::An extremely rare silver-hilted sword used by an American officer during the Revolutionary War is set to go on display for the first time.The small sword was owned by Col. Jonathan Pettibone of the 18th (Connecticut) Regiment, who fought in the battles for New York in 1776.Pettibone, of Simsbury, Connecticut, died in Rye, New York, in September of that year, shortly after the Battle of Long Island.The weapon, which is inscribed with Pettibones name, will go on display at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia beginning in 2018.500-YEAR-OLD NATIVE AMERICAN CANOE TO BE UNVEILED TO THE PUBLIC AT MISSISSIPPI MUSEUM Experts note that it is unusual for Revolutionary War swords to have the name of the original owner inscribed on the weapon.The sword also bears the mark of its maker, silversmith Joseph Copp of New London, Connecticut.With the rare maker's hallmark, and considering who owned it and the history it probably saw, this sword is truly one of the most fascinating Revolutionary War weapons I have ever seen, said Dr. Philip Mead, chief historian and director of curatorial affairs at the Museum, in a statement.The Museum received the sword Wednesday from donor B. Owen Williams of Maryland, a descendent of Pettibone.FROM ROYAL STATUE TO REVOLUTIONARY WAR BATTLE: THE AMAZING JOURNEY OF 'MELTED MAJESTY' MUSKET BALL As a family, we are delighted that the Museum will provide a home for this article, where it should be, in an exhibit to be seen by the many visitors who come to the Museum from all over, said Williams, in the statement.Im thrilled that it has survived in remarkably good condition despite my youthful exuberance and blissful ignorance to play with it surreptitiously as a boy.After Pettibones death the sword was passed on to his son Jonathan Pettibone Jr., who also served in the Revolutionary War.The elder Pettibones tricorn hat is already on display at the Smithsonians National Museum of American History.The discovery of Revolutionary War era artifacts offers a fascinating glimpse into the events that shaped America.A storied Revolutionary War musket ball that was melted from a famously toppled statue of King George III, for example, went on display earlier this year at the Museum of the American Revolution.SOLDIERS FAITH: RARE BIBLE CARRIED AT THE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL HAS MOVING INSCRIPTIONS In August, a Revolutionary War-era knife was unearthed during an archaeological dig at Colonial Michilimackinac in Mackinaw City, Michigan, the latest in a series of amazing finds at the site.Last month, archaeologists in Boston unearthed a centuries-old outhouse that may be linked to the family of Patriot Paul Revere.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers
Strange 'alien activity' causing Arizona couple to sell home:::::Is the truth out there?Maybe for some, but one Arizona man is not going to wait to find out.John Edmonds has lived at his Buckeye ranch for 20 years but is ready to leave due to a number of reportedly strange "alien encounters" he and his wife have experienced.The Stardust Ranch, also known as the "Alien Ranch," can be purchased for the low price of $5 million, according to the homes listing.Besides a large amount of land (10 acres) and five bedrooms, the owner also gets the chance to experience contact with aliens.TOP 25 CITIES FOR UFO SIGHTINGS ACROSS THE U.S. "Almost immediately from the day we moved in, we began to have strange experiences," Edmonds told 12 News.Edmonds posted a picture of his calf with strange marks on it on his Facebook page with the caption: Wounds from recent attack here at Stardust Ranch upper right calf from battle with malevolent ET.This is why I want to move!Edmonds told the Travel Channel he has killed 18 aliens, or alien grays as he called them, with his samurai sword during his tenure living at the ranch.One particular time, Edmonds had to break out his sword when he saw his wifes body being levitated by three aliens.SCIENTIST PROPOSES WILD EXPLANATION FOR WHY WE HAVEN'T DISCOVERED ALIENS YET If you dont take the heads, they disappear, Edmonds said.Edmonds said he hopes to move to Maine to start a horse rescue ranch, USA Today reported.He already owns one located on the Stardust Ranch.Edmonds said the animals were strangely mutilated on the ranchs property.Despite the strange activity, Edmonds said he and his wife stayed at the ranch because he was stubborn."I am extremely stubborn, both logically and rationally," Edmonds told USA Today."I have a lot of money and time invested in this property, and many animals housed here."Kimberly Gero, the real estate agent trying to sell the home, told 12 News potential buyers were either intrigued by the ranch or scared."Some are very intrigued and have no issues with the history of the property," Gero told 12 News."While others are absolutely scared to death about what may or may not happen to them if they should buy it.""Obviously, it is going to take a unique person who has a true curiosity and interest in the propertys history," Gero added."I have no doubt that there is a buyer out there for this special place."
Primordial fossils of Earth's 1st trees reveal their bizarre structure:::::Earth's first trees had hundreds of tree-like structures within them, making them exceedingly more intricate than the insides of modern trees, a new study finds.Researchers made the discovery after studying the fossils of 374-million-year-old trees found in northwest China.The fossils showed that these ancient trees had an interconnected mesh of woody strands, the researchers found."It's just bizarre," said study co-researcher Christopher Berry, a senior lecturer of paleobotany at Cardiff University in the United Kingdom.[Nature's Giants: Photos of the Tallest Trees on Earth] The two specimens were found in 2012 and 2015 in Xinjiang, China, by study lead researcher Hong-He Xu, of the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.The specimens belong to a group of trees known as cladoxylopsids, which are known to have existed from the Middle Devonian to the Early Carboniferous periods, from about 393 million to 320 million years ago, long before dinosaurs walked the Earth.Prior to these discoveries, researchers knew about fossilized cladoxylopsids from other locations, including Scotland, Germany and Gilboa, in upstate New York.However, these fossils didn't have the extreme detail needed to map the trees' anatomy.For instance, the 385-million-year-old Gilboa stumps were preserved in sand, which made it challenging to study their anatomy, Berry said."Most of it is just sand.It's very frustrating," Berry told Live Science."We came up with different scenarios to try to figure out how this tree would grow, but we just couldn't figure it out."A volcanic environment preserved the newfound specimens in much more detail than the cladoxylopsid specimens in New York, Berry said.Trees within trees The researchers named the newfound species Xinicaulis lignescens, which translates to "new stem becoming woody" ("Xin" means "new" in Mandarin; "caulis" means "stem" in Latin" and "lignescens" is Latin for "becoming woody.")X. lignescens was filled with hundreds of xylems, woody tubes that carry water from the roots of the tree to its branches and leaves.In most modern trees, the xylem goes up the center of the tree, and a new growth ring is added each year around it.In other trees, such as palm trees, the xylem is found in strands that are embedded in spongy tissue throughout the trunk.Unlike modern trees, the xylems of X. lignescens was arranged in strands on just the outer 2 inches (5 centimeters) of the tree, which meant the middle of the trunk was hollow, the researchers found.What's more, the xylem strands were connected to one another with a web of supportive strands, the researchers said.Surprisingly, each xylem had its own set of growth rings.As these hundreds of rings and their supportive webs grew, the tree got fatter over time, the researchers found.Examining cross sections of X. lignescens was like looking at hundreds of tiny trees within a larger tree, Berry said.As the xylems grew, they pulled at their supportive webs.This web would break but then repair itself, the researchers found by studying the volcanically preserved fossils."What you see, basically, is the way that each individual strand is growing, and the fact that it's slowly ripping itself apart but repairing itself at the same time," Berry said."That's the key to how this thing grew.It's just incredibly complex."[Photos of First Fire-Scarred Petrified Wood] Other cladoxylopsid fossils show that the tree had a pyramid-like base that tapered as it got taller.The new specimens reveal the mechanism behind this curious shape: As the tree's diameter grew, the xylems went from the side to the base of the tree, creating the well-known flat base and tapering trunk, the researchers said.Berry said he plans to continue to study these trees, and determine how much carbon they could capture from the atmosphere, as well as how this impacted the climate.The study was published online today (Oct. 23) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Original article on Live Science.
Ancient coptic tombstone found along Egypt's avenue of Sphinxes:::::Archaeologists unearthed an ancient Coptic tombstone during a dig Sunday (Oct. 22), according to Egypt's antiquities ministry.The tombstone is decorated with a cross and Coptic inscriptions that were carved onto a limestone block, the ministry said.It measures about 1.2 feet by 3 feet (38 by 98 centimeters).It wasn't immediately clear for whom the gravestone was made or when it was produced, but archaeologists plan to study it more to find out, Mostafa Alsager, the general director of Karnak Antiquities and the Avenue of Sphinxes, said in a statement.[Photos: 2,000-Year-Old Tombs Found in Egyptian Oasis] The tombstone was discovered by an Egyptian archaeological group that was excavating beneath the Al Mathan bridge in Luxor, on the eastern side of the Avenue of Sphinxes a well-known historical road that is lined with small sphinxes.These days, Coptic Christians make up just 5 to 10 percent of Egypt's population, but the majority of Egyptians used to be Coptic, according to Paul Rowe, a professor of political and international studies at Trinity Western University in British Columbia, Canada.The word "Copt" comes from an ancient Greek word that means "Egyptian," and it's used to refer to all Egyptian Christians, Rowe said.According to the biblical book of Acts, Jews from Egypt visited Jerusalem for the feast of Pentecost, a harvest festival that marked the birth of the Christian church just weeks after Jesus' crucifixion, Rowe said.These Egyptians took the Christian message back to their homes, which started the Coptic tradition.The majority of Egyptians were Christian by the fourth century, but a few hundred years later, during the Middle Ages, Egyptians began to convert to Islam, Rowe said.The discovery of the limestone tombstone may help archaeologists learn more about the ancient Coptic people who lived in Egypt, the ministry said.Original article on Live Science.
This shipwreck dates to when Genghis Khan's descendants ruled China:::::Archaeologists have uncovered a shipwreck buried under silt and mud that dates back around 700 years to a time when the descendants of Genghis Khan ruled China, sometimes from their palace at Xanadu.Although China was ruled by the Mongols, Chinese culture flourished at this time and the art and artifacts found in the 70-foot-long (21 meters) wooden shipwreck show motifs that were popular in China.These include a colorful jar depicting a dragon and phoenix.The ship, which the archaeologists believe was used for river journeys, was found at a modern-day construction site and had a hull sectioned into 12 cabins by 12 bulkheads, wrote the team of archaeologists led by Shougong Wang, of the Shandong Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, in a paper published recently in the journal Chinese Cultural Relics.[See Images of the Shipwreck Remains and Artifacts] Dating to the Yuan dynasty (circa 1271-1368), the ship held a shrine, a captain's cabin, crew quarters, cargo compartments and a control room that doubled as a kitchen, the archaeologists said in their paper.In the cabin that was used as a shrine, archaeologists found an incense burner and stone-carved figurines of "arhats," which, in Buddhism, are individuals who have attained enlightenment.The figurines show seemingly tame dragons and tigers sitting peacefully beside the arhats.Overall "more than 100 artifacts were unearthed from both inside the shipwreck and its surrounding area, including artifacts of porcelain, pottery, lacquerware, jade, stone, iron, bronze and gold," the archaeologists wrote in the journal article.Inside the crew quarters, the researchers found "porcelain ewers [a type of jug or pitcher], net sinkers, scissors, oil lamps and bronze mirrors," they wrote, adding that lacquerware was found in the captain's quarters and grain remained in the cargo compartments.Inside the control room, which also served as the kitchen, they found an iron stove, an iron pot, an iron ladle and a wooden cutting board.The researchers also found the ship's control system, which included a tiller located just above the control room on the ship's deck, the archaeologists wrote.Final moments "The deposits around the shipwreck and the cracking of its [hull] suggest the possibility that the ship sank after its hull was hit and the ship wrecked," the study researchers wrote.They didn't speculate on the fate of the crew; however, no human remains were found inside the shipwreck."During a relatively short period of time after the accident, the silt beneath the shipwreck was washed away by the current, [and] the shipwreck continued to sink to 1 m to 2 m [3.3 feet to 6.6 feet] below the original riverbed, then stabilized at its current location.Silt and mud were then deposited over it, and the shipwreck was completely buried," the archaeologists wrote.The shipwreck was excavated between October 2010 and January 2011 by archaeologists from the Shandong Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology and the Heze Municipal Commission for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments.A journal article with their results was published in 2016, in Chinese, in the journal Wenwu.Recently, this article was translated into English and published in the journal Chinese Cultural Relics.Originally published on Live Science.
Astronomers Race to Study a Mystery Object From Outside Our Solar System:::::For the first time that we know, an interstellar visitor has zoomed through our solar system.The small space rock, tentatively called A/2017 U1, is about a quarter of a mile long and astronomers across the world are racing to study it before it departs just as quickly as it arrived.Weve never seen anything like this before, said Rob Weryk, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy.On Oct. 19, Dr. Weryk was reviewing images captured by the universitys Pan-STARRS 1 telescope on the island of Maui when he came across the object.At first he thought it was a type of space rock known as a near earth object, but he realized its motion did not make sense.It was much faster than any asteroid or comet he had seen before.He quickly realized that it was not of this solar system.Its moving so fast that the Sun cant capture it into an orbit, Dr. Weryk said.After contacting a colleague at the European Space Agency to discuss the find, he submitted it to the Minor Planet Center, which tracks objects in the solar system, to share with other astronomers.Photo I was not expecting to see anything like this during my career, even though we knew it was possible and that these objects exist, said Davide Farnocchia, a navigational engineer with NASAs Center for Near-Earth Object Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
A Turkey-Size Dinosaur With a Raccoon-Like Bandit Mask:::::It shows that the world of dinosaurs wasnt so crazily far from what we could imagine today, said Fiann Smithwick, a doctoral student at the University of Bristol and lead author of the study.Photo A couple of years ago, Mr. Smithwicks adviser, Jakob Vinther, went to China and took high resolution images of Sinosauropteryx specimens under specially polarized light, which brought out their colors.The dark feathers the only ones that were preserved on the fossils were filled with melanin, the same pigment that colors our hair and skin.It is a strong molecule that is resistant to decay and can survive in fossils for hundreds of millions of years.Mr. Smithwick mapped the pigmented feathers on the fossils, finding that the Sinosauropteryx had brownish feathers covering its back and sides that stopped about halfway down its body.The rest of the feathers were most likely lightly colored.The color pattern is a form of camouflage known as countershading, and on the Sinosauropteryx the transition from dark to light happened relatively high on the body.Mr. Smithwick said that the pattern could provide insight into the type of environment where the dinosaur lived.He made 3D models of the dinosaurs color shading and tested them under different types of light to see where they would perform best as camouflage.He found that the pattern was most useful in open environments where sunlight is coming straight from above with little interference.When sunlight illuminates an animals top, it also keeps its underside in shadow, he said.This means that when something is looking at it, whether a predator or prey, the animal is seen as a three-dimensional object.More Reporting on Paleontology But countershading distorts the shadows in a way that makes the animal look less three-dimensional, and harder to spot.Animals that live in open, grassy environments have sharp transitions high on their body, from dark to light.But those that live in wooded or forested areas, like deer, tend to have a more gradual transition that appears much lower on the body.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The research suggests that countershading is not a modern evolutionary development, but a timeless camouflage technique.Mr. Smithwick added that the dark feathers around the eyes indicate that Sinosauropteryx had bandit masks, most famously seen in raccoons, but also in some badgers, ferrets and red pandas.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Researchers tend to think mammals use the patches as warning signs that tell predators they are aggressive and not to be messed with.But Mr. Smithwick thinks Sinosauropteryx used its eye patches either as camouflage or to block glare, like athletes who paint dark stripes under their eyes to reduce incoming sunlight.Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland who was not involved in the study, said the research was a leap forward in paleontologists understanding of Sinosauropteryx.We knew before that its feathers were vibrantly patterned, but this study shows that it was countershaded and even striped, Dr. Brusatte said in an email.These findings breathe life into this dinosaur.
Yes, Oysters Can ‘Hear.’ They Probably Wish We’d Clam Up.:::::Photo Like anyone with rowdy neighbors, oysters may be feeling stressed thanks to the growing problem of underwater noise pollution, and are trying to filter out the racket.New research published Wednesday in PLoS One reveals that oysters will close their shells when exposed to noises along a range of frequencies that includes the sounds emitted by known noise polluters like cargo ships and underwater oil exploration.In oysters, closed shells are an indicator of distress.Under optimal conditions, bivalve mollusks will keep their shells open, and are thought to shut them only when feeling stressed or threatened.Clamping their shells to screen out noise pollution or other artificial irritants could prevent oysters from perceiving important biological cues, said the authors of the study.Oysters must be able to hear breaking waves and water currents, which could trigger their biological rhythms, said Jean-Charles Massabuau, research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research and an author of the study.To hear the current arriving could prepare them for eating and digesting, possibly as when we hear and smell that somebody is preparing dinner.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Not being able to detect other natural events, like rainfall or thunderstorms, could also prevent them from knowing when its time to spawn, Dr. Massabuau said.
Ancient Skull May Be History’s Earliest Known Tsunami Victim:::::Here we start to see human interaction with some nasty earthquakes and tsunamis, said James Goff, a retired geologist at the University of New South Wales Sydney and author of the study.Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern half of a large, bountiful island just north of Australia (the western side is part of Indonesia).In 1998, after decades of relative geological quiet, a devastating tsunami rocked the country, killing more than 2,000 people.This huge volume of water struck the coast and swept away everything, said John Terrell, an anthropologist at the Field Museum in Chicago who has completed research in the country and is a co-author on the paper.The villages I knew and loved were sheared off.Photo Following the tsunami, Dr. Goff and some colleagues went to the country to assess the damage.The visit helped spark his interest in investigating whether there was a link between ancient tsunamis and the Aitape skull.After struggling for almost two decades to get funding for the project, he returned to the island in 2014 to explore the rain forests and crystal clear creek where Dr. Hossfeld had discovered the skull 85 years earlier.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Hossfeld had left detailed notes about where he had found the skull, which helped guide Dr. Goff and his team as they collected samples from the same sediment layer at a nearby river-cut cliff.Back at the lab, they performed geochemical analysis to determine whether the sediment level had been deposited by a tsunami 6,000 years ago.Because they had previously analyzed geochemical signals from sediment on the island following the 1998 tsunami, the team knew which clues to look for, like grain size and composition.They found that the sediment collected from the skull site contained fossilized deep sea diatoms.These microscopic organisms were a telltale sign that ocean water had drowned the area at some point.The researchers also found geochemical signals that matched the signatures they collected in 1998, offering additional evidence that a tsunami had struck around 6,000 years ago.Bang!Right where the diatoms were looking very sexy and youre getting excited, you have a signal that says, Hi, Im seawater, said Dr. Goff.More Reporting on Archaeology He said the findings checked all the boxes for a tragic tsunami tale.Yes, this was a tsunami.And yes, this is most probably a tsunami victim, and he or she is the oldest one we know.Sue Dawson, a geographer the University of Dundee in Scotland who studies tsunami sedimentation, said that the teams diatom evidence was similar to what she found examining sediments in Papua New Guinea after the 1998 tsunami and could be suggestive of a tsunami flooding the area.But she added that the findings do not rule out that the skull could have belonged to someone who died before the tsunami occurred and whose grave was disturbed by the event.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Ethan Cochrane, an archaeologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand and an author of the paper, questioned that alternative scenario.Tsunamis do not rip up the ground enough to remove already buried bodies and put them into suspension and transport them, he said, pointing to findings from rescue efforts with recent tsunamis.Overwhelmingly, the dead you find were killed by the tsunami.The geochemistry analysis supported the authors conclusions, another scientist not involved in the study said, although he added that it didnt contribute much to our understanding of the dangers posed by tsunamis.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is more of an intriguing geological snapshot of an ancient catastrophic event, said Iain Stewart, a geologist at the University of Plymouth in England.
One Simple Signal Sets Off a Complicated Frog Journey:::::South American poison frogs are known to most people for their poison and their brilliant colors.But in almost all species, the poison frog carries tadpoles on its back to a rain forest pool for their final growth stage.One species, Allobates femoralis, may or may not be mildly poisonous, and for color it has a splash of orange on its thighs.Thus its endearing common name, the brilliant-thighed poison frog.And sure enough, the females lay the eggs in a relatively dry spot in the rain forest, and once the embryos reach tadpole stage, the males load them on their backs and take off.Andrius Pasukonis, a researcher associated with the University of Vienna and Harvard University, has been studying these frogs in the rain forest of French Guiana to learn how the males find the pools and what triggers this complicated act of tadpole transport.He and Kristina Beck, a graduate student at the University of Vienna, and others, determined in one project that the frogs dont search for pools but return directly to pools they know.They really rely on their spatial memory; they dont randomly wander around the forest until they bump into pools, Dr. Pasukonis said.The publication of that research was the first time the navigational behavior of the frogs was described, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He and his colleagues also found that they could trigger the complex behavior of tadpole transport simply by putting tadpoles on a frogs back.The tadpoles could come from any frog at all.And the method worked just as well with females as males.That was a surprise, because in nature females only carry tadpoles if the male has disappeared, and then they will only carry tadpoles from the exact spot where they laid their eggs.Males will carry any tadpoles found in their territory.
How a 672,000-Gallon Oil Spill Was Nearly Invisible:::::Even so, 16,000 barrels is a pretty substantial leak, said Edward B. Overton, an emeritus professor of environmental sciences at Louisiana State University who is studying the environmental effects of Deepwater Horizon.But it was not enough on the surface to warrant a cleanup response.In this case, the oil degraded quickly, in part because of environmental forces.The company that operates the pipeline, LLOG Exploration, believes the pipe fractured in the early morning hours of Oct. 11, a company spokesman, Rick Fowler, said in an email.On Oct. 12, LLOG discovered that the amount of oil leaving its wells was different from the amount of oil leaving the companys floating production system, Delta House, which is in the Gulf of Mexico, about 40 miles southeast of Venice, La.The small crack in the pipeline has not yet been fixed, Mr. Fowler said, but the wells were shut and the flow through the pipe was stopped.What caused the fracture was unclear.The federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, which has regulatory oversight of the offshore energy industry, is investigating.The authorities determined that most of the oil droplets that escaped from the pipe, which was pressurized to more than 3,000 pounds per square inch, were so small that they were measured in microns, Lieutenant Commander Youde said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in Climate Change?Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Think of a soda can or a beer can, he said.If you shake it up and poke a tiny hole in it, it comes out in tiny, tiny droplets.Officials searched for the oil for several days before determining that it was unlikely to ever be seen, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Those minuscule droplets were ingested by oil-degrading bacteria that live in the Gulf of Mexico, Dr. Overton said.Some of the larger drops rose to the surface, where sunlight, wind and wave action helped break them down.As a result, the spill has some environmental impact, Dr. Overton said, but it doesnt appear to be measurable or significant.You have most of the impact when the oil can congregate into a very thick layer.Every year, natural oil seepage unrelated to the oil and gas industry releases an estimated 20 million to 50 million gallons into the Gulf of Mexico, he said, from hundreds, possibly thousands of different spots on the ocean floor.The families of bacteria that can degrade oil already exist in the Gulf, he said.So when they see more oil, what happens is those bacteria degrade that oil and start reproducing.The bacteria eat the hydrocarbons in the oil and turn it into carbon dioxide or more bacteria, and those bacteria become a food source for other organisms.An oil spill essentially serves as food for the bacteria, but there are times, like during Deepwater Horizon, when the bacteria are overwhelmed by the volume and cannot work fast enough to break it down.The oil released by the LLOG fracture was originally estimated to be between 7,950 to 9,350 barrels, then revised to 16,000 barrels.There is a high degree of confidence in the new figure, Mr. Fowler said.The spill is a reminder of the importance of continuing to research the Louisiana marshlands before the next oil spill happens, Claudia Husseneder, a professor of entomology at Louisiana State University, said in a phone interview.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Thats not if, but when, she added.Eventually there will be another big one that makes landfall.
Virtual Reality Gets Naughty:::::You can pretend like you are in the bedroom with me, and it is someone you have a crush on, she said.You are in the experience.Photo While virtual-reality pornography may feel like something out of a science fiction movie, it already has a formidable, if underground, presence.According to website Pornhub, views of VR porn are up 275 percent since it debuted in the summer of 2016.Now the site is averaging about 500,000 views (on Christmas Day in 2016, this number shot up to 900,000.)By 2025 pornography will be the third-largest VR sector, according to estimates prepared by Piper Jaffray, an investment and management firm.Only video games and N.F.L.-related content will be larger, it predicted, and the market will be worth $1 billion.Were getting more and more of it every day, said Mark Kernes, a senior editor at AVN Media Network, which covers the industry.We are leading the technology in this area.Sex sells, and where there is money to be made, there will be entrepreneurs who want to adopt it and make money from it, some by offering it for free to increase clicks.Pornography is what rushed along the first printing press, and spurred developments in the internet, online payment systems and other technology.Now its time for virtual reality, Mr. Kernes said: Im pretty sure there is more porn VR out there than regular VR.Headsets Are Just the Beginning Ms.Darling first experienced regular old VR at E3, a conference for the video-game industry.Excited by the pornography possibilities, she found a college student on Reddit who knew the technology but lacked a star.Before long, Ms.Darling started streaming weekly VR segments live from her bedroom in Los Angeles.Photo She was one of the first VR webcam women, according to Mr. Kernes.She then started a company named VRTube.xxx, which now employs over 40 performers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Though the pornography industry as a whole is challenging to regulate, considering the potential for abuse, disease and exploitation, the virtual kind comes with extra moral and maybe legal issues.For example, can you use someones likeness to have sex with them in virtual reality?Virtual reality is like the Wild Wild West, said Bryony Cole, the host of Future of Sex, a podcast that explores technology and sexuality.At this years AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, a convention and trade show held each January in Las Vegas, the latest advancements in virtual reality pornography were on display.CamSoda, a website that specializes in live sex videos, had an exhibit featuring pornography stars dressed in plunging bathing suits and waving visitors into the booth.They were showing off OhRama, a small canister that attaches to virtual reality headsets and releases scent during the action.Believe it or not, the scents were created by the girls, said Mr. Kernes, who was there.Its sweet and musty.They know what they like.Photo There are also companies that are adding taste and touch to the experience.Another big player is CamasutraVR, a start-up using 142 cameras that all look at one person, or one body part.They are creating images from that, which they are hoping will be indistinguishable from an actual person, Mr. Kernes said.Im sure those people wished they had been using that VR system at home.Still other virtual reality companies were showing off their partnerships with sex toy companies to create vibrators or penis pumps that link to VR material.As the action ramps up so does the vibrations of the vibrator, he said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.One of the most buzzed-about inventions has been the sex robot.The first one, Harmony, was introduced in May by a company named Realbotix.In seductive videos posted on YouTube, Harmony shows off her long legs, her firm breasts, her full lips, her lifelike hand gestures, even her intellect.How do you feel about sex?an unknown presenter asks her in one video.Sex is one of the most fascinating things in the world, she responds in a raspy voice.I dont see anything wrong with it.Harmony can connect with virtual reality so the user can interact with her in that space; she can perform all the acts the viewer is watching.Its a little bit of a video game combined with sci-fi, said Matt McMullen, the C.E.O.and creative director of Realbotix.The company has been making dolls for 20 years that were linked to artificial intelligence but not virtual reality.Based on our experiences with thousands of clients, Mr. McMullen said, people do use them for sex, but there is something more that exists.We focus on companionship.Photo Virtual reality has been nicknamed the empathy machine because it allows people to feel like they are truly connected to the action.Its neurological, said Holly Richmond, a somatic psychologist based in Los Angeles and Portland, Ore. You arent just watching and thinking about it.You are feeling it, and its not just your genitals.There is literally a mind-body connection.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When Ms.Darling does live X-rated performances, users can leave comments and chat to one another on the side of the screen.The people who are in virtual reality tell the other people watching me in 2-D to stop being jerks and knock it off, she said.They feel like they know me and are in the bedroom with me.Many sex therapists and educators are interested in the new technology, just as a dentist might be with the latest plaque-detection gizmos.Ms. Richmond worked with BaDoinkVR, a virtual-reality company in Rochester, N.Y., to create Virtual Sexology, a series of free videos that help men and women overcome common sex problems.A recent video, updated in June, takes women into the bedroom where they see how one blond, busty woman arouses herself before sex.She sits in front of her partner massaging her arms, her legs, her breasts.As her breathing heats up, a voice-over says that some women need to be physically touched before feeling any desire for sex.The first video, aimed at men, was the most downloaded video on BaDointVR.com in 2016 an impressive feat considering it was competing with noneducational pornography.Ms. Cole, the podcast host, is most excited about how virtual reality can be used in sex education.What if we had young people watch videos where they practice consent or practice identifying at-risk behaviors?she said.Or they can be in a room with someone who said, I contacted herpes and this is my experience.That is way more informative than a gonorrhea slide.Photo Indeed.Barbara Rothbaum, a professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine and the director of Emorys Veterans Program, is studying how virtual reality can help treat people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder caused by military sexual trauma.The program is building scenes that take victims to barracks, tents, private living quarters, latrines, offices or remote buildings and vehicles, where the trauma may have taken place.The idea is that going back to these places virtually will help victims confront their memories so they can move forward with more internal peace.But for virtual reality to work, the scenes have to be so lifelike that users get lost in them and take them for reality.They have to feel like they are participants, not just observers.We can create 3-D bodies in virtual reality and do whatever we want with them, Ms. Cole said.As the technology becomes good enough to make that happen, issues are bound to arise.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. McCullen said an issue his company has is clients commissioning dolls that look exactly like people they know in real life, maybe an ex-girlfriend they never got over or someone about whom they fantasize.His company requires written consent from the model for his or her likeness to be used.Ms. Cole said VR companies are going to have to address this same problem as they get better at customizing avatars to look exactly like what their customers desire.What are the lines between reality and fantasy and what can we do in this space?she said.What does consent mean in virtual reality?Can you do something to your girlfriend in virtual reality that you wouldnt do in real life?If you are using someones likeness in virtual reality, do you require their permission?And what about revenge porn?That will be even harsher in virtual reality.She is worried about the technology assimilating into the culture as easily as dating apps, drawing people away from flesh-and-blood encounters.Certainly partners will also have to negotiate whether virtual-reality sex constitutes cheating.It is, after all, much more lifelike than traditional pornography.But Mr. McCullen said a lot of people accuse his sex robot of doing that, but he believes he is helping alleviate a bad situation, not causing it.There are people who are already lonely, and people who live their lives being alone.They work all day and come home to an empty house, he said.This is just offering an alternative to those types of people.They dont have anyone else.
Amazon Key Is a Lot Less Scary Than My Post-1-Click Remorse:::::So, too, may more information about our choices, according to a 2008 study, The Blissful Ignorance Effect: Pre versus PostAction Effects on Outcome Expectancies Arising From Precise and Vague Information, published in The Journal of Consumer Research.Researchers found that the less knowledge consumers had about something before a purchase, the better they expected it to be and the more they convinced themselves that they liked it afterward.This reduction of cognitive dissonance is easier inside and after leaving a store, which never reveals anything negative about its products and doesnt typically burden the consumer with an onslaught of information that might impede an impulse purchase.But the sprawling internet bazaar is filled with scathing critiques, and every pertinent spec exists somewhere online for the diligent buyer to seek out.That one-star rating is hard to forget when your product is failing in the exact way the unhappy reviewer described.The most obvious difference between brick-and-mortar and online shopping is physicality, both of the item itself and the consumers presence in the store.Beyond the potential pitfall of not getting exactly what you thought you were buying online, a problem that is minimized when you can assess the product in person, the lack of tactile interaction may reduce our connection to the object.Martin Lindstrom, the author of several books on branding, has conducted studies on what makes consumers buy a product and how they feel about it after.In one, 34 percent of people who asked an employee for a product in a supermarket and were made to touch it ended up buying it; just 21 percent did if the employee merely pointed it out to them.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of 20 subjects, when the senses of smell and touch were paired with pictures of a product, the right medial orbitofrontal cortex, a region of the brain involved in the perception of pleasantness, was activated more strongly than when those senses were independently engaged.(On its own, smell was the most important sense.)The tactile experience doesnt end in the checkout line.After purchasing an item, the consumer typically takes it home.This act of carrying it into ones domestic space can bolster ones proprietary pride: You are now responsible for its existence in your world.That act, plus roaming through aisles beforehand and going from shop to shop, can also be physically and mentally tiring.But ordering online for an anonymous deliveryman to leave the item at ones doorstep or, with the help of Amazon Key, just inside is impersonal and not enervating.Its the difference between the estrangement of ordering takeout and the intimacy of cooking for oneself.And a pavement-pounding, shop-till-you-drop marathon may recall an even more primal method for acquiring nutrients.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Youre coming back to hunters and gatherers, Mr. Lindstrom said of in-store purchases.Dopamine kicks in when were buying stuff theres a reptile brain that tells us we need to gather things before winter happens.The more we have to fight for things, the less likely we are to return it after.When its delivered on Amazon Prime, you forget it was so hard to get this product.The tactility of how one finalizes the transaction itself can have an effect on remorse, too.Mr. Lindstrom found that 93 percent of consumers feel a stronger connection to cash than to credit cards and are more careful when spending with it.Likewise, for the least tactile connection he studied, Amazons 1-Click Ordering, 70 percent of respondents said it made them spend more money than even with a credit card.But whereas cash-based transactions lead to more immediate remorse, 89 percent of shoppers said they feel guiltier when they receive their credit card statements after 1-Click orders than when they pay in cash.The remorse still exists with online shopping; its just deferred, with extra pain later.Shopping on a website featuring attractive models or beautiful homes may engender the same sense of inadequacy that leafing through catalogs can, unlike picking them up in person, and that visual memory may linger when the object has been delivered, leading to remorse.Buying something online can also lead quickly to a social-media search after the fact for friends and strangers superior products (or better use of the same product).The sneakers I bought in this troublesomely bottomless marketplace were for casual wear, but I also needed a new pair of running shoes, a purchase that I undertook with more serious online research: reading reviews from specialized publications and individual users, comparing models from different years, taking quizzes to determine what was best for my particular stride.But even the highest-rated sneakers had their detractors, and those damning, all-caps review headlines (SHODDILY MADE, THEY RUINED IT) made me hesitate whenever I was on the verge of adding them to my virtual shopping cart.A week after searching in vain and the ensuing deluge of targeted ads, I visited a nearby running store.I tried on a few pairs and solicited opinions from one employee, then picked the sneakers that felt best.Within 20 minutes I was walking out with them, glad to have given my money to a local business over a soulless national chain.There is undoubtedly a better running shoe out there for me, and I could probably find it if I spent enough time scouring the internet.But je ne regrette rien.
Trump Plans to Shrink Two National Monuments in Utah:::::Earlier on Friday, Mr. Zinke met with Mr. Trump to discuss the recommendations.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, said a final report would be released shortly.She did not confirm whether the president has signed off on it in part or in whole.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Im not going to get ahead of the presidents announcement on the specifics of that, but I can tell you he will be going to Utah in the first part of early December and we will release more details at that point, if not before, Ms. Sanders said.A spokeswoman from the Interior Department did not respond to requests for comment.Environmental groups denounced the decision.Video It is a disgrace that the President wants to undo the nations first national monument created to honor Native American cultural heritage.And a travesty that hes trying to unravel a centurys worth of conservation history, all behind closed doors, Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council said, referring to Bears Ears.National monuments have long been a source of controversy among ranchers, miners and environmentalists.Conservative groups argue that such designations, similar to national parks, create regulatory burdens that hurt local economies.Bears Ears, which Mr. Obama created at the end of his term, has been a particular source of friction, as is Grand Staircase-Escalanate.Republicans in Western states have accused both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama of federal overreach in demanding strict protections for those sites.We believe in the importance of protecting these sacred antiquities, but Secretary Zinke and the Trump administration rolled up their sleeves to dig in, talk to locals, talk to local tribes, and find a better way to do it, Senator Hatch said.The decision was expected to be challenged in court.
The Stripes in a Cat’s Whiskers:::::Photo Q.How come my cats whiskers are striped, with bands of white and brown on each one?How does the pigment change like that as a single whisker grows?A.This banding pattern is typically associated with the agouti gene, which also produces banding in ordinary fur in some cats, said Robert A. Grahn of the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory at the University of California, Davis.But cat whiskers do not seem to follow the same pigmentation patterns observed in other hair types.In regular fur, the agouti gene controls the production of granules that carry pigment, speeding it up and slowing it down so that an individual strand winds up with light and dark bands.This produces so-called ticked coats, seen in many tabbies and Abyssinian cats.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The difference in pigmentation patterns for whiskers is likely due to more complicated development patterns and physiology, he said.The location of the whisker root is deep in the skin and is associated with a special blood supply and sensory nerves.
Isabella L. Karle Dies at 95; Findings on Molecules Helped Husband Win Nobel:::::Bhakta B. Rath, a former associate director of the naval laboratory, said, Isabella Karle took the task of deciphering the theory to provide not only a solution but also to show that it could be used to solve very complex molecules, such as proteins.Other scientists took notice in the mid-1960s.With a clearer picture of the structure of biological molecules, drug researchers now have a much better idea of the chemistry going on inside the body and how to formulate drugs to treat illnesses.After I found some structures that no one could have dreamt of solving before, it started to get a lot of attention, Dr. Karle told The New York Times in 2013.When Jerome Karle and Dr. Hauptman were awarded the Nobel for their work in 1985, Jerome Karle was deeply disappointed that his wife was not also honored.He wanted to not accept it, Ms. Hanson said, and she told him, Go ahead, thats silly, you should accept it.Photo Isabella Helen Lugoski was born in Detroit on Dec. 2, 1921, the daughter of Polish immigrants.Her father, Zygmunt Lugoski, worked for the citys transportation system.Her mother, the former Elizabeth Graczyk, ran a restaurant eventually with Isabellas help.My mother realized fairly early that I like numbers, Dr. Karle recalled in an interview in 2015.I soon became the accountant, so to speak.Fresh meat was delivered every day, and the butcher left the bill that had to be paid once a week.So once a week I added up all the numbers of the money that was owed him.She skipped a couple of grades in elementary school.Later, she learned she would need to take a science class in high school to attend a university.By whim, she said, she chose chemistry, and the teacher, a woman, sparked her passion for the subject.(Her father was initially disappointed.He had hoped she would be a lawyer, as he had wanted to be.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story She attended Wayne University (now Wayne State University) in Detroit for a semester before obtaining a four-year scholarship to the University of Michigan, where she received her bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees, all before she turned 23.She met her husband while an undergraduate: The spaces in the physical chemistry laboratory were assigned in alphabetical order, so Karle was seated next to Lugoski.I walked into the physical chemistry laboratory and theres a young man in the desk next to mine with his apparatus all set up running his experiment, Dr. Karle said.I dont think I was very polite about it.I asked him how did he get in here early and have everything all set up.He didnt like that.So we didnt talk to each other for a while.Eventually, they did talk again.They married in 1942.Both worked in Chicago on the Manhattan Project, the government effort during World War II to develop an atomic bomb.Isabella Karle developed processes to synthesize plutonium chloride out of lumps of impure plutonium oxide.The Karles moved to the Naval Research Laboratory after the war and stayed there until both retired on the same day in July 2009.Jerome Karle died in 2013.In addition to her daughter Louise, Dr. Karle is survived by two other daughters, Jean Karle Dean and Madeleine Karle Tawney; four grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.Isabella Karle published more than 350 papers.She was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.In 1993, the Franklin Institute presented her with the Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science, and in 1995 she received the National Medal of Science from President Bill Clinton in a White House ceremony.Dr. Rath, who supervised Dr. Karles work in Washington, said that her renown within the scientific community was so wide that when scientists from around the world visited the Naval Research Laboratory, they would very often make one request.They all wanted to see Isabella, he said.
Review: ‘Bill Nye: Science Guy,’ a Portrait of a Fighter for Facts:::::Photo In the film Bill Nye: Science Guy, Mr. Nye, the 1990s childrens-television personality with the signature bow tie, warns of an anti-science movement afoot in this country.And this delightful, revealing documentary, directed by David Alvarado and Jason Sussberg, offers evidence supporting that assessment.Mr. Nye, who left his Emmy-winning series after around 100 episodes, has embraced a new mission: educating an older generation as he champions space exploration and challenges creationists and climate-change deniers.In TV clips, Sarah Palin impugns Mr. Nyes credentials, and an Obama-era Donald J. Trump declares, Our president is worried about global warming what a ridiculous situation.Joe Bastardi, the former chief long-range forecaster at AccuWeather and a frequent Fox News guest, insists that extreme weather is merely meteorological variation, not the result of human-caused global warming.(Mr. Nye is polite but resolute as he argues with Mr. Bastardi during a visit to his home.)As we stand here, the Juno spacecraft just went into orbit around Jupiter, Mr. Nye says.Its an extraordinary accomplishment of engineering and rocket science.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Here is anti-science, he adds, gesturing in the direction of the Kentucky tourist attractions the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter, whose exhibits present such sights as prehistoric humans cohabiting, Flintstone-like, with dinosaurs, and a sauropod (a dinosaur species) dwelling on Noahs ark.Mr. Nye debates the museums chief executive, Ken Ham, on a stage, though his efforts only galvanize Mr. Hams supporters.The documentary also follows Mr. Nyes work as chief executive of the Planetary Society, as he collaborates with the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and spearheads the LightSail project (a small spacecraft powered by photons from the sun), a tribute to Mr. Nyes mentor Carl Sagan.And it accompanies Mr. Nye to Greenland, where he witnesses melting ice caps and ice-core studies revealing climate temperatures of centuries past and our fossil-fuel-poisoned present.
C.D.C. Panel Recommends a New Shingles Vaccine:::::Once a person has had chickenpox, the virus lies inactive in nerve tissue.Years later, it may reactivate as shingles.The C.D.C.estimates that about one million cases are diagnosed in the United States each year.This is what weve been waiting for, said Dr. Anne Louise Oaklander, an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and an expert in the disease.Shingles is an unappreciated and common cause of severe problems throughout the nervous system.Dr. Oaklander said that while rash symptoms lead some people to consider shingles as minor as a bad sunburn, the illness can cause strokes, encephalitis, spinal cord damage and loss of vision.Photo Given in one dose, Zostavax had shown a 51 percent reduction in shingles and a 67 percent reduction in nerve pain.Shingrix is given in two doses, and the company said clinical trials showed it to be about 98 percent effective for one year and about 85 percent over three years.By preventing shingles, the vaccine also drastically reduces the overall incidence of severe nerve pain, a lasting complication for about one in three people who get shingles.GlaxoSmithKline said it tested the vaccine in more than 38,000 people.We believe Shingrix will provide confidence in the protection one can expect from a shingles vaccine, said Luc Debruyne, the companys president of global vaccines.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The recommendation of the advisory committee will be considered an endorsement of Shingrix over Zostavax, although the closeness of the committee vote, 8 to 7, may mitigate the market loss for Merck.Dr. Kathleen Dooling, a medical officer in the C.D.C.s division of viral disease, said she expected the agencys final recommendation to be issued early next year.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Shingrix vaccine has the potential to prevent tens of thousands of cases of shingles and its complications, Dr. Dooling said.She cautioned, however, that more people had adverse reactions to Shingrix than to Zostavax, including fever and muscle aches.Patients and health care providers should be aware that this vaccine is very effective, but it also causes more reactions than they may be used to with other adult vaccines, she said.All indications are these are not dangerous to ones health, but they may interfere with your daily activities for a few days.GlaxoSmithKline said its new vaccine would cost about $280 and would be available next month.Zostavax costs about $223.
Albert Einstein’s ‘Theory of Happiness’ Fetches $1.56 Million:::::On Tuesday, Einsteins theory of happiness was sold by Winners Auctions and Exhibition, based in Jerusalem, for $1.56 million, adding him to the pantheon of the worlds most generous tippers.The identity of the seller, who is European, has not been revealed.(The second note sold for $250,000, according to the auction house.)Meni Chadad, a spokesman for Winners, said by phone from Jerusalem that the auction house had been approached a few months ago by a grandson of the Japanese bellboys brother.Photo After authenticating the documents, he said, the auction house predicted the notes would fetch $5,000 to $8,000.Bidding began at $2,000, but quickly exploded into six figures.The room erupted into applause, Mr. Chadad said.It was an all-time record for an auction of a document in Israel, and it was just wow, wow, wow, he added.I think the value can be explained by the fact that the story behind the tip is so uplifting and inspiring, and because Einstein continues to be a global rock star long after his death.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Winners said that when the bellboy arrived at Einsteins hotel room, the celebrated physicist had recently been informed by telegram that he would be receiving the Nobel Prize, and he had been overwhelmed by thousands of well-wishers who had flocked to see him.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.It said that the bellboy went to his room just as Einstein was trying to note down his thoughts and feelings.Unable to offer a tip, he decided to make the most of his new exalted status, the auction house explained.Einstein, who died in 1955, had a strong connection to Israel.He was a founder of Hebrew University and a member of its board, and bequeathed it all his papers.His wife Elsa donated a manuscript of his general theory of relativity to the university when it opened in 1925.How does Einsteins tip rank even if after the fact?One of the worlds most generous tips was given on March 30, 1984, at Sals Pizzeria in Yonkers, when a police detective named Robert Cunningham offered to give half his prize money from a $1 lottery ticket to a waitress, Phyllis Penzo.Ms. Penzo agreed, and they picked the numbers together.The next day, the ticket won $6 million.The story was later made into a film, It Could Happen to You.While Einsteins theory of happiness affirms the value of the simple life over wealth and success, Mr. Chadad said, the hotel messengers descendants were, nevertheless, elated by their new riches.They are very, very happy, he said.
For an Endangered Animal, a Fire or Hurricane Can Mean the End:::::Advertisement For an Endangered Animal, a Fire or Hurricane Can Mean the End When a wildfire swept through Arizona, all but 35 rare red squirrels disappeared.After Californias fires and Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma, so did other near-extinct animals.Image Mount Graham red squirrel Credit Joel Sartore/National Geographic Creative When lighting struck the Pinaleo Mountains in southeast Arizona at around 2:45 p.m. on June 7, igniting a 48,000-acre fire that reduced an ancient forest to blackened poles and stumps, a scurry of rare squirrels 217 of the 252 left in existence disappeared.Some were fitted with radio transmitters that burned to ash; conservationists deduced their fates.They hoped others had managed to escape.But for those 35 survivors biological remnants from the last ice age Jeff Humphrey, a spokesman with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, was deeply concerned.Most of them have lost the cones theyve stored for their winter nourishment, Mr. Humphrey said.How do we get them through this winter?The Mount Graham red squirrel is among more than a dozen rare or threatened species that either perished or suffered habitat loss during recent hurricanes and wildfires across the United States.Image Mexican spotted owl Credit Joel Sartore/National Geographic Photo Ark Southwest Fires The red squirrel was not the only creature affected during the Arizona wildfires, intensified by heat waves in the states south.After the fire, biologists and wildlife officers rescued Gila and Apache trout from forest streams before the water became clogged with ash, which happens when normal forest ground cover isnt there to filter the runoff.The Mexican spotted owl, which lives in wooded and canyon areas throughout New Mexico and southern Utah, was also vulnerable.Its primary threat is wildfires, but its far more abundant, Mr. Humphrey said.Image Amargosa vole Credit Joel Sartore/National Geographic Photo Ark California Wildfires In Southern California, the mountain yellow-legged frog, of which there were about 400 living in remote, drying streams in the San Gabriel, San Bernardino and San Jacinto mountains, could face a hard winter after fires destroyed their habitat .Dr. Bruce Stein, a conservation scientist at the National Wildlife Federation, said he also worried for the California red-legged frog in wine country, as well as for endangered salmon and steelhead living in the Russian River (as in Arizona, sediment flowing into the water could harm the fish).One of North Americas rarest species, the Amargosa vole, also lost part of its remaining habitat in a September fire in the Amargosa Basin near Tecopa, Calif. About 50 of the few hundred remaining mammals perished, said Janet Foley, a professor at the U.C.Davis Veterinary Medicine protection program.It killed off all the vegetation, she said, and they need to live in that.Image Attwater prairie chicken Credit Joel Sartore/National Geographic Photo Ark Hurricane Harvey Just five of the 29 rare prairie chickens being tracked at the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge near Houston survived Hurricane Harvey.The bird known for its funky mating dance was already critically endangered.During the last century, its prairie grassland habitat in Texas and Louisiana was plowed to create space for farmlands and cities.It was a devastating impact, said Mike Morrow, the refuges lead biologist.The good news is we have an established captive breeding program, he said.Had it not been for that captive flock, it could have resulted in near-extinction.Whooping cranes dodged a bullet, Dr. Stein said, when Harvey made landfall at their winter spot in Aransas County.At that time, the bird was breeding in Canada, but had it been in Texas, the species could have been wiped out, said Dr. Stein.The concern is what effect the hurricane may have had on the habitat, he added.Ocelots (a small Texan cat) and Kemps ridley sea turtles, which conservationists feared would be affected, also managed to survive the storm.Image Snail kite Credit Joel Sartore/National Geographic Creative Hurricane Irma Irma hit a number of species hard, including the Barbuda warbler and the Everglade snail kite.In Floridas Keys which Dr. Stein referred to as a biological hot spot the storm was bad news for butterflies like the Miami blue, Schaus swallowtail and Bartrams hairstreak; as well as green and loggerhead sea turtles and Key deer.The Key deer is a really charismatic animal, said Brian Hires, a spokesman for the U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service.Fewer than 1,000 Key deer are left in existence.All but 33 survived the storm, but may face challenges with restricted access to fresh drinking water.The Miami blue butterfly (there are fewer than 100 left) are only hanging on in a couple of Keys, Dr. Stein said.Hurricane Irma also cut off power to a Florida grasshopper sparrow aviary where the species, teetering on the edge of extinction, was successfully bred in captivity for the first time last year.Hours away from their backup generator shutting down, a service truck delivered 100 gallons of fuel to the facility.The grasshopper sparrow chicks survived.The fate of the Bahama oriole, found only in North Andros, South Andros and Mangrove Cay, is still unknown.Hurricane Maria In 1989, Hurricane Hugo killed almost half the wild population of Puerto Ricos native parrots the only remaining bird of its type in the United States.The animal with white-ringed eyes and a red stripe above its beak had, by this year, recovered to about 500 wild and captive individuals.While most of those at the Iguaca Aviary in Puerto Ricos rain forest survived, the fate of those wild birds in the Rio Abajo and El Yunque forests is unknown.Correction : An earlier version of this article identified incorrectly the area where the Barbuda warbler is found.It is Barbuda, not the Florida Keys.An earlier version also referred incorrectly to the range and conservation status of another bird.The snail kite is not generally threatened over its entire range; the Everglade snail kite, which is not found in the Florida Keys, is endangered.Correction : An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of a fire that destroyed part of the habitat of the Amargosa vole.It was in the Amargosa Basin near Tecopa, Calif., not in the Mojave National Preserve.
Lights, Camera and, Yes, Music: Reporting From the Operating Room as Doctors Perform Fetal Surgery:::::I learned about this one when I contacted Dr. Belfort about a YouTube video in which he described the need for tiny tools to operate on fetuses.Hes got a book full of his own detailed drawings a cross between Leonardo and Rube Goldberg of instruments he wants made.In our conversation he mentioned spina bifida surgery, and I wanted to see it.Permission was not immediate: Doctors, patients and hospital officials had to consent.Once they agreed, a public relations person was assigned to accompany me and a photographer in the operating room.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Before the operation started, one of the surgeons who would assist, Dr. Oluyinka O. Olutoye, shared a sobering thought about the potential risks of performing surgery on two patients at once.Fetal surgery, he said, is one of the few operations with a 200 percent risk of mortality.Operating rooms are usually kept cool, almost chilly.But not for fetal surgery.If the temperature is too low, the fetuss heartbeat can slow down too much, so this operating room was pretty hot.When the photographer, Batrice de Ga, and I were changing into scrubs in the womens locker room, a nurse warned, Its going to be like a sauna in there.It was crowded, too.Besides Dr. Belfort and a pediatric neurosurgeon, Dr. William Whitehead, there were two anesthesiologists, a pediatric cardiologist and two doctors who would steady the uterus and help to gently hold the fetus in position, as well as several nurses.For reporters in the operating room, the job is to see whats going on, stay out of the way and not touch or even get near anything draped in blue, which is the sterile stuff.Its O.K.to look over the surgeons shoulders as long as you dont brush their gowns.And the reporter has to stay out of the photographs, too.In this case there were amazing views of the surgery, on three flat screens that showed images from the camera inside the uterus.Because the doctors were operating through the tiny slits, they needed those images to see what they were doing.People often ask if Ive ever felt sick or faint in an operating room.So far, no: Whats going on is invariably so interesting, and Im so caught up in trying to understand it, that squeamishness just doesnt happen.I dont like the smell: Surgeons seem to cauterize everything they cut, and burning flesh has an acrid odor, but either it doesnt last or my nose gets used to it.At 9:28 that Tuesday morning, the soft Pandora music had moved on from Eric Church to Neil Youngs Harvest Moon, and he was singing, I want to see you dance again, as Mrs. Royers son came into view.He seemed to be kneeling inside her womb; we could see his bottom and the soles of his feet, impossibly small.Photo The operation was an endurance test for the surgeons.They stood shoulder to shoulder for hours, hands and arms in the air as they worked through the slits, painstakingly snipping tissue, stretching it over the open spine and stitching it shut to make a watertight seal.The spinal defect was so big that there seemed barely enough skin to cover it, and it was painful to watch it being tugged into place.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The room was so hot that I took off a gown Id been given to put over my scrubs, and I found a chair to sit in periodically, to give my legs a break.There were no breaks for the surgeons.Israel Kamakawiwoole was singing Over the Rainbow as the last stitch went into the fetus.By noon, the surgeons were done.I sweat like hell, Dr. Belfort said, peeling his gloves off pale waterlogged hands that looked as if theyd spent too long in the bath.Mrs. Royers husband, Joshuwa, his mother and Mrs. Royers parents were waiting anxiously, and crowded into a small room when Dr. Belfort arrived.Everything went very well, so you can relax, he said, showing them pictures of the fetuss back, before and after.So far, so good.Now we have to hope and pray she doesnt go into preterm labor.Mr. Royer was stoic, but the parents, the reporter and the photographer all burst into tears and hugged one another.Later, Mrs. Royers mother, Raquel Bourgeois, said the family understood that the operation was not a cure, and that her grandson would almost certainly have some degree of disability.But were strong believers in God, and were at peace, Mrs. Bourgeois said.This baby is going to be so loved.We just dont care.She went on: Lexi and Josh are very strong together.This is not going to break them.They are the best possible parents for this child in this situation.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I am wishing the best for Mrs. and Mr. Royer and their son, and I hope to report on how theyre all doing after hes born.
How Climate Change Is Playing Havoc With Olive Oil (and Farmers):::::But as the supply from the Mediterranean becomes more unpredictable, some bottlers are looking elsewhere as future sources of oil.Even some champions of Mediterranean oil, like Nancy Harmon Jenkins, author of Virgin Territory: Exploring the World of Olive Oil, recommend venturing further afield.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I hesitate to say this because I love the Mediterranean and I want people to have Mediterranean olive oil, she said, but I think California is going to be more and more important in the years ahead and places like Australia and New Zealand.Between June and August this year, it was exceptionally hot and dry across southern Europe.In Spain, temperatures soared above 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) in July.In Italy, rainfall was 30 percent below normal levels and in parts of the country, much lower still.Scientists with the World Weather Attribution program, a group dedicated to the study of extreme weather, concluded last month that the the chances of seeing a summer as hot as 2017 had increased tenfold since the early 1900s, and the chances of a heat wave like the one that hit the region for three days in August, nicknamed Lucifer, had risen by four times.We found a very clear global warming fossil fuel fingerprint, said Heidi Cullen, a climatologist who heads the program.Ask Italian olive growers about the weather this year and you hear a wide range of answers.It rained on one hill.It didnt rain on the neighboring one.One olive variety made it through the heat; another didnt.Even in one orchard, one tree hung heavy with fruit; another barely had any.Photo Photo Many said they would have to invest in irrigation.The one upside of the heat, they all said, was that the olive fly withered, too.On an unseasonably warm Monday in October, Ms. Contini Bonacossi and her brother, Filippo, took me through their family estate, known as Capezzana, in the hills northwest of Florence.Here and there, tiny, dried-up olives lay on the ground.A few trees were bare.But many were drooping with fruit: fat, purple-green olives, the sight of which made Filippo exceedingly happy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He is very excited, Ms. Contini Bonacossi said of her brother.She was less so.Capezzana would produce 20 percent less oil this year; as Capezzanas sales chief, she would have to ration it out to her loyal customers.Ms. Guidobaldi, for her part, was taking no chances.She started harvesting in late September, the earliest ever on the estate.It was still scorching hot.What if a freakish storm came and knocked the olives down?Bellissimo, she said, caressing the olives she had saved.I dont have children.These are my children.You cant just ignore them one year and then come back the next year and everything is O.K.On the southern edge of Tuscany, in a valley of scraggly oak, Riccardo Micheli didnt have the luxury of saving his trees with water trucks.Unlike Ms. Guidobaldis conventional farm, Mr. Micheli ran his, the Agricola Nuova Casenovole, according to biodynamic principles: he used no pesticides and left much of his land to wilderness.This year, nature did not return the favor.By June it was burning hot.The hills around his groves turned red, then brown, as though the seasons had forgotten themselves and June had turned into November.
‘Hotumn’ Takes Hold as October Temperatures Soar:::::Photo Piles of fall sweaters are drawing moths in closets.Once-roaring fireplaces stand crawling with cobwebs.Even the pumpkin spice doesnt feel quite right.Its late October, and yet summer, like a graceless party guest, hasnt taken the hint.Temperatures have scraped the high 70s across much of the United States this month, including in the Great Plains and Great Lakes regions and up and down the East Coast.In New York City on Saturday, the high was 78 degrees.Its enough to make one, or at least ones editors, wonder whether Vivaldi needs to write a new concerto.Photo Maybe we do need a fifth season.Not autumn, but hotumn a between-time when thighs and shoulders linger a little longer, and fans of fall fashion are left sweating in their boots.For beach bums and other summerphiles, cold weather sentences are temporarily commuted.Those on the East Coast shouldnt count on Tuesdays showers to help it feel like autumn.Even the rain is warm and sticky, and the high was forecast to hit 71 in New York.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It feels more like September or even late August, conceded Jon Gottschalck, chief of the operational prediction branch at the National Weather Service.

Congressional Auditor Urges Action to Address Climate Change:::::But Senators Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who jointly requested the report, said between the lines of a conservative government audit was an urgent economic message that Washington should heed.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Government Accountability Office if you will, the chief bean counter is basically telling us that this is costing us a lot of money, Ms. Cantwell said.We need to understand that as stewards of the taxpayer that climate is a fiscal issue, and the fact that its having this big a fiscal impact on our federal budget needs to be dealt with.The report, two years in the making, comes as the Senate prepares to vote this week on a $36.5 billion disaster-relief package to fund hurricane relief, a flood insurance program and wildfire recovery efforts in the West.Ms. Cantwell and Ms. Collins noted that the White House Office of Management and Budget had calculated that extreme weather events over the past decade cost the federal government $350 billion.Both asserted that the study should help move Congress and the administration past partisan fights over the science of global warming and toward a search for solutions something they said could be problematic given that the Trump administration is rolling back many of former President Barack Obamas climate change initiatives.My hope is the administration will take a look at this report and realize there is an economic impact here that is significant, Ms. Collins said.We simply cannot afford the billions of dollars in additional funding thats going to be needed if we do not take into account the consequences of climate change.The G.A.O.study draws on interviews with 26 scientific and economic experts and 30 studies, though it focuses most heavily on the only two national-scale studies analyzing the economic effects of climate change.One of them is an ongoing research project being produced by the Environmental Protection Agency, and the other is a study by several organizations led by the Rhodium Group that analyzed the potential costs associated with climate change in coastal property, health, agriculture, energy, labor productivity and crime.Trevor Houser, a partner at the Rhodium Group, which led the American Climate Prospectus study, said the accounting was on the conservative side.The agriculture analysis, for example, looked only at how changes in temperature and precipitation would affect four commodity crops.It did not study the fiscal fallout of events like wildfires and did not take into account the costs of infectious diseases linked to climate change.Climate change is clear and present danger to the U.S. economy and the fiscal health of the U.S. government, and that risk is really unevenly spread, Mr. Houser said.It needs to be actively managed by the federal government.Advertisement Continue reading the main story J. Alfredo Gomez, one of the lead authors of the G.A.O.study, said the federal government had identified climate change as a significant economic risk since 2013.This study, he said, asks the administration to use the detailed data to prepare for the inevitable.Robert N. Stavins, an economist at Harvard University, said he doubted the study would convince either Republicans in Congress or the White House to act.The G.A.O.study is conservative, its not alarmist, its realistic and balanced and they go out of their way to point out all of the uncertainties involved, Mr. Stavins said.I dont see any likelihood its going to be taken seriously.
U.S. Hospitals Wrestle With Shortages of Drug Supplies Made in Puerto Rico:::::Some device and supply companies have already begun limiting shipments of certain items from the island, ranging from mesh for repairing hernias to surgical scalpels and tools used in orthopedic surgery.On Monday, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, questioned companies statements that their plants were back in operation: We understand that manufacturing is running at minimal levels, and certainly far from full production, Dr. Gottlieb said in prepared remarks published Monday by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.He is scheduled to be questioned by the committee on Tuesday.In his prepared statement, Dr. Gottlieb said many plants are running at below 50 percent capacity, with many firms operating around 20 percent capacity, and some even less.We have found no firm operating above 70 percent of their normal operation.Photo In a recent interview, Dr. Gottlieb said he was worried that if conditions dont improve, more shortages of both drugs and medical devices might follow by early next year.Pharmaceutical products made in Puerto Rico account for nearly 10 percent of all drugs consumed by Americans, and about 80 firms make medical products there, the F.D.A.has said.I dont think weve dealt with a situation where weve had so many simultaneous impacts to what are very important facilities, Dr. Gottlieb said.So far, we have been able to mitigate these issues, but its been all hands on deck at the F.D.A., and theres been close calls.Dr. Gottlieb says the F.D.A.is watching the supply of about 30 drugs that are made on the island, in addition to medical devices.Most companies are still running on diesel generators, and manufacturers that have been able to connect to the power grid are still encountering an unpredictable supply of electricity, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Cathy Denning, the senior vice president of sourcing operations at Vizient, which negotiates with medical companies on behalf of its member hospitals, said several device manufacturers, including Medtronic, which makes surgical staples, and Stryker, which makes orthopedic surgery products, were shipping reduced supplies of some products to hospitals because of Hurricane Maria.We here at Vizient had an aha moment when we realized how much manufacturing actually takes place in Puerto Rico, she said.Last week, a Johnson & Johnson executive told investors that the company couldnt rule out intermittent shortages of some formulations of its products, although he noted that many were made elsewhere.Johnson & Johnson makes Tylenol and the H.I.V.drug Prezista in Puerto Rico, as well as other products.Soon after the storm, Johnson & Johnson Vision informed customers that a product used in cataract surgery might go into short supply, according to Vizient.A spokesman for Johnson & Johnson said production of the product has resumed, but that it has not yet been shipped from Puerto Rico.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The F.D.A.has been supplying logistical help to companies, providing fuel for the generators and assisting with moving finished products off the island.Dr. Gottlieb said some companies had gotten down to a 24-hour supply of diesel fuel, and representatives for the medical-device industry had said some generators were beginning to break down, requiring emergency repair.Pharmacists at half a dozen hospitals, from Utah to North Carolina, said in interviews that the fluid bag shortage had had a domino effect, leading to scarcities of a range of products as administrators race to stock up on the supplies they need to keep their hospitals running smoothly.Even products like empty bags and plastic tubing, which are also made by Baxter in Puerto Rico, have been hard to come by, some said.With drug shortages, it is often a race to see who can find a supply of the drug on shortage and also any alternatives, said Philip J. Trapskin, who is the program manager of medication use strategy and innovation at UW Health, the University of Wisconsin-Madisons health system.We have been able to get what we need to avoid disruptions in patient care, but the mix of products is not ideal and there are no guarantees we will continue to get the supplies we need.Photo Baxter recently announced that the F.D.A.had allowed it to import bags from the companys factories in Ireland and Australia, and said production in Puerto Rico was slowly resuming.The company, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., said it was also helping its employees on the island, including distributing generators and propane-powered cooktops for the workers use.While the storm devastated the island in a day, the recovery will take time, the company said in a statement.Baxter did not provide a timeline for when the bags would be back in stock, and pharmacists said they anticipated that the bags might not be available for many more weeks or months.This is a big deal for hospitals across the country, said Scott Knoer, the chief pharmacy officer at the Cleveland Clinic.Were really still trying to get the information we need to manage it.Baxter has been rationing its supply, shipping limited orders of the bags filled with saline and dextrose to hospitals based on a percentage of what the institutions typically use.We are getting small amounts, but it is nowhere what we need in order to take care of patients, said Jeff Rosner, who oversees pharmacy contracting and purchasing at the Cleveland Clinic.The impact has rippled throughout the clinics normal operations.Alternatives, such as injecting some drugs into an IV known as an IV push take more time for nurses, which divert them from attending to other needs.And the method is not appropriate for some drugs.This has repercussions, Mr. Knoer said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The pharmacists said the shortage had not yet affected patient care, although some of the alternatives require that employees learn new systems or adopt complex practices that can introduce human error.If the shortage persists, some said elective procedures, like knee replacements, might be postponed.It is a predicament that is all too familiar.While Hurricane Maria caused the latest problem, drug shortages have plagued the nations hospital system for years.The affected products are typically longstanding staples, like epinephrine or morphine, and are often sterile injectable drugs that sell for low profit margins.In 2014, a shortage of large saline bags, which were manufactured by Baxter and are not currently scarce, led to state and federal investigations into its business practices.Even the Mini-Bags have previously been in short supply, and pharmacists said shipments of the small bags had been unpredictable before the hurricane.Its like, do we have any great faith this company is going to be able to turn this shortage around, when they havent been able to effectively turn around the shortages they had in existence before?said Debby Cowan, the pharmacy manager at Angel Medical Center, a small hospital in Franklin, in North Carolinas Smoky Mountains.Like Dr. Gottlieb, many of the hospital administrators said their eye was on the horizon.With so many drug companies manufacturing products in Puerto Rico, Mr. Rosner said, I am fearful that this may not be the end of the shortages it may only be the beginning.
To Mend a Birth Defect, Surgeons Operate on the Patient Within the Patient:::::But now Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead are testing a new, experimental technique one that some in the field are eager to learn, but that others regard warily, questioning its long-term safety for the fetus.The surgeons had made a wide incision in the mothers lower abdomen, gently lifted out her uterus still attached internally and made two tiny, 4-millimeter slits.In one, they inserted a fetoscope, a small telescope fitted with a camera, light and grasping tool.The second slit was for other miniature instruments.Lit from within, the uterus glowed, red and magical in the darkened room.Spina bifida occurs early, at three to four weeks of pregnancy, when the tissue forming the spinal column should fold into a tube but does not close properly.There are 1,500 to 2,000 cases a year in the United States.Photo The causes are not fully understood, but in some cases a deficiency in the B-vitamin folic acid plays a role, which is why supplements are recommended for pregnant women and the vitamin is added to grain and cereal products.Introducing prenatal surgery for spina bifida was a bold step.In the early days, doctors were so worried about risk that they operated only for conditions that would be fatal if left unrepaired; if the surgery did harm, it would be to a fetus that would have died anyway.Spina bifida is generally not fatal, so the standard practice was to operate after birth.But the results of postnatal surgery were mixed: most children could not walk and had other problems.Doctors began to suspect that outcomes might be better if they could fix the defect before birth.Some of the spinal damage is caused by amniotic fluid, which turns increasingly toxic to the exposed nerve tissue as the pregnancy progresses and the fetus passes more and more wastes into the fluid.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Surgeons thought that if the opening could be closed before birth, sealing out the fluid, some of the nerve damage might be averted.They began operating in the 1990s, but it was not clear the surgery was helping.A landmark study published in 2011 found that for carefully selected fetuses prenatal surgery was better than operating after birth.The percentage of children who could walk independently rose to 40 percent from 20 percent, and the need for a shunt was cut in half, to 40 percent from 82 percent.The percent who benefit, I wish it was higher, Dr. Whitehead said, adding that so far prenatal surgery does not seem to help with bladder incontinence, and most children with spina bifida need catheters to pass urine.The ideal time for the surgery is from 24 to 26 weeks of pregnancy, Dr. Belfort said early enough to prevent some nerve damage, but late enough so that the baby has a decent chance of surviving and doing well if something goes wrong and it has to be delivered.Prenatal Surgery for Spina Bifida Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the spinal column does not close properly during the earliest stages of fetal development.In some cases, surgery on the fetus may reduce the severity of the condition.EMBRYO A groove along the embryos back folds together to form the neural tube, an enclosed space that will fill with the brain and spinal column.But a gap at the base of the tube can lead to spina bifida.Embryo at 21 days 22 days 28 days Head Back Gap DEVELOPING FETUS If the base of the neural tube fails to close, the spinal cord and nerves may be exposed or protrude through a gap in the spine, and the brain stem may be pulled down into the spinal column.Gap Embryo at 21 days 22 days 28 days Head Gap Back Gap EMBRYO A groove along the embryos back folds together to form the neural tube, an enclosed space that will be filled with the brain and spinal column.But a gap at the base of the tube can lead to spina bifida.DEVELOPING FETUS If the base of the neural tube fails to close, the spinal cord and nerves may be exposed or protrude through a gap in the spine, and the brain stem may be pulled down into the spinal column.His patient, Lexi Royer, 28, and her husband, Joshuwa, 29, were high-school sweethearts who had always wanted children.But Mrs. Royer had health problems that doctors said made pregnancy unlikely.She had one miscarriage and then did not conceive again.So the couple were thrilled in May to discover that she was pregnant.During an ultrasound exam at 13 weeks, they saw their son for the first time.There were a lot of happy tears, Mrs. Royer said.Then the ultrasound tech said she had to go back and get the doctor.A wrenching series of tests and visits to specialists followed.With each one, the news got worse.The defect was big and severe, and the brain stem was being pulled down into the spinal column.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It sounded like we were looking at brain damage, feeding tubes, a breathing tube, a wheelchair, just a bad quality of life, Mrs. Royer said.Termination was offered as an option, and Mrs. Royer felt that doctors were pushing it.But this might be their only chance to have a child.They wanted to learn more about their sons condition.Mrs. Royer, a hairdresser, and her husband, a firefighter and emergency medical technician, turned to the internet and discovered Facebook groups for parents of children with spina bifida.Some reported good results from a procedure that doctors in their home city, San Diego, had never even heard of: fetoscopic surgery.In early September, they went to Houston for two days of testing.The results confirmed that their son had a severe spinal defect, but still gave them hope.
The Cookie Crumbles: A Retracted Study Points to a Larger Truth:::::Before the study period, about 20 percent of the children chose an apple, and 80 percent the cookie.But when researchers put an Elmo sticker on the apple, more than a third chose it.Thats a significant result, and from a cheap, easily replicated intervention.While the intervention seems simple, any study like this is anything but.For many reasons, doing research in nutrition is very, very hard.Photo First, the researchers have to fund their work, which can take years.Then the work has to be vetted and approved by an Institutional Review Board, which safeguards subjects from potential harm.I.R.B.s are especially vigilant when studies involve children, a vulnerable group.Even if the research is of minimal risk, this process can take months.Then theres getting permission from schools to do the work.As you can imagine, many are resistant to allowing research on their premises.Often, protocols and rules require getting permission from parents to allow their children to be part of studies.If parents (understandably) refuse, figuring out how to do the work without involving some children can be tricky.Finally, many methodological decisions come into play.Lets imagine that we want to do a simple test of cookies versus apples, plus or minus stickers as this study did.Its possible that children eat different things on different days, so we need to make sure that we test them on multiple days of the week.Its possible that they might change their behavior once, but then go back to their old ways, so we need to test responses over time.Its possible that handing out the cookie or apple personally might change behavior more than just leaving the choices out for display.If thats the case, we need to stay hidden and observe unobtrusively.This matters because in the real world its probably not feasible to have someone handing out these foods in schools, and we need the methods to mirror what will most likely happen later.Its also possible that the choices might differ based on whether children can take both the apple and the cookie (in which case they could get the sticker and the treat) or whether they had to choose one.I point out all these things to reinforce that this type of research isnt as simple as many might initially think.Without addressing these questions, and more, the work may be flawed or not easily generalized.Advertisement Continue reading the main story These difficulties are some of the reasons so much research on food and nutrition is done with animals, like mice.We dont need to worry as much about I.R.B.s or getting a school on board.We dont have to worry about mice noticing whos recording data.And we can control what theyre offered to eat, every meal of every day.But the same things that make animal studies so much easier to perform also make them much less meaningful.Human eating and nutrition are typically more complex than anything a mouse would encounter.Overcoming these problems and proving spectacular results in preteens are some of the reasons this study on cookies and apples, and others like it, are so compelling.The authors have transformed this work into popular appearances, books and publicity for the Food and Brand Lab.Photo But cracks began to appear in Mr. Wansinks and the Food and Brand Labs work not long ago, when other researchers noted discrepancies in some of his studies.The numbers didnt add up; odd things appeared in the data, including the study on apples and cookies.The issues were significant enough that JAMA Pediatrics retracted the original article, and the researchers posted a replacement.The problems didnt end there.As Stephanie Lee at BuzzFeed recently reported, it appears that the study wasnt conducted on 8-to-11-year-olds as published.It was done on 3-to-5-year-olds.Just as mice cant be easily extrapolated to humans, research done on 3-to-5-year-olds doesnt necessarily generalize to 8-to-11-year-olds.Putting an Elmo sticker on an apple for a small child might matter, but that doesnt mean it will for a fifth grader.On Friday, the study was fully retracted.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Making things worse, this may have happened in other publications.Ms. Lee has also reported on a study published in Preventive Medicine in 2012 that claimed that children are more likely to eat vegetables if you give them a cool name, like X-ray Vision Carrots.That study, too, may be retracted or corrected, along with a host of others.As a researcher, and one who works with children, I find it hard to understand how you could do a study of 3-to-5-year-olds, analyze the data, write it up and then somehow forget and imagine it happened with 8-to-11-year-olds.The grant application would have required detail on the study subjects, as well as justification for the age ranges.The I.R.B.would require researchers to be specific about the ages of the children studied.I reached out to the authors of the study to ask how this could have happened, and Mr. Wansink replied: The explanation for mislabeling of the age groups in the study is both simple and embarrassing.I was not present for the 2008 data collection, and when I later wrote the paper I wrongly inferred that these children must have been the typical age range of elementary students we usually study.Instead, I discovered that while the data was indeed collected in elementary schools, it was actually collected at Head Start day cares that happened to meet in those elementary schools.This is a level of disconnect that many scientists would find inconceivable, and I do not mean to suggest that this is the norm for nutrition research.It does, however, illustrate how an inattention to detail can derail what might be promising work.The difficulties of research in this area are already significant.Distrust makes things worse.The social sciences are already suffering from a replication problem; when work that makes a big splash fails to hold up, it hurts science in general.We want to believe there are easy fixes to the obesity epidemic and nutrition in general.We want to believe there are simple actions we can take, like putting labels on menus, or stickers on food, or jazzing up the names of vegetables.Sadly, all of that may not work, regardless of what advocates say.When nutrition solutions sound too good to be true, theres a good chance they are.
Astronomers may have found solar system's first observed interstellar object:::::Oct. 28 (UPI) -- Astronomers are tracking what they believe may be the first observed interstellar asteroid or comet to travel through Earth's solar system, NASA said.The space agency said the object is less than a quarter mile in diameter and is traveling "remarkably fast."They're not sure what exactly it is.Paul Chodas, manager of NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies, said the agency has been "waiting for this day for decades.""It's long been theorized that such objects exist -- asteroids or comets moving around between the stars and occasionally passing through our solar system -- but this is the first such detection.So far, everything indicates this is likely an interstellar object, but more data would help to confirm it," he added.The University of Hawaii's Pan-STARRS 1 telescope discovered the object, named A/2017 U1, on Oct. 19.Post-doctoral researcher Rob Weryk first spotted the object."Its motion could not be explained using either a normal solar system asteroid or comet orbit," he said.Weryk said he also reviewed images taken at the European Space Agency's telescope in the Canary Islands and determined: "This object came from outside our solar system."NASA scientist Davide Farnocchia said the object has the most extreme orbit he's ever seen."It is going extremely fast and on such a trajectory that we can say with confidence that this object is on its way out of the solar system and not coming back," he said.NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies determined the object came from the direction of the Lyra constellation and is traveling about 15.8 miles per second.A/2017 U1 approached the solar system from above the ecliptic -- the plane on which the planets and most asteroids orbit the sun.Pulled in by the sun's gravity, the object then made a "hairpin" turn underneath the ecliptic, passing about 15 million miles under Earth.It began traveling back above the plane and is making its way toward the Pegasus constellation."We have long suspected that these objects should exist, because during the process of planet formation a lot of material should be ejected from planetary systems.What's most surprising is that we've never seen interstellar objects pass through before," said Karen Meech, an astronomer at the Institute for Astronomy.Since it's potentially the first object of its kind, the International Astronomical Union must first determine a naming convention before A/2017 U1 can get a permanent name.
New research shows how plants decide what shape to grow new leaves:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- How do plant cells know how to organize into the proper pattern as new leaves form?New research offers clues.Scientists have made great progress in detailing the communication among animal cells as they develop and form new tissue, but plants evolved separately from other multicellular organisms.As such, researchers know less about how plant cells organize as they form new structures -- like fresh leaves.New research out of the University of Tbingen's Center for Plant Molecular Biology suggests plant cells use unique signals called "small RNAs" to mobilize new cells.Previous studies have highlighted the role small RNAs play in triggering defense mechanisms against herbivores and disease, but the latest findings -- detailed in the journal Developmental Cell -- suggest the signal is also vital to the organization of fresh plant cells.Small RNA are similar to chemical signals used in animals in that different concentrations can trigger different thresholds, allowing the same basic signal to jumpstart a variety of cellular processes."Small RNAs are short molecule chains which perfectly match certain regulatory sections of genetic information in DNA or RNA," researchers explained in a news release."They are able to attach themselves there, thereby preventing those particular genes from being read."By altering the expression of genes, the chemical signals can dictate the formation and behavior of cells.To better understand how these chemical signals control leaf formation, researchers supplied new cells with artificial small RNA signals and observed how leaf growth was affected."The surprising thing was that the small RNAs were able to produce stable patterns," plant geneticist Marja Timmermans said."Unlike the conventional development signals, small RNAs operate in a highly specific way, and they can intervene directly in gene activity."Because plant cells are connected by plasma bridges, small RNA can move freely throughout the entire system.And the latest research suggests the signals can perform individualized tasks based on its location, enabling it organize new cell growth and form boundaries -- or leaf edges."Mobile small RNAs provide a high-performance mechanism for passing on positioning information," Timmermans said."They can develop precise development patterns."
New map identifies vulnerable mammals, conservation priorities:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- Scientists have published a new map identifying areas of priority for the conservation of vulnerable mammals.Researchers prioritized threatened mammals with the fewest close relatives, such as Australia's echidnas, or spiny anteaters, and Madagascar's lemurs.The team of ecologists analyzed the habitats of thousands of vulnerable and threatened mammal species to find areas of overlap, where targeted conservation projects will benefit several species.They published their results of their mapping effort this week in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B."Scientists have often focused on the number of species in a protected area, but studies like this one consider the degree to which the family tree of life is well represented," Dan Rosauer, biologist at Australia National University, said in a news release."This study seeks to protect all land mammals, but it gives top priority to species with no close relatives, because if they were lost there would be nothing like them left."With increasing habitat loss and mammal populations on decline, mass extinction has become a real threat in the face of climate change.As result, ecologists, biologists and conservationists have begun to consider how to prioritize the needs of endangered species.Some argue conservation efforts should prioritize those isolated on the evolutionary tree."This is the first time that anyone has mapped these priority areas for conserving the diversity of mammal evolution along with minimum target areas for habitat protection," Rosauer said."People are already working on these challenges, but by using this cutting-edge genetic information we can make far better decisions, protecting up to 32 percent more of the diversity of the mammal tree of life through better use of limited resources."Of course, researchers don't want to leave behind vulnerable animals.By also prioritizing habitats rich in biodiversity, conservationists can ensure they help a variety of species."By targeting areas with these really unique species, you would also protect a lot of other species too," Rosauer said.
Winters leave marks on Mars' sand dunes:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- New lab experiments suggest the sublimation of carbon dioxide -- which freezes in the winter and thaws in the spring -- is leaving unique marks on Mars' sand dunes.Much science has been devoted to the events and processes that shaped the Martian surface millions of years ago, but a team of scientists at the University of Dublin, in Ireland, wanted to better understand how the Red Planet's surface continues to be altered today.To find out, researchers tested how CO2 phase changes influence different types of surfaces."We've all heard the exciting news snippets about the evidence for water on Mars," Lauren Mc Keown, Ph.D student at Trinity College Dublin, said in a news release."However, the current Martian climate does not frequently support water in its liquid state -- so it is important that we understand the role of other volatiles that are likely modifying Mars today."Because Mars' atmosphere is 95 percent CO2, researcher figured it was the most logical volatile to experiment with.Unlike water, Mars' changing seasons move carbon dioxide through several phase changes."Mars has seasons, just like Earth, which means that in winter, a lot of the CO2 in the atmosphere changes state from a gas to a solid and is deposited onto the surface in that form," Mc Keown said."The process is then reversed in the spring, as the ice sublimates, and this seasonal interplay may be a really important geomorphic process."The experiments were inspired by patterns first observed on Martian sand dunes several years ago by Dublin researcher Mary Bourke."I called them 'sand furrows' as they were elongated shallow, networked features that formed and disappeared seasonally on Martian dunes," Bourke said."What was unusual about them was that they appeared to trend both up and down the dune slopes, which ruled out liquid water as the cause."To see whether CO2 could be responsible for the sand furrows, Bourke and her research partners place blocks of frozen CO2 on miniature sand dune models.They conducted the experiments inside a low humidity chamber.The tests showed sublimating CO2 can leave a wide variety of uniquely shaped furrows on the sand surface."The difference in temperature between the sandy surface and the CO2 block will generate a vapor layer beneath the block, allowing it to levitate and maneuver downslope, in a similar manner to how pucks glide on an ice-hockey table, carving a channel in its wake," Mc Keown said."At the terminus, the block will sublimate and erode a pit.It will then disappear without a trace other than the roughly circular depression beneath it."Similar formations, called gullies, are formed by water and ice migrating down rocky slopes on Earth, but the terminuses are usually marked by debris deposits, not a depression, which suggests Martian gullies and furrows are indeed formed by CO2, not water.The lab tests showed under certain conditions, frozen CO2 blocks can sublimate fast enough enough to burrow directly into the sand and become swallowed up in less than a minute, leaving only a slight depression behind."This process is really unlike anything seen to occur naturally on Earth -- the bed appears fluidized and sand is kicked up in every direction," Mc Keown said."When we first observed this particular effect, it was a really exciting moment."The researchers described the effects of sublimating CO2 on sand in a new paper published this week in the journal Scientific Reports.
Astronomers detect comets outside the Milky Way:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- An international team of researchers has identified six extra-galactic comets, or exocomets, outside the Milky Way.The discovery was assisted by amateur astronomers.The distant ice balls, roughly the size of Halley's Comet, were spotted orbiting a small star 800 light-years from Earth.They were documented using transit photometry -- the first time the technique has been used to identify comets.Transit photometry describes the measurement of light dimming as objects pass across the face of a luminous object, like a star.The dimming can reveal the presence of planets and other orbital objects.In recent years, the improved precision of astronomical instruments has allowed scientists to measure even the slightest dimming of distant stars.The six comets -- detailed this week in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society -- were revealed by their tails, which blocked out just 1 percent of their host star's light."It's amazing that something several orders of magnitude smaller than the Earth can be detected just by the fact that it's emitting a lot of debris," Saul Rappaport, professor emeritus of physics at MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, told MIT News."It's pretty impressive to be able to see something so small, so far away."The data that revealed the light-dimming caused by the tails of distant exocomets was recorded by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope.The unusual dimming was first identified by an amateur astronomer, Thomas Jacobs, who enjoys surveying Kepler data for irregularities in his spare time."Looking for objects of interest in the Kepler data requires patience, persistence, and perseverance," Jacobs told MIT."For me it is a form of treasure hunting, knowing that there is an interesting event waiting to be discovered.It is all about exploration and being on the hunt where few have traveled before."Scientists have designed computer algorithms to parse transit data and pick out patterns caused by passing planets, but Jacobs set out to find dimming signatures missed by the computers -- specifically, one-time, or single, transits, dimming that does not repeat with regularity.Jacobs found three such transits and alerted scientists, including researchers at MIT.When they looked closer, they found six, and the light signatures they discovered surprised them.Instead of a U-shaped dimming pattern caused by a planet passing across the face of the star, scientists found sharp dips followed by a gradual rise.The signatures suggested the presence of disintegrating planets with tails of debris.But disintegrating planets would create a repeating dimming pattern.Instead, they found isolated signatures."We thought, the only kind of body that could do the same thing and not repeat is one that probably gets destroyed in the end," Rappaport said."The only thing that fits the bill, and has a small enough mass to get destroyed, is a comet."The discovery could offer new insights into ways solar systems evolve.Scientists believe water and other ingredients essential to life were delivered by comets early in Earth's history.The discovery of six comets passing close to their host star in the span of four years suggest bombardment eras may be common in young solar systems.
New study details bacteria's 'sense of touch':::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- How do bacteria sense and grab hold of surfaces, allowing biofilms to fester in hospitals and clog up sewer pipes?A new study detailing microganisms' "sense of touch" has offered some answers.Scientists first observed a bacterium cell's feelers, or pili, hair-like appendages that sense the cell's surroundings, using targeted fluorescent dye delivered by tiny maleimide molecules.The dyes allowed researchers to watch the movement of pili under a high-powered microscope.Researchers were able to make the pili appear larger and fluoresce by substituting the chain up amino acids that normally make up the cell's appendages with an amino acid called a cysteine.The dyes bind easily with cysteine, enhancing the appendages visibility under the microscope."It's like switching on a light in a dark room," Courtney Ellison, a doctoral student at Indiana University, said in a news release."Pili are composed of thousands of protein subunits called pilins, with each protein in the chain composed of amino acids arranged like a tangled mess of burnt-out Christmas lights.Swapping out a single light can illuminate the whole string."To better understand how bacteria grab onto surfaces and create a biofilm, scientists tricked cells into thinking they were sensing a surface.They did so by using a large maleimide molecule to block the movement of the cell's pili.Pili can extend and retract through the cell wall to "feel" around for nearby objects.The maleimide molecule effectively blocked the pili's ability to extend and move, tricking the cell into thinking it had bumped up against a surface."It's like trying to pull a rope with a knot in the middle through a hole -- the maleimide molecule can't pass through the hole the cell uses to extend and retract the pili," Ellison said.The experiment -- detailed in a new paper published this week in the journal Science -- confirmed that a cell becomes aware of a surface when the pili's movement is restricted."These results told us the bacteria sense the surface like how a fisherman knows their line is stuck under water," said Yves Brun, professor of biology at IU."It's only when they reel in the line that they sense a tension, which tells them their line is caught.The bacteria's pili are their fishing lines."Biofilms can thwart valuable infrastructure and cause deadly infections, but researchers hope their new research will help scientists develop new ways to thwart their formation and growth."The more we understand about the mechanics of pili in biofilm formation and virulence, the more we can manipulate the process to prevent harm to people and property," Brun said.
Peak of fall foliage can be seen from space:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Every autumn, many trek to New England to soak in the foliage as Green and White mountains of New Hampshire and Vermont turn a potpourri of yellows, oranges and reds.A new image from NASA, however, suggests the best leaf-peeping perspective may be from space.The image -- captured last week by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on NASA's Terra satellite and shared online this week -- showcases the autumn colors spreading across the forests of North America."With temperatures falling and fewer hours of daylight in the northern hemisphere, autumn colors are sweeping across the eastern United States and Canada," NASA wrote in a blog update.According to the Foliage Network, which tracks the color of the leaves across North America, fall colors are just passing their peak in Upstate New York, Northern Michigan and across much of New England.While rates of leaf dropping are accelerating, much of the Northeast is still experiencing peak color.Earlier this week, NASA's Earth Observatory shared images of the vivid foliage in Northern Maine, where the colorful autumnal leaves of deciduous trees contrast with the deep greens of conifer stands.
Urban cooling study: When surrounding farms get hot and dry, cities cool off:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Until now, scientists thought city temperatures knew just one direction -- up.Many studies have documented what's known as the heat island effect, but new research shows some cities, especially in India, benefit from an urban cooling phenomenon.Usually suburban and rural land, with more vegetation, experience more cooling than cities, where concrete buildings and paved roads bake in the sun and encourage rising temperatures.Scientists have worried that residents of cities -- the majority of the world's population -- will experience global warming more dramatically than their suburban and rural peers.But new research shows 60 percent of cities in India experience a cooling effect during the daytime.According to a new paper on the subject -- published this week in the journal Scientific Reports -- the cooling effect is explained by a lack of vegetation and moisture in the areas surrounding many of India's cities."When the areas around cities are running low on water and they aren't being irrigated, they turn into hot, dry, barren fields," Matthew Huber, a professor of earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences at Purdue University, said in a news release."When that happens, there's actually more water available to evaporate in the cities than the surrounding countryside.It's like the cities are sweating."Huber and his colleagues used daily temperature measurements in dozens of Indian cities, as well as temperature data from surrounding farmland, to build a model of urban heating and cooling.They used climate models to determine the impact of irrigation on local temperature patterns.Their simulations showed agricultural irrigation is the main driver of moisture availability on lands surrounding cities.When irrigation is curtailed, less moisture is available on rural farmland than in the city.As such, rural inhabitants are likely to experience the effects of heat waves more dramatically than those in the city.The research showed that both cities and their unirrigated rural neighbors experience nighttime heating.And Huber suggests the daytime cooling effect experienced in many Indian cities may not last."As conditions warm, it's more likely that this effect would go away rather than intensify," he said."On the other hand, this shows that green infrastructure could be really effective at cooling cities."Watering plants in the city could further rob the countryside of water, leaving them baking in the sun.Centuries of agricultural expansion has left many of India's water resources depleted and dried out much of the subcontinent, leading to significant desertification.The latest research is a reminder of the balancing act policy makers will face as they work to protect different populations from the consequences of climate change."Are you going to impoverish the countryside and leave those areas barren, and the cities lush?"Huber said."These are the kinds of questions we're asking: what are the tradeoffs?"
New technology can weigh single cells, measure mass fluctuation in real time:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Scientists in Switzerland have developed a scale capable of weighing a single living cell.The device can even calculate changes in a cell's weight in real time -- with precision to milliseconds and trillionths of a gram.The scale was designed by scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, or ETH Zurich.The device's arm features a transparent silicon cantilever.The wafer-thin plate is coated with a film of collagen or fibronectin.To weigh a cell, scientists lower the cantilever in a cell culture chamber where it presses against the cell and picks it up."The cell hangs on the underside of a tiny cantilever for the measurements," doctoral student Gotthold Flschner, who helped design the scale, said in a news release.At the opposite end of the device's arm is a pulsing blue laser, which causes the nanoscale cantilever to oscillate.A second infrared laser measures the oscillation before and after the cell is affixed to the plate."The cell's mass can be calculated from the difference between the two oscillations," said researcher David Martnez-Martn, who invented the device.The technology feeds real-time measurements to a computer screen.A cell's mass fluctuations can be tracked for several hours or even days.The scale can be installed on the object plate of a high-performance fluorescence microscope, allowing scientists to observe biochemical process inside the cell while monitoring changes in the cell's weight.Early tests using the scale has already begun to offer insights."We established that the weight of living cells fluctuates continuously by about one to four percent as they regulate their total weight," said Martnez-Martn.The fluctuation in weight only ceases after the cell dies."We're seeing things that nobody else has yet observed," Flschner said.Researchers described their new technology in a paper published this week in the journal Nature.Scientists expect the new technology to be used to study a variety of cellular processes.The device could be used to analyze a pathological mechanisms inside a diseased cell or observe the effects of a new drug."A cell's mass is a very good indicator of its physiology," said Martnez-Martn.The patented scale -- which could also be used by material scientists to measure nanoparticles -- will soon by manufactured by Swiss company Nanosurf AG.
Ancient footprints reveal new megatheropod dinosaur species from southern Africa:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Researchers have found evidence of a new "megatheropod" dinosaur species from southern Africa.The giant carnivore roamed the continent some 200 million years ago.The dinosaur's presence was revealed by a set of three-toed footprints.The dimensions of the prints suggest the species, named Kayentapus ambrokholohali, measured 30 feet from head to tail and rose 10 feet at the hip."The latest discovery is very exciting and sheds new light on the kind of carnivore that roamed what is now southern Africa," Fabien Knoll, senior research fellow at the University of Manchester, said in a news release."That's because it is the first evidence of an extremely large meat-eating animal roaming a landscape otherwise dominated by a variety of herbivorous, omnivorous and much smaller carnivorous dinosaurs.It really would have been top of the food chain."Ripples in the ancient rock where the prints were found suggest the site was once home to a watering hole or river bank.Should the massive carnivore have showed up for a drink, he might have scared away most of the residents.Other members of the "megatheropod" dinosaur group, like Tyrannosaurus rex, didn't appear on the scene for another 60 million years.The diversity of large theropods didn't expand until the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous."This discovery marks the first occurrence of very large carnivorous dinosaurs in the early Jurassic of southern Gondwana -- the prehistoric continent which would later break up and become Africa and other landmasses," said Lara Sciscio, postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Cape Town."This makes it a significant find.Globally, these large tracks are very rare."Researchers described the novel theropod tracks this week in a new paper published in the journal PLOS ONE.
Investment in conservation pays dividends, research shows:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- New research suggests conservation investments aren't wasted.Most of the time, investments translate to better protected species.During the decade following the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, countries spent $14.4 billion on conservation.According to the latest analysis, those investments reduced anticipated declines in global biodiversity by 29 percent.A team of international researchers charted the impacts of conservation spending across dozens of countries between 1992 and 2003, comparing the size and scope of conservation efforts with shifts in trajectory of vulnerable species' conservation status.Scientists relied on data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species to gauge the health of target species in various countries.In tracking specific conservation projects, scientists made sure to allow time for impacts to materialize up in the conservation assessments of targeted species.The research findings -- published this week in the journal Nature -- showed conservationists get the most bang for their buck in developing countries."This paper sends a clear, positive message: Conservation funding works," senior author John Gittleman, dean of the Odum School of Ecology at the University of Georgia, said in a news release.Conservation funding works best in developing countries because many of the world's developing nations are home to the richest biodiversity hotspots on the planet.The same countries are also the most vulnerable.In fact, 60 percent of global biodiversity losses between 1992 and 2003 were attributable to seven countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, China, India, Australia and the United States -- mostly as a result of biodiversity loss in Hawaii.Researchers also found that population growth and the expansion of farmland was linked with increased pressure on vulnerable species.But the latest findings offer proof that negative trends can be reversed and pressure on vulnerable species can be relieved by investing in conservation."For 25 years, we have known that we need to spend more on nature conservation, or face a modern mass extinction as serious as that of the dinosaurs," said lead author Anthony Waldron of Oxford University."But governments and donors have been unwilling to come up with the necessary budgets, often because there was little hard evidence that the money spent on conservation does any good.This finding should now encourage decision makers to re-engage with the Earth Summit's positive vision, and adequately bankroll the protection of Earth's biodiversity today."
To survive, marine microbes living beneath the seabed must resort to cannibalism:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- In order to survive, marine microbes living buried beneath seabed sediments must resort to cannibalism, according to a new study.In an effort to better understand how microorganisms break down carbon trapped in the sediments at the bottom of the ocean, a team of researchers at the Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich conducted a genetic analysis of the enzymes secreted by resident microbial communities.Extracellular enzymes are secreted by microbes to accelerate the breakdown of surrounding organic detritus.The byproducts of the breakdown process are reabsorbed as proteins that serve as fuel for the microbes.Enzymes secreted into the surrounding sediment contain signature strings of amino acids that mark its extracellular destiny.The microbe's secretory mechanism recognizes this signature and allows the enzyme access to the outside world.These RNA fragments can be sequenced in the lab and used to study the microbes that released them."Using a novel bioinformatic method, we searched for evolutionarily conserved, and hence functionally important, amino-acid sequence motifs within these recognition sequences," William Orsi, professor of geomicrobiology at LMU, said in a news release."In this way, we were able, for the first time, not only to use genetic data to deduce enzyme functions, but also to specifically identify those enzymes that are secreted by cells that live in these sediments."Researchers sequenced the genetic material found in sediments recovered from deep-sea drilling sites situated off the coast of Peru.Some of the sediments were 2.8 million years old.The researchers' analysis -- detailed this week in the journal Nature Microbiology -- showed different communities of bacteria, archaea and fungi buried in seabed sediments use an array of enzymes to breakdown carbohydrates, lipids and proteins into usable sources of energy.The enzymes can also breakdown dead cells, allowing microbes to eat their own kind for additional sustenance."Many of the enzymes synthesized and secreted by fungal cells specifically attack the cell walls of archaea, while many of the extracellular enzymes released by bacteria can degrade the cell walls of fungi," Orsi said."In other words, different classes of microbes apparently cannibalize one another's 'carcasses.'"Marine sediments are the planet's largest carbon reserve.Scientists hope an improved understanding of the microbial communities living in the seabed will help them more accurately model how carbon and other organic molecules are recycled.
It's science: Men, women both attracted to arched backs:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- Men and women are biologically programmed to be drawn to the arched back of a female, new research suggests.Scientists at the University of Minho in Portugal used 3D models and eye-tracking technology to showcase how slight shifts in posture affect the perception of a woman's attractiveness.Researchers used computers to generate six 3D models of female upper bodies.Each model featured a slightly different posture, their backs tweaked subtly while still maintaining normal body angles.The models images, pictured from the front, side and the back, were presented to 82 undergraduate students -- a mix of men and women.The study participants were asked to rate the attractiveness of each model.Both men and women rated the models with their backs more arched as more attractive."Increased curvature increases the perception of attractiveness," researcher Farid Pazhoohi said in a news release.Eye-tracking technology showed both men and women focused their gaze on the rear-view of each model for longer periods of time than on other perspectives.Men tended to focus on the hips, while women trained their eyes on the waist.The link between arched backs and attractiveness was stronger for rear and side-views."The latter highlights the unique influence of an arched back on the perception of attractiveness," said Pazhoohi.The curve in the spine that allows the lower back to bend inward toward the belly is called lordotic posture.Previous studies have showcased the role the posture plays in signaling a female's readiness to mate among a variety of animals, including rats, guinea pigs, sheep, cats, ferrets and primates.The latest research -- detailed this week in the journal Evolutionary Psychological Science -- suggests the evolutionary signal may also influence human behavior."The perception of attractiveness and visual attention to the hip region suggests that lordosis or the arching of the back might signal human females' proceptivity or willingness to be courted," Pazhoohi said."This also might explain why women wear high heel shoes and why wearing high heel shoes increases womens' attractiveness."
Palm oil production, deforestation blamed for rising temperatures in Indonesia:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- The clearing of forests for palm oil production has triggered rising temperatures in Indonesia, according to a new study.Previous studies have detailed the negative consequences of land conversion and deforestation on biodiversity, but the latest is one of the first to reveal the impacts on temperatures."Land use change from forest to cash crops such as oil palm and rubber plantations does not only impact biodiversity and stored carbon, but also has a surface warming effect, adding to climate change," Alexander Knohl, a professor in bioclimatology at the University of Gottingen in Germany, said in a news release.The island of Sumatra has suffered the greatest loss of rainforest in Indonesia.When researchers measured the surface temperatures of different types of land in Sumatra's Jambi province, they found clear-cut acreage was 10 degrees Celsius warmer than forests."Clear-cut land is the phase between forest and other land cover types, such as small-holders [small-scale family farms] or commercial plantations," said doctoral student Clifton Sabajo."From field observations, we know that the landscape is so dynamic that there are continuous land use changes all the time, so clear-cut land is always present."Mature palm plantations, those older than five years, featured surface temperatures just 0.8 degrees warmer than forests.Younger plantations feature hotter surfaces, as the palms' canopies are less developed, allowing more sunlight to penetrate and warm the earth.There's also less evaporative cooling, as fewer leaves translates to less transpiration.Evaporative cooling works to keep forests cool, just as perspiration helps to cool the human body.As detailed in their new paper, published this week in the journal Biogeosciences, scientists estimate land-use changes were responsible for 0.6 degrees of warming between 2000 and 2015.That trend is likely to continue as Indonesia continues to clear forests at rates rivaling Brazil to meet the global demand for palm oil, the world's most popular cooking oil."We think that current land-use developments in Indonesia need to carefully evaluate all aspects of environmental and socio-economic consequences," Knohl warned."Land-surface temperature and microclimate should be considered."
ESO releases massive image of nearby Fornax Cluster:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- The European Southern Observatory has released a 2.3-gigapixel image of the Fornax Cluster, the second most populous galaxy cluster within 100 million light-years of the Milky Way.The image is one of the largest ever released by ESO.The giant image was captured using the VLT Survey Telescope, located at ESO's Paranal Observatory in Chile.It was captured as part of the ongoing Fornax Deep Survey, an effort to render the galaxy cluster in a variety of wavelengths.The cluster's brightest galaxy is NGC 1316, which was formed by the mergers of several smaller galaxies.The outer layers of the galaxy's lens-like structure feature a variety of ripples and other types of perturbations -- evidence of its dynamic history.The galaxy's history of mergers has furnished it with a massive supply of gas, which feeds a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center.The black hole boasts a mass 150 million times the mass of the sun.Its appetite fuels relativistic jets, which eject high-energy particles at tremendous speeds, exciting the surrounding material and triggering the emission of intense radio waves.As a result, NGC 1316 is the fourth-brightest radio source in the sky.NGC 1316 has also hosted four observed type Ia supernovae, the explosive collapse of a binary star system.The bright flash produced by type Ia supernovae help astronomers measure the distance of the host galaxy as well as the distance of more remote cosmic objects.Astronomers used type Ia supernovae, called "standard candles," to measure the expansion of the universe.
Early results from NASA's Twins Study: Space encourages gene expression:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- NASA has announced some preliminary results from its Twins Study, an effort to study the effects of space travel on human health.The early findings suggest space travel boosts methylation, the process of switching genes on and off."Some of the most exciting things that we've seen from looking at gene expression in space is that we really see an explosion, like fireworks taking off, as soon as the human body gets into space," Chris Mason, lead researcher on the Twins Study, said in a news release late Tuesday."With this study, we've seen thousands and thousands of genes change how they are turned on and turned off.This happens as soon as an astronaut gets into space, and some of the activity persists temporarily upon return to Earth."The twins participating in the Twins Study are astronauts Scott and Mark Kelly.The pair are identical twins.Mark has served as the control, having remained on the ground.Scott spent most of 2015 in space as part of the so-called year-long mission.When Scott returned to Earth in March 2016, NASA scientists collected a variety of tissue and biological samples and began analysis on the ways Scott's genome had changed during his 340 days on the International Space Station."This study represents one of the most comprehensive views of human biology," said Mason, an associate professor at Weill Cornell Medicine."It really sets the bedrock for understanding molecular risks for space travel as well as ways to potentially protect and fix those genetic changes."Scientists expect to publish finalized results from the Twins Study in 2018.
Study links rapid ice sheet melting with distant volcanic eruptions:::::Oct. 24 (UPI) -- New research suggests volcanic eruptions can trigger periods of rapid ice sheet melting.Researchers surveyed evidence of melting among ice cores and meltwater deposits, and compared their findings to a timeline of ancient volcanic eruptions between 12,000 to 13,000 years ago.Their analysis revealed a connection between the two phenomena."Over a time span of 1,000 years, we found that volcanic eruptions generally correspond with enhanced ice sheet melting within a year or so," Francesco Muschitiello, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said in a news release.The volcanoes of note weren't situated next-door, but thousands of miles from the ice sheet, a reminder of the unexpected global impacts of volcanic activity.The new research -- detailed this week in the journal Nature Communications -- suggests ash ejected into the atmosphere by erupting volcanoes can be deposited thousands of miles away.When it's deposited on ice sheets, the dark particles cause the ice to absorb more thermal energy and accelerate melting.Ancient glacial varves, layers of sediment deposited by glacial meltwater, helped scientists document periods of accelerated melting at the end of the last ice age.Like a hearty tree rings reveal periods of intense growth, thicker varve layers indicate increased periods of melting.Researchers matched varve layers with ice core layers, which can reveal ancient atmospheric conditions.The data helped scientists build a computer model to better predict how much melting a single volcanic eruption could cause.As expected, simulations proved a volcano's impact on melting is dependent on a variety of factors, including the snowpack, weather patterns, ice thickness and more."Change any one of these and you would get different amounts of melt," said James Lea, a glaciologist at the University of Liverpool.In the worst case scenario, researchers predicted a volcanic eruption in the northern latitudes could removed between 20 centimeters to one meter of ice, or several inches to a few feet.Until recently, volcanic eruptions were mostly linked with broad cooling effects on the planet's climate, as thick layers of ash can partially block out the sun for months or years.Particulate matter also encourages cloud formation, further shadowing Earth's surface.But a number of studies suggests a more complicated story -- a combination of warming and cooling mechanisms.Some scientists have even suggested melting encouraged by volcanic eruptions could trigger even more eruptions, a positive feedback loop.As glaciers and ice sheets melt, pressure is relieved from the planet's crust, allowing magma to rise to the surface.
Levels of microplastics in the Baltic have remained constant for 30 years:::::Oct. 24 (UPI) -- Levels of microplastics in the Baltic Sea haven't risen for three decades, according to sampling and analysis by efforts by researchers in Germany and Denmark.Scientists from the Technical University of Denmark, the University of Copenhagen and the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, in Germany, have been measuring the amount of micro plastics in fish and water samples from the Baltic since 1987.This week, researchers published a summary of their findings over the last 30 years in the journal Science of The Total Environment."The result is surprising.There is the same amount of plastic in both the water and the fish when you go back 30 years," Torkel Gissel Nielsen, a professor at the Technical University of Denmark, said in a news release.The result is surprising because the production of plastics has increased, along with the planet's population, and because plastics take more than a century to break down.Elsewhere, studies have found increasing concentrations of microplastics."So where has the plastic gone?Does it sink to the bottom?Are there organisms that can break it down?Or is it carried away by currents?"Nielsen asked.Researchers hope the results of their study don't give the false impression that the problem of microplastics pollution is going away.In addition to analyzing Baltic water samples, scientist have surveyed the insides of hundreds of herring and sprat specimens.The stomachs of one in five fish have revealed plastic particles and fragments -- most frequently synthetic fibers from clothing."It is important to focus on the fact that microplastics do not belong in the sea, and we still need to reduce their spreading so they do not end up in the aquatic environment and the food chain," Sabrina Beer, who was a masters student at the University of Copenhagen at the time of the research.While the amounts of microplastics found in the Baltic isn't overwhelming -- the team found 0.3 microplastic fibers in every cubic meter of water -- scientists are still working to understand the ecological risks posed by plastic pollution.One of their gravest risks likely lies in their ability to attract other contaminants.Toxic chemicals can attach to microplastics, making them more likely be absorbed by and accumulate in the tissue of marine organisms."There remains a need for a greater focus on microplastics in our seas," Breer said."Our study paves the way for studying other aspects of the significance of microplastics, and levels of microplastics from the air to the seabed."
Study: Millions of miles of planned roads shouldn't be built:::::Oct. 24 (UPI) -- New research suggests millions of miles of planned roads shouldn't be built, as many projects will sacrifice valuable environmental and ecological resources for limited benefits.The majority of planned new roads are slated to be paved through high-rainfall tropical and subtropical areas, mainly in developing countries.The areas are often rich in biodiversity and home to vulnerable species."In these high-rainfall regions, even expensive roads can be rapidly rendered useless by numerous pot-holes, road slumping, and landslides," Mohammed Alamgir, a researcher at James Cook University in Australia, said in a news release."Unless there's expensive ongoing maintenance, big road projects can easily become giant money-losers for developing nations."Corruption is one of the reasons ill-advised road plans are approved.Government officials regularly give the go-ahead after they're bribed by those who will directly profit from the road's construction."Often contractors build substandard roads -- for example, using too little cement or road base -- and then pocket the stolen proceeds, leaving the roads even more vulnerable to rapid collapse," said James Cook University professor William Laurance.In a paper published this week in the journal Current Biology, Alamgir, Laurance and their colleagues detailed the economic, social and environmental costs and benefits of road building projects across the globe.Their findings suggest, in most cases, the costs significantly outweighs the benefits.Previous research has a shown new roads lead to increases in illegal logging and poaching in developing countries rich in valuable natural resources.Land for road construction is regularly commandeered from indigenous groups and other marginalized communities, with infrastructure projects often serving as flash points for social conflict."We knew roads were very dangerous for the environment," said researcher Mason Campbell."But to us the big surprise was just how risky they were from economic and social perspectives."More than 32,000 miles of new roads are currently planned for Africa, and Asia's developing countries are expected to double the number of paved roads in the region over the next three years.Almost all of these projects need to be more carefully considered, and many should not be built, researchers argue."It's a very dangerous time," said Laurance."Our exhaustive study suggests that the economic, social and environmental risks of poorly planned roads are much greater than is generally understood."
Acoustic gravity waves help scientists pinpoint spot, time objects hit the ocean surface:::::Oct. 24 (UPI) -- Scientists at the University of Cardiff in Wales have developed a method for tracing acoustic gravity waves to their point of origin.Researchers can use the method to identify the precise time and location that an object splashed into the ocean.The technique could be used to locate the entry point of meteorites, spacecraft, satellites, aircraft and more.The method -- detailed in a new paper published this week in the journal Scientific Reports -- relies on hydrophones, microphones that can pick up underwater sound waves emitted when an object hits the surface of the ocean.The underwater sound waves are called acoustic gravity waves, or AGWs.The waves are triggered by sudden shifts in water pressure and can travel for several miles beneath the surface of the ocean.Scientists at Cardiff have previously considered redirecting AGWs to break up onrushing tsunami waves.Researchers have also tracked similar waves in the atmosphere to predict the path of large storms.In the lab, researchers used hydrophones to measure AGWs produced when various spheres were dropped into a water tank.Scientists analyzed the different wave patterns to develop a predictive formula.They tested the accuracy of their method using recordings from hydrophones operated by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization.The hydrophones are designed to listen for possible underwater nuclear weapons tests, but they can also record AGWs.Researchers used their method to accurately predict the time and location of an earthquake in the Indian Ocean."By using existing detectors dotted all around our oceans and listening out for signatures from these deep ocean sound waves, we've uncovered a completely novel way of locating objects impacting on the sea surface," Usama Kadri, from Cardiff's School of Mathematics, said in a news release."Tracking these acoustic gravity waves opens up a huge range of possibilities, from locating falling meteorites to detecting landslides, snowslides, storm surges, tsunamis and rogue waves."Researchers used their method to analyze hydrophone data recorded on the day the Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 disappeared over the South Indian Ocean.Their analysis revealed a pair of faint signals near the projected path of the airplane."Though we've located two points around the time of MH370's disappearance from an unknown source, we cannot say with any real certainty that these have any association with the aircraft," said Davide Crivelli, from Cardiff's School of Engineering."What we do know is that the hydrophones picked up remarkably weak signals at these locations and that the signals, according to our calculations, accounted for some sort of impact in the Indian Ocean."
Scientists surprised to find jellyfish under Arctic sea ice:::::Oct. 24 (UPI) -- When researchers drilled into the Arctic sea and plunged a camera into the Chukchi Sea, they were surprised to find adult Chrysaora melanaster jellyfish floating by.Until now, scientists assumed jellyfish only survived the winter in the form of polyps, small masses that bind to rocks and release tiny baby jellyfish each spring.Scientists detailed their collection of underwater videos in a new paper on the Arctic jellyfish, published this week in the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series."One reason we were interested was, first of all, we saw them, and it was kind of weird," Andy Juhl, a marine biologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said in a news release.Studying marine relief in the Chukchi Sea during the harsh Arctic winters isn't easy.For the past several years, Juhl and his colleagues have snowmobiled several miles across the sea ice and drilled a hole through which they deploy a small underwater vehicle equipped with a camera."The whole study is based on videos we made over several years," Juhl said.The footage features the animals' foot-long-plus tentacles, but Juhl isn't sure whether the tentacles sting."I don't know," he said."There aren't that many people around there swimming to find out."The videos' content may explain why commercial pollock fishermen in the nearby Bering Sea often find their nets fouled by a barrage of jellyfish.Pollock is used to make fish sticks, fish patties, imitation crab meat and other fish products.Every few years, the jellyfish population seems to peak, clogging fishing rigs.The problem tends to crescendo and dissipate, and scientists suggest their research may help explain the factors driving these population cycles.As to why the jellyfish are congregating beneath Arctic sea ice, scientists hypothesize that the icy ceiling shelters the creatures from strong winter storms and that the colder water temperatures slow their metabolism, helping them subsist off smaller amounts of food."Life under sea ice is like living in a refrigerator -- everything slows down," Juhl said.Elsewhere, warming water temperatures are allowing select species of resilient jellyfish to dominate ecosystems, but shrinking sea ice in the Arctic could see Chrysaora melanaster dwindle.
Shrews shrink their heads in preparation for winter, study finds:::::Oct. 24 (UPI) -- While the rest of us are packing on winter weight in preparation for the cold months ahead, the common shrew is shrinking -- it's head."We found that each shrew undergoes a dramatic decrease in braincase size from summer to winter," Javier Lazaro, scientist with the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany, said in a news release."Then, in spring, the braincase regrows, almost reaching the original size in the second summer."Scientists have previously observed the Dehnel phenomenon, named for the first person to describe it, but the latest study is the first to follow individual shrews through the seasons.Scientists captured shrews and recorded X-rays of their entire body.They also microchipped each shrew for future identification.The researchers recaptured each specimen twice more to document the change in head size.The X-rays revealed the expected pattern: a maximum head size in summer, a significant shrinkage in winter and an expansion in spring.The results of their observations -- shared in the journal Current Biology -- showed the shrew's head, skull and brain mass shrunk between 20 and 30 percent during the winter.The research also showed the entirety of the shrew's body shrinks, organs and all -- but not as significantly as the brain.Shrews don't hibernate or migrate, so researchers hypothesize the seasonal shrinkage may be a technique for surviving the winter."Reducing head size -- and thus brain size -- might save energy disproportionally as the brain is energetically so expensive," Lazaro said.Researchers aren't entirely sure how the shrinkage process works, but they believe the skull shrinks as the collagen composing brain joints, or cranial sutures, is resorbed.
Michigan State scientists develop transparent solar cell technology:::::Oct. 23 (UPI) -- Researchers at Michigan State have developed transparent solar cell technology that could be used to make power-generating windows.In a new paper published in the journal Nature Energy, the team of engineers argue their technology can replace or supplement rooftop solar units.The technology consists of a thin film of organic molecules that absorb invisible wavelengths of sunlight.These ultraviolet and the near-infrared wavelengths can then be converted into electricity.The device, called a transparent luminescent solar concentrator, can be installed on the windows of buildings, a car's windshield or even on the screen of a phone."Highly transparent solar cells represent the wave of the future for new solar applications," Richard Lunt, an associate professor of chemical engineering and materials science at MSU, said in a news release."We analyzed their potential and show that by harvesting only invisible light, these devices can provide a similar electricity-generation potential as rooftop solar while providing additional functionality to enhance the efficiency of buildings, automobiles and mobile electronics."Scientists have previously described and demonstrated their technology.Their new paper, published Monday, is a call-to-arms of sorts, describing the potential to integrate transparent luminescent solar concentrators into modern infrastructure.Scientists estimate there are 5 billion to 7 billion square meters of glass surface in the United States.If renewable energy production is to meet the demands of American consumers, the researchers say creative solutions, like the installation of transparent solar cells, are essential.If all the glass in the United States was outfitted with transparent solar cells, the harvested energy would be enough to meet 40 percent of Americans' electricity demands.Coupled with traditional rooftop installations and solar energy, the combination could produce nearly as much electricity as traditional energy sources."The complimentary deployment of both technologies could get us close to 100 percent of our demand if we also improve energy storage," Lunt said.The best opaque solar panels reach efficiency rates of between 15 and 18 percent.Transparent solar cells achieve efficiencies at just above 5 percent.But scientists believe the technology can eventually register efficiencies closer to traditional panels."That is what we are working towards," Lunt said."Traditional solar applications have been actively researched for over five decades, yet we have only been working on these highly transparent solar cells for about five years.Ultimately, this technology offers a promising route to inexpensive, widespread solar adoption on small and large surfaces that were previously inaccessible."
Google Earth helps researchers identify 400 ancient stone gates in Saudi Arabia:::::Oct. 23 (UPI) -- With the help of Google Earth, a single researcher from the University of Western Australia has identified 400 previously undocumented stone "gates" in Saudi Arabia."I refer to them as gates because when you view them from above they look like a simple field gate lying flat, two upright posts on the sides, connected by one or more long bars," David Kennedy, a professor of classics and ancient history, said in a news release."They don't look like structures where people would have lived nor do they look like animal traps or for disposing of dead bodies.It's a mystery as to what their purpose would have been."The barren deserts and rugged mountains of Saudi Arabia are mostly thought of as harsh landscapes devoid of archaeological value, but Kennedy's discoveries are a reminder that ancient humans can leave their mark in the unlikeliest of places.Kennedy detailed the 400 newly identified gates in a scientific paper published next month in the journal Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy."You can't see them in any intelligible way at the ground level but once you get up a few hundred feet, or with a satellite even higher, they stand out beautifully," he said.Kennedy has previously spent time surveying ancient stone structures in Jordan from the perspective of a helicopter.During flyovers above Jordan's lava fields, Kennedy has documented a variety of manmade structures.The stone structures are named for their shape and purpose."Kites" are structures that were used to trap animals, while "pendants" describe funerary monuments.Other shapes, like "wheels," don't have a known function.The architects of the ancient gates and similar structures are believed to be the ancestors of modern day Beduins, but little is known about the ancient residents of these harsh landscapes.The stone structures were erected between 2,000 and 9,000 years ago.
Prozac is polluting waterways, potentially impacting marine life:::::Oct. 23 (UPI) -- Exposure to pharmaceuticals is a growing problem for coastal wildlife.New research suggests the behavior of Oregon shore crabs is influenced by the antidepressant Prozac.In the lab, scientists from Portland State University exposed Oregon shore crab specimens to trace amounts of fluoxetine, the active ingredient in Prozac.Crabs exposed to the drug were more likely to forage, ignoring the threat of predators.Crabs exposed to fluoxetine also foraged during the day, when the crustaceans would typically be hiding.The findings -- published last week in the journal Ecology and Evolution -- suggest the drug lowers the crabs' inhibitions, causing them to taker greater risks.The drugged crabs also engaged in more aggressive behavior, getting in fights with both friend and foe.Crabs exposed to the antidepressant were more likely to get killed or injured in duels with their peers.Lead researcher Elise Granek told UPI the crabs were not exposed to unrealistically high doses in order to elicit a dramatic reaction."Many labs study the effects of very high concentrations of pharmaceuticals on organisms -- much higher than we would find in our waterways," Granek said in an email."In our lab, all of the concentrations we use in our experiments are levels that have been measured in bays and/or estuaries on the U.S. West Coast."Granek has previously conducted research showing small doses of antibiotics slowed the growth of mussels -- "likely because their gut biota are disrupted when exposed to antibiotics," she said.Some scientists hypothesize that because pharmaceuticals boast relatively short half-lives and can attach themselves to sediment particles, filter feeders and scavengers who eat detritus -- those who process lots of water and sediment -- may be more likely to accumulate pharmaceutical compounds.But researchers have also found significant concentrations of drugs in juvenile salmon living the Puget Sound, suggesting a wide variety of organisms are at risk."Since we don't know the extent to which prey species can pass these contaminants on to their predators, it is a bit hard to say whether crustaceans are truly more vulnerable," Granek said.Granek says drug companies and pharmacies need to do more to ensure medications are properly disposed of so they don't end up in local waterways."A possible approach policy makers could take is to mandate that all pharmacies that dispense pharmaceuticals have to also have drop boxes to take back unused pharmaceuticals," Granek said."Some pharmacies are doing so voluntarily, but it is not required, so these pharmacies are few and far between."
Magnificent Microscopy: Capturing the Hidden Beauty of the "Microenvironment":::::Hidden within the world we see are many others we cannot.Every year scientists, photographers and hobbyists capture enchanting stories that secretly unfold among seemingly mundane objects in the microenvironment for the annual Nikon Small World photomicrography competition.Out of this years 2,000-plus photo entries from 88 countries, Nikon recently announced the top 20 winners, along with 10 honorable mentions and 58 images of distinction.Participants could submit photographs of anything from green algae to credit cards, as long as they were taken with some form of light microscope such as phase contrast, confocal or fluorescence.The judges based their picks on originality, aesthetics, technical skill and informational content.The first place winnerwhich netted a $3,000 prizeis a photo of a fluorescently glowing human skin cell.Other winners give us an idea of what it might be like to shrink and perch atop a flower or capture what looks like an aerial view of roads: a neural network paved to support our racing thoughts.The following slide show features a selection of images that either won prizes or was given honorable mention in the contest.
Confronting Sexual Harassment in Science:::::If anyone thought scientists were somehow different from ordinary peoplenobler, more ethical, more purethen events over the past two years have been a sharp wake-up call.As with just about any area of human endeavor where men hold the lions share of power, the world of science and technology is plagued by sexual harassment.Women in STEM fields have long known this, of course.But just as in Hollywood, where the predatory behavior of producer Harvey Weinstein was long whispered about but never discussed openly, the phenomenon of professors and researchers hitting on undergrads, grad students, postdocs and colleagues has mostly been hushed upnot only by victims fearing retaliation but also by institutions determined to keep their good name untarnished and their superstars happy.But thanks to a handful of (mostly) female scientists who have been brave enough to speak out and name names, the conspiracy of silence has become impossible to ignore in this publicity-driven age.A sea change has swept through sciences highest ranks, forcing institutions across the country to take more visible and aggressive actions to crack down on unacceptable conduct, push for improvements in the classroom and the workplace, and encourage victims of harassment to come forward.Ive asked myself, Why did it take until now for all of this to come out?I find it totally appalling that it has taken this long for all of these women to feel comfortable coming forward, says geophysicist Marcia McNutt, the first woman president of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.In one of the strongest statements to date on the seriousness of such behavior, the 60,000-member American Geophysical Union adopted an updated 33-page Scientific Integrity and Professional Ethics policy in September that for the first time defines harassment as scientific misconduct.This puts it on equal footing with fabrication, falsification and plagiarism in a research environment, AGU President Eric Davidson, President-elect Robin Bell and past-President Margaret Leinen said in announcing the new policy.We have broken new ground that takes this issue to a new level of importance.It is already having a ripple effect in terms of broadening the discussion in the scientific community, Davidson added in an interview The AGU is also part of a new collaborative research project, funded by a $1.1-million, four-year grant from the National Science Foundation Foundation, that will update the teaching of research ethics by addressing sexual harassment as scientific misconduct.Led by University of WisconsinMadison researcher Erika Marn-Spiotta, the project will produce more effective training materials in Earth, space and environmental sciences that may serve as a model for other STEM fields.This includes development of tested bystander intervention workshops to help academic leaders respond to and prevent sexual harassment.There is limited data on the effectiveness of existing training programs and a sense that many were designed primarily to meet legal liability concerns.These efforts are among a host of recent efforts to combat sexual harassment in science, including major revisions of sexual harassment and ethics policies at universities and other scientific institutions; more research documenting the extent of the problem; and, hardest of all, the ongoing challenge to create a more welcoming culture for women in male-dominated research disciplines.One of the most prominent efforts is a two-year study under way for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, which provides guidance to public and private institutions on issues of critical importance to science.A 21-member committee is examining the impact of sexual harassment in academia on the career advancement of women in the scientific, technical and medical workforce.It has commissioned research to conduct detailed interviews with women science faculty who have experienced sexual harassment and has also held a series of workshops around the country.The committee expects to issue a comprehensive report by mid-2018 The cause clbre for sexual harassment in science was the revelation two years ago of shocking charges against world-renowned University of California, Berkeley, astronomer Geoffrey Marcy, whose pioneering exploration of exoplanets was considered Nobel Prizeworthy.An October 9, 2015, investigative story in the online media outlet BuzzFeed News reported that a leaked report of a six-month university investigation revealed four female students alleged Marcy had repeatedly engaged in inappropriate physical behavior between 2001 and 2010, including unwanted massages, kisses and groping.The controversy forced Marcy to step down from his university post (Marcy wrote an open letter apologizing for his actions).It also led to disclosure of other sexual harassment cases at Berkeley, changes in leadership and pressure for more aggressive action at not only Berkeley but throughout the U.C.system.Weve made a lot of progress over the past two years, U.C.Berkeley Chancellor Carol T. Christ, the first female to hold the post, said in an interview.Were setting a tone at the top that there is zero tolerance for sexual harassment in the workplace, classroom, or in the laboratory.Christ, a former president of the all-women Smith College, named a special faculty adviser, reporting directly to her, to lead campus efforts against sexual violence, sexual harassment and gender-based discrimination.Earlier a 15-member university task force drew up recommendations that include a streamlined investigation process, more transparent monitoring and accountability, improved training and better care for survivors.The Marcy revelations had a domino effect across the country, triggering widespread publicity about other alleged cases of sexual harassment by well-known male scientists in numerous fields including a California Institute of Technology astrophysicist, a University of Chicago molecular biologist, a University of Washington microbiologist and an American Museum of Natural History paleoanthropologist..More recently, Boston University has been investigating formal complaints by two former graduate students that geologist David R. Marchant allegedly abused and belittled them, physically and verbally, on research expeditions at a remote Antarctic field research site starting two decades ago, according to Science Magazine, which broke the story in early October.Major media outlets such as The Boston Globe, Washington Post, and the Atlantic have since covered the story.One of the complainants, Geologist Jane K. Willenbring, now a Scripps Institution of Oceanography associate professor, reportedly waited to file her October, 2016 complaint until after she got tenure, fearing professional repercussions.But she has now gone public, including tweets (@jkwillenbring) on media coverage of sexual harassment scandals in science and the entertainment industry.When asked to comment for this story, Marchant replied by email: "As you know, Boston Universitys investigation into these allegations is ongoing.I have cooperated fully in that investigation.I do not wish to compromise the integrity of that investigation by making any comments before the investigation has been completed."A prominent case at the University of Rochester in New York state, meanwhile, involves sexual harassment complaints filed in late August with the U.S.Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) by eight current and former members of the universitys Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences.They accused T. Florian Jaeger, a professor in the department, of a long pattern of sexually predatory behavior and also contended the university has retaliated against Jaegers accusers.Two earlier university investigations concluded the allegations against him did not violate the law or university policy.Mother Jones broke the story in September and local and national media outlets like The New York Times followed up.Widespread publicity, reaction among alums and campus protests, including a students hunger strike, spurred the Universitys board of trustees to take action.It appointed a committee to oversee an independent, comprehensive investigation into the EEOC complaints and the universitys sexual harassment procedures.Jaeger is on administrative leave pending the outcome.According to the Times, Jaeger told the Rochester faculty that his accepting the leave was in no way an admission of guilt with respect to the allegations publicized about me.These big stories in science have served to increase public awareness of this problem.Its not as if the problem didnt exist before, says BuzzFeeds prize-winning science reporter Azeen Ghorayshi, who broke the initial Marcy story and has tenaciously pursued numerous sexual harassment cases since then.After the Marcy revelations, it snowballed and more people came forward, in part because they felt let down by their institutions, Ghorayshi says.THE PREVALENCE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT Vindicating the experiences of many women scientists, studies across a variety of settingsfrom campuses to companiesconfirm the prevalence of sexual harassment of all forms is high.Research presented at a two-day workshop of the National Academies Committee on Women in Science, Engineering and Medicine found that somewhere in the range of 40 to 70 percent of women had experienced sexual harassment during their careers or as students.This range of prevalence was strikingly consistent across different studies.Self-reporting in anonymous surveys makes it difficult to quantify sexual harassment with any certitude; only a small percentage of victims report sexual harassment, largely because of embarrassment, fear of not being believed and concern about retaliation by superiors.Sexual harassment is generally defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that tends to create a hostile or offensive work environment.It is worse when it is the boss, a faculty supervisor or teacher because a quid pro quo arrangement may be offered or implied.In the U.S. workplace discrimination, including sexual harassment, is prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which affects any federally funded education program or activity.(The Trump administration announced it is pulling back from Obama-era sexual harassment guidelines.)While not all individual complaints violate the law, many may violate workplace or academic codes of conduct.Most victims are female and perpetrators male, but sexual harassment also affects LGBTQ individuals and men victimized by women or other men.Cultural norms and individual perceptions also affect whether a given behavior is interpreted as unwelcome or hostile.DANGER ZONES IN SCIENCE To my mind, there are still bad neighborhoods ripe for sexual harassment.Dramatically tilted sex ratios in some fields signal a potential problem, says senior research social scientist Christopher Krebs of RTI International.Potential sexual harassment danger zones include field research; remote science sites such as observatories; isolated or smaller laboratories; professional travel and meetings; medical training; and predominantly male fields, according to research and interviews with scientists, graduate students and science educators.Double jeopardy.A recently published, internet-based survey of 474 astronomers and planetary scientists found women of color in this sample faced the greatest risk of feeling unsafe in their workplace due to gender (40 percent) and race (28 percent).Nearly 20 percent of women of color and 12 percent of white women scientists said they skipped professional events because they felt unsafe.Anthropologist Kathryn Clancy of the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign and colleagues concluded: Never has awareness of hostile workplace behaviors in the sciences been so strong, and the possibility for change so great.Field research.Another internet-based Survey of Academic Field Experiences (SAFE) conducted by Clancy reported widespread sexual harassment of students or trainees working in anthropology, archaeology and life science field research sites.Nearly two thirds of 666 field science respondents, mostly American women, said they had experienced sexual harassment, inappropriate or sexual remarks, or jokes about physical beauty and cognitive sex differences.More than 20 percent reported they had been sexually assaulted.Trainees were particularly vulnerable to harassment by senior managers or scientists.Medical training and practice.Nearly one in three women in medicine say they have experienced sexual harassment, compared with 4 percent of men, according to a 2016 study in JAMA The Journal of the American Medical Association.A 2015 compilation of surveys in Australia, the U.K., Sweden, Canada and the U.S., published in the The Medical Journal of Australia, found that sexual harassment in training or practice ranged from one quarter to three quarters of respondents.Fields with lower numbers of women.A University of Washington study in the journal Psychological Bulletin concluded that large gender gaps in disciplines such as computer science, engineering and physics may be related in part to more masculine cultures that signal a lower sense of belonging to women than men.Scientific travel and conferences.The informal atmosphere at professional meetings, particularly larger conferences with an ample supply of alcohol-fueled social gatherings, is another danger zoneparticularly for students and younger researchers looking for jobs.Scientific meetings have increasingly featured sexual harassment sessions for students, early-career scientists and senior professional leaders.A recent AGU meeting featured prominent anti-harassment signs, Safe AGU buttons, and a #SafeAGU social media campaign.If its unwanted, its harassment warn red-and-white signs posted at meetings of the American Astronomical Society (AAS), which recently strengthened its code of ethics and anti-harassment policies.Novel efforts such as Astronomy Allies have also provided a volunteer network of scientists to mentor or advocate for individuals who encounter sexual harassment.Whatever the setting or field of science, the modus operandi of sexual predators is often the same.One former Harvard University science graduate student recalled being hit on at a social event by a distinguished male scientist.After some initial research talk, the elder scientist began to say some inappropriate stuff, such as youre really smart and beautiful.I want to know more about you and, at one point, he hugged me.It was very uncomfortable, she recalled.SOME QUESTIONS GOING FORWARD The challenge ahead is how to move beyond rhetoric and individual cases to implement more effective strategies to combat sexual harassment and hasten womens advancement and equality in science.Success in doing so will be measured by how well the scientific community writ large responds to tough questions those on the front lines of anti-harassment efforts are asking.They include: Will publicity and punishment in egregious cases have a deterrent effect?Will stepped up efforts by professional science societies help shift the culture toward zero tolerance for sexual harassment?Will mandatory sexual harassment reporting to federal science funding agencies be instituted?Will federal funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation take more aggressive action by terminating funding to institutions that do not comply with Title IX nondiscrimination regulations?Will there be more transparency about sexual harassment cases, to the degree possible under privacy laws, to discourage job-hopping by sexual harassers who do not disclose their history to future employers?Will development and implementation of better training programs help prevention and reporting of sexual harassment?Will colleges and universities greatly improve their formal and informal systems for reporting and acting on sexual harassment complaints?Will more female scientists in leadership roles change the dynamics and add more clout in terms of preventing and handling sexual harassment in the workplace?Will more family-friendly policies help women in science move up the career ladder in academia, research or business?Will changes at the bottom create a female-friendly climate for science students in male-dominated fields that will help keep more women in science?Frustrated at the pace of change, three generations of women scientists are pushing hard to speed up efforts to reduce sexual harassment and gender discrimination in science.You get discouraged.You know the hill you are climbing is going to be steeper, says one 20-something Yale University physics graduate student.Says another, Its a cycle.We need more women, but we need to create a better environment to do that.Im inherently an optimist.On the one hand, theres been tremendous progress.But we clearly have not done enough, says Yale astrophysicist and former AAS president Meg Urry, a longtime champion of women in science.People feel the momentum right now.With more public attention to this issue, there are a huge number of radicalized people ready to move, ready to be loud, to change policies on sexual harassment, University of Illinioiss Clancy says.Accelerating efforts to combat sexual harassment takes on more urgency, given the national need to recruit and retain a diverse STEM workforce in the 21st century.To do so, the message to end gender discrimination and sexual harassment may indeed need to go viral to keep media attentionand public pressureon both individuals and institutions to create a more welcoming climate for women and minorities in the global science community of tomorrow.
When GMOs Are the Movie Star:::::Three quarters of the way into Food Evolution, a recent documentary about genetically engineered food, agricultural economist Charles Benbrook glances furtively around a crowded lobby.Hes just participated in a public debate over GMO technology, and moviegoers know his angle: Benbrook is the author of several influential scientific papers that have been rallying points for pro-organic and anti-GMO folks, including one suggesting pesticide use skyrocketed after the introduction of GMOs, and another claiming organic milk is more nutritious than conventional milk.In the scene, Benbrook leans close to Chris Arnold, the public relations director for Chipotlea company that has publicly shunned GMOs.It looks like Benbrook is about to kiss him on the cheek.Ive been hired as an expert witness by the Vermont defense statute, Benbrook says.(Vermont had recently passed a law that would require companies to label GMO foods; lawsuits from pro-GMO industry groups followed.)Benbrooks disclosure meant he was helping defend these labeling laws.He adds: Im whispering in your ear because Im micd.We might be funding your testimony, Arnold replies.We made a contribution to that defense fund.The two men laugh.While watching this scene from a packed Manhattan auditorium at the films theatrical debut in June, the audience shifted and muttered in discomfortmaybe even in disgust.In an earlier scene, Benbrook, who had presented himself as an independent scientist employed by the University of Washington, had looked straight into the camera and said: I am deeply troubled by the sort of erosion of the integrity of science and the whole debate about genetically engineered food.Food Evolution also uses protest scenes from Hawaii to tell its story.But here, the message is that GMO food is safe to eat and that naysayers are overreacting.Credit: Black Valley Films Yet here he was, behaving flippantly about the same lack of transparency and conflicts of interest that are typically associated with big biotech players like Monsanto.As Benbrook whispered in the ear of an industry representative, the audience saw another angle of the story: The organic industry is jockeying for its own capitalist interests, too, and sometimes using dubious strategies.This narrative established, the filmmakers lay out more evidence, including excerpts from Benbrooks e-mails, released as part of a Freedom of Information Act request, showing requests to industry to fund his research.The film reveals that because companies like Whole Foods and Organic Valley funded Benbrooks work for three yearsand because he received no public grants during that timeU.W.ended Benbrooks contract.Its a punchy scene, and one that was emblematic of Food Evolutions message, which is that GMOs are safe to eat and much of the ado surrounding them is overblown or deceitful.The audience seemed convinced: After the credits rolled, the filmmakers repeated an informal poll they had taken before the movie played, asking how many people were afraid of GMOs with respect to human health.Before the film, around 25 people raised their hands.After, there was just one.As a journalist who covers biotechnology, this raised a question: Just what is the purpose of documentary films that center around controversial science?Are they for entertainment or education?And if entertainment is prioritized over education, can a 90-minute film dutifully explore a topic as dense and politically fraught as genetically engineered food?Its an increasingly important question as genetic science advances and the ethics surrounding it get ever more complex.With CRISPRd humans and gene drives that may shape entire ecosystems on the horizon, the need for accurate and contextualized storytelling will only grow.These technologies will provide compelling fodder for filmmakers.But how will they cover human embryos that scientists have altered by CRISPR or the next generation of GMOs?What will a documentary about the first publicly released gene drive organism look likeand whose voices will that documentary include?Theres a lot to lose if the entertainment industry mangles this research or omits key perspectives in the name of a good story.On one hand, an unfairly critical view can spark public backlash, which can strangle innovation and halt projects and products ranging from new ways to curb disease to crops that can better withstand climate change.On the other, an overly rosy view cuts out legitimate concerns and critiques of that same technology.Food Evolution is just one of the latest documentaries to delve into one facet of the GMO debate while presenting itself as a more comprehensive take on the issue.Another recent release is Island Earth, which follows several Hawaiiansincluding a young scientist studying biotechnology and chemistryas they struggle to understand the impact of the technology on their islands.The takeaway is that although GMOs may be safe in a narrow sense, there are broader implications for how the technology is wielded as a form of modern-day colonialism.Its a perspective that is too often omitted in conversations about modern technology.At an Island Earth screening in Brooklyn, just a few days after Food Evolutions theatrical release, an eager audience seemed just as convinced by this narrative.Dennis Gonsalves developed a genetically modified variety of papaya to combat ringspot virus, which devastated papaya yields in the 1980s.Credit: Cyrus Sutton Island Earth Both films were fun to watch.They both also get a lot of the facts right.But did either of the audiences leave the theaters with a more comprehensive take on GMOs?Whether documentaries are primarily for education or entertainment is one of the central dilemmas in the industry, says Theo Lipfert, the director of the School of Film and Photography at Montana State University.Documentaries have become really popular in the last few years and there is an absolute entertainment value to many that are being created right now.Whereas documentarians draw from the real world, filmmakers are not necessarily journalists, he says.Were not doing science communication.Were not training [our students] to be science journalists, to always find the other side and to be fair and balanced.Were really teaching them about artistic expression and about communicating visually, he adds.Recognizing an opportunity to get more science in front of film audiences, the National Academy of Sciences started a program in 2008 called the Science and Entertainment Exchange, which provides free scientific advice to filmmakers.Most of the nearly 2,000 consultations the exchange has done so farincluding working on Arrival, Ghostbusters, Star Trek, Frozen and various Marvel featureshave focused on fiction.But according to Ann Merchant, the deputy executive director for communications at the National Academies, thats changing.We have seen a rebirth of the documentary filmmaking medium, she says.Theres a new audience for them.The academy is actively reaching out to filmmakers, and in September 2016, the exchange brought 15 documentarians and 15 scientists for a weekend of presentations in Woods Hole, Mass., to learn about a range of scientific research, from plant breeding to cosmology to bioethics.They have more workshops in the works.Its an ongoing partnership that they hope will spark ideas for newand, perhaps, more nuancedprojects.In order to express their art, filmmakers, like all storytellers, are often drawn to fraught topics.A real-life drama such as the fights over climate change, GMOs and vaccines makes for compelling tales with high stakes.These stories also come with a built-in audience, Lipfert says.When hot-button issues collide with strong points of view, though, it can be difficult to present an accurate and compelling story at the same time.When that documentary is about food, it gets even trickier, because how we eat is deeply personal and cultural.I have yet to meet a single person who doesnt have a bias towards food and [agriculture]including myself, says Jessica Eise, a communications expert at Purdue University and co-author of The Communication Scarcity in Agriculture.Most people arent aware that they have a bias, so they dont do the mental work to try and stretch around that bias.This attitude can make it harder for subtleties to enter mainstream writing and film, she adds.Audiences, Lipfert says, might assume a documentary is a piece of journalism, where the creator has made an explicit attempt to be objective and fair.They may believe a documentary has a one-to-one relationship to the truth, and that watching it is enough to learn everything about a topic, rather than treating it as a starting point that requires more context.In interviews with the filmmakers of Food Evolution and Island Earth, both say they actively checked their own biases during the production and editing.Inevitably, some of those leanings still made it to the final cut.This problem is perfectly illustrated by public protests on Kauai that occurred as lawmakers were debating whether to ban GMOs on the island.Both films use similar footage from these events to evoke strikingly different feelings.Food Evolution films from outside the action, putting the viewer as an observer, and uses music in a minor key, which gives a sense of foreboding.Interview clips with protesters feature nonsensical statements that make them look cartoonish and uninformed.(The audience in New York City laughed and snorted at these scenes).Meanwhile the protest scene in Island Earth is a slow-motion montage scored with dramatic drums, giving the protesters an aura of underdogs rising up against an oppressor.At times, the camera films from within the protest, giving the viewer the feeling that they part of itand rooting for it.Other frames direct the viewers perspective, too.The Food Evolution filmmakers say they interviewed 200 experts but the focus is almost entirely on whether or not GMO foods are safe to eatand how the misinformation about food safety is stifling potentially lifesaving technology in other parts of the world.Because they were laser-focused on this narrow frame they left out valid arguments against the technology such as its role in exacerbating herbicide resistance in weeds as well as the politicized fights over whether glyphosate, the main herbicide connected to GMOs, causes cancer.And during the documentarys takedown of Charles Benbrook, the filmmakers chose to flash a New York Times article on the screen, which laid out the scientists ties to the organic industry.Although it is true Benbrook has had financial ties to the organic industry, painting him as a pure villain isnt quite right.In reality, he uses real data in his work, unlike many other GMO critics, and his perspective on GMOs and herbicide use can be quite nuanced.The film also failed to mention the biotech industry has also faced criticism for financial ties with university scientists, which is covered in that same Times article.By isolating Benbrook, viewers might think the organic industrys actions are uniquely egregious when in fact questionable behavior has occurred on both sides.Island Earth, meanwhile, lacks follow-through.In one scene a tractor fitted with a row-crop sprayer applies pesticides on an open test field that belongs to Pioneer, which sells GMO seed.A local resident named Malia Chun gestures toward the field and says, almost every resident on a street nearby has cancer, suggesting a link.Chun also says she had her daughters hair tested for pesticides, which turned up evidence of 36 different chemicals, eight of which were restricted use.It makes for a powerful narrative.But the filmmaker, Cyrus Sutton, doesnt give the viewer any context as to how likely it is that these pesticides are linked to cancer or other health problems.There are no interviews with toxicologists, epidemiologists or risk experts.Its not clear whether the pesticides in Chuns daughters hair were present in harmful amounts.These are all starting points for worthy investigation but the way they are treated raises more questions than it answers.When asked about the claims his subjects make, Sutton says he tried to portray peoples sentiments as accurately as I could.On the science side of things, I tried to understand and convey the nuances on the issue with the limited time and resources that I had.The problem is, the very nature of documentary films demands a narrow storytelling lens, and both films left out key context that would have made for a fullerand more accuratedepiction of GMOs.If only Island Earth could have applied some of the scientific rigor from Food Evolution, and Food Evolution could have considered the broader implications of the GMO industry.Or, as Nathanael Johnson, a reporter at Grist who appears in both films, put it to me: Theres probably a world in which some master documentarian would find a way to fuse these two [films] into something that was really solid.It may be an impossible task, but filmmakers eyeing the next generation of genetic technologies would do well to give audiences not only entertainment but also a story that captures more facets of their subject.
Radical Proposal Would Prop Up Coal Power Industry:::::The U.S. coal power industry has been declining, thanks to the abundant availability of cheap natural gas, falling prices of solar and wind power, and the clear global imperative to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.The Trump administration has long promised to fight that so-called war on coal.Several weeks ago the U.S. Department of Energy, led by Secretary Rick Perry, offered up an aggressive salvo: The nations power grid, the DoE said, would become vulnerable if more coal-fired power plants closed down.Therefore, the government should prop up the market for power facilities that offer a theoretical boost to stabilitycoal, along with nuclear plants.Action could begin soon, which could result in higher consumer prices for electricity and unhealthy pollution emissions from power plants.And progress toward a more climate-friendly energy system would take a hit.Perry started to exploit the largely nonexistent crisis of electric grid reliability with a controversial DoE study he commissioned in April.Although it did not conclude the grid is in any danger due to decreasing coal power or increasing power from renewable energy sources, Perry seized on some fuzzy language about support[ing] reliable grid operations to push forward.His notion was that coal and nuclear power have to be strengthened so the electricity transmission system can withstand and recover from shocks due to major weather events or other catastrophes.Perry and the DoE issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (pdf), or NOPR, which, if enacted, would dramatically alter the power sector.The NOPR requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)an independent agency that regulates electricity transmissionrequire utility companies to pay not just for the electricity they buy from power plant companies and supply to consumers, but also for the fixed costs associated with power plants that keep 90 days of fuel on site.That sort of cost recovery, as it is called, would be largely unprecedented.In reality those plants are coal and nuclear installations, because wind and solar power plants do not consume fuel.Natural gas plants would not meet the 90-day requirement either, because they get their fuel via pipeline instead of storing it on site.The stratagem is that by allowing full cost recovery for those plants, the government is helping to keep them economically viable whereas normal market forces might have led to their closure.The 90-day number is apparently arbitrary.Critics say such a move would upend energy markets, and that the electric grid is strong enough without what amounts to a massive subsidy for coal and nuclear power.Yet they acknowledge the measure, or more likely some variation on it, could actually be enacted.We do not expect FERC to reject this proposal outright, says Christine Tezak, managing director of research for ClearView Energy Partners, an energy research and analysis firm.We expect the FERC to take it seriously, if not literally.Although it might not follow the word-for-word policy proposal, it might still consider the message and take some sort of action.The fundamental argument supporting the NOPR is that baseload power generationthe predictable type of generation provided by coal and nuclear plantsdoes not get the credit it deserves, in terms of its value and the profits it generates.Because of that, the argument goes, coal plants are retiring at rates that might be dangerous to grid stability.Allowing the coal plants to recover some of that expense from utilitieswhich could pass that cost on to the consumer in the form of rate increaseswould in theory restore something closer to the real value of those plants.But some experts think such an allowance would come at too great a cost, ultimately paid by consumers.Former FERC chairman John Wellinghoff says the rule would blow the markets up.Former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz has also pointed out carbon emissions should be considered as a more central part of any such equation than resiliency.Tezak largely agrees that the proposal is extreme, as written.If adopted, she says, it would disrupt the entire system of how electricity is managed around the country.That is not an overstatement of fact, she says.Wind, solar and natural gas would suddenly face an uphill economic battle to compete.There is little evidence such a radical change is needed for resiliency against bad weather events or other calamities.Perrys proposal focused on the 2014 polar vortex in the Arctic, which sent extreme cold plunging down into the U.S. and produced high electricity demand; the DoE is arguing power plants with fuel on site would serve as a bulwark against such events.Experts point out a flaw in this argument, however: Massive amounts of coal power itself were actually forced offline due to equipment problems, likely related to the extreme cold, an issue not solved by the on-site fuel requirements.PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission organization that coordinates movement of electricity around a large chunk of the country, noted in their May 2014 report that wind power offered more than its expected share to the grid during the extreme cold event.It had a positive impact on supply and contributed to PJMs ability to maintain reliability.Even though this insight makes it difficult to see the proposal as anything other than a subsidy for particular industries, Tezak says there is at least a reasonable question behind it.This resiliency thing that DoE wants compensated has never been defined before, by any metric, she says.We dont have a yardstick for resiliency.Asking electricity regulators to more carefully study this issue, then, and perhaps arrive at some measure of how much baseload generation really is required for resiliency, is not wholly unreasonable.This is undermined by the NOPR, however, which calls for a decision on a remarkably complicated, previously unaddressed question within a 60-day public comment period that ends November 24.FERCs decision is required by December 11.Tezak says she expects FERC to seriously consider the proposal, but that it is very unlikely to actually implement the measure as written.FERC is an independent federal agency; its rules on electricity and energy are not approved or reviewed by Congress or the executive branch but can be reviewed in federal courts.Still, Tezak says, I do not think it is, or ever has been, completely immune to politics.FERC could take the spirit of the NOPRthat baseload power deserves more creditand implement a rule with slightly different details.In fact, she thinks the proposal was not necessarily intended to go through in its original form.If DoE really wanted to break the markets, they could have been so much more prescriptive, she says.They threw it over the transom.They said, pay attention to this, and no putting it off.They want action.
Astronomers Spot First-Ever Space Rock from Another Star:::::For the first time ever, an asteroid or comet from another star has been caught hurtling through our solar system, astronomers announced late Thursday.Provisionally designated A/2017 U1, the object appears to be less than a half-kilometer in diameter and is traveling at just over 40 kilometers per secondfaster than humanitys speediest outbound space probes.Because this is the first object of its type to be found, there are as yet no official rules for naming it, and its discoverers have balked at suggesting anything besides Interstellar.Whatever one might call it, though, it is presently racing away from the sun and has sparked a stampede of astronomers rushing to observe it before it fades entirely from view in the darkness of interstellar space.All we can say right now is this was something that was tossed out of another star system, says Karen Meech, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii.Meech is helping coordinate a global observation campaign, which presently includes nights on large telescopes in Chile and Hawaii, as well as five orbits of the Hubble Space Telescope.Everyone is trying to get time to look at this thing on big telescopes right now, urgently, within the next few days, she explains.Exactly what those telescopes might see is anyones guess.Astronomers will first and foremost attempt to pin down the objects exact size (based on its brightness), as well as its shape and spin rate (based on how its brightness fluctuates).They will also seek to measure A/2017 U1s color, and perhaps even its spectrumthe subtler details of its emitted and absorbed light.Taken together, all that information could show what exactly A/2017 U1 is made ofwhether it is mostly rock, or ice, for instanceand potentially reveal more about its history and origins, somewhere out there among the stars.Most likely, Meech says, the object is an outcast from another star system: a space rock flung out during the stars tempestuous youth when it was surrounded by freshly-formed giant planets embedded in a disk of debris.One of those planets hefted its weight, and tossed this thing and a lot of other stuff around, she says.So now we have a piece of another planetary system flying by Earth, flying through our solar system, that we briefly have a chance to study.The same process is thought to have unfolded billions of years ago around our own star, when Jupiter and Saturn formed.Those giant worlds may have scattered debris all across our solar system, helping form the asteroid belt as well as the icy Kuiper belt, of which dwarf-planet Pluto is the largest known member.Much of that scattered debris ended up even farther out, about a light-year from the sun in a spherical shell of comets called the Oort Cloud.The farthest-flung debris probably escaped the solar system entirely and may be cruising through the void even now, bound for parts unknown.Going Hyperbolic A/2017 U1 was first discovered on Oct. 19 by Rob Weryk, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Hawaii.He found ita faint, pale dot streaking across the skywhile reviewing images from the universitys Pan-STARRS telescope, which searches for near-Earth objects (NEOs) from the mountain Haleakala.When I first saw the object in question, I immediately thought it was an NEO that had not been seen before, being quite close to the Earth, Weryk says.But then I started to look for additional detections from other nightsand when I found it [in images from] the night before, the data didnt make sense.Follow-up observations taken at Weryks request by astronomer Marco Micheli, using a European Space Agency telescope in the Canary Islands, only deepened the mystery.Based on its estimated speed and direction of travel, the object appeared to be on a hyperbolic trajectory, moving out from the sun fast enough to escape our stars gravitational pull entirely.Barring the rare space probe launched from Earth, any massive object with enough speed to leave the solar system likely originated beyond its boundaries, too, because such speeds are difficult to build up solely through natural gravitational encounters with our sun and its planets.A further batch of observations gathered by Weryks advisor, astronomer Richard Wainscoat, confirmed A/2017 U1s unprecedented motion.From there, the Pan-STARRS team began coordinating further studies of the object with the wider astronomy communityincluding researchers at NASAs Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.This is the most extreme orbit I have ever seen, said CNEOS scientist Davide Farnocchia, who worked with others to trace A/2017 U1s path through the solar system.We can say with confidence that this object is on its way out of the solar system and not coming back.Dark Objects, Bright Futures Based on these analyses, A/2017 U1 came from the direction of the constellation Lyra, swooping in from high above the ecliptic plane in which the suns planets orbit at a breathtaking 25 kilometers per second.According to calculations by Micheli, that trajectory placed it 25 times farther out than Pluto in the year 1837, and it crossed the orbit of Neptune in November of 2012 on its sunward plunge.Pulled by our stars gravity, on Sept. 9 A/2017 U1 approached within 40 million kilometers of the sunwell within the orbit of Mercurybefore being flung back up and out of the ecliptic plane in the direction of the constellation Pegasus at nearly 44 kilometers per second.On Oct 14 it passed less than 25 million kilometers from Earthabout 60 times the Earth-moon distance.Astronomers could not see it, then, however, because its trajectory took it too close to the sun as seen from our planet's skies.As its distance from the sun increases and less sunlight strikes its surface, A/2017 U1s brightness will plummet.Already, Meech says, its glow is diminishing to the equivalent of one of Plutos small moons as seen from Earth.By the end of next month it will be at the limit of what the worlds largest ground-based telescopes would be able to discern in a 10-hour exposure.Much beyond that, even keener-eyed space-based observatories such as Hubble will struggle to see it.Maybe we had a window of a little over a week, maybe two, in which we couldve discovered this thing by its brightness alone, Meech says.It was moving so fast, and registered so faintly in detectors, that Pan-STARRSs finding it at all seems to have been a matter of luckor at least whatever happens when preparation meets opportunity.Imaging the entire firmament overhead night after night, the telescope is one of several all-sky surveys already or imminently watching the heavens.These facilities, most notably the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) set to debut in 2020, promise to revolutionize the field of transient astronomythe study not of steady-shining stars and galaxies, but of the things that rapidly move and change: exploding stars, whirling asteroids and comets, and anything else that goes bump!in the outer night.No one really knows yet how often interstellar interlopers like A/2017 U1 soar through our solar systembut observatories like Pan-STARRS and the LSST could soon find out.This, to Weryk, is perhaps the most vital thing to learn.The most important response to the Okay, so what?question is Well, where do these things come from, and are there more?he says.There is still a lot we don't know about the solar system, and finding objects like this could help improve our understanding of how the Earth and our solar system first came to be.
Was the Extreme 2017 Hurricane Season Driven by Climate Change?:::::Summer and fall 2017 saw an unusual string of record-breaking hurricanes pummel the U.S. Gulf Coast, eastern seaboard, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.Hurricane Harvey brought unbelievable floods to Houston.Irma, one of the two strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the northern Atlantic, wreaked havoc on Florida and many Caribbean islands.Maria devastated Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.The destruction begs the question: Has climate change influenced these extreme events?Hurricanes can be difficult to decipher, but experts are gaining a sense of what our warming world might mean for monster storms in the U.S. and worldwide.Storm Intensity Many experts are confident that a warmer world will create stronger stormsand already is doing so.Since 1981 the maximum wind speed of the most powerful hurricanes has risen, according to research (pdf) by Jim Elsner, a climatologist at The Florida State University.Thats because higher ocean heat provides more energy for storms, fueling their intensity.Hurricane Patricia, in 2015, set the record at the time for top wind speed215 miles per hourin the north Atlantic.The next year Winston shattered records as the most intense cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere.The dynamic between storms and warming oceans occurs in part because of the role hurricanes play in our climate system: they rebalance Earths heat.The storms remove heat from tropical oceans in the form of moisture and pump the heat up into the atmosphere, where heat is redistributed and radiated out into space.In some sense, hurricanes are a relief valve, explains Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist in the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.From the climate standpoint, you need to have some hurricanes to come along and cool the ocean, to keep them at reasonable temperatures.No other phenomenon can play this role.Frequency How climate change will influence the frequency of hurricanes is less well understood.Some experts predict a potential drop in overall numbers.In rebalancing Earths heat, Trenberth says, one big hurricane can play the role of four smaller hurricanes.Tom Knutson, a climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, says nearly all models predict this effectthey show a decrease in the total number of hurricanes in a warmer climate.Elsner notes, however, Theres still a lot of uncertainty on this point.Both Trenberth and Knutson think the number of very intense storms may actually grow.Some studies show that globally, we end up with more storms at the high endat category 4 and 5, Trenberth says.The north Atlantic, in particular, may experience this trend.Elsner is more hesitant; he says the frequency of the strongest hurricanes is also controlled by the occurrence of ideal conditionsno wind shear high in the atmosphere to tear storms apart from above, no land in their path to break them up from below and no dry air to absorb some of their moisture.It is unknown how or if these conditions will change, he says.Size and Duration Scientists are still unsure about how climate change will influence the physical breadth and duration of hurricanes.In their modeling Knutson and his team have found that the number of category 4 and 5 storm days could potentially increase slightly by the late 21st century.Trenberth thinks higher ocean temperatures may mean storms will become both bigger in size and last longer.He does note, though, that these traits depend on how storm details are defined: For a storms breadth across the ocean, for example, where are the boundaries drawn?Does duration apply to its time as a specific hurricane category (4, 5) or as an overall tropical storm?Storm Surge Scientists do agree climate change means higher storm surges are hitting coastlines.This would happen even if hurricanes do not become stronger.Once you have a higher baseline sea level, Knutson says, that's going to add to the water level experienced during storm surges.If sea level is a half-meter higher, for example, then a storm surge will be a half-meter higher than it would have been otherwise.Rainfall Experts also expect that climate change may increase the intensity of hurricane rainfall.The unprecedented, deep flooding in the Houston area certainly bears witness to that idea.Warmer air holds more water vapor.For hurricanes, that can lead to more efficiency; the rate at which rain falls out of the clouds increases, Elsner says.Were seeing that in some of these storms.Knutson gives a number for this phenomenon: Hurricane rainfall rate is projected to rise 7 percent for every degree Celsius rise in tropical sea surface temperatures.Expanding Reach Regions of the world that have not experienced hurricanes may in the future.As oceans heat up, the cyclonic storms territory could enlarge.If a storm remains over warm water, it can maintain a high intensity, Elsner says.If those warm waters are expanding, then you can find these strong storms in [new] places.Trenberth agrees: Witness Ophelia, which surprised Ireland and the U.K. in October.Even though scientists are investigating these potentially changing factors, they caution that uncertainty remains for many of them.Hurricanes are particularly challenging because they are such complex and relatively rare events.Not only is there large variability but the reliable record is shortsatellite [tracking] began about 1970, Trenberth says.Plus, many other forces (pdf)such as weak wind shear and low pressure at the sea surfaceinfluence this type of storm.Knutson is less certain than others that it is possible to already see global warmings influence on any of these factors in the record (except for higher storm surge due to sea level rise).It is too early to say that we can detect this change already in the data, and its clearly distinct from natural variability, Knutson says.That limits our confidence in future projections.But Elsner says the growing intensity of hurricanes is already evident in the record.It has already been shown that the strongest hurricanes are getting stronger worldwide, Elsner wrote in an e-mail to Scientific American.Trenberth goes further.The environment in which all such storms occur is warmer and moister, and we know that this has effects, he notes.The evidence is that climate change is already with us.
A Nearby Neutron Star Collision Could Cause Calamity on Earth:::::A long time ago in a galaxy far awayNGC 4993, to be exacttwo neutron stars collided and created a spectacular light show.After billions of years spent slowly circling each other, in their last moments the two degenerate stars spiraled around each other thousands of times before finally smashing together at a significant fraction of light-speed, likely creating a black hole.The merger was so violent it shook the universe, emitting some 200 million suns worth of energy as perturbations in the fabric of spacetime called gravitational waves.Those waves propagated out from the merger like ripples on a pond, eventually washing over Earthand into our planets premiere gravitational-wave detectors, the U.S.-built LIGO and European-built Virgo observatories.Yet gravitational waves were not the mergers only products.The event also emitted electromagnetic radiationthat is, lightmarking the first time astronomers have managed to capture both gravitational waves and light from a single source.The first light from the merger was a brief, brilliant burst of gamma rays, a probable birth cry of the black hole picked up by NASAs Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope.Hours later astronomers using ground-based telescopes detected more light from the mergera so-called kilonovaproduced as debris from the merger expanded and cooled.For weeks much of the worlds astronomical community watched the kilonova as it slowly faded from view.As astronomers studied the mergers aftermath in various wavelengths of light, they saw signs of countless heavy elements forming instantly.Astronomers had long predicted merging neutron stars may be responsible for forming elements such as gold and titanium, neutron-rich metals that are not known to form in stars.Most everything they saw in the changing light of the mergers kilonova matched those predictions, although no one definitively, directly saw the merger spewing out gold nuggets by any stretch.Even seen across its estimated 130 million light-year separation from us, the event was big, bright and glorious.Based on the rarity of neutron starslet alone ones that happen to mergeit is unlikely we will ever see such a display significantly closer to us.But lets imagine if we couldif it happened in the Milky Way or one of its several satellite galaxies.Or, heaven forbid, in our immediate stellar neighborhood.What would we see?What effects would it have on our home world?Would the environment, civilization, even humanity, emerge intact?Instant Action Although LIGO, by design, can hear the mergers of massive objects such as neutron stars and black holes, astronomers were still lucky to detect this particular event.According to Gabriela Gonzlez, a LIGO team member and astrophysicist at Louisiana State University, if the merger had been three to four times farther away, we would not have heard it at all.Ironically, LIGOs exquisite tuning for detecting distant black hole mergers could make it miss big ones occurring around the solar systems nearest neighboring stars.The immense and intense gravitational waves from such a nearby event would probably be [greater] than the dynamic range of our instrument, Gonzalez says.Despite being strong enough to shake the universe, the gravitational waves from even a nearby merger of two large black holes would still be scarcely noticeable, because the shaking manifests on microscopic scales.(If gas, dust or any other matter was very close the merging black holes, however, astronomers might see light emitted from that infalling material as it plunges in.)The amazing thing to me is that you could be so close to black holes colliding, even as close as just outside the solar system, and you wouldnt even notice the stretching of spacetime with your eyes, Gonzlez says.You would still need an instrument to see or measure it.In contrast, a kilonova from a neutron star merger in our galaxy would probably be quite noticeable.Gonzalez says it could suddenly appear as a bright star in the sky, and would be clearly detectable by LIGO, too.Rather than lasting for a matter of seconds, the gravitational waves heard by LIGO would be drawn out over minutes, even hours, as the neutron stars spiraled ever-closer together before their ultimate coalescence.It would be a bit like tuning into a live Grateful Dead jam instead of a studio version.(And yes, lets say the song is Dark Star for our purposes.)Even if LIGO tuned in, however, there are ways we might miss seeing much of the light from a nearby neutron star merger and its subsequent kilonova.Kari Frank, an astronomer at Northwestern University, says such a large, luminous event could end up obscured by dust and other starsat least at visible and infrared wavelengths.In other words, LIGO and telescopes looking in wavelengths such as radio or x-ray might glimpse a nearby kilonova that optical astronomers would miss.There have been supernovaeat least ones that we know of in our galaxy in the last 100 years or sofor which we didnt see the explosion at all, we only saw what was left afterward, Frank says.And a kilonova, for all the punch it packs, is only a fraction of the luminosity of a typical supernova.Still, astronomers responses to any stellar cataclysm in or around the Milky Way would likely be swift.After all, theres the example of supernova 1987A to consider.The Big Boom As its name suggests, supernova 1987A occurred in 1987, unfolding in a dwarf galaxy that orbits the Milky Way called the Large Magellanic Cloud.A star about eight times the suns mass collapsed in on itself and sent its outer envelope of gas out into interstellar space, forming a nebula of heavy elements and other debris before collapsing into either a neutron star or a black hole.It remains the only nearby supernova astronomers have seen in modern times.Frank has studied the subsequent global campaign to observe supernova 1987A, focusing on how astronomers organized and executed their observations at a time when the internet was embryonic at best.Somebody sees something, and they send out notices to everybody, she says.The people who first discovered it had to phone whomever they could to tell them that this thing was happening, that they saw this supernova in the sky that was really close by, Frank says.They sent these circularsletters and things to peopleand then everyone who could would go to their telescope and point to it.For months, astronomers worldwide scrutinized the event, utilizing almost every available telescope.Everybody wanted to make sure that as many [telescopes] looked at it as possible, Frank says.Eventually, things settled down, but several researchersincluding Frankare still studying the supernovas remnants 30 years later.For some people, it was life-changing, or at least career-changing, Frank says.This was the thing in astronomy that year.Like LIGO, the observation campaign for supernova 1987A involved thousands of collaborators.But not all of them shared in the glory of co-authoring any of the many resulting studies published in the scientific literature.Consequently, theres no real head count of how many people participated.Counting collaborators working on the recent neutron star merger is much easiersome 3,000 authors across 67 papers, or an estimated 15 percent of the entire field of astrophysics.The question of how many astrophysicists would receive credit for another event like supernova 1987A depends, in no small part, on just how close the event would be.If supernova 1987A had occurred much, much closer to Eartharound a nearby star, for instancethe key uncertainty could become not how many scientists observed the event, but how many survived it.Death from Above According to a 2016 study, supernovae occurring as close as 50 light-years from Earth could pose an imminent danger to Earths biospherehumans included.The event would likely shower us in so much high-energy cosmic radiation that it could spark a planetary mass extinction.Researchers have tentatively linked past instances of spiking extinction rates and plummeting biodiversity to postulated astrophysical events, and in at least one case have even found definitive evidence for a nearby supernova as the culprit.Twenty million years ago, a star 325 light-years from Earth exploded, showering the planet in radioactive iron particles that eventually settled in deep-sea sediments on the ocean floor.That event, researchers speculate, may have triggered ice ages and altered the course of evolution and human history.The exact details of past (and future) astrophysical cataclysms impact on Earths biosphere depend not only on their distance, but also their orientation.A supernova, for instance, can sometimes expel its energy in all directionsmeaning it is not always a very targeted phenomenon.Merging black holes are expected to emit scarcely any radiation at all, making them surprisingly benign for any nearby biosphere.A kilonova, however, has different physics at play.Neutron stars are a few dozen kilometers in radius rather than a few million like a typical stars.When these dense objects merge, they tend to produce jets that blast out gamma rays from their poles.[W]hat it looks like to us, and the effect it has on us, would depend a lot on whether or not one of the jets was pointed directly at us, Frank says.Based on its distance and orientation to Earth, a kilonovas jets would walk the fine line between a spectacular light show and a catastrophic stripping away of the planets upper atmosphere.If a jet is pointed directly at us, drastic changes could be in store.And we probably wouldnt see them coming.A kilonova begins with a burst of gamma raysincredibly energetic photons that, by definition, move at light-speed, the fastest anything can travel through the universe.Because nothing else can move faster, those photons would strike first, and without warning.What [the gamma rays] would do, probably more than anything else, is dissolve the ozone layer, says Andrew Fruchter, a staff astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute.Next, the sky would go blindingly white as the visible light from the kilonova encountered our planet.Trailing far behind the light would be slower-moving material ejected from the kilonovaradioactive particles of heavy elements that, sandblasting the Earth in sufficient numbers, could still pack a lethal punch.Thats if the kilonova is close, thoughwithin 50 light-years, give or take.At a safer distance, the gamma rays would still singe the ozone layer on the facing hemisphere, but the other side would be shielded by the planets bulk.Most radiation happens very quickly, so half the Earth would be hidden, Fruchter says.There would still be a momentarily blinding light.For a few weeks, a new star would burn bright in the sky before gradually fading back into obscurity.Improbabilities Dont let all this keep you up at night.Kilonovae are relatively rare cosmic phenomena, estimated to occur just once every 10,000 years in a galaxy like the Milky Way.Thats because neutron stars, which are produced by supernovae, hardly ever form as pairs.Usually, a neutron star will receive a hefty kick from its formative supernova; sometimes these kicks are strong enough to eject a neutron star entirely from its galaxy to hurtle at high speeds indefinitely through the cosmos.When neutron stars are born, theyre often high-velocity.For them to survive in a binary is nontrivial, Fruchter says.And the chances of two finding each other and merging after forming independently are, for lack of a better term, astronomically low.The binary neutron stars we know of in our galaxy are millions or billions of years away from merging.Any local merger of neutron stars at all would take LIGO by surprise, given that the events are so rare, and astronomers might not even see the resulting kilonova at all.But if one did occursay, in one of the Milky Ways satellite galaxiesit would be a great reason to run to a telescope to witness the flash and fade of a brief, brilliant new star.The dangers would be nearly nonexistent, but not the payoff: Our generation of astronomers would have their own supernova 1987A to dissect.This is a once-in-many-lifetimes kind of event, Frank says.Thus, she says, we would need to follow something like it with all the worlds astronomical resources.We have to remember to think beyond the initial explosion, she adds.Stuff might still happen and we have to keep a watch out for that.For now astronomers attentions are still fixated on the kilonova in NGC 4993.The Earths orbital motion has placed the sun between us and the distant galaxy, however, hiding the kilonovas fading afterglow.When our view clears, in December, many of the worlds telescopic eyes will again turn to the small patch of sky containing the merger.In the meantime papers will be penned and published, careers minted, reputations secured.Science will march on, and waitwait for the next possible glimpse of a kilonova, the whispers of a neutron star merger or, if were lucky, something new altogether.
New Gene-Editing "Pencil" Erases Disease-Causing Errors:::::There are more than 50,000 known human genetic maladies that have, in most cases, few good treatments and no cure.Now researchers at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT have developed a new tool that would theoretically make it possible to correct the genetic errors behind about 15,000 of these illnessesincluding sickle-cell disease, cystic fibrosis and several forms of congenital deafness and blindness.Standard gene-editing tools, such as the well-known CRISPRCas9 system, function like scissors; they can cut an offending gene from a strand of DNA.This could be useful against diseases such as Huntingtons, which is caused by duplications of genetic material.The new tool, called ABE (adenine base editors), is more like an editing pencil, according to lead researcher David Liu.It lets scientists precisely change individual pairs of basesthe letters that form the sentences of the vast human genomeand thus might help address diseases like sickle cell that can be treated with a single letter change.Liu emphasizes that one tool is not better than the other; rather they can be used to address different types of problems.But before ABE can be tried in human patients, Liu says, doctors would need to determine when to intervene in the course of a genetic disease.They would also have to figure out how to best deliver the gene editor to the relevant cellsand to prove the approach is safe and effective enough to make a difference for the patient.Genes are made up of DNAtwo long, parallel strands of molecules called nucleotides that are linked by pairs of chemical bases.The base A (adenine) always pairs with T (thymine); and G (guanine) joins with C (cytosine).But when the genetic machinery makes mistakes and puts a pair in the wrong place, it sometimes leads to disease.The new tool targets genetic errors in which an AT base pair should be a GC.Liu is a professor of chemistry at Harvard University and a vice chair of the faculty at the Broad Institute.Along with his students and postdoctoral researchers he had previously developed base editors that convert CG base pairs into TA pairs.(The order is important, so a GC mistake is not the same as a CG one.)Liu, who is also an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, said Tuesday in a news conference that he and others have been working on additional tools, which could correct other types of spelling mistakes in DNA.This led them to ABE.The new ABE technique uses an enzyme Liu and his colleagues developed.It rearranges the atoms in A so they form a base that resembles G in a DNA strand.The ABE system also nicks the mated DNA strand that contains the T. The cells repair mechanisms then turn on to fix the tear.In doing so, the cell replaces the T with a C, correcting the other half of the base pair.The net result is the troublesome AT base pair is converted into a beneficial GC pair.Using ABE in a lab dish, Liu and his colleagues were able to precisely edit genes that cause a hereditary form of hemochromatosisa disease that leads the body to store too much iron, causing pain, fatigue, weakness and, if untreated, liver and heart failure.They also used ABE to install a different genetic mutation that compensates for the DNA defect that causes sickle-cell disease.The ABE gene-editing process is efficient, effectively editing the relevant spot in the genome an average of 53 percent of the time across 17 tested sites, Liu said.It caused undesired effects less than 0.1 percent of the time, he added.That success rate is comparable with what CRISPR can do when it is cutting genes.Dirk Hockemeyer, an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the Broad research, said he is impressed in the work and the tool the team developed.But it is still a long way from helping patients.In clinical applications the key question is always delivery, delivery, delivery: How do I get the editing agent to the position in the cell that I want to repair?he says.But if it cures a single disease, we should all be happy.
Space-Based Test Proves Light's Quantum Weirdness:::::Physicists sometimes say that a beam of light traveling through space is like a great smoky dragon.One can know much about where the light comes from (the dragons tail) and where it is seen (the dragons head), yet still know precious little about the journey in between (the dragons mysterious, nebulous body).As light travels from source to detection, it can behave as either a particle or a waveor, paradoxically, both states or neither state.Now an experiment using laser beams shot at satellites in low-Earth orbit has confirmed that this bizarre detail about the nature of light holds true across record-breaking distances.Quantum physics, the best description yet of how all known particles behaves, suggests that reality is fuzzy and uncertain at its most basic levels.For instance, the surreal quantum effect known as superposition essentially allows electrons, atoms and other building blocks of the universe to each exist in two or more places simultaneously.Another strange quantum phenomenon is particle-wave duality.Whereas Isaac Newton thought light was made up of particles, his contemporary the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens argued that it consisted of waves.Eventually, researchers performing the so-called double-slit experiment demonstrated that Newton and Huygens were both rightphotons of light could behave as both particles and waves.The double-slit experiment involves shining a single light source through two adjacent slits in an opaque plate, and onto a detecting screen.If an experimenter closes one slit, the light passing through the other forms a bar on the screenas if the light were behaving like a stream of particles.But if the experimenter leaves both slits open the light will not form two such bars.Instead it generates a series of bright and dark bands on the screen, as if waves of light scattered through the slits and interfered with each other.The bright bands indicate where light waves reinforced each other, and dark bands where they canceled each other out.Remarkably, this interference pattern will materialize even if photons are projected at the slits one at a time.The way quantum physics explains these confounding results is that the instruments used to detect light determine its state as a particle or a wave.Describing this situation, in 1983 the American physicist Jonathan Wheeler coined the now-famous great smoky dragon comparison.To examine how light chooses to become either a particle or wave upon its detection, Wheeler conceived of the delayed-choice experiment.In it, an optical device called a beam-splitter offers a single photon two paths to take.At the end of each path is a detector.If the photon behaves like a particle, it has an equal chance of taking either path and being seen by either detector.If the photon instead behaves like a wave, it will take both paths simultaneously and register in both detectors.When the experiment only incorporates one beam-splitter, a single photon will take either path and just one detector will see it.This suggests the photon made the choice at the beam-splitter to behave like a particle.However, a beam-splitter can also act in reverse to merge two photons into one; if the experiment has the paths converge at a second beam-splitter before channeling them to a detector the result will be the interference pattern from the photons acting as waves and reacting to each other.This holds true even when the second beam-splitter is introduced in the split second after light passes through the first onebut has yet to reach the detectors.Scientists have successfully carried out both versions of this experiment in the decades since Wheeler proposed it.Its results make sense if the photon delays making the choice to become a particle or a wave until it actually gets detected.The alternative would suggest that the photon could somehow decide to become a particle if it encountered one beam-splitter but then change its decision and become a wave if it ran across a second beam-splitter.Historically, all delayed-choice experiments have been performed on Earth.But now scientists are increasingly conducting quantum experiments involving lasers shot across the vastness of outer space.Quantum physicist Paolo Villoresi at the University of Padua in Italy and his colleagues wanted to verify if the dual nature of light still held true even across the distances between the ground and satellites in low-Earth orbit.As Galileowho did most of his work at the University of Paduasaid, we have to prove the laws we know in new contexts, Villoresi quips.Using the Matera Laser Ranging Observatory in Italy, Villoresi and his colleagues performed Wheelers delayed-choice experiment by firing green laser pulses at the Beacon-C and Starlette satellites, which reflected the photons back at the observatory.At their farthest, the satellites were 1,771 kilometers (1,100 miles) away from the observatory.Distance matters, explains astrophysicist Brian Koberlein at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, who did not take part in this research.In a single lab, you could argue that maybe in some way the experimenters are affecting the outcome.But over larger distances, there isnt a clear way to affect outcomes.Instead of having the photons travel down one of two separate paths of equal lengths, the scientists measured two different aspects of each photonhow each one oscillated in space, and whether it took a shorter or longer path to the detectors.Their results confirmed lights curious quantum behavior over distances tens to hundreds of times greater than previously shown, Villoresi says.The teams findings appeared Oct. 25 in the journal Science Advances.This work further confirms that quantum mechanics really is the description of the great smoky dragon, Koberlein says.It may be strange, but it is logically and mathematically consistent.Aside from testing the quantum qualities of light across unprecedented distances, Villoresi notes that quantum physics experiments conducted across space could help lead to satellite-based telecommunications networks protected by nigh-unhackable quantum cryptography.By clarifying the fundamental properties of photons during such experiments as was done in this study, there may be direct applications for larger bandwidths in quantum communications, Villoresi says.Indeed, great smoky dragons may someday carry secrets in their jaws.
Neurologists' Role in Nazi "Racial Hygiene" Only Now Comes to Light:::::Medical historians have recently published accounts that show neurologists were indeed complicit with the Nazisand became victims if they were classified as non-Aryan.Heiner Fangerau, who teaches the history and ethics of medicine at University Hospital Dsseldorfalong with colleagues Michael Martin at the Heinrich Heine University of Dsseldorf and Axel Karenberg from the University of Cologneundertook extensive research on neurologists during the Third Reich for the German Society of Neurology.Fangerau discussed new findings with Corinna Hartmann and Andreas Jahn of Gehirn&Geist, the psychology and neuroscience specialty publication of Spektrum der Wissenschaft, and the German sister publication of Scientific American.An edited transcript of the interview follows.Professor Fangerau, your research project examines the role played by neurologists during the Nazi period.Why is this only happening 70 years after the fact?There were several different phases in which people dealt with National Socialism after World War II.Immediately after 1945 the Allies pursued a policy of denazification.After that German society as a whole attempted to suppress its dark past.Many members of the next generation, however, found it impossible to close their eyes: Students in the 1968 movement were angry that their parents were unwilling to deal openly with the Third Reich.The medical specialties took even longer to begin working through the past.As a result, their reappraisal of the crimes committed began only in the 1980s.Part of the reason why historical research into neurology has only been conducted systematically over the past several years is that neurology and psychiatry were forced into the same disciplinary framework in 1935.Before then neurology had begun to separate from psychiatry.The basic idea was to leave psychological phenomena that are difficult to understand to the psychiatrists and to concentrate on disorders that are anatomically demonstrable.The National Socialists nullified this effort.They believed that they could control these medical specialties more effectively if they brought them together in the Society of German Neurologists and Psychiatrists, which was dominated by psychiatrists committed to the ideology of racial hygiene.The chairman of the society was Ernst Rdin, a psychiatrist.As a result, neurology has come to be viewed as less implicated.Historical research conducted since the late 1980s, however, paints a very different picture.What are the most important findings of your research?Neurology as a discipline was indeed complicit in the crimes of the Nazis.The ideology of racial hygiene combined with opportunistic arguments about compassion and cost reductions served to justify the systematic killing of more than 70,000 disabled and sick people.The Nazis euphemistically called this policy euthanasia.Both neurologists and psychiatrists were involved, and it is often difficult to distinguish who was a neurologist and who was a psychiatrist.The doctors assessed patients, and whomever they found to be either problematic or incapable of working was transferred to a killing facility and murdered.Neuroscientists then used the brains of these murdered patients in their research.What did you find especially shocking?I found especially frightening the matter-of-factness with which many physicians used the bodies of those that had been killed, and their indifference in carrying out or approving experiments on their patients.After the war these crimes in the name of science were covered up as the acts of individuals.But in fact, these were by no means the acts of sadistic individuals; rather, a large proportion of academic neurologists collaborated with the Nazi system to their mutual benefit.The scientists were the recipients of research projects and state funding, and in return the National Socialists received scientific legitimation for their racial policies.Under the Nazis physicians were to play a major role in the state.And unfortunately, on the whole physicians were prepared to work with the regime.What sorts of research did neurologists conduct back then?For one thing, they studied diseases like epilepsy.Their main concern here was to distinguish between hereditary and nonhereditary forms so that patients with a genetic predisposition could be forcibly sterilized in accordance with Nazi eugenic principles.The second research focus was brain anatomy.Using samples from those who had been euthanized, neurologists studied the structure, function and pathology of the brain.What happened to the samples and the knowledge derived from them after 1945?The findings of these inhumane studies were simply merged into further research during the postwar era.The brains and preserved tissue such as the brain sections of euthanasia victims largely remained at the institutes where they continued to be used as material for studies.For example, the German Research Institute for Psychiatry, now the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich, housed a large anatomical collection.Researchers in the history of medicine are currently doing research on these specimens.Apparently, for many years scientists were unable to resist the lure of working with these ghastly remains.It took persistent pressure from journalists and historians, especially from Israel, before German anatomical collections were systematically examined for incriminated material.In the 1990s many of these samples were removed from the archives and buried.It should be noted, however, that such mass burials are not unproblematic from todays perspective, because it has made it even more difficult to identify the people who were murdered.It is one of the goals of research into this history to return to victims who were given numbers their true identities.Which neurologists were especially complicit in the crimes of the National Socialists?The most prominent were the neuropathologist Hugo Spatz and the brain researcher Julius Hallervorden.Both worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research in Berlin.Under Spatzs leadership the institute became a hotbed of eugenics.As head of the histopathology department, Hallervorden conducted secondary research for the euthanasia program on the diseases suffered by the patients who were killed.Among other things, he and his co-workers studied which neurological and psychiatric diseases are hereditary.These determinations formed the basis for the selection of patients to be killed.The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute received large numbers of brains of euthanasia victims for its research.And as we now know, those who took part in that research were well aware of their origin.After the fact, how do you determine who was a true believer in the Nazi cause and who was merely a follower?In point of fact, it is not always as clear as in the case of Hugo Spatz and Julius Hallervorden.For example, Heinrich Pette, who headed the Neurology Department of the Society of German Neurologists and Psychiatrists, has never been linked to the euthanasia program.If we want to know whether a particular person was complicit with the Nazi system, we could of course ask: Was he or she a member of a National Socialist organization?But that would be an oversimplification because many people became members of the Nazi Party without acting on its behalf.That is why we also look at the date on which they joined.For example, did the person join the party before 1933 or after the seizure of power?Or was he or she someone who applied for membership after it stopped accepting members?Other important considerations include personal contacts with Nazi functionaries, appearances at political events, publication in Nazi periodicals and the denunciation of co-workers.Pette took the stage at important Nazi-sponsored events and frequently expressed the racial policies of the day.But it is not yet clear whether he betrayed colleaguesor perhaps may even have protected them.Prizes awarded by the German Society of Neurology, which was rededicated in 1950, have actually been named in honor of Spatz and Pette.How could this have happened?After the war the German colleges of physicians concocted a self-protective interpretation.They convinced themselves that only a few doctors had participated in the crimes, and that these few had either been brought to justice during the Nuremberg Trials or been captured during the war.At the time, Spatz and Hallervorden were renowned neurologists whose colleagues and students found difficult to attack for their involvement in the Nazi regime.Questions were raised almost exclusively abroad.In 1953, when Hallervorden was to present a paper at the International Congress of Neurology Lisbon, the Dutch participants protested so vehemently that his presentation was canceled.The Hugo Spatz Prize was renamed only in 1999 after one of its awardees made an issue of it.In contrast to Spatz, Heinrich Pette was a more ambiguous character whose role has yet to be clarified.After the end of the war were any neurologists forced to answer for their crimes?Only about 20 physicians were charged at the Nuremberg Doctors Trial, among them the only woman, Herta Oberheuser, who participated in human experiments in a concentration camp.None of the other physicians involved, even those who had worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, were prosecuted.There was another wave of trials during the 1960s, but it mainly involved psychiatrists.Important neurologists like Hallervorden and Spatz continued in their careers in Germany as if nothing had happened.Do you know of any neurologists who resisted?A few neurologists remained in the country but were unwilling to associate themselves with the Nazi cause.However, there were many who were exiled, deported, driven to suicide or murdered after being classified as non-Aryan.Medical historians have shown that contemporary documents also reveal differences between neurologists in private practice and those working in university clinics in terms of recommending forced sterilization.In rural areas, where physicians had a personal relationship with their patients and their families, they were less likely to recommend sterilization.Such recommendations were more frequent in urban hospitals in which there was no real physicianpatient relationship.But we have heard of no neurologists who opposed the regime more resolutely.That is something that we intend to examine in a future research project.How are young physicians responding to your findings?Happily, young physicians are very interested in the history of their field.Many had previously known nothing of the involvement of German neurologists in the crimes of National Socialists, and they now find it all the more important to make this history known.Of course, there are some who disagree, but we want to ensure that we do not forget.That is why we intend to reconstruct histories of persecuted physicians and to shine a light on these physicians, some of whom made important contributions to scienceespecially since many of their names were expunged from the professional literature.History has shown unambiguously that human beings are prepared to inflict suffering on others in the name of modern medical research.This is a propensity that we must bear in mind at all times.Although knowledge of what happened in the past cannot prevent future horrors, it may at least serve as a warning.A LIST OF CONTROVERSIAL NAZI-ERA NEUROLOGISTS Julius Hallervorden (18821965) led the Histopathology Department at the Kaiser Wilhelm

Small-Minded Strategy: The Common Shrew Shrinks Its Head to Survive Winter:::::Shrews might seem rather unassuming.Smaller than mice, they can go largely unnoticedscurrying through the grasslands of Britain, northern Europe and many parts of the U.S. in search of insects or dodging the hovering threat of owls and eagles.Yet new research reveals these little molelike mammals are biological marvels when it comes to enduring the hardships of winter.A new study published Monday in Current Biology reports the skulls of Sorex araneus, the most common shrew species, shrink by up to 20 percent as the cold season approaches.Come spring, their heads return to roughly normal size.Working in the 1940s, Polish zoologist August Dehnel first recognized shrews bodies shrink during winter, a finding that came to be known as the Dehnel phenomenon.But the new research is the first to nail down more specifics, and to measure the extent of the creatures head shrinkage by following individual animals through the seasons.The work suggests declining temperatures trigger shrews to literally break down their cranial bones and warm weather cues them to rebuild.To conduct the new study, lead author Javier Lazaro, a PhD candidate at Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, and his colleagues trapped 12 shrews in the nearby town of Mggingen, Germany.The animals were anesthetized, x-rayed and implanted with microchips for later identification.They were then scanned at regular intervals for over a year.All 12 showed the same pattern of peak head size in summer, a reduction throughout the winter and regrowth in the spring.It is not just the skulls that shrink with winter, however.Shrews brains appear to get smaller, tooby as much as 30 percent, according to prior dissection research.Moreover, the animals other organs also lose mass; even their spines get shorter.Overall, the latest study suggests shrew body mass drops by 18 percent from July to February.Then, in spring, the creatures start to grow until they reach their peak size83 percent larger than their winter low.Shrews are not the only creatures to undergo bodily changes in response to environmental cues, scientists note.It's not unusual for animals to lose soft tissue mass during lean periods, says John Grady, a postdoctoral researcher in ecology at Michigan State University who was not involved in the study.In addition to fat, some animals will lose organ mass when food is scarce.He points to the fact some snakes break down their digestive tracts between feedings and build them back up after nabbing prey.But, like the authors of the new research, he was surprised by the degree of shrews shrinking bones and brains.A shrinking skull may indicate bone is being reabsorbed by the body in the winter and regenerated in spring, according to Lazaro and his co-authors.They think gaining a better understanding of the proximate causes of that breakdown may help advance studies of degenerative bone diseases including osteoporosis.For now, however, they see the animals diminished bone, brain and body mass as an alternative to hibernation or migration.When food is scarce during winter, weight reduction likely saves the animals energy, the researchers say.Shrews are fascinating, Lazaro adds.They are among the smallest mammals on the planet and have by far the highest relative metabolic rate among mammals.Their hypothesis that brains shrink to reduce energy is very reasonable, Grady says of the new study.But one thing I wish theyd done is try to tease apart whether the shrews brains shrunk simply because they were too big for the newly shrunken body or if shrews are actually [able] to compromise brain function to save energy.Further research by Lazaro may soon help answer that question.He and his colleagues hope to build a large outdoor enclosure to better study how a shrinking brain influences shrews mental skills like learning, flexibility and memory.The goal, he says, is to help illuminate the relationship between their mammalian brains, body metabolism and environment.As Grady puts it, Maybe the shrews get a little dimmer during the winterand thats the price of not starving to death.
Astrophysicist Leads a Tour of the "Zoomable Universe":::::Do you want to hear the most epic story ever?So begins The Zoomable Universe (October 2017, Scientific American/FSG), a new book from astrophysicist Caleb Scharf and artist Ron Miller that is a tour of, well, almost everything.The epic story is the tale of how atoms made in the immediate aftermath of the big bang 13.8 billion years ago came together from the hearts of distant, long-dead suns scattered across our galaxy to coalesce into our familiar Earthinto toadstools, trilobites, trees and, of course, dear reader, into you.Just as our planet itself is but one of hundreds of billions likely to exist in the Milky Way, this opening story is just one small part of Scharf and Millers greater, grander aim: condensing the sum total of our knowledge about the natural world into one illustrated 200-page volume.Of course, this doesnt mean copying the entirety of Wikipedia onto glossy paper in microscopic print; they take a more elegant path, crafting a cosmic travelogue that jumps through all of existences known scales in order-of-magnitude leaps, ranging from the outer limits of the observable universe to the quantum worlds of fundamental particles.Its a timeworn formula, tracing at least as far back as Charles and Ray Eamess seminal 1977 film Powers of Tenbut updated for the 21st century with new findings from the far frontiers of science at all scales.Scientific American spoke to Scharf about his book, his research process and what it really means to appreciate the universes vast scales.[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]What is this book about, fundamentally?Its not just about scales, for starters.Its about all that weve learned about the cosmos in the last hundred years or soand not just things like planets, stars and galaxies, but also the fundamental physical underpinnings of reality.Its a highly visual and accessible presentation that is meant to bring a reader right up to date: all that we know, in a nutshell, about everything.But in a more ambitious sense, I feel this book is a jumping-off point for stories yet to be told, a starter for codifying what we do not know.Its not a tidy wrap-up by any stretch of the imagination.The story of physical reality could be written differently, and it can and will be rewritten in the future.I hope that this book will help prompt those next sets of questions in readers somewhere, and lead to this tale being revised and retold.What most interested you about this project?There were lots of things.Theres the minutia and the mechanics of the project itself: How do you choose where this tour of the entire universe takes you, across 63 orders of magnitude, from the very large to the very small?Then, on what is really a meta-level, there is something intriguing about the idea of gathering together a summation of our knowledge of the physical world into a few words and pictures on some pages.These days I think most people have heard about how amazingly big a galaxy is or the incredibly small sizes of the quantum realm.But to have it all laid out in one placemaybe that isnt so usual.Theres something special about that.And I like the idea of laying the right bread crumbs, cluesfor talking about all the things we dont know.Given the breadth of the material covered, some of it must have fallen outside your expertise in physics and astronomy.Were you ever surprised by anything you learned while writing this?There definitely were those moments.Heres a rather extended example: One of the big decision points for The Zoomable Universe was to choose where to set the zooms midpoint, where we show things that we as humans are most familiar with.So, the original Powers of Ten presentation from Charles and Ray Eames zoomed in and out from a couple lying on a picnic blanket in a park in Chicago.And thats great, but I wanted to get away from a Western-centric view and pick somewhere else on Earth, and I didnt want to focus so strictly on humans.So I ended up making the midpoint a family of elephants walking in the Great Rift Valley in Africa, zooming in on a bird on one elephants back eating a louse out of the elephants skin, and then to the cells in a grain of pollen on a whisker near the louses compound eye, and so on.But we dont just talk about multilayered biosystems herethis is also a place to talk about minds and consciousness, because elephants are incredibly intelligent creatures.So one of the breakout graphics we decided to do was a two-page spread on Brains of the World, showing different species brains to scale with each other and some information about how many neurons each contains and how we associate all this with cognitive abilities.It was surprising to me how difficult it was to assemble that information.We dont really know exactly how many neurons there are even in a human brain.When I started putting together the data, I took the number that appears nearly everywhere: A hundred billion neurons.It turns out that isnt trueits more like 86 billion neuronsbut even that number is constantly being revised, and thats not even addressing the brains of other species!At heart, I am a physicist, and physicists want to quantify and count fundamental things: Okay, weve got a brain.How many neurons are in it?How many cells?And it became apparent to me that, to some extent, many biologists dont find that approach useful.I ended up being obsessed with this for a week or two, trying to find the right numbers to have data for the graphic; and then wondering whether the numbers, exact or not, actually tell us anything usefulhow meaningful is it to compare the number of neurons in a bee to the number in a mouse or in a human?Right, so when youre trying to sum up all our knowledge, you end up better appreciating the gapsnot only in what we know, but in how different scientific disciplines see and study the world.Its interesting that these tensions came up for you, in this book about scale.Many people might think a book like this would just be about space and physics.But youve just described how it encompasses more than that.Well, as I was developing the narrative of the book, I was very aware I had to link a huge diversity of topics together, and I knew that a way to do this might be to appeal to the different physical forces operating at each scale, and also to appeal to a readers preexisting knowledge.So at the big-picture scale of the universe, gravity is the thing to talk aboutits what pulls mass together, and people are familiar with its effects and, of course, it operates at every scale, although other forces become more important further down.But gravity probably isnt the best or only way to talk about planets or about life, right?So, for example, maybe talking about how energy moves and dissipates in the universe is better there.The Earth formed more than four and a half billion years ago, and its been trying its hardest to cool down ever since.Except its being blasted by solar radiation all the time, and by talking about that I could discuss how life exists as part of that global thermodynamic process.A book like this allows you to explore all these little side streets and alleyways that branch off from the main streets and highways of our knowledge.Do all those branches reflect enough of reality?I dont know, but they definitely reflect how weve constructed our pictures of it.Speaking of side streets, heres one to go down: Sometimes an apparent gap in our knowledge is actually just showing us the true, fundamental absence of something rather than our ignorance.For example, in the section of the book where you zoom into an atom, it seems like there is an awful lot of empty space down there between an atoms electrons and its nucleus.And so one might wonderdoes this void reflect something we dont know?Or is there really just nothing there to see?I noticed this as I was writing the book and planning the illustrations with my collaborator Ron Miller, thinking about the linear progression of scales.The first chapter we handled was about planets, because we wanted to begin the collaborative process with a visually rich topic.That part came naturally to us.But later, as we went further down and got to the scale of the interior of atoms, we reached this place where, as you say, youre in an atom.And now youre scaling down, down, down through this void toward the atomic nucleus, the protons and neutrons, and theres just nothing much to say.And nothing much to illustrate, either!This highlights a counterintuitive statement you might have heard before, which is that in a very real physical sense we are mostly emptiness.And that is definitely driven home when youre sitting there looking at what are essentially blank pages for the illustrations, saying, Okay, well, can we put a little dot in the middle just to give readers the idea that something is coming next?You asked whether this is just a gap in our knowledge, or is this instead just how things are.It does seem sad in an aesthetic sense if thats all there is, but the atomic emptiness also mirrors other voids that seem to exist at even smaller scales.In the book, as we zoom down through the quantum realm, we eventually reach a page that marks 10-18 meters, which is the scale where we find ourselves well within a proton, deep down into even more fundamental particlesquarks and gluons.Then you turn the page, and we have suddenly jumped further down by 17 orders of magnitude, to 10-35 meters, to what we call the Planck scale.Based on our understanding of the laws of physics, this is where uncertainty causes the concepts of location and duration to lose all meaning, where spacetime itself may break down into a probabilistic quantum foam of virtual particles and fields popping in and out of existence.But we really cant say much more about itor all those orders of magnitude we skippedbecause we simply dont know.We thought about including those additional orders of magnitude at one per pageso 17 additional pages.But we didnt know what to fill those pages with except for abstract, speculative visualizations.Then we considered just including 17 blank pages.You know, just turn, turn, turn, turn, to kind of pound home the emptiness.In the end, we just skipped these scales.Theres a big chart toward the end that shows all the scales the book covered.Those last scales are there, but theyre blank.We dont make a big deal out of it in the book.But its there.And maybe some readers will see that and react to it, which is precisely what Id like to have happen.Maybe an astute 12-year-old somewhere will read it and think, Hang on, these idiots left the most important parts out!The book does leave some clues lying around about what we might be missing.Thinking about that big chart that shows all of the books scales, from the quantum foam to the outer limits of the observable universe, its already impressive that we can plot out 63 orders of magnitude like that in a unified diagram.But can anyone actually grasp it all?Can you hold all those scales together simultaneously as a construct in your mind and get an idea of what they all add up to in any meaningful sense?I have to admit I cant grasp it allno.Its a struggle to even comprehend small parts of it.There are moments in life when you might discern a superposition of more than one order of magnitude scale, but those experiences are few and far betweenstanding under the Eiffel Tower, hiking through the Grand Canyon, looking up at a total solar eclipse and seeing the stars come out.But, yeah, most of the time I dont feel it in a visceral senseI just see numbers on the page or on the screen.In a very selfish way, I guess the whole book was kind of an experiment to see if I could collect all this information to somehow get that feeling of awe, of perspective, and hopefully to create a way for other people to have that feeling, too.Other than awe, how do you think contemplation of these scales should make us feel, as human beings, as little sparks of consciousness and quasi-emptiness adrift in a cosmos steadily sliding deeper into entropy?Are we meant to feel apathetic and insignificant in a vast and meaningless universe?Can you just think about quantum foam and multiverses, and suddenly it doesnt matter that you stepped in a big wad of chewing gum on your way into the office in the morning?Wow!Well, I can see our insignificance in terms of scale, and I can see my own insignificance there, too.But I guess Id rather be a microscopic speck in a vast and fascinating universe than to be some bloated, central lump around which everything else revolves.[ That kind of puts you in a box, right?Being so smallbeing surrounded by things that are so much bigger, and other things that are so much smallerit just means theres so much more to explore.For me its actually affirming to think that in all this unfathomable vastness we have somehow managed to be here at all.So what if our existence is just due to some quantum fluctuation?Why should that change how we feel?Sure, on a truly grand scale were not even really herewe have borrowed something from somewhere else, and someday that something will be gone and we will be gone with it.But, you know, we are still here, now.We can write books like this.We can construct stories, and that as a cosmic phenomena may be quite unique.I mean, life might exist all over the place in the cosmos.We dont know yet.But this capacity to not just communicate but to imagine and to dream, maybe that is a bit special, even for intelligent life.Bees and ants communicate with each other in a language of sorts.In some ways they are collectively very intelligent.But I dont think they tell each other epic fantasies or debate their interpretations of reality the way humans do.It could be, in that sense, we fall in a pretty special category.Which, I guess, can be a comforting thought.
Link between Adolescent Pot Smoking and Psychosis Strengthens:::::BERLINSocietys embrace of cannabis to treat nausea, pain and other conditions proceeds apace with the drive to legalize the plant for recreational use.Pots seemingly innocuous side effects have helped clear a path toward making it a legal cash crop, with all of the marketing glitz brought to other consumer products.But that clean bill of health only goes so far.Marijuanas potentially detrimental impact on the developing brains of adolescents remains a key focus of researchparticularly because of the possibility teenage users could go on to face a higher risk of psychosis.New findings may fuel those worries.At the World Psychiatric Associations World Congress in Berlin on October 9, Hannelore Ehrenreich of the Max Planck Institute of Experimental Medicine presented results of a study of 1,200 people with schizophrenia.The investigation analyzed a wide range of genetic and environmental risk factors for developing the debilitating mental illness.The resultsbeing submitted for publicationshow people who had consumed cannabis before age 18 developed schizophrenia approximately 10 years earlier than others.The higher the frequency of use, the data indicated, the earlier the age of schizophrenia onset.In her study neither alcohol use nor genetics predicted an earlier time of inception, but pot did.Cannabis use during puberty is a major risk factor for schizophrenia, Ehrenreich says.Other studies, although not all, support the thrust of Ehrenreichs findings.There is no doubt, concludes Robin Murray, a professor of psychiatry at Kings College London, that cannabis use in young people increases the risk of developing schizophrenia as an adult.Speaking at the Berlin conference, Murrayone of the first scientists to research pots link to the disordercited 10 studies that found a significant risk of young cannabis users developing psychosis.He also mentioned three other studies that identified a clear trend but had a sample size that was too small to reach statistical significance.The more [cannabis] you takeand the higher the potencythe greater the risk, he contends, warning this makes the increasingly potent new strains of marijuana especially concerning.In an interview Murray said his research with users in London has shown that high-potency cannabisapproximately 16 percent THC (tetrahydrocannabinol)was involved in 24 percent of all cases of a first episode of psychosis.(New laws permitting recreational pot use do not make it legal for teens to consume cannabis, but that has not impeded access.)Interpretations of these new findings are hardly likely to receive universal acceptance.Questions about the cannabispsychosis link have persisted for years.The available data on this subject is far from definitiveparticularly with regard to any potential cause-and-effect relationship, notes Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML, a U.S. organization that advocates marijuana legalization for adults.For instance, increased cannabis use by the public has not been followed by a proportional rise in diagnoses of schizophrenia or psychosis.In 2015 the Toronto-based International Center for Science in Drug Policy issued a reportState of the Evidence: Cannabis Use and Regulationthat detailed this discrepancy.It cited a British study that estimated the significant rise in pot use should have produced, between 1990 and 2010, a 29 percent increase in schizophrenia cases among men and 12 percent among women.But according to other data, during the time when usage was thought to have grown most (1996 to 2005), the number of new schizophrenia cases remained stable or declined.These findings strongly suggest that cannabis use does not cause schizophrenia, the centers report notes.Another speaker at the Berlin conferenceBeat Lutz, a neurochemist at the University of Mainzdescribed the mechanisms by which the drug might produce deleterious effects in a young persons brain.The main psychoactive compound in marijuana, THC, disrupts the normal flow of signals among brain cellsa process normally regulated by chemicals called endocannabinoids.These compounds occur naturally in the body and activate a type of cellular docking site (called the cannabinoid type 1, or CB1, receptor) to act like a circuit breaker, Lutz says, keeping the brains level of signaling activity or excitation within a normal range.Too little endocannabinoid signaling results in excessive excitation of the nervous system, and this can promote anxiety disorders, impulsivity and epilepsy.Too much activity has the opposite effect and can promote depression, for example.Upsetting the information flows regulated by the endocannabinoid system has also been linked to psychosis.THC acts differently from endocannabinoids.It does not break down rapidly in the body the way natural endocannabinoids do, Lutz says, noting this sustained activation causes serious wide-ranging disturbances in the brain.Low doses of THC may reduce anxiety but high doses can heighten it, and chronic overstimulation of CB1 receptors by THC shuts down the bodys natural endocannabinoid signaling system by eliminating the CB1 receptors from neurons, Lutz adds.In addition, new research reveals mitochondriathe organelles within cells that generate energy for cellular metabolismalso have CB1 receptors.THC inhibits mitochondrial activity, reducing the cells vital energy supply, he says, citing a 2016 paper published in Nature.Perhaps most critically, he believes THCs disruption of endocannabinoid signaling in the early teen brain can hinder key neurodevelopmental processes that involve the CB1 receptors, thereby impairing brain communication permanently.Recent research on marijuana is starting to address the type of questions that might ordinarily be revealed via lengthy clinical trials during the development of a pharmaceutical.This process is occurring as the legalization bandwagon picks up speed.Marijuana is increasingly taking a place alongside Johnny Walker and Yellow Tail on the credenzano longer stashed away in a drawer within.In the U.S. marijuana use among high school seniors is more common than smoking cigarettes.The researchers at the Berlin conference discussed the need to alert the public about worrying new findings.As physicians, we need to say clearly what is happening and what is not, says Peter Falkai, a psychiatrist at the Munich Center for Neurosciences at Ludwig Maximilian University.Looking into the data, clearly yes, the data show increasing risk of psychosis.
Humans May Be Influencing Bird Evolution in Their Backyards:::::Evolution is one of natures greatest shows.From humble beginnings, it gave rise to fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds and mammals; it took the ancestors of apes and sculpted them into humans.These grand spectacles play out across millions of years, dazzling us with their before-and-after shots.But if we look closely, we can sometimes glimpse evolution unfolding in real time.And often we are surprised to find ourselves directing the show.A new study finds that great tits, a type of songbird, in the U.K. have evolved longer beaks over the past couple of decades, possibly because of a British pastime that has become massively popular since the 19th centurybird feeding.The findings, reported Thursday in Science, represent a possible empirical example of an organism evolving directly in response to human activities.The great tit, a black-and-yellow bird with a call like a squeaky seesaw, is common across Europe and is a frequent visitor to bird feeders.Biologists have long known U.K. great tits had longer beaks than those in continental Europe, but the reason for this difference was unclear.Now a group of Dutch and British researchers tracked the variation down to the birds genes and found natural selection at work.They first embarked on an ambitious investigation into the genomesthe complete sets of genesof 2,322 great tits from across the U.K. and the Netherlands.They flagged spots in the genomes between the two populations that were most different, which turned out to be the same spots that were the least different among the genomes of individual U.K. birds.Favored genes had nudged their way into these areas and, with time, pushed out most other genes that might have been found therea clear indication natural selection was at work, according to the researchers.They then labeled around 30 of the genes that seemed to oust all the others and scanned the scientific literature to figure out what role these genes played in other organisms.It turns out many of them are involved in human skull development and bill length in Darwins finchesGalpagos Islands birds that served as the famed biologists most famous subjects.The scientists suspected these genes could be linked to beak length, so they measured this anatomical feature in U.K. great tits.They found birds with that handful of favored genes, as expected, tended to have longer beaks than their continental counterparts in the Netherlands.The researchers further backed their findings using historical data.Ecologists at the University of Oxford, which co-authored the study, had been measuring beak lengths for 26 years, or around 13 generations for the songbird.Even just in the last 30 years weve seen the beak lengths getting longer in the U.K. population, says senior author Jon Slate, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Sheffield.And he thinks the evolutionary time frame is even longer than that.The researchers then scoured museum collections and looked at specimens of the birds collected since the 1920s to confirm their findings.Something about the U.K. environment was giving longer beaks an edge.It was a fishing expedition, says David Reznick, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Riverside, who did not take part in the study.They have done a good job of identifying the groups of genes that are associated with variation in [beak length].The signature of natural selection in their data, he adds, is quite strong.Leif Andersson, a geneticist at Uppsala University in Sweden, also not part of the work but who has conducted research on the genes that drove natural selection in Darwins finches, was impressed by the amount of data the team generated.We have only used hundreds of birds and identified this association [of evolving bill length], he says.They have used thousands.Human Touch What makes a bird with a long beak better than a bird with a short beak?Slate asks.There are documented instancessuch as studies on Darwins finchesthat show evolution of beak length results from differences in food availability.Peter and Rosemary Grant, a famous pair of evolutionary biologists and emeritus professors at Princeton University, for example, spent 40 years observing Darwins finches in the Galpagos.They found that finch beak size evolved based on competition for dwindling food sources in extreme climatic conditions such as drought.But the U.K. great tits are not known to have different diets than those in the rest of Europe, according to the researchers.After consulting with some ecologists, the team decided to test whether this natural selection had something to do with bird feeders.After all, according to a 2015 study, around half of U.K. homes feed birds in their gardens.And the U.K. spends twice as much on birdseed than the whole of continental Europe, according to a study cited by the researchers.Ecologists in the new study gauged the fitness of great tits by counting the number of chicks the birds reared to maturity in artificial nests.They found that in the U.K. the great tits with the genes for shorter beaks had fewer surviving chicks per year than those with longer ones.According to Slate, although the difference is small this probably means the latter were better able to bring seeds back to their young.The researchers also tagged the birds to count the amount of times they visited the feeders, finding longer-beaked ones showed up at the feeders more often than their more stubby-beaked cousins.So they seem to be better at exploiting that resource, says Slate, a bird feeder himself.If that part of the story is true, it tells us that humans have actually been the selective agents, which [have] caused this evolutionary change in great tits.But thats just an if.Slate cautions this is just a hypothesis and needs much more data to be confirmed.It is also unclear what it is about bird feeders that give longer-beaked great tits an advantage.Reznick agrees that more data is needed, but he is optimistic this idea is testable.There may be other explanations for what theyre saying but theyve done a good job of making a case for [the bird feeders] as one possible explanationand it really is a testable hypothesis, he says.Yet the idea humans may be influencing evolution is not new.One well-known example involves moths that evolved a darker coloration as camouflage in the soot-covered backdrop of the industrial revolution.A human influence on beak-size evolution is not new, we have seen signs of this in finches on an inhabited island (Santa Cruz) of the Galpagos, but an association with bird feeders is new as far as I know, Princetons Grant wrote in an e-mail.Speaking of the human touch on evolution, I would point to current global warming, partly caused by human activities, and the likelihood that animal and plant populations are undergoing evolutionary change by natural selection in response, he added.Slate hopes to pursue more studies that may help answer the mysterious influence of the bird feeders but he does note the difficulty of drawing major conclusions because of the lack of literature on how widespread the practice is.He also hopes to extend the range of study to the rest of Europe to understand how one species has adapted so well to very different environments.All the scientists agree long-term studies like this are valuable in seeingin real timea process that continuously alters history and the ecosystem.In the public perception, when we say evolution they expect that youre going to go outside and see a different world, Reznick says.But even these beak lengths only differed by a fraction of a millimeter.He adds: The noticeable things are sort of the large-scale version of the smaller things that are going on all the time, and that evolution is probably happening in organisms all around us all the timebut you need to know how to look for it.
Engulfed in Opioid Deaths, Ohio Turns to Science:::::Ohio holds a singular place in America's opioid scourge.In 2014 it suffered more overdose deaths than any other state.Since then such fatalities have only swelled, with 4,050 in 2016a 32.8 percent increase from the previous year, according to health officials.Fueled by prescription painkillers as well as heroin and fentanyl, the epidemic has overrun city morgues, forced thousands of children into foster care and turned Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, into the overdose capital of the U.S. Last year Ohio poured nearly $1 billion into fighting the crisis through prevention, treatment and law enforcement.But the state keeps surpassing its own grim statistics.Exasperated, local authorities have begun confronting the disaster from another angletechnology.In May the state signed off on Gov.John Kasich's request to invest $20 million in accelerating high-tech scientific measures to address the situation.Universities, hospitals and medical device manufacturers are now vying for grant money with proposals that include implantable therapeutic meshes and systems that deliver electric nerve jolts.Matthew Becker, an associate dean at the University of Akron's Department of Polymer Science, says personal outrage drove him to apply for grant money.When his wife underwent minor laparoscopic surgery earlier this year, she was prescribed roughly 60 doses of the opioid painkiller oxycodone for postoperative pain, at a cost of $6.The quantity of pills she was prescribed, at such a low cost, dismayed Becker.After they threw away the unused drugs, Becker began to wonder about nonopioid alternatives for pain management.So in May his research teamwhich has developed degradable polymers already used in procedures such as hernia repairsbegan examining whether it could use this material as an implantable and more effective platform for existing pain medication.To Beckers knowledge, the technology has never been used this way before.The teams challenge has been to load and stabilize a sufficient dose of nonopioid pain reliever in a polymer film, and to control the medications delivery using an implantable mesh.After successful in vitro testing, Beckers team is seeking grant funding from the state to test the technology on animals.He hopes to have proof of concept on a small rodent model by December, and to deliver a functional submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by next summer.Meanwhile SPR Therapeuticsa company that makes an electric peripheral nerve stimulation system for pain reliefhas already received FDA clearance for its product.A wire from the device pierces the skin near a nerve that is sending pain feedback to the brain, according to Maria Bennett, CEO and founder of SPR Therapeutics.The wire, she says, is connected to a wearable generator that stimulates the nerve, calming its overactivity.Bennett says clinical studies of the device have shown other benefits.Once the stimulation is turned off we see a carryover or sustained pain relief effect, she says.Its not 100 percent.I would say about 75 percent of the patients we see have the carryover effect.SPR is preparing to sell the product commercially, and has submitted a proposal for Ohio grant money to fund more of its work.The grant would help enroll patients with lower back pain into those studies.High-tech approaches to treating chronic painespecially nerve painhave bloomed in recent years, according to Einar Ottestad, an assistant professor at Stanford University Medical Centers Systems Neuroscience and Pain Laboratory.In terms of the chronic pain population, were certainly getting better at managing them without opioids, Ottestad says.And certainly theres been a change in our practice.At Stanford, I would say we prescribe much less opioids now than we did even a few years ago.But Ottestadwho is not involved in the SPR project or Beckers researchcautions the opioid crisis is primarily a behavioral and mental health issue.He notes that chronic pain technology, no matter how advanced, will struggle to eliminate opioid use among people already addicted to the drug, largely due to overprescription.Becker and Bennett readily agree.Overprescribing has been widely blamed for the opioid epidemic in Ohio.After the state sued five pharmaceutical companies in May for deceptive claims about the addictiveness of its products, it was revealed that physicians prescribed 3.8 billion opioid pills between 2011 and 2015 in Ohio, a state with about 11.6 million people.In Ross County, one of the hardest-hit areas in the U.S., physicians prescribed over 1.6 million opioid pillsor 20.7 pills per residentin 2015 alone.Nationally, prescription opioid sales nearly quadrupled from 1999 to 2014, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Protection.For those already gripped by addiction, science may hold promise in the form of medication-assisted treatment, or MAT.For example, physicians generally laud the semisynthetic opioid buprenorphine for helping addicts confront opioid withdrawal.An optimal dose works as a partial agonist for opioid receptors in the brain, meaning it helps control cravings and withdrawal symptoms without producing the euphoric high that drives addiction.But for it to work effectively, patients using it need to stick to a strict prescription schedule.To help patients stay on the medication, the FDA last year approved Probuphinea long-acting implant that consists of buprenorphine attached to a polymer and delivers low doses over a six-month period.Some physicians, however, caution against labeling buprenorphine a magic pill.Much depends on how patients use it, says Gabriel Schonwald, a substance disorder specialist and professor at Stanford, who is not involved in the Ohio research.Schonwald says buprenorphine is often sold on the streetand can deliver a potent high in some doses.As for the Probuphine implant, Schonwald worries that addicts will rely too heavily on it and dismiss checkups, counseling and psychotherapy.To me the biggest issue is the spiritual evolution, he says.It involves bio, psycho, social and not just treating one aspect of it.Its the same drug, but its just sitting in your body somewhereand youve checked out.
Scientists Zero In on a New Target for Obesity:::::For the 35 million American adults who are battling obesity, the age-old advice to improve diet and exercise often falls short.And surgical interventions that reduce stomach sizealthough effectivecan prove risky.But there may be another alternative: flooding the body with a protein that makes an individual prefer low-fat food and feel full longer, and that activates neurons responsible for regulating the bodys energy intake.Such a simple fix may sound too good to be true, but the approach has shown promise in experiments with mice, rats and monkeys.If the therapy can be improved and shown to work well in humans, it could be an entirely new way to help battle obesity, diabetes and related conditions.Currently there are a few federally approved weight loss and insulin control agents on the market, but they appear to work along different pathways than the new therapy does.They can also cause serious side effects, and are still not as effective as surgical weight-loss interventions.In new work spearheaded by pharmaceutical company Amgen, researchers took advantage of a protein linked with multiple metabolic disorders to try to make thinner, healthier animals.In multiple species, lean creatures appear to have naturally higher concentrations of the protein GDF15 than their stouter counterparts, the Amgen team noted.So they tried to boost levels of the compound in obese animals via gene therapygiving rodents injections of a form of the gene that would cause their bodies to produce more of the protein than they would have otherwise.In the short-term that seemed to help make the animals healthier, but their bodies cleared the substance too quickly for it to produce a lasting effect.So the researchers decided to bypass the gene therapy approach and engineer two stable, longer-lasting forms of GDF15 that they injected directly into the animals.Weekly injections of either of these engineered molecules slimmed down rodents and monkeys without causing any apparent serious side effects, the scientists report Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine.After about a month of weekly treatments with one of the two engineered forms of GDF15, treated rodents sometimes lost as much as 17 or 24 percent of their body weight, depending on what molecule they received, says senior author Murielle Vniant, who studies metabolic disorders as a lead researcher at Amgen.The treatment also helped monkeys shave pounds.In the most extreme cases, the treated monkeys lost 5 or 10 percent of their body weight during that same time period, she says.Meanwhile, untreated animals continued to gain weight.We were very surprised to see improvements in body weight, glucose and insulin levels as well as triglycerides, she adds.Exactly how these weekly GDF15 treatments work remains murky.As a whole, the findings suggest the proteins act on the gutbrain axisthe collection of two-way nerve and chemical pathways that communicate between the digestive tract and the brainand that GDF15 might be a clinical target for metabolic disorders.The specifics have yet to be ironed out, but the Amgen team has uncovered a few clues in their rodent studies: They found treated animals had increased activation of certain neurons in the brain that detect blood sugar, and this may have helped them sense when it was time to stop eating.The treated rodents stomachs also took longer to empty outsuggesting they may have felt full longer and that GDF15 may block the transmission of signals from the vagus nerve, which connects the brain and digestive tract.Finally they found animals receiving the therapy seemed to prefer a lower-fat diet than those that did notalthough the researchers cannot yet explain why taste preferences changed.Some experts were cautiously optimistic about the findings.This group really seemed to go a long way toward identifying what may be an interesting new approach to treatment, and thats fantastic, says Paul Kenny, chair of the Department of Neuroscience at Mount Sinai Health System, who was not involved with the Amgen work.This is exciting, he adds, but the key will be [determining] if its safe in humans.If this work makes it into human trials, he notes, two areas to watch will be whether there is any significant muscle mass loss with treatmentbecause treated animals lost some lean mass alongside their fatand if the therapy causes any serious side effects such as depression or mood changes, which have been concerns with some other proposed weight-loss products.Vniant declined to comment on Amgens next steps or potential timeline for clinical trials in humans but says the company plans to continue its work in this area.Clearly, she says, GDF15 is a very interesting protein.
AI versus AI: Self-Taught AlphaGo Zero Vanquishes Its Predecessor:::::Earlier this year the AlphaGo artificial intelligence program ended humanitys 2,500 years of supremacy at the board game go.Not content with its 30 victory over the worlds top player, AlphaGo creator DeepMind Technologies on Wednesday unveiled an enhanced versionAlphaGo Zerowhich the company says soundly thumped its predecessor program in an AI face-off, winning all 100 games played.But perhaps even more significant than these victories is how AlphaGo Zero became so dominant.Unlike the original AlphaGo, which DeepMind trained over time using large quantities of human knowledge and supervision, the new systems algorithm taught itself to master the game.AI lets computers recognize faces, make online purchasing recommendations and even parallel park cars.Computers gain these abilities from learning algorithms, written by humans who feed massive amounts of training data into an artificial neural network (named for its ability to process information in a way that is loosely based on the brains nerve cell structure).This process is called machine learning.In AlphaGos case this involved analyzing millions of moves made by human go experts and playing many, many games against itself to reinforce what it learned.AlphaGo defeated Ke Jiethe worlds top human go playerin May.In March 2016 it beat another top master, Lee Sedol, with the aid of multiple neural networks whose computers required 48 tensor processing units (TPUs)specialized microchips designed specifically for neural network training.AlphaGo Zeros training involved four TPUs and a single neural network that initially knew nothing about go.The AI learned without supervisionit simply played against itself, and soon was able to anticipate its own moves and how they would affect a games outcome.This technique is more powerful than previous versions of AlphaGo because it is no longer constrained by the limits of human knowledge, according to a blog post authored by DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis and David Silver, who leads the companys reinforcement learning research group.(DeepMind is a division of Alphabet, Inc., Googles parent company.)One problem with AI that always relies on human knowledge is that such information may be too expensive, too unreliable or simply nonexistent in certain situations.If similar techniques can be applied to other structured problems such as protein folding, reducing energy consumption or searching for revolutionary new materials, the resulting breakthroughs have the potential to positively impact society, the blog post says.AlphaGo Zero even devised its own unconventional strategies.The game go is typically played using stones colored either black or white on a board with a 19 by 19 grid.Each player places stones with the objective of surrounding an opponents.In training, AlphaGo Zero discovered, played and ultimately learned to prefer a series of new joseki [corner sequence] variants that were previously unknown, says DeepMind spokesperson Jon Fildes.Go games typically start with plays in the grids corners, allowing one player to gain a better overall position on the board.Like move 37 in the second game against Lee Sedol, these moments of algorithmic inspiration give us a glimpse of the creativity of AlphaGo and the potential of AI, the spokesperson adds.An Young-gil, a South Korean professional go player of 8-dan rank (9-dan is the highest), singled out move 37 as rare and intriguing play shortly after the March 2016 match.DeepMinds study describes a very impressive technical result; and both their ability to do itand their ability to train the system in 40 days, on four TPUsis remarkable, says Oren Etzioni, chief executive officer of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2), an organization that Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen formed in 2014 to focus on AIs potential benefits.While many have used [reinforcement learning] before, the technical aspects of the work are novel.AlphaGo Zeros success bodes well for AIs mastery of games, Etzioni says.Still, I think it would be a mistake to believe that weve learned something general about thinking and about learning for general intelligence, he adds.This approach wont work in more ill-structured problems like natural-language understanding or robotics, where the state space is more complex and there isnt a clear objective function.Unsupervised training is the key to ultimately creating AI that can think for itself, Etzioni says, but more research is needed outside of the confines of board games and predefined objective functions before computers can really begin to think outside the box.
New VR Tech Aims to Take Surround-Sound to the Next Level:::::Virtual realitys goal is to fully immerse a person in a digital landscape, triggering the same kinds of physical and psychological reactions they would experience in the real world.In virtual reality (VR) parlance, this is called presencea mental state in which people recall VR experiences as if they had actually occurred.Computer graphics have improved dramatically in recent years, and advances in haptic, or touch, VR technology are beginning to allow users to feel sensations such as temperature, pressure and vibrations.For VR to really take hold of a person, however, a dynamic soundscape is essential.One of the most significant developments in VR sound is spatial audio, which is designed to mimic the pitch, volume, reverberation level and other audio cues the brain would expect during a real-world experience.With our hearing we can sense what happens in those directions around us where we cannot see, [such as] car tires screeching behind us, and reactjump out of the waywithout the need for visual input, says Kai Havukainen, senior product manager for audio at Nokia Technologies, which is developing spatial audio technology for some of the companys devices.Spatial audio allows VR programmers to create content whose sounds can come from any direction, says Tom Smurdon, audio design manager for Oculus VR, which is owned by Facebook.Theres wind in the trees above your head, theres the sound of water coming from a river at your feet and now theres sound from somebody sitting right next to you, whispering in your ear, he says.Everybody is still learning how powerful spatial audio can be.Shifting Soundscapes Spatial audio, in its most basic form, emulates how we perceive sound in the real world, says Brian Yessian, chief creative officer and partner of sound design company Yessian Music.If we are in a room and someone in front of me is speaking and I turn my head to the left, then my right ear is going to pick up more of the voice and my left ear will [hear] less, he explains.Or if something falls behind me, I know to look back because our audio senses pick up on the fact that it was actually behind me.Spatial audio achieves that effect in VR using software algorithms that manipulate a programs sound wave frequencies, creating audio levels that become louder or softer depending on the users distance from a virtual object.The sound also shifts from one headphone speaker to the other as the person moves their head from side to side or as the virtual objects move on their own.Makers of VR headsets have begun to embrace immersive soundscapes as a way to improve the quality of the virtual experience.The new Nokia 8 smartphone, for example, includes OZO Audio software that uses the devices multiple microphones to record video that has surround-sound qualities when heard through headphones.Spatial sound is also a major feature of the Microsofts new Windows Mixed Reality head-mounted displays, which go on sale later this month.Mixed reality is essentially a hybrid of VR and augmented reality that relies on cameras and other sensors to integrate digital objects into the real world or real objects to be embedded in a virtual world.Microsoft already makes a mixed-reality headset with spatial audio called the HoloLens, but that device is targeted at software developers and corporate users.The HoloLens price also starts at $3,000, several times the cost of the consumer-targeted Mixed Reality headset.Microsoft has also made spatial audio part of Windows 10, which means any device running that version of the operating system will be able to play dynamic sound when headphones are used.The new Windows Mixed Reality and HoloLens headsets offer very different user experiences.The HoloLens has a transparent display that projects vivid holograms on top of real-world environments and is a fully self-contained computer that allows the user to move around without being restricted by cables.The new Mixed Reality headset plugs into a PC and has an opaque display similar to that of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.Microsoft developed its spatial audio algorithms after studying different ear shapes and the way in which a persons brain via the inner and outer ears locates the source of a sound in three dimensions.The goal was to better understand how they affect a persons sound perception.Weve also done a lot of work in modeling how audio bounces and reverberates off the environment, says Noel Cross, Microsoft principal software engineering lead, who has worked on both the HoloLens and the new Mixed Reality devices.Different size rooms give you different levels of comfort as a human, and if things dont match your expectations in terms of [what] they should sound like, you instinctively feel quite uncomfortable.Cross and his team took those lessons into account when designing the interface for Microsofts new consumer headset.Instead of presenting users with a start menu or screen when they don the device, they begin their experience in a virtual house located on a cliff by the sea, where they are then free to wander its three different floors.Users interact with that setting much the same way they would stare at pictures or TV screens in the rooms of a real houseand for that to make sense, Cross says the developers had to get the sound element just right.Oculus likewise has its users begin in the same locationsort of like a VR home pageeach time they use the device.The Sweet Spot Earlier efforts at 3-D audioa precursor to spatial audiowere very limited in that they were designed for PCs in the 1990s, Cross says.The speakers were typically located on either side of the computer monitor, and the sound was immersive if the users sat in a sweet-spot zone in the middle and did not move, he says.Even with headphones in earlier experiences, as you moved your head, the sounds wouldnt stay locked in the context of the world but would stay fixed relative to your head, Cross adds.Given that humans are hardwired to pay attention to sound and instinctively use it to map their surroundings, find points of interest and assess potential danger, it is hard to overstate the usefulness of spatial audio for VR.As virtual environments move to the mainstream in education, training and health careincluding the treatment of phobias and trauma via virtual reality exposure therapyusers will want to fully engage their senses.
Saving the Endangered Cuban Crocodile:::::The critically endangered Cuban crocodile (Crocodylus rhombifer) has many peculiar qualities, but perhaps the most intriguing one is its curiosity.For biologists conducting fieldwork in Zapata Swamp, Cubas largest wetland and the only place in the world where the species is found, this is a notable trait.The crocs will investigate a campsite if nothing prevents them.Protective netting is deployed to keep them out, although not always successfully.The animal comes inside the camp looking for a warm place to sleep beneathreferring to human bodies in hammocks, says Etiam Prez, a Cuban crocodile researcher and manager of the Zapata Swamp Captive Breeding Farm.Prez is speaking to Scientific American at the farm, beside an open-air pen that holds hundreds of young, brilliant, black-and-yellow Cuban crocodiles under the fierce Caribbean sun.The tropical facility claims more than 4,000 specimens of what Prez calls the most beautiful crocodile in the world.Like most Cuban operations it is government-owned, and was founded 57 years ago by Fidel Castro himself.A large black-and-white photograph of Castro hangs on a wall of the facility, complete with a lengthy quotation from the late autocrat praising Cuban crocodile conservation.The animal, Prez says, holds a kind of political and symbolic weight in Cuba, especially in in the south-central Matanzas Province, where Zapata Swamp is located.But the crocodiles vaunted status has not prevented its decline.Overhunting in the 19th and 20th centuries coupled with deforestation from increased development in modern times has reduced its population to historic lows.Scientists estimate only around 3,000 wild crocs are left, although even that number comes largely from guesswork.Now scientists are scratching their heads over another potential threat to these reptiles: interbreeding with American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus).Is Hybridization to Blame?The most widely distributed crocodilian species in the Americas, C. acutus, is native to Cuba (as well as the U.S.) and, unlike C. rhombifer, flourishing across the country.Scientists say the two species are morphologically, ecologically and behaviorally distinct from each other.Increased hybridization of the two poses an existential risk to the much less common Cuban species via a gradual erosion of its genetic identity.For conservation-minded scientists, this is worrying indeed.The concern is that widespread hybridization might eliminate the unique Cuban crocodile through [such] genetic swamping, says George Amato, a conservation genomics biologist at the American Museum of Natural History.Yoamel Milin-Garca, a biologist at the University of Havana, first published data on the hybridization epidemic in 2015.He analyzed scale clippings of 227 wild crocodiles and 137 farm-raised ones, finding that 49.1 percent of the wild specimens were hybrids and 16.1 percent of captive ones possessed mixed genes.The degree of hybridization that were seeing seems much higher than we would have predicted or imagined, Amato says.Some people think its the biggest threat to these animals, he adds.But nobody knows for sure.Hybridization could be a frightening species eraser.It could also be a normal historical process, says Amato, who has collaborated with Cuban biologists, including Milin-Garca and Prez, on crocodile research there since the 1990s.Scientists simply do not have enough evolutionary or biological data yet to decide which interpretation is the right one.Conservation Challenges The reason for this is partly logistical: The 300-square-kilometer area of Zapata where Cuban crocodiles reside is famously difficult to access and there has not been sufficient survey work to gain a complete picture of what is happening there; for Cuban crocodile research, foreign assistance is critical.Local scientists, in part due to the U.S. embargo against Cuba, possess scant resources.Milin-Garca is only able to conduct his work on hybridization because he uses advanced technologies available in Canadian and U.S. labs.Even the Zapata breeding farm must supplement its meager government income with other means.Ticket sales from tourists are a major funding source.Visitors, mostly Cubans, tour the facility and for a few Cuban pesos (about 50 cents) they can feed the reptiles raw meat with a stick.The farm also slaughters a small number of its crocodiles for their meat, which is sold to designated restaurants; it is the only organization in the country legally permitted to do so.Although perhaps strange-sounding to U.S. environmentalists, Prez stresses that such business brings in good money for the breeding farm.Alongside breeding-and-release, there is also an ongoing public outreach program that aims to reduce poaching and crocodile consumption through informational posters hung in schools and restaurants.The farm also employs six former poachers as an alternative employment to illegal hunting.The facility, which takes pains to produce only non-hybridized crocodiles, acts as a stopgap in the fight against extinctionbut genetic mixing complicates conservation planning.Should genetic purity be the ultimate goal?Or should hybridization be allowed to run its course, possibly resulting in a species better adapted to a changing environment?Complicating things further is recent evidence suggesting American crocodiles in Cuba are related more closely to the Cuban croc than to their own counterparts in the continental U.S., a genetic connection Milin-Garca calls a sister relationship.Meanwhile American crocodiles, which abound across Cuba, are not threatened by hybridization, Amato says.Where hybridization is increased, its not that were seeing Cuban genes going to American crocsits mostly that its American genes going into [animals in] the one small area in Zapata where the Cuban crocodiles live, he says.The Future of Cuban Crocs There is a plan, however, to maintain a genetically pure population of Cuban crocodiles by breeding the species and then releasing them into the wild.The first release of 100 crocs happened last year.The latest one, conducted in June in conjunction with the New York Citybased Wildlife Conservation Society, involved 10 animals.All the genetically pure Cuban crocodiles were let go in areas of the Zapata Swamp that are free of American crocodilesthe latter mostly stick to brackish waters whereas Cubans need freshwater.Another such release is currently in the works, Prez says.Amato and Milin-Garca have also begun a survey of Cuba as a whole that involves sequencing the genomes of various crocodile species, hoping to get a better understanding of the genetic relationships among them.This, in turn, will inform future conservation planning.Well get a better sense of, with animals that were calling hybrids: Does that hybridization look like a phenomenon that happened thousands of years ago or something thats very recent?Amato says.In conjunction with these efforts he and his colleagues will also be analyzing ancient crocodile remains.As Prez puts it back at the farm, surrounded by sagging palms and sunbathing crocs, If you understand the past, you can predict the future.
Gravitational Wave Astronomers Hit Mother Lode:::::Ushering in the beginning of a new era in astronomy and physics, scientists on Monday announced they have for the first time detected the spacetime ripples known as gravitational waves from the collision of two neutron stars.Streaming in from the sky over the Indian Ocean on August 17, the waves registered at the twin detecting stations of the U.S.-based Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) as well as a European detector called Virgo located in Italy.This is the fifth time in the last two years that scientists have confirmed spotting such waves, a phenomenon that Einstein first predicted more than a century agoand that led to this years Nobel Prize in Physics for three of LIGOs leaders.All of the previously detected gravitational waves, however, came from merging pairs of black holes.These objects are so dense that light cannot escape their grasp, making such mergers essentially invisible to normal telescopes despite the prodigious gravitational waves they generate in the final moments of their incredibly violent death spirals.Without a much-larger network of gravitational wave observatories, astronomers cannot pin down the precise locations of merging black holes, let alone deeply investigate them.But neutron-star mergers begin with objects that in comparison with black holes can be featherweights.A neutron star is the highly compressed core of an expired massive star, and is formed in the aftermath of a supernova explosion.Its gravitational field is strong enough to squeeze and break down an entire suns worth of matter into a city-size orb of neutrons, making it less a true star and more an atomic nucleus as big as Manhattan.But a neutron stars gravity is still too weak to trap light.So the flash from two of them slamming together can escape into the cosmos, producing not just gravitational waves but also one of the universes most brilliant fireworks displays for anyone who cares to look.In this case, after the initial chirp of gravitational waves signaling the onset of the merger, the fireworks consisted of a two-second-long gamma-ray burst (GRB) followed by a weeks-long, multi-wavelength afterglowand anyone proved to be nearly every astronomer and physicist on Earth who had found out about the event.Julie McEnery, project scientist for the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, which spotted the GRB, called August 17 the most exciting morning of the nine-year Fermi mission.The astronomers working with the LIGO and Virgo physicists had been sworn to secrecy.But the sheer volume of follow-up observations around the world unavoidably spawned public rumors, now confirmed, about a global campaign to track the collision and its aftermath.The resulting frenzy of new observations and theories is the most potent example yet of multi-messenger astronomy, an emerging field in which light, gravitational waves and subatomic particles emitted from astrophysical cataclysms are collected and studied in unison.In an overwhelmingly mammoth series of papers published simultaneously across several journals, researchers are linking the latest event to a vast range of phenomena and providing fresh insights on everything from fundamental nuclear physics to the large-scale evolution of the universe.Among other things, the merger gave observers a front-row seat at the birth of a black hole, which the colliding neutron stars likely produced.The discovery that most glitters, though, is smoking-gun evidence that neutron star mergersrather than run-of-the-mill supernovaeare the cosmic crucibles that forge the universes heavy elements: substances including uranium, platinum and gold.So it looks as if the radioactive pile in a nuclear reactor, the catalytic converter in your car and, yes, the precious metal in your wedding band may all come from the smashed-up innards of the universes smallest, densest and most exotic starsor at least whatever fraction can escape without falling into a mergers resulting black hole.The result could solve an ongoing debate over the cosmic origins of heavy elements that has possessed theorists for more than half a century.The bulk of the universes hydrogen and helium was produced in the first moments after the big bang, and most of the lighter elementsoxygen, carbon, nitrogen and so onwere formed from nuclear fusion in stars.But the origin of the heaviest elements had been a lingering question until now.We have hit the mother lode!says Laura Cadonati, an astrophysicist at Georgia Institute of Technology and LIGOs deputy spokesperson.This is really the first time we have multi-messenger detection of a single astrophysical event, where gravitational waves are telling us the story of what happened before the cataclysm and the electromagnetic emissions are telling us what happened after.Although presently inconclusive, Cadonati says, analyses of the events gravitational waves could eventually reveal details of how matter sloshes around within neutron stars as they merge, giving researchers a new way to study these bizarre objects and learn just how big they can get before collapsing into a black hole.Relatedly, Cadonati notes, there was a mysterious gap of about two seconds between the end of the gravitational-wave chirp and the onset of the GRBan interval, perhaps, in which the structural integrity of the combined neutron stars briefly resisted the inevitable collapse.For many researchers the breakthrough has been a long time coming.My dream has come true, says Szabolcs Marka, an astrophysicist and LIGO team member at Columbia University who was an early proponent of multi-messenger astronomy in the late 1990s.Back then, he recalls, he was seen as that crazy guy trying to prepare for follow-up observations on gravitational wavesa phenomenon that was then still decades away from direct detection.Now, I and others feel vindicated, Marka says.We have studied this system of colliding neutron stars in a very diverse set of messengers.We have seen it in gravitational waves, in gamma rays, in ultraviolet, visible and infrared light, and in x-rays and radio waves.This is the revolutionthe evolutionof astronomy that I first hoped for 20 years ago.France Crdova, director of the National Science Foundation, or NSF (the U.S. federal agency that supplied the bulk of LIGOs funding), calls the observatorys latest achievement a historic moment in science that could not have come without decades of sustained governmental support for a variety of astrophysical observatories.The detection of gravitational waves, from the first short chirp heard round the world to this latest, longer chirp, not only validates the kind of high-risk, high-reward investments that the NSF makes but also spurs us to want to do more, Crdova says.My hope is that the NSF will continue to support innovators and innovations that will transform knowledge, and inspire many generations to come.The Golden Opportunity After the initial detections of the mergers gravitational waves and its subsequent GRB (the latter of which was immediately observed by the Fermi and Integral space telescopes), the race was on to find the collisions sourceand hopefully its afterglowin the sky.Within hours multiple teams had marshaled available telescopes to stare at the region where LIGOs and Virgos scientists had calculated the source must be: a swath of the heavens spanning 31 square degrees and containing hundreds of galaxies.(Using LIGO alone, Cadonati says, the search would have been like looking for the glimmer of a gold ring in the Pacific.With the addition of a third data point from Virgo, she says, the researchers could properly triangulate the sources position, reducing the search to something more like seeking a gold ring somewhere in the Mediterranean.)The bulk of the observations took place at observatories in Chile as soon as the sun had set and the crucial region of sky drifted up over the horizon, with different teams adopting an assortment of search strategies.Some simply tiled the region with observations, moving methodically from one side to the other; others targeted subsets of galaxies that theories suggested would be most likely to host a neutron star merger.In short order, the targeting strategy won out.First to actually see the optical afterglow was Charles Kilpatrick, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz.He was sitting at his desk and sorting through images of selected galaxies at the behest of one of his coworkers at Santa Cruz, the astronomer Ryan Foley, who had helped organized the campaign.In the ninth image he examined, hastily taken and transmitted by colleagues half a world away using the meter-wide Swope Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, he saw it: a bright blue dot embedded in a giant elliptical galaxy, a 10-billion-year-old swarm of old, red stars about 120 million light-years away, nameless save for catalogue designations.Such galaxies are thought to be the main cosmic homes for neutron star mergers due to their advanced age, stellar density and relative lack of recent star formation.A side-by-side comparison with earlier images of that same galaxy showed no such dot; it was something new and recent.It very slowly dawned on me what a momentous occasion this was, Kilpatrick recalls, but I had tunnel vision at the time, just trying to work as quickly as possible.Kilpatrick notified other team members including Josh Simon, a Carnegie Observatories astronomer who rapidly obtained a confirmation image with one of the larger 6.5-meter twin Magellan telescopes in Chile.The blue dot was there, too.Over the course of an hour, Simon followed-up by measuring the dots spectrumthe various colors of light it emittedin a pair of five-minute exposures.Those spectra could prove useful for further study, he reasonedor if nothing else they could serve to ensure the blip was not an ordinary supernova or some other cosmic imposter.Meanwhile other teams had spotted the dot and were embroiled in follow-ups of their own.The rapid confirmation and spectra from Foleys team, however, clinched provenance for them.We had the first image of this, and we have the first identification of the source in this image, Simon says.Because we obtained both of those so early, we were also able to get the first spectrum for this mergerwhich no one else in Chile was able to do that first nightand then we issued the first announcement to the rest of the community.Those early spectral observations proved vital for subsequent analysis and solving several mysteries.They showed the mergers leftovers rapidly cooling, fading from a brilliant sapphire blue to a dim ruby in the sky.These readings were verified over the next few weeks of observation as the visible dot faded, its afterglow shifting and peaking in cooler, longer-wavelength infrared light.The general pattern of colors, cooling and expansion hews close to what was predicted years earlier by a number of theorists working independently of each other, most notably Brian Metzger of Columbia University and Dan Kasen of the University of California, Berkeley.In short, Metzger explains, what astronomers have seen from the mergers aftermath is something called a kilonova: an intense outburst of luminosity created by the ejection and radioactive decay of white-hot, neutron-rich material from the neutron stars.As the material expands and cools, most of its neutrons are captured by the nuclei of iron and other heavy elements left over as ashes from the neutron stars formative supernova explosion, creating even heavier elements.Over the course of about one second, as the ejecta are capturing these neutrons and expanding through space, one of these mergers will form the lower half of the periodic tablegold, platinum, uranium and so on, Metzger says.Near its conclusion, the kilonovas light dramatically shifts to infrared as the neutrons cascading through the ejecta forge the heaviest elements, which efficiently absorb visible light.Measuring the kilonovas spectral evolution, in turn, allows astronomers to estimate the amount of different elements it has produced.Edo Berger, who studies kilonovae at the HarvardSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics and oversaw many of the most ambitious follow-up observations of the merger, the event produced roughly 16,000 Earth masses worth of heavy elements.Thats everythinggold and platinum and uranium as well as all the weird ones you see just as letters on the periodic table and dont know their names, he says.As for the breakdown?For that, I dont think we have exact answers yet.Some theorists have suggested only a few tens of Earth masses of gold were made in the merger.Metzger, for his part, pegs the mergers gold output at roughly 100 Earth masses, with about three times more platinum and 10 times less uranium.In any case, when paired with updated statistical estimates of how often these mergers must occur, based in part on the latest detection, you get a high enough rate per galaxy per year to build up the elements that form our own solar system and the abundances we see in other stars, Metzger says.All that stuff we see, you can explain through these mergers.There may be other ways to make heavy elements, but you dont seem to need them.On average, he says, probably only one neutron star merger occurs in the Milky Way every 10,000 years.The Far Frontier Whats more, studying exactly how a mergers kilonova evolves can convey crucial information about how the collision unfolded.For instance, the light from this mergers initial emission was bluer than expected, suggesting to Metzger and others the kilonova was being viewed at an angle rather than face-on.In this scenario the early blue emission would come from a spherical shell or equatorial band of relatively neutron-poor material blown out from the neutron stars at perhaps 10 percent light-speed.The later, redder emission would emerge from very neutron-rich material ejected at two to three times higher speeds from the neutron stars poles as they collided, like toothpaste squirted from a tube.Paired with detailed x-ray and radio observations, this scenario helps explain the curious nature of the gamma-ray burst associated with the mergerthe closest GRB ever seen, but also one of the faintest.Short GRBs are thought to be bipolar jets of intense radiation spun up and ejected at nearly light-speed by churning magnetic fields within colliding neutron stars as they coalesce and collapse into a black hole.Viewed face-ondown the barrel of the GRB gun, so to speakthey are extremely bright.This is the case with the majority of such bursts that astronomers witness in the distant universe.But if they are tilted or inclined from our perspective they would appear rather dim and would only be detectable if they were relatively close, within several hundred million light-years.Using the wealth of data available from multi-messenger astronomy, then, astronomers could eventually determine the viewing angles of many kilonovae throughout the observable universe, making each one a more potent marker for measuring large-scale cosmic structure and evolution.This could allow scientists to better confront a mystery arguably deeper than the origin of the heavy elements: the baffling fact that the universe is not merely expanding, but accelerating at an ever-increasing rate under the influence of a kind of cosmos-spanning anti-gravity known as dark energy.Cosmologists hope to better understand dark energy by precisely measuring its effect on the universe, tracking objects in ever-more-distant regions of the universe to see how far away they are, and how fast they are moving, caught up in dark energys accelerating flow.But to do this they need reliable standard candles, objects with known brightness that can be used to calibrate this vast, sweeping view of spacetime.Daniel Holz, an astrophysicist and LIGO collaborator at the University of Chicago, has demonstrated how merging neutron stars could contribute to this effort.His work shows the strength of this latest mergers gravitational waves and the emissions of its kilonova can be used to calculate the local universes expansion rate.Limited to just one merger, the technique yields a value with significant uncertainties, albeit still in the ballpark of the expansion rate obtained from other methods.But in coming yearsas gravitational wave observatories and a new generation of large telescopes on the ground and in space work together to identify hundreds or even thousands of neutron star collisions per yearthose estimates will markedly improve.What all this means is that the gravitational waves from these mergers measured by LIGO and Virgo are complementary with modeling of kilonovae that suggests their inclination, their viewing angle, by their spectral evolution from blue to red, says Richard OShaughnessy, an astrophysicist and LIGO team member at Rochester Institute of Technology.That is a powerful synergy.If we know the inclination, we can know the distance, and that helps us with cosmology.What has been done here is a prototype for what we will be doing regularly in the future.If you think about it, the universe is sort of a cosmic particle collider, with neutron stars as the particles, OShaughnessy says.It throws them together, and we now have the opportunity to see what comes out.We are going to see so many of these in the coming yearshow many, I cant tell you, but people already describe it as a rain.This event is a Rosetta stone, giving us real data to connect disparate threads of astrophysics that previously only existed in the mind of theorists or as bits in a supercomputer simulation.It allows us to understand the cosmic abundance of heavy elements.It allows us to probe the squishiness of nuclear matter at extreme densities.It allows us to measure the expansion of the universe.These synergies set the agenda for all of high-energy astrophysics for decades to come, and are built on decades of investment.We are now reaping the reward, a mountain of gold 10 or a hundred times the mass of the Earth, that the universe just gave us.
Could AI Be the Future of Fake News and Product Reviews?:::::When Hillary Clintons new book What Happened debuted on Amazons Web site last month, the response was incredible.So incredible, that of the 1,600 reviews posted on the books Amazon page in just a few hours, the company soon deleted 900 it suspected of being bogus: written by people who said they loved or hated the book, but had neither purchased nor likely even read it.Fake product reviewsprompted by payola or more nefarious motivesare nothing new, but they are set to become a bigger problem as tricksters find new ways of automating online misinformation campaigns launched to sway public opinion.Amazon has deleted nearly 1,200 reviews of What Happened since it debuted on September 12, according to ReviewMeta, a watchdog site that analyzes consumer feedback for products sold on Amazon.com.ReviewMeta gained some notoriety last year when, after evaluating seven million appraisals across Amazon, it called out the online retailer for allowing incentivized reviews by people paid to write five-star product endorsements.Amazon later revised its Community Guidelines to ban incentivized reviews.Amazons deletions of so many appraisals for Clintons book caught ReviewMetas attention.The site gathers publicly available data on Amazon, including the number of stars a product receives, whether the writer is a verified buyer of the product and how active that person is on the site.Tommy Noonan, a programmer who founded ReviewMeta in May 2016, refrains from calling these reviews fake, given how politically loaded that term has become in the past year.Noonan prefers the term unnatural.There is no way to say with 100 percent certainty that a particular review is fake, he explains.Fortunately, only a handful of items sold on Amazons site have had review integrity problems comparable with What Happened.And those items were mostly Clinton booksalthough there was also a problem with a [Donald] Trump Christmas ornament that received an unusually large number of negative critiques, Noonan adds.AI to the Rescue?It is not as it easy as it might sound to churn out enough deceptive reviews to influence a product or services reputation on Amazon, Yelp or any other commerce site that relies heavily on consumer appraisals.Unlike fake news stories that someone writes and then tries to spread virally through social media, artificial reviews work only if they are manufactured in volume and posted to sites where a particular item is sold or advertised.They also need to be reasonably believablealthough proper spelling and punctuation seem to be optional.A group of University of Chicago researchers is investigating whether artificial intelligence could be used to automatically crank out bulk reviews that are convincing enough to be effective.Their latest experiment involved developing AI-based methods to generate phony Yelp restaurant evaluations.(Yelp is a popular crowdsourced Web site that has posted more than 135 million reviews covering about 2.8 million businesses since launching in July 2004).The researchers used a machine-learning technique known as deep learning to analyze letter and word patterns used in millions of existing Yelp reviews.Deep learning requires an enormous amount of computation and entails feeding vast data sets into large networks of simulated artificial neurons based loosely on the neural structure of the human brain.The Chicago teams artificial neural network generated its own restaurant critiquessome with sophisticated word usage patterns that made for realistic appraisals and others that would seem easy to spot, thanks to repeated words and phrases.But when the researchers tested their AI-generated reviews, they found that Yelps filtering softwarewhich also relies on machine-learning algorithmshad difficulty spotting many of the fakes.Human test subjects asked to evaluate authentic and automated appraisals were unable to distinguish between the two.When asked to rate whether a particular review was useful, the humans respondents replied in the affirmative to AI-generated versions nearly as often as real ones.We have validated the danger of someone using AI to create fake accounts that are good enough to fool current countermeasures, says Ben Zhao, a Chicago professor of computer science who will present the research with his colleagues next month at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security in Dallas.Like Yelp, Amazon and other Web sites use filtering software to detect suspicious reviews.This software is based on machine-learning techniques similar to those the researchers developed to write their bogus evaluations.Some filtering software tracks and analyzes data about reviewers such as their computers identifying internet protocol (IP) addresses or how often they post.Other defensive programs examine text for recurring words as well as phrases that may have been plagiarized from other Web sites.The researchers are not aware of any evidence AI is currently being used to game the online review system, Zhao saysbut if misinformation campaigners do turn to AI, he warns, it basically [becomes] an arms race between attacker and defender to see who can develop more sophisticated algorithms and better artificial neural networks to either generate or detect fake reviews.For that reason, Zhaos team is now developing algorithms that could be used as a countermeasure to detect fake reviewssimilar to the ones they created.The ability to build an effective defense requires knowing a neural networks limitations.For example, if it is designed to focus on creating content with correct grammar and vocabulary, it is more likely to overlook the fact that it is using the same words and phrases over and over.But [searching for such flaws] is just a short-term fix because more powerful hardware and larger data for training means that future AI models will be able to capture all these properties and be truly indistinguishable from human-authored content, Zhao says.Crowdturfing As AI matures it is not a stretch to suppose it will be used to corrupt online review systems that so many people turn to before opening their wallets.But for now a more common and human-based approach to generating large numbers of fake critiquessuch as those for Clintons bookis called crowdturfing.In general, crowdturfing marketplaces offer payment to people willing to help attack review systems, social media and search engines.These efforts work like an evil Mechanical Turk, Zhao says.Amazon created a site called Mechanical Turk in 2005 to enable the crowdsourcing of work via the internetwhether for a company that pays random Web surfers to weigh in on a new logo design or a researcher who is conducting a social science experiment.In crowdturfing online reviews, an attacker creates a project on the Mechanical Turk site and offers to pay large numbers of people to set up accounts on Amazon, Yelp, TripAdvisor or other sites and to then post reviews intended to either raise or sink a product or services money-making prospects.[A company] can pay workers small amounts to write negative online reviews for a competing business, often fabricating stories of bad experiences or service, Zhao says.Crowdturfing has become a growing problem in China, India and the U.S. but is often limited by the amount of money a person has available to get others to do the dirty work, he adds.Automating Fake News In anticipation of automated misinformation technology maturing to the point where it can consistently produce convincing news articles, Zhao and his colleagues are considering fake news detection as a future direction for their research.Programs already exist to automatically generate essays and scientific papers, but a careful human read usually reveals them to be nonsensical, says Filippo Menczer, a professor of informatics and computer science at the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing.Articles intended purely to spread falsehoods and misinformation are currently written by humans because they need to come off as authentic in order to go viral online, says Menczer, who was not involved in the Chicago research.That is something that a machine is not capable of doing with todays technology, he says.Still, skilled AI scientists putting their effort into this not-so-noble task could probably create credible articles that spread half-truths and leverage peoples fears.
Puerto Rico Looks to Alphabet's X Project Loon Balloons to Restore Cell Service:::::More than three weeks after Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, much of the island remains without access to cell phone service and electricity.In addition to taking dozens of lives, the storms 175kilometer per hour winds, heavy rainfall and flooding destroyed most cell towers and brought down the power grid entirely.Progress to restore these essential services has been slow, given the damage to the islands infrastructure on the ground.Some relief could be on the way from above, however, in the form of massive, translucent plastic balloons.Launched by AlphabetGoogles parent companythe balloons could create a network to restore wireless communications for most of the islands 3.4 million residents.The floating orbswhich look and move like jellyfish drifting in Earths stratosphereare part of Project Loon, Alphabets experimental effort to deliver wireless services to unserved or underserved areas around the world.Puerto Rico will be Project Loons biggest challenge since Alphabets X (previously known as Google X) officially launched the effort in 2013.Xs plan is to float the solar-powered, helium-filled balloons about 19 kilometers above Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for up to six months, creating a wireless network on the ground covering nearly 7,800 square kilometers.(The island itself is just over 9,100 square kilometers.)The balloons can stay aloft in the stratosphere for 100 days or more at a time, according to the company.They change position by navigating the stratospheres well-charted wind currents.It is unclear when the balloons might arrive, but the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted Alphabet an experimental license (pdf) on October 7 to deploy 30 of them.Project Loon is now looking to collaborate with local telecom providers in Puerto Rico, which could install small base stations called microcells on lampposts, buildings and other locations where there is a clear line of sight with the sky.Cell phones would communicate with the microcells, which in turn would relay those communications to the network of balloons.Each balloon has two main radio transceiversone serves as a 4G LTE cellular base station and the other acts a high-speed link that transfers data onto laser signals that are beamed among the balloons.The transceivers essentially transmit connectivity from ground stations, across balloons and back down to users phones.The signals will be sent over the 900-megahertz frequency band, which the local telecom companies will allow Project Loon to access.Signals in the 900-MHz band are relatively low frequency, which means they are very reliable when traveling in a straight line through the atmosphere between transmitting and receiving antennas.On the downside, a few 900-MHz links arent going to be enough to provide high-speed connectivity to a whole island, says Aditya Dhananjay, a postdoc at New York Universitys Tandon School of Engineering.However, its more than enough spectrum to connect Puerto Rico to the rest of the world for voice calls and text messaging, but you wont be able to stream YouTube videos, adds Dhananjay, who is not involved with Project Loon.On the Ground Help cannot come soon enough for Puerto Ricos residents, who have been scrambling to find cell service to communicate with one another and with family and friends living off the island.Cell networks have been fairly functional in the cities of San Juan [in the north] and Guaynabo to the south, says Giovanni Collazo, an app developer living in San Juan.Calls and SMS work most of the time through his service providerAT&Tbut data service is very limited, slow and fails all the time.He recently bought a prepaid SIM card for internet access.(A SIM card is an integrated circuit containing unique information that identifies it to a specific mobile network.)The plan came with 10 [gigabytes] of data, but Ive been using it a lot more than that, he says.Im using one of my test devices as a wi-fi hot spot.As long as Claro [Telecom] is working in San Juan, Im able to connect.Another thing is that we dont have power, so keeping equipment charged is an issue.The situation on other parts of the island is much worse.During the weekend I visited Caguas, Cayey, Aibonito, Barranquitas and Naranjito, and theres no signal in those cities, he says.In most areas not even land lines are working.At one of the stops we saw business owners using satellite phones.As you drive from San Juan to Guaynabo you can see hundreds of cars parked [on] the shoulders of the highway, as people use their phones to contact loved ones and communicate with others on the island and outside [of it], he notes.People are finding places where theres good or at least some reception and are going there to use their devices.As word spreads about the best places to get reception, people drive to those areas from rural parts of the island.He adds: The telcos have started putting up signs around Guaynabo and San Juan in places where they have coverage so people can stop there and use their services.Collazo has another way to gauge wireless service on the island.He runs a start-up called Alias Payments and has created an appGasolina Movilthat allows customers to pay for gas at the pump using their smartphones.In the past few days weve started seeing transactions as stations in the metro area have gone back to normal, and some of them have internet access, he says.Our customers are using microwave antennas to get online in most cases since [cable provider] Liberty and Claro have very limited wired service.Local television andmore importantly, given the power shortageradio stations have been talking about Project Loon, so there is some awareness on the island that the technology is coming.Still, people dont know when and how its going to work, Collazo says.Everyone I know and who is involved in one way or another in the tech scene is very excited about it.Everyone agrees the restoring comms is a priority to first enable emergency services, facilitate aid delivery logisticsthere are a lot of new truckers without GPSmobilize politically and, finally, try to restore business like mine.Up in the Air X spokesperson Libby Leahy released a statement saying, Were grateful for the support of the FCC and the Puerto Rican authorities as we work hard to see if its possible to use Loon balloons to bring emergency connectivity to the island during this time of need.To deliver signal to peoples devices, Loon needs be integrated with a telco partners networkthe balloons cant do it alone.Weve been making solid progress on this next step and would like to thank everyone whos been lending a hand.Other large tech companies have also promised to help Puerto Rico.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in late September the social media giant would send a connectivity team to help restore communications on the island.And Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted last week that he wants to talk with Puerto Ricos governor about deploying Teslas solar-charged batteries to restore power on the island.X has tested Project Loon successfully over New Zealand and Peru in recent years.There is one obstacle that could deflate the project, however.Space Data Corp., a company that makes wireless communications technology for use in balloons, sued X and Alphabet last year.Space Data claims the project infringes on two of the companys patents related to creating airborne networks.The company recently won a motion forcing Alphabet to share technical data on Project Loon to see where it might be infringing on Space Datas patents and could file an injunction calling for Alphabet to stop using any of its infringing technology until the case is decided, Wired reported in July.Alphabets X did not respond to requests for comment on Project Loon.Given the trial is currently scheduled for summer 2019, an injunction would be a major setback to Puerto Rico.
Astronomers Are Finally Mapping the “Dark Side” of the Milky Way:::::Think of the Milky Wayor search for pictures of it onlineand youll see images of a standard spiral galaxy viewed face-on, a sprawling pinwheel of starlight and dust containing hundreds of billions of stars.These images, however, are mostly make-believe.We know the Milky Way is a star-filled spiral galaxy in excess of 100,000 light-years wide, and we know our solar system drifts between two spiral arms at its outskirts, some 27,000 light-years from its center.But much beyond that, our knowledge fades.No space probe or telescope built by humans has ever escaped the Milky Way to turn back and take a portrait; because we are embedded in our galaxys disk, we can only see it as a bright band of stars across the sky.For astronomers trying to map it, the effort is a bit like learning the anatomy of a human body from the perspective of a single skin cell somewhere on a forearm.How many spiral arms does the Milky Way have, and how do those spiral arms branch and curl around the galaxy?How many stars does the Milky Way really contain?How much does it weigh?What does our cosmic home actually look like, viewed from another nearby galaxy?Ask an astronomerand if he or she is being perfectly honest, you will learn that we do not fully know.Among the biggest obstacles to our knowledge is the disk of the galaxy itself, particularly its center, which is thick with starlight-absorbing dust and rife with energetic astrophysical outbursts that can ruin delicate observations.This means we know very little about the other side of the galaxy.Optically, its like trying to look through a velvet clothblack as black can be, says Thomas Dame, an astronomer at HarvardSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA).In terms of tracing and understanding the spiral structure, essentially half of the Milky Way is terra incognita.Now, however, new record-breaking measurements are allowing astronomers to pierce the veil of the galactic center as never before, and to construct the best-ever maps of our galaxys structure.Instead of using visible light, Dame and others map the Milky Way by looking for radio emissions from molecular gas clouds and massive, young stars, both of which typically reside in spiral arms.The challenge lies in measuring, in the absence of convenient intergalactic road signs or distance markers, how far off these objects are.Without knowing these distances, astronomers cannot precisely situate any given radio source within the galaxy to accurately reconstruct the Milky Ways morphology.Since the 1950s astronomers have solved this problem using kinematic distances, calculations that treat objects in the Milky Way a bit like pieces of flotsam spiraling into a whirlpool; because things tend to move faster as they approach the center, measuring how fast an object is moving toward or away from us yields an estimate of its distance from the galactic centerand thus from our solar system.Kinematic distances have helped Dame and others discover previously unknown spiral arms and spiral-arm substructures on our solar systems side of the Milky Way.But the technique breaks down for peering directly across the galaxy, where objects do not move toward or away from us at all but rather purely perpendicularly to our line of sight.To map the Milky Ways hidden half requires a more direct method.In a study published October 12 in Science, Dame and an international team of colleagues have demonstrated just that.Using the National Science Foundations Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), an interlinked system of 10 radio telescopes stretching across Hawaii, North America and the Caribbean, the astronomers have directly measured the distance to an object called G007.47+00.05, a star-forming region located on the opposite side of the galaxy from our solar system.The measurement showed the region to be some 66,000 light-years awaynearly 40,000 light-years beyond the galactic center, and roughly double the distance of the previous record-holding direct measurement of distance in the Milky Way.The team relied on a timeworn technique called parallax, which measures the apparent shift in an objects celestial position when seen from opposing sides of the Earths orbit around the sun.You can see parallax on smaller scales simply by holding a finger in front of your face and winking one eye then the other.Your finger will seem to jump from side to side; calculating its distance from your face is as simple as measuring the angle of its apparent shift.The smaller the angle, the greater the distance.And the wider the distance between your two detectors, be they eyes or radio dishes, the more acute your measurement can be.The VLBAs parallax observations took place in 2014, when Earth was on one side of its orbit, and then six months later in 2015, when our planet was on the opposite side of the sun.This maximized the sensitivity of the technique, allowing it to measure the minuscule shift in the apparent position of the distant star-forming region.According to lead author Alberto Sanna, a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany, the VLBAs measurement is equivalent to seeing a baseball on the surface of the moon.The feat, Sanna says, shows we can measure the whole extent of our galaxy, to accurately number and map the Milky Ways spiral arms and know their true shapes, so that we can learn what the Milky Way really looks like.It really is excellent workI believe this is the smallest parallax ever obtained, and it is certainly a milestone in modern observational astronomy, says Mareki Honma, an astronomer at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.Honma led a separate team that independently measured the distance to G007.47+00.05 in 2016, finding a similar value.Those measurements, however, were not accurate enough to obtain parallax, and relied instead on tracking the star-forming regions so-called proper motion across the plane of the sky.The similarity between the two teams results, Honma says, suggests proper motion alone can be a useful tool for determining distances to objects on the other side of the galaxy.Already, the confirmed distance for this particular star-forming region is redrawing galactic maps.In 2011 Dame and colleagues used radio measurements to tentatively trace the path of one spiral arm, called ScutumCentaurus.Their fragmentary measurements suggested this arm might wrap around almost the entirety of the Milky Way, but they lost its trailand crucial evidence for its galaxy-encircling breadthin the vicinity of the dark, roiling galactic center.This star-forming arm runs right through one of the features we identified in 2011, and adds evidence that the ScutumCentaurus arm is really a major structure in our galaxy, Dame says.In 2011 we wrote that we may never sort this out, because proving its distance through the galactic center would be so difficultbut we were being shortsighted, because here it is, six years later!The VLBAs painstaking, Earth-orbit-spanning measurement occurred as part of a larger project, the Bar and Spiral Structure Legacy Survey (BeSSeL) led by Mark Reid, who like Dame is a radio astronomer at the CfA and a co-author on the Science study.Now in its concluding stages, BeSSeL used 3,500 hours on the VLBA to obtain more than 200 distance measurements for star-forming regions scattered throughout the Milky Way.Many of these readings are now tracing out new details in the galaxys filigree of spiral arms.Which is a good startbut being in the Northern Hemisphere, the VLBA and BeSSeL cannot survey most of star-forming regions visible from the southern sky.And even if they could, parallax alone will not fill in the galactic map.Because parallax measurements are so difficult to obtain for far-distant star-forming regions on the other side of the galaxy, astronomers widely agree they will chiefly serve as important calibration points to augment existing kinematic distance measurements.Further progress will come from a combination of parallax, proper motion and kinematic distance data via surveys using Southern Hemispherebased radio telescopes as well as from space-based data from the European Space Agencys Gaia satellite.The latter is using visible-light parallax measurements to pin down the precise positions for a billion of the Milky Ways stars.Taken together, the resulting map will help astronomers pin down many still-unknown fundamental aspects of our galaxy such as how fast and uniformly it rotates.This will let them finally determine just how massive the Milky Way really is, potentially yielding new insights into our galaxys inventory of stars, dark matter and small satellites that lurk at its edges.All of this will help scientists understand how the Milky Way first came to be, and much that has happened to it since.How important is it, really, for us to be able to see clear across to the other side of our own galaxy?asks Tom Bania, a radio astronomer at Boston University involved in some of the southern surveys.It is the most important thing in all of astrophysics.It took humankind thousands of years to map the Earth accurately; a map of the galaxy will constrain about a dozen or so models of the structure and evolution of the Milky Way.To me, perhaps the Holy Grail of astronomy is to provide a clear perspective of our relationship to the physical universe.The map of our galaxy is a part of that, and that map is still incomplete.Soon, that could change.Thanks to BeSSeL and its ilk, Reid notes, in only a few more years we should have a map that shows us what the Milky Way really looks like.
Will Italy's Ominous Supervolcano Erupt Soon?:::::POZZUOLLI, ItalyTragedy struck at the Solfatara volcano crater north of Naples a few weeks ago.An 11-year-old boy climbed over a low, wooden fence, ventured onto the chalky moonscape, and fell into an open fissure.His parents frantically tried to pull him out, just as the hollow floor of the crater crumbled, sending them all to their deaths in a gaseous pit of boiling gray mud, as the familys seven-year-old boy watched in horror.The accident was a freak occurrence, responsible for the only recorded deaths on this crater in centuries.But those hot gases hold an ominous story: Solfatara is part of the massive Phlegrean Fields, a threatening supervolcano experts agree could begin erupting anytime.Phlegrean Fieldsa network of two dozen craters and other volcanic structuresis especially worrisome because the nested craters stretch under the Gulf of Naples, right alongside the greater Naples metropolitan area, home to more than three million people.Much like Yellowstone in Wyoming and Long Valley in California, Phlegrean Fields is classified as a supervolcano that, when (not if) it next erupts, could cause a catastrophic global event.Its eruption 200,000 years agothe largest ever in what is now Europedarkened skies worldwide, causing a terrible volcanic winter.An eruption 40,000 years ago may have wiped out Neanderthals, according to a 2010 report that is hotly debated.Phlegrean Fields last blew in 1538, an eight-day eruption that created the 440-foot Monte Nuovo volcano on the coast.Even if Phlegrean Fields takes another 500 years to erupt, it offers a unique research opportunity because of its particular style of unrest.Prior to and after the 1538 eruption the ground in this highly populated area experienced very slow, vertical oscillations known as bradyseism, which do not exist to the same extent in any other caldera in the world.In the 1970s these movements became strong againthe ground rose and fell 10 to 15 centimeters (about four to six inches) a year.Volcanologists were concerned the complex might be reaching another eruptive phase.The fear became worse after bradyseism caused the ground to lift an incredible 110 centimeters (43.3 inches) in 1982, and the movements then stopped almost entirely in 1983.But Phlegrean Fields did not erupt.In 2016 the volcano was upgraded from green to yellow on a scale that continues up to orange and then red, which indicates an imminent eruption.Scientists last declared it red in 1983 after roads, houses and a hospital were destroyed by the sudden 110-centimeter rise.More than 30,000 people had to be evacuated.Whether or not the odd, current silence means a threat is imminent is open to scientific interpretation, just as changes at other volcanoes worldwide are.The latest studies provide some intriguing suggestions, and offer insights about possible eruptions elsewhere on Earth.Part of determining just when Solfatara or another portion of Phlegrean Fields might erupt is understanding what is under the crust.That has been difficult to ascertain with certainty because most of the crater is covered by a one- to two-kilometer-thick caprock.Several recent studies paint different pictures of just what lies below this protective lid.Luca De Siena, an expert in geophysics and volcanology at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, thinks there are reservoirs of static, thick magma about a kilometer long and five to 10 meters thick that last migrated between ancient cavities around the 1980s.Tiziana Vanorio, director of Stanford Universitys Rock Physics Laboratory, instead thinks the calderas cavities have less structure and hold hot, fluid liquids and gases that influence the stress and strain on the caprock.Both of the Italian experts grew up on the Phlegrean Fields caldera and are happy to credit each others research, even as they disagree with it.If the next eruption is explosive like in the past, rather than effusive (which would be relatively gentler), Vanorio, who was evacuated after the 1982 unrest, says what is under the caprock really will not matter for people in cities such as nearby Pozzuoli.Whether the eruption involves viscous magma containing sufficient gas dissolved under pressure or hot mudflows and ash-laden gas clouds, the town of Pozzuoli and its surroundings would not be subjected to such different risk exposures, she says.In other words, events resulting from conditions predicted by either hypothesis would be equally catastrophic.Phlegrean Fields offers an intriguing research opportunity because companies drilled almost a dozen geothermal wells there prior to the 1982 fright.No longer used, the wells now allow extensive monitoring, provide direct data about underground characteristics such as temperature and allow researchers to drill cores into the deep interior.Having cores is like having a view through a window to a landscape that has been long-covered, Vanorio says.Techniques used in Phlegrean Fields are already being applied at other major volcanoes, including Mount Saint Helens in the U.S., Deception Island in Antarctica, Mount Teide in the Canary Islands and Mount Aso in Japan.And yet, the debate about what exactly is under the caprock of this supervolcano stems from lack of access beyond the geothermal wells.In 2010 funding was made available for a deep-drill project that would have penetrated all the way through the caprock to see what was below.But the Neapolitan mayor, backed by a handful of experts, stopped the plan based on fears that drilling might cause an eruption.By the time a new city administration green-lighted drilling again several years later, the funds had been sent elsewhere.Some researchers are trying to revive the project.Unfazed, De Siena and a group of experts published a study in August that explores the dramatic unrest in the 1980s and sets out new methods to measure and analyze even the subtlest movements and sounds.He hopes that new techniques will take some of the guesswork out of modeling eruptions.One approach would be to monitor underground water, underground rocks, and oil and gas fields together, providing unified data that go beyond studying such factors independently.All of this could make it safer for populations that live on volcanoes around the world.Unlike earthquake prediction, scientists can actually do something about volcanoes, Vanorio says.Though each volcano is unique and may change its eruptive behavior at any time, there are trends in precursors.That helps scientists get better at predicting eruptions.Despite new tools and renewed enthusiasm for useful results, scientists still cannot say how soon Phlegrean Fields might erupt.Are we in danger?De Siena asks.The answer is always yes.There are more than three million people there.Any eruption of any sort is going to be dangerous.
Where's the Proof That Mindfulness Meditation Works?:::::The concept of mindfulness involves focusing on your present situation and state of mind.This can mean awareness of your surroundings, emotions and breathingor, more simply, enjoying each bite of a really good sandwich.Research in recent decades has linked mindfulness practices to a staggering collection of possible health benefits.Tuning into the world around you may provide a sense of well-being, an array of studies claim.Multiple reports link mindfulness with improved cognitive functioning.One study even suggests it may preserve the tips of our chromosomes, which whither away as we age.Yet many psychologists, neuroscientists and meditation experts are afraid that hype is outpacing the science.In an article released this week in Perspectives on Psychological Science, 15 prominent psychologists and cognitive scientists caution that despite its popularity and supposed benefits, scientific data on mindfulness is woefully lacking.Many of the studies on mindfulness and meditation, the authors wrote, are poorly designedcompromised by inconsistent definitions of what mindfulness actually is, and often void of a control group to rule out the placebo effect.The new paper cites a 2015 review published in American Psychologist reporting that only around 9 percent of research into mindfulness-based interventions has been tested in clinical trials that included a control group.The authors also point to multiple large placebo-controlled meta-analyses concluding that mindfulness practices have often produced unimpressive results.A 2014 review of 47 meditation trials, collectively including over 3,500 participants, found essentially no evidence for benefits related to enhancing attention, curtailing substance abuse, aiding sleep or controlling weight.Lead author of the report Nicholas Van Dam, a clinical psychologist and research fellow in psychological sciences at the University of Melbourne, contends potential benefits of mindfulness are being overshadowed by hyperbole and oversold for financial gain.Mindfulness meditation and training is now a $1.1-billion industry in the U.S. alone.Our report does not mean that mindfulness meditation is not helpful for some things, Van Dam says.But the scientific rigor just isnt there yet to be making these big claims.He and his co-authors are also concerned that as of 2015, less than 25 percent of meditation trials included monitoring for potential negative effects of the intervention, a number he would like to see grow as the field moves forward.Van Dam acknowledges that some good evidence does support mindfulness.The 2014 analysis found meditation and mindfulness may provide modest benefits in anxiety, depression and pain.He also cites a 2013 review published in Clinical Psychology Review for mindfulness-based therapy that found similar results.The intention and scope of this review is welcomeit is looking to introduce rigor and balance into this emerging new field, says Willem Kuyken, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford in England, who was not involved in research for the new report.There are many areas where mindfulness-based programs seem to be acceptable and promising, but larger scale randomized, rigorous trials are needed.Two trials published earlier this month in Science Advances also support mindfulness practices.The first found mindfulness-like attention training reduces self-perceived stress, but not levels of the hormone cortisol, a commonly used biological gauge of stress levels.The other trial links mindfulness-like attention training to increases in thickness of the prefrontal cortex, a brain region associated with complex behavior, decision-making and shaping personality.The authors called for further research into what these findings could mean clinically.Van Dam characterizes the research methods used in both of these studies as sound.Yet he points out both also represent the fields larger problema lack of standardization.Varying mindfulness-like approaches have been investigated over the years, making comparisons of different studies difficult.Mindfulness is rooted in Buddhist thought and theory.In the West it was popularized in the 1970s by University of Massachusetts professor Jon Kabat-Zinn, a cognitive scientist who founded the universitys Stress Reduction Clinic and the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine.Kabat-Zinn developed what he called mindfulness-based stress reduction, an alternative therapy for a variety of often difficult-to-treat conditions.By the early 2000s, the concept of mindfulness had ballooned in popularity.It soon came to have many differing meanings and varying approaches to treatment.We specifically commented in our article on the fact that many continue to develop novel interventions without fully evaluating those that are already being implemented, Van Dam says.I think these studies, while well-designed, may fit within the category of being just different enough from what we already have to prevent us from really knowing whether we could use these results as evidence for [the effectiveness of] other mindfulness-based practices.As Van Dam and his co-authors wrote, [there is] neither one universally accepted technical definition of mindfulness nor any broad agreement about detailed aspects of the underlying concept to which it refers.Overall, I suspect that a large number of the health promises will not be fulfilled, mostly because therapies, phone apps and other interventions are being rushed to market without sufficiently rigorous testing and appropriate implementation, he says.But given what weve seen to date, I suspect evidence may accumulate supporting mindfulness practices for anxiety, depression and stress-related conditions.Behavioral and social sciences professor and director of Brown Universitys Mindfulness Center Eric Loucks, who was not involved in researching the new paper, agrees there are multiple definitions of mindfulness.But it is the trickiness in bringing a rich spiritual concept into a standardized framework for testing and advising patients that he feels might be tough to tackle.One element in defining mindfulness, if considering its roots in Buddhism, isthe Buddha's recommendation that descriptions of concepts like mindfulness are like a finger pointing at the moon, he explains.It is important not to confuse the finger for the moon.There will always be variations in people's understanding of mindfulness.It is a personal experience.
After the Napa Fires, Toxic Ash Threatens Soil, Streams, and the San Francisco Bay:::::By any measure, the fires that tore through Northern California were a major disaster .Forty-two people are dead, and 100,000 are displaced.More than 8,400 homes and other buildings were destroyed, more than 160,000 acres burnedand the fires arent all out yet.That devastation leaves behind another potential disaster: ash.No one knows how much.Itll be full of heavy metals and toxinsno one knows exactly how much, and it depends on what burned and at what temperature.The ash will infiltrate soils, but no ones really sure how or whether thatll be a problem.And eventually some of itmaybe a lotwill flow into the regional aquatic ecosystem and ultimately the San Francisco Bay.Thats the bomb.Heres the timer: An old, grim joke about the California says that the state only has three seasons: summer, fire, and mudslides.Those mudslides happen because of rain; the Santa Ana (or Diablo, if youd prefer) wind-driven wildfires of autumn give way to a monsoon season that lasts through winter and into spring.The rains of 2016-2017 ended a longstanding drought and broke all kinds of records .Scientists and environmental health agencies know, mostly, what to expect from ash that comes from burned vegetation.But these fires included something a little new.They burned through the wildland-urban interface and into cities.For how many structures that were burned in fairly small areas in these fires, I think that's a first-of-its-kind event, says Geoffrey Plumlee , associate director of environmental health for the US Geological Survey.The concern is, can they get it cleaned up before the heavy rains come?Chemically, ash is fascinating .If the fire that made it burned at lower than about 840 degrees F, itll be darker-colored, maybe even black, and mostly organic carbon.At higher temperatures the carbon burns away, leaving inorganic compounds of stuff like calcium, magnesium, and sodium, and itll be whiter and fluffier.Even hotter fires, like above 1100 degrees, leave nothing but oxides.Inside a single fire, combustion happens at different temperatures in different places, and because ash is so light, wind can transport it, so the composition of ash from the same fire can vary.So depending on how combusted the ash is, itll have different chemical compositions.And thatll mean the ash will mix either better or worse with underlying soil.Water wont stick to more hydrophobic ash, so rainfall might run off faster, carrying away the surrounding soil as sediment.More hydrophilic ash might mix into the water and wash into nearby streams.Now, carbon is the backbone element of organic systems.Having some flow off of burned hillsides and into aquatic ecosystems isnt necessarily bad.Itll increase whats called primary productivity, allowing algae to reproduce, which means more food for fish.Naturally occurring, lower-severity fires can have positive impacts, says Kevin Bladon , a forest ecohydrologist at Oregon State University.The fires free up organic carbon and put nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous into play.But the really large, high-severity megafires that weve started to observe push the systems in a lot of cases too far.That means dangerously large algal blooms, so-called eutrophication that can eat all the dissolved oxygen out of a waterway, making it unlivable for everything else.Sediments freed up by the hydrophobic ash end up making water more turbidbad for people if that waters supposed to end up coming out of someones tap, and bad for fish because sediment can gum up feeding and breeding grounds.The problems getting more familiar as an after-effect of fires ranging from Australia to Canada to the US.Climate change makes fires and storms more severe.As one of Bladens papers notes, the 2002 Hayman fire in the Colorado Rockies sent 765,000 cubic meters of sediment, ash, and other stuff into Denvers drinking water reservoirs, and the problems were still there four years later .Were anywhere from five years to 100 years in terms of the longevity of effects, Bladon says.That really depends on the severity of the fire and our ability to get some vegetation re-established on site.It gets even weirder.At high enough combustion temperatures, compounds like potassium carbonate and calcium carbonate turn to oxides.Given the right amount of light rain, calcium oxidequicklimeslurps carbon dioxide out of the air and forms a crust of essentially cement, limestone.Basically, the ash can pave a forest.If you had the perfect situation, you can really change a watershed with increased runoff, says Victoria Balfour, a post-fire hydrologist.There's more.Combustion byproducts called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and cancer-causing dioxins can all be part of ash.In older forested land that hasnt burned in decades, pollution may have deposited heavy metals like copper, lead, aluminum, arsenic, and even mercury onto the plants.When the plants burn, the metals stay behind, or run into waterways.The 2009 Station Fire northeast of Los Angeles increased levels of iron, manganese, and mercury in nearby streams...and the storms that followed soon after brought elevated levels of copper, lead, nickel, and selenium.What makes these latest northern California fires unique, though, is that they burned not just forest wildland but also cities.And the built environment burns differently.It gets hotter, and it leaves behind different remains.All of a sudden youve got a lot of impervious surfaces, Bladon says.Water hits it and flows over.If there are burned materials sitting on the roads, thats going to move very rapidly into waterways.We have no handle on that at all.Ash science isnt much more than a decade old; understanding urban ash science has never really been a necessitybut now megafires are coming to cities.Whats in that ash depends on how old the buildings are.Pre-1980, the paint will be full of lead.Even more recently, pressure-treated lumber used in landscaping was full of chromate copper arsenate, which leaches arsenic and hexavalent chromiumbad for fish and other living things.On the good side, there are probably fewer lead phosphor TV screens.Theres a lot more flat screens, says Plumlee."There are more LED light bulbs and hopefully fewer fluorescent and compact fluorescent, which have a concern with mercury.Copper and zinc are also commonly used in building materials.All of which means the real trick in Northern California will be debris cleanup.The US Environmental Protection Agency, Californias EPA, the Army Corps of Engineers, and other agencies and NGOs are all onsitespinning up as a Watershed Protection Taskforce.Theyre evaluating the debris and getting it ready for collectiona job done most safely wearing gloves, a Tyvek bodysuit, and an N95 respirator.Drinking water for the region hasnt been compromisedit comes from farther north than the firesbut the Napa and Sonoma Rivers (and the associated stream systems) empty straight into San Francisco Bay.We cherish our creeks and streams, and theres uncertainty in regards to what may be in all this ash, says Bennett Horenstein, director of Santa Rosa Water.So theres a lot of activity to do everything we can in a thoughtful and safe way to protect the ecosystem.Stormwater typically doesnt get treated, so the inlets in Santa Rosa have gotten barrier protection installed.Were all recognizing that this disaster was of such magnitude, the organization is unfolding, Horenstein says.But it does seem to be unfolding in a thoughtful, structured way.The Regional Monitoring Program for Water Quality already watches whats in the San Francisco Bay besides water.Some of its scientists now have a proposal to monitor the Napa River for what water watchdogs call contaminants of emerging concern.The field is new enough that theyre not even sure what theyre looking for yettheyre going to use non-targeted analysis to look for anything unexpected.The San Francisco Estuary Institute already monitors dioxins, PAHs, metals, and other stuff in the Bay, but only annually or semi-annually.Thats probably not fast enough.The ash is on the ground.Getting through the entire area will take some time, says Horenstein, and were approaching the wet weather season.Theres a small storm forecast for next week.Tis, after all, the season.
Best-Ever Algorithm Found for Huge Streams of Data:::::Its hard to measure water from a fire hose while its hitting you in the face.In a sense, thats the challenge of analyzing streaming data, which comes at us in a torrent and never lets up.If youre on Twitter watching tweets go by, you might like to declare a brief pause, so you can figure out whats trending.Thats not feasible, though, so instead you need to find a way to tally hashtags on the fly.Quanta Magazine About Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.Computer programs that perform these kinds of on-the-go calculations are called streaming algorithms.Because data comes at them continuously, and in such volume, they try to record the essence of what theyve seen while strategically forgetting the rest.For more than 30 years computer scientists have worked to build a better streaming algorithm.Last fall a team of researchers invented one that is just about perfect.We developed a new algorithm that is simultaneously the best on every performance dimension, said Jelani Nelson , a computer scientist at Harvard University and a co-author of the work with Kasper Green Larsen of Aarhus University in Denmark, Huy Nguyen of Northeastern University and Mikkel Thorup of the University of Copenhagen.This best-in-class streaming algorithm works by remembering just enough of what its seen to tell you what its seen most frequently.It suggests that compromises that seemed intrinsic to the analysis of streaming data are not actually necessary.It also points the way forward to a new era of strategic forgetting.Trend Spotting Streaming algorithms are helpful in any situation where youre monitoring a database thats being updated continuously.This could be AT&T keeping tabs on data packets or Google charting the never-ending flow of search queries.In these situations its useful, even necessary, to have a method for answering real-time questions about the data without re-examining or even remembering every piece of data youve ever seen.Heres a simple example.Imagine you have a continuous stream of numbers and you want to know the sum of all the numbers youve seen so far.In this case its obvious that instead of remembering every number, you can get by with remembering just one: the running sum.The challenge gets harder, though, when the questions you want to ask about your data get more complicated.Imagine that instead of calculating the sum, you want to be able to answer the following question: Which numbers have appeared most frequently?Its less obvious what kind of shortcut you could use to keep an answer at the ready.This particular puzzle is known as the frequent items or heavy hitters problem.The first algorithm to solve it was developed in the early 1980s by David Gries of Cornell University and Jayadev Misra of the University of Texas, Austin.Their program was effective in a number of ways, but it couldnt handle whats called change detection.It could tell you the most frequently searched terms, but not which terms are trending.In Googles case, it could identify Wikipedia as an ever-popular search term, but it couldnt find the spike in searches that accompany a major event such as Hurricane Irma.Jelani Nelson, a theoretical computer scientist at Harvard University, co-developed the new algorithm.Yaphet Teklu Its a coding problemyoure encoding information down to compact summary and trying to extract information that lets you recover what was put in initially, said Graham Cormode, a computer scientist at the University of Warwick.Over the next 30-plus years, Cormode and other computer scientists improved Gries and Misras algorithm.Some of the new algorithms were able to detect trending terms, for example, while others were able to work with a more fine-grained definition of what it means for a term to be frequent.All those algorithms made trade-offs, like sacrificing speed for accuracy or memory consumption for reliability.Most of these efforts relied on an index.Imagine, for example, you are trying to identify frequent search terms.One way to do it would be to assign a number to every word in the English language and then pair that number with a second number that keeps track of how many times that word has been searched.Maybe aardvark gets indexed as word number 17 and appears in your database as (17, 9), meaning word number 17 has been searched nine times.This approach comes closer to putting the most frequent items at your fingertips, since at any given moment, you know exactly how many times each word has been searched.Still, it has drawbacksnamely that it takes a lot of time for an algorithm to comb through the hundreds of thousands of words in the English language.But what if there were only 100 words in the dictionary?Then looping over every word in the dictionary wouldnt take that long, Nelson said.Alas, the number of words in the dictionary is what it is.Unless, as the authors of the new algorithm discovered, you can break the big dictionary into smaller dictionaries and find a clever way to put it back together.Small Data Small numbers are easier to keep track of than big numbers.Imagine, for example, that youre monitoring a stream of numbers between zero and 50,000,000 (a task similar to logging internet users by their IP addresses).You could keep track of the numbers using a 50,000,000-term index, but its hard to work with an index that size.A better way is to think of each eight-digit number as four two-digit numbers linked together.Say you see the number 12,345,678.One memory-efficient way to remember it is to break it into four two-digit blocks: 12, 34, 56, 78.Then you can send each block to a sub-algorithm that calculates item frequencies: 12 goes to copy one of the algorithm, 34 goes to copy two, 56 goes to copy three, and 78 goes to copy four.Each sub-algorithm maintains its own index of what its seen, but since each version never sees anything bigger than a two-digit number, each index only runs from 0 to 99.An important feature of this splitting is that if the big number12,345,678appears frequently in your overall data stream, so will its two-digit components.When you ask each sub-algorithm to identify the numbers it has seen the most, copy one will spit out 12, copy two will spit out 34, and so on.Youll be able to find the most frequent members of a huge list just by looking for the frequent items in four much shorter lists.Lucy Reading-Ikkanda/Quanta Magazine Instead of spending 50 million units of time looping over the entire universe, you only have four algorithms spending 100 units of time, Nelson said.The main problem with this divide-and-conquer strategy is that while its easy to split a big number into small numbers, the reverse is trickierits hard to fish out the right small numbers to recombine to give you the right big number.Imagine, for example, that your data stream frequently includes two numbers that have some digits in common: 12,345,678 and 12,999,999.Both start with 12.Your algorithm splits each number into four smaller numbers, then sends each to a sub-algorithm.Later, you ask each sub-algorithm, Which numbers have you seen most frequently?Copy one is going to say, Ive seen a lot of the number 12.An algorithm thats trying to identify which eight-digit numbers its seen most frequently cant tell if all these 12s belong to one eight-digit number or, as in this case, to two different numbers.The challenge is to figure out which two-digit blocks to concatenate with which other two-digit blocks, Nelson said.The authors of the new work solve this dilemma by packaging each two-digit block with a little tag that doesnt take up much memory but still allows the algorithm to put the two-digit pieces back together in the right way.To see one simple approach to how the tagging might work, start with 12,345,678 and split it into two-digit blocks.But this time, before you send each block to its respective sub-algorithm, package the block with a pair of unique identifying numbers that can be used to put the blocks back together.The first of these tags serves as the blocks name, the second as a link.In this way, 12,345,678 becomes: 12, 0, 1 / 34, 1, 2 / 56, 2, 3 / 78, 3, 4 Here the number 12 has the name 0 and gets linked to the number named 1.The number 34 has the name 1 and gets linked to the number named 2.And so on.Now when the sub-algorithms return the two-digit blocks theyve seen most frequently, 12 goes looking for a number tagged with 1 and finds 34, then 34 goes looking for a number tagged with 2 and finds 56, and 56 goes looking for a number tagged with 3 and finds 78.In this way, you can think of the two-digit blocks as links in a chain, with the links held together by these extra tagging numbers.The problem with chains, of course, is that theyre only as strong as their weakest link.And these chains are almost guaranteed to break.Building Blocks No algorithm works perfectly every time you run iteven the best ones misfire some small percentage of the time.In the example weve been using, a misfire could mean that the second two-digit block, 34, gets assigned an incorrect tag, and as a result, when it goes looking for the block its supposed to be joined to, it doesnt have the information it needs to find 56.And once one link in the chain fails, the entire effort falls apart.Mikkel Thorup, a computer scientist at the University of Copenhagen, helped develop an error-resistant way of remembering data.uniavisen.dk To avoid this problem, the researchers use whats called an expander graph.In an expander graph, each two-digit block forms a point.Points get connected by lines (according to the tagging process described above) to form a cluster.The important feature of an expander graph is that instead of merely connecting each point with its adjoining blocks, you connect each two-digit block with multiple other blocks.For example, with 12,345,678, you connect 12 with 34 but also with 56, so that you can still tell that 12 and 56 belong in the same number even if the link between 12 and 34 fails.An expander graph doesnt always come out perfectly.Sometimes itll fail to link two blocks that should be linked.Or itll link two blocks that dont belong together.To counteract this tendency, the researchers developed the final step of their algorithm: a cluster-preserving sub-algorithm that can survey an expander graph and accurately determine which points are meant to be clustered together and which arent, even when some lines are missing and false ones have been added.This guarantees I can recover something that looks like the original clusters, Thorup said.And while Twitter isnt going to plug in the expander sketch tomorrow, the techniques underlying it are applicable to a far wider range of computer science problems than tallying tweets.The algorithm also proves that certain sacrifices that previously seemed necessary to answer the frequent-items problem dont need to be made.Previous algorithms always gave up something they were accurate but memory-intensive, or fast but unable to determine which frequent items were trending.This new work shows that given the right way of encoding a lot of information, you can end up with the best of all possible worlds: You can store your frequent items and recall them, too.Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine , an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is

Newfound Wormhole Allows Information to Escape Black Holes:::::In 1985, when Carl Sagan was writing the novel Contact , he needed to quickly transport his protagonist Dr. Ellie Arroway from Earth to the star Vega.He had her enter a black hole and exit light-years away, but he didnt know if this made any sense.The Cornell University astrophysicist and television star consulted his friend Kip Thorne, a black hole expert at the California Institute of Technology (who won a Nobel Prize earlier this month).Thorne knew that Arroway couldnt get to Vega via a black hole, which is thought to trap and destroy anything that falls in .But it occurred to him that she might make use of another kind of hole consistent with Albert Einsteins general theory of relativity: a tunnel or wormhole connecting distant locations in space-time.Quanta Magazine About Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.While the simplest theoretical wormholes immediately collapse and disappear before anything can get through, Thorne wondered whether it might be possible for an infinitely advanced sci-fi civilization to stabilize a wormhole long enough for something or someone to traverse it.He figured out that such a civilization could in fact line the throat of a wormhole with exotic material that counteracts its tendency to collapse.The material would possess negative energy, which would deflect radiation and repulse space-time apart from itself.Sagan used the trick in Contact , attributing the invention of the exotic material to an earlier, lost civilization to avoid getting into particulars.Meanwhile, those particulars enthralled Thorne, his students and many other physicists, who spent years exploring traversable wormholes and their theoretical implications.They discovered that these wormholes can serve as time machines, invoking time-travel paradoxesevidence that exotic material is forbidden in nature.Now, decades later, a new species of traversable wormhole has emerged, free of exotic material and full of potential for helping physicists resolve a baffling paradox about black holes.This paradox is the very problem that plagued the early draft of Contact and led Thorne to contemplate traversable wormholes in the first place; namely, that things that fall into black holes seem to vanish without a trace.This total erasure of information breaks the rules of quantum mechanics, and it so puzzles experts that in recent years, some have argued that black hole interiors dont really existthat space and time strangely end at their horizons.The flurry of findings started last year with a paper that reported the first traversable wormhole that doesnt require the insertion of exotic material to stay open.Instead, according to Ping Gao and Daniel Jafferis of Harvard University and Aron Wall of Stanford University, the repulsive negative energy in the wormholes throat can be generated from the outside by a special quantum connection between the pair of black holes that form the wormholes two mouths.When the black holes are connected in the right way, something tossed into one will shimmy along the wormhole and, following certain events in the outside universe, exit the second.Remarkably, Gao, Jafferis and Wall noticed that their scenario is mathematically equivalent to a process called quantum teleportation, which is key to quantum cryptography and can be demonstrated in laboratory experiments.John Preskill , a black hole and quantum gravity expert at Caltech, says the new traversable wormhole comes as a surprise, with implications for the black hole information paradox and black hole interiors.What I really like, he said, is that an observer can enter the black hole and then escape to tell about what she saw.This suggests that black hole interiors really exist, he explained, and that what goes in must come out.Lucy Reading-Ikkanda/Quanta Magazine A Cryptic Equation The new wormhole work began in 2013, when Jafferis attended an intriguing talk at the Strings conference in South Korea.The speaker, Juan Maldacena , a professor of physics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, had recently concluded, based on various hints and arguments, that ER = EPR .That is, wormholes between distant points in space-time, the simplest of which are called Einstein-Rosen or ER bridges, are equivalent (albeit in some ill-defined way) to entangled quantum particles, also known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen or EPR pairs.The ER = EPR conjecture, posed by Maldacena and Leonard Susskind of Stanford, was an attempt to solve the modern incarnation of the infamous black hole information paradox by tying space-time geometry, governed by general relativity, to the instantaneous quantum connections between far-apart particles that Einstein called spooky action at a distance.The paradox has loomed since 1974, when the British physicist Stephen Hawking determined that black holes evaporateslowly giving off heat in the form of particles now known as Hawking radiation.Hawking calculated that this heat is completely random; it contains no information about the black holes contents.As the black hole blinks out of existence, so does the universes record of everything that went inside.This violates a principle called unitarity, the backbone of quantum theory, which holds that as particles interact, information about them is never lost, only scrambled, so that if you reversed the arrow of time in the universes quantum evolution, youd see things unscramble into an exact re-creation of the past.Daniel Jafferis, an associate professor of physics at Harvard University.Paul Horowitz Almost everyone believes in unitarity, which means information must escape black holesbut how?In the last five years, some theorists, most notably Joseph Polchinski of the University of California, Santa Barbara, have argued that black holes are empty shells with no interiors at allthat Ellie Arroway, upon hitting a black holes event horizon, would fizzle on a firewall and radiate out again.Many theorists believe in black hole interiors (and gentler transitions across their horizons), but in order to understand them, they must discover the fate of information that falls inside.This is critical to building a working quantum theory of gravity , the long-sought union of the quantum and space-time descriptions of nature that comes into sharpest relief in black hole interiors, where extreme gravity acts on a quantum scale.The quantum gravity connection is what drew Maldacena, and later Jafferis, to the ER = EPR idea, and to wormholes.The implied relationship between tunnels in space-time and quantum entanglement posed by ER = EPR resonated with a popular recent belief that space is essentially stitched into existence by quantum entanglement .It seemed that wormholes had a role to play in stitching together space-time and in letting black hole information worm its way out of black holesbut how might this work?When Jafferis heard Maldacena talk about his cryptic equation and the evidence for it, he was aware that a standard ER wormhole is unstable and non-traversable.But he wondered what Maldacenas duality would mean for a traversable wormhole like the ones Thorne and others played around with decades ago.Three years after the South Korea talk, Jafferis and his collaborators Gao and Wall presented their answer.The work extends the ER = EPR idea by equating, not a standard wormhole and a pair of entangled particles, but a traversable wormhole and quantum teleportation: a protocol discovered in 1993 that allows a quantum system to disappear and reappear unscathed somewhere else.When Maldacena read Gao, Jafferis and Walls paper, I viewed it as a really nice idea, one of these ideas that after someone tells you, its obvious, he said.Maldacena and two collaborators, Douglas Stanford and Zhenbin Yang , immediately began exploring the new wormholes ramifications for the black hole information paradox; their paper appeared in April.Susskind and Ying Zhao of Stanford followed this with a paper about wormhole teleportation in July.The wormhole gives an interesting geometric picture for how teleportation happens, Maldacena said.The message actually goes through the wormhole.Diving Into Wormholes In their paper, Diving Into Traversable Wormholes, published in Fortschritte der Physik , Maldacena, Stanford and Yang consider a wormhole of the new kind that connects two black holes: a parent black hole and a daughter one formed from half of the Hawking radiation given off by the parent as it evaporates.The two systems are as entangled as they can be.Here, the fate of the older black holes information is clear: It worms its way out of the daughter black hole.During an interview this month in his tranquil office at the IAS, Maldacena, a reserved Argentinian-American with a track record of influential insights, described his radical musings.On the right side of a chalk-dusty blackboard, Maldacena drew a faint picture of two black holes connected by the new traversable wormhole.On the left, he sketched a quantum teleportation experiment, performed by the famous fictional experimenters Alice and Bob, who are in possession of entangled quantum particles a and b , respectively.Say Alice wants to teleport a qubit q to Bob.She prepares a combined state of q and a , measures that combined state (reducing it to a pair of classical bits, 1 or 0), and sends the result of this measurement to Bob.He can then use this as a key for operating on b in a way that re-creates the state q .Voila, a unit of quantum information has teleported from one place to the other.Maldacena turned to the right side of the blackboard.You can do operations with a pair of black holes that are morally equivalent to what I discussed [about quantum teleportation].And in that picture, this message really goes through the wormhole.Juan Maldacena, a professor of physics at the Institute for Advanced Study.Sasha Maslov for Quanta Magazine Say Alice throws qubit q into black hole A.She then measures a particle of its Hawking radiation, a , and transmits the result of the measurement through the external universe to Bob, who can use this knowledge to operate on b , a Hawking particle coming out of black hole B. Bobs operation reconstructs q , which appears to pop out of B, a perfect match for the particle that fell into A.This is why some physicists are excited: Gao, Jafferis and Walls wormhole allows information to be recovered from black holes.In their paper, they set up their wormhole in a negatively curved space-time geometry that often serves as a useful, if unrealistic, playground for quantum gravity theorists.However, their wormhole idea seems to extend to the real world as long as two black holes are coupled in the right way: They have to be causally connected and then the nature of the interaction that we took is the simplest thing you can imagine, Jafferis explained.If you allow the Hawking radiation from one of the black holes to fall into the other, the two black holes become entangled, and the quantum information that falls into one can exit the other.The quantum-teleportation format precludes using these traversable wormholes as time machines.Anything that goes through the wormhole has to wait for Alices message to travel to Bob in the outside universe before it can exit Bobs black hole, so the wormhole doesnt offer any superluminal boost that could be exploited for time travel.It seems traversable wormholes might be permitted in nature as long as they offer no speed advantage.Traversable wormholes are like getting a bank loan, Gao, Jafferis and Wall wrote in their paper: You can only get one if you are rich enough not to need it.A Naive Octopus While traversable wormholes wont revolutionize space travel, according to Preskill the new wormhole discovery provides a promising resolution to the black hole firewall question by suggesting that there is no firewall at black hole horizons.Preskill said the discovery rescues what we call black hole complementarity, which means that the interior and exterior of the black hole are not really two different systems but rather two very different, complementary ways of looking at the same system.If complementarity holds, as is widely assumed, then in passing across a black hole horizon from one realm to the other, Contacts Ellie Arroway wouldnt notice anything strange.This seems more likely if, under certain conditions, she could even slide all the way through a Gao-Jafferis-Wall wormhole.The wormhole also safeguards unitaritythe principle that information is never lostat least for the entangled black holes being studied.Whatever falls into one black hole eventually exits the other as Hawking radiation, Preskill said, which can be thought of as in some sense a very scrambled copy of the black hole interior.Taking the findings to their logical conclusion, Preskill thinks it ought to be possible (at least for an infinitely advanced civilization) to influence the interior of one of these black holes by manipulating its radiation.This sounds crazy, he wrote in an email, but it might make sense if we can think of the radiation, which is entangled with the black holeEPRas being connected to the black hole interior by wormholes ER.Then tickling the radiation can send a message which can be read from inside the black hole!He added, We still have a ways to go, though, before we can flesh out this picture in more detail.Indeed, obstacles remain in the quest to generalize the new wormhole findings to a statement about the fate of all quantum information, or the meaning of ER = EPR.A sketch known as the octopus that expresses the ER = EPR idea.ARXIV:1306.0533V2 [HEP-TH] In Maldacena and Susskinds paper proposing ER = EPR, they included a sketch thats become known as the octopus: a black hole with tentacle-like wormholes leading to distant Hawking particles that have evaporated out of it.The authors explained that the sketch illustrates the entanglement pattern between the black hole and the Hawking radiation.We expect that this entanglement leads to the interior geometry of the black hole.But according to Matt Visser , a mathematician and general-relativity expert at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand who has studied wormholes since the 1990s, the most literal reading of the octopus picture doesnt work.The throats of wormholes formed from single Hawking particles would be so thin that qubits could never fit through.A traversable wormhole throat is transparent only to wave packets with size smaller than the throat radius, Visser explained.Big wave packets will simply bounce off any small wormhole throat without crossing to the other side.Stanford, who co-wrote the recent paper with Maldacena and Yang, acknowledged that this is a problem with the simplest interpretation of the ER = EPR idea, in which each particle of Hawking radiation has its own tentacle-like wormhole.However, a more speculative interpretation of ER = EPR that he and others have in mind does not suffer from this failing.The idea is that in order to recover the information from the Hawking radiation using this traversable wormhole, Stanford said, one has to gather the Hawking radiation together and act on it in a complicated way.This complicated collective measurement reveals information about the particles that fell in; it has the effect, he said, of creating a large, traversable wormhole out of the small and unhelpful octopus tentacles.The information would then propagate through this large wormhole.Maldacena added that, simply put, the theory of quantum gravity might have a new, generalized notion of geometry for which ER equals EPR.We think quantum gravity should obey this principle, he said.We view it more as a guide to the theory.In his 1994 popular science book, Black Holes and Time Warps, Kip Thorne celebrated the style of reasoning involved in wormhole research.No type of thought experiment pushes the laws of physics harder than the type triggered by Carl Sagans phone call to me, he wrote; thought experiments that ask, What things do the laws of physics permit an infinitely advanced civilization to do, and what things do the laws forbid?Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine , an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public

Space Photos of the Week: These Are The Moons You're Looking For:::::This humbling image, taken by the European Southern Observatorys VLT Survey Telescope in Chile, shows off one of the largest galaxy clusters we know of.The Fornax Cluster is a group of countless galaxies, some with large bubbles of material that seem to curve out from their galactic centers.This rich cluster is still one of the main ways scientists study galaxy mergers.One galaxy, dubbed NGC 1316, is especially noticeable here with large wispy loops jutting out from its glowing center.This elongated shadow was cast by one of Jupiters lesser known moons, Amalthea--and captured by the Juno spacecraft, currently orbiting the banded planet.The tiny satellite orbits just outside of Jupiters gossamer rings, and is the third closest moon to the planet.Just when you thought Mars couldnt get any weirder, a photo like this gets sent back from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.These strange squiggles live in a basin called Hellas Planitia.The fainter lines at the top of the image are simply sand ridges shaped by dust devils.But the more pronounced scratches at the bottom, called linear gullies, have a stranger origin story.Scientists think they form when carbon dioxide, frozen in the winter, thaws during the summer months and breaks off into blocks that carve these strange shapes.This colorful chromosphere flash spectrum image of the sun was taken during the solar eclipse on August 20.The suns chromosphere is the second layer of the suns atmosphere.Only some areas of the sun are observable with visible light, and others can only be seen during a total solar eclipse.Scientists took this rare opportunity to capture this red second layer of atmosphere as well as its spectrum of chemicals in the few seconds they had during totality.Last month, the Cassini orbiter sped through the cloud-tops of Saturn, where it ended its 13-year mission to study the planet and its moons in a dramatic suicide plunge.This black and white raw photo was one of its final snapshots, showing off the elegance of the gas giant from a distance of 581,000 miles.And see that tiny speck to the upper right, just outside the rings?Thats Pandora, one of Saturns innermost moons, sneaking into the image in a single pixel.Talk about an epic photobomb!The moon is seen here transiting (thats crossing in front of) the sun in this video released by NASAs Solar Dynamic Observatory.This transit, captured on October 19, took around 45 minutes.Hello moon, we know youre there.
Just How Much Food Do Cities Squander?:::::This story originally appeared on Citylab and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.Last winter, teams of researchers in three US cities donned goggles, gloves, and respirators, tore into bags of other peoples household garbage, and then pawed though the contents .Separating slimy banana peels from clumps of coffee grounds was dirty work, but it had a laudable goal: trying to get a handle on how much food waste could have been consumed or diverted before winding its way into the waste stream with a one-way ticket to the dump.The problems associated with urban food waste are no mystery.Proof of the problem is everywhere, in overflowing garbage bins and grime-slicked compost caddies.Food scraps contribute to the already sizable piles of refuse that cities must haul to landfills; shuttling edible castoffs to people in need requires labyrinthine routes and mind-boggling logistics ; and gases released by decomposing leftovers detract from cities work toward reining in emissions .But theres surprisingly little hard data about whos wasting what, and where, which makes it harder for cities to address the issue.To sniff out specifics, the engineering company Tetra Tech (in collaboration with the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Rockefeller Foundation) recruited more than 1,151 residents in Denver, New York, and Nashville.Of these, 631 supplied qualitative info in the form of kitchen diaries noting what they tossed and why.Researchers also inspected the contents of 277 residential trash bins, and 145 containers of commercial or industrial garbage.Now, the team has digested the data in a pair of reports , released Wednesday, that take stock of how food waste shakes out in these cities, and what they can do to clean up their act.Proportion of wasted food by sector.NRDC The researchers divided trashed food into three categories: stuff that is typically edible, questionably edible (including peels and cores), and inedible (such as pits, bones, and egg shells).They then tallied up findings from the bin digs and kitchen diaries to gauge how much is going to waste in each city.In Denver and New York, residents trashed the majority of the wasted food; in Nashville, the residential and restaurant sectors were neck and neck.Denverites trashed the most edible foodabout 7.5 pounds per household each weekfollowed by New York (5.4 pounds) and then Nashville (4.6 pounds).Overall, these sums are lower than previous estimates from ReFED , a consortium of food-centric organizations, which placed the weekly figure around 11.6 pounds per household.Across all three cities, coffee and grounds were the goods most often pitched in the trash, trailed by bananas (in Nashville and New York) and chicken (in Denver).Apples, bread, oranges, and potatoes also topped the list, as did discarded dairy products.Types of food wasted by city.NRDC In the accompanying kitchen diaries, respondents described why they opted to jettison these scraps.Forty-four percent of participants said they were getting rid of inedible portions; 20 percent reported moldy or spoiled food, and 11 percent indicated they werent interested in the leftovers.Only 4 percent of residents noted that theyd discarded food because it was past the date printed on the label, though perceived confusion over inscrutable labeling practices has spurred legislation to standardize and streamline best by and use by language.The reports also qualified attitudes toward waste.Most respondents preferred fruit without blemishes; still, more than half of the respondents said they always or mostly excised bruised portions and salvaged the rest of the fruit or vegetable.And though some indicated that squandering food felt morally icky, 58 percent of the respondents indicated less guilt about wasting food if they knew it was going to be composted.Judging by the kitchen diaries, though, most of the trashed food didnt end up in the compost bin53 percent went straight to the trash.In New York, which has a comparatively robust organics scheme, 37 percent of the self-reported discards ended up in the green bin.In Denver and Nashville, this figure was 24 percent and 28 percent, respectively, though respondents in Denver reported the highest rate of compost participation.The researchers flag that discrepancy, among other sticking points: At least in New York City, they found that participating in a compost program led to more overall waste, compared with families whose garbage all goes into a single stream.In other words: Compost-happy residents were disposing of more total scraps than residents who just threw the whole lot in the trash.To counter that trend, the reports authors recommend reminding consumers that preventing food waste is preferable to composting it.All this surplus food could be put to better use.An outrageous amount of food is wasted in our cities, yet at the same time many residents are in need, said Dana Gunders, a senior scientist at NRDC, in a statement.The other new report documents the ways that cities can push back against hunger and food insecurity, which continue to nag cities, suburbs, and rural regions despite the excess of edible food.Some 13.4 percent of Tennessee residents are food insecure, according to a 2016 report from the USDA .Across New York State, that figure is 12.5 percent; in Colorado, 10.3 percent of citizens struggle to reliably access nutritious food.The NRDC researchers compared current food rescue rates in the three cities to the maximum volume that could be intercepted, and found that its feasible to recoup tens of thousands of tons of packaged, raw, or prepared items across the board, from grocery stores, restaurants, caterers, coffee shops, schools, and more.In Denver, where 2,539 tons of food is currently rescued along the food chain, the researchers pinpoint an additional untapped potential of 4,232 tonsenough for about 7.1 million meals.These could go a long way in a city where nearly about 13 percent of residents lack reliable access to nutritious food.But that goal is a lofty one: It assumes that all of the local businesses and institutions will buy in.The researchers also spooled up a less ambitious projection, in which participation rates are more modestly scaled up from their current numbers.That model would still translate to 901 tons of food, or 1.5 million mealsbut it could require an infusion of $2 million to cover the cost of vehicles and storage space to accommodate the haul.More than a prescription, the research is a starting point.As more research in this vein is conducted, it will be easier to identify trends and potentially aggregate data for better extrapolation, better intervention designand eventually, less wasted food, the authors note.Urban areas can carry this charge, Gunders told me last year.Cities can be setting targets in their community, and elevating the profile of the issue and raising awareness, she said.Thats a nice foundation.They can take a look at their waste policies.Cities can also redesign trash management from the ground up.As I wrote last week , a band of architects in New York, backed by the Center for Architecture and the Rockefeller Foundation, laid out a series of design guidelines that approach trash as a design issue, and turn to clever planning and ingenious interiors to help alleviate the burden while getting the city closer to Mayor Bill de Blasios goal of schlepping zero waste to landfills by 2030 .That call for better engineering is echoed in some of the qualitative feedback in the NRDC reports.When asked what sorts of steps they hope their cities will take, most respondents gestured toward expanded compost programs or beefed-up public service campaigns.Others asked for more options, arrayed in a smarter and more durable way.Make it easier to compost and recycle, one participant wrote.Like many NYCers, I live in a small place and mice and cockroaches come up often.That means we keep our trash on a specific counter.Since we have to already split up our paper recycling, and have trash, there is no room for four bins!!!When we lived in San Francisco and we could throw all recycling in one bin, we composted a lot more often.Far from being a luxury, design thinking is something people should demand from cities, architects, and supers, said Benjamin Prosky, executive director of the Center for Architecture, at an event announcing the waste-reduction blueprint.Collecting, digesting, and acting upon ever-more-precise data can only sharpen its focus and impact.
Can You Figure Out What's Wrong in This Iron Man 3 Scene?:::::Late at night, I tend to flip through the channels just to see what's up.If there's a good movie on, I might watch part of itand recently, I stumbled on Iron Man 3 .I know what you're gonna saythat's a terrible superhero movie.But I disagree .Fantastic Four , now that's a terrible superhero movie.Iron Man 3 wasn't so bad.Especially not that part where Tony Stark has to go to the store and MacGyver his way into a temporary suit.However, I did notice something annoying in a scene near the end.Iron Man needs to recharge his suit, and he improvises by connecting two cables (one red and one black) from a car battery to his suit.When he is mostly charged up, he pulls off the cablesone at a time.First he pulls the red cable off and it creates a slight sparking effect.Right after that he pulls off the black cable and it also makes a spark.See the mistake?One of the cables could easily make a spark, but not both.But why?Of course that is the question.And now for the answer.What Causes a Spark?You can get a spark when air changes from an electrical insulator into an electrical conductor.This happens not at a certain electric potential difference (voltage) but at a certain electric field strength.Let me explain the difference with an example.Suppose you have two wires connected to a 9 volt battery with the free ends of the wires held just 1 centimeter apart.The electric potential difference between these two ends is 9 volts.That's probably not a huge surprise.If I move the wires closer together, they still make a 9 volt potential.However, the electric field depends on both the potential and the distance.As I move the wires closer together, the electric field gets stronger between the two wires.The electric field is the gradient of the electric potential and measured in units of volts/meter.I know you didn't like that example, so how about an analogy?Instead of electric stuff, I have a hill.The height of the hill is like the change in electric potential.The slope of the hill at some point would be the electric field.So now I have a 9 meter tall hill (instead of 9 volts).As the bottom and top of the hill move closer together (horizontally) the slope gets steeper.That's just like the difference between electric potential difference and the electric field.Bonus: Note the importance of calling the electric potential a "difference" or "change in"just like a hill, the change in height is the key, not just the top of the hill.Now back to sparks.A spark is created by a high electric field, not a high voltage.At about 3 x 106 Volts/meter, you get a spark in air.With a 9 volt battery (and assuming a constant electric field for simplicity), you would need two wires to get 3 micrometers apart to cause a spark.That's one super tiny spark.A Simple Electric Circuit But there are many cases where a spark is created even with low voltage.In order to understand this, let's first look at a simple circuitthe simplest circuit you could ever imagine.It consists of a battery and a wire.That's it.Here is what that might actually look like.Yes, that is just a battery and a wire.OK, technically there are two rare earth magnets in there toothey just are an easy way to connect the wire to the battery.And although this is a simple circuit, it's not very useful.In fact, it would be considered a short circuit since there isn't really anything in the path.Without a resistor or anything, the current will get higher than it normally would.This would make the wire get hotnot too crazy hot with just a D-cell battery, but still hot.What happens when I disconnect one of the wires?Let me show you.That wasn't very exciting.A More Complicated Electric Circuit Here is another circuit.Watch closely as I connect the final cable to the battery.It's dark so you can see better, but notice that there is a spark both when I connect the battery and when it is disconnected.Here is a picture of the whole circuit.There are two significant differences with this second circuit.First, I am using two 9 volt batteries instead of one D-cell battery (at just 1.5 volts).Second, I have another device in this circuita coil of wire (on the left).We call this an inductor.There is a pretty cool relationship between electric and magnetic fields and that's the basis of the inductor.Let me start with a simpler example.Suppose I have a coil of wire and a magnet.As I move the magnet in and out of this coil, it will produce an electric current.Here is an example of that.The device on the right is essentially a sensitive meter to detect electric currents (called a galvanometer).If you look carefully, you might be able to notice that a current is produced when the magnet is movingnot just when there is a magnetic field.There must be a changing magnetic field to produce a current.But what if I replaced this moving magnet with a coil of wire with a changing current running through it?It could produce the exact same effect as the moving magnet.Even betterI don't need two separate coils.With just one coil and a changing electric current, part of the coil will make a changing magnetic field that will induce an electric current in the other part of the coil.This is the essence of an inductor.Really, the best way to think of an inductor is as a device that produces a change in electric potential that is proportional to the rate of change of the electric current.When the current is constant, there is not electric potential difference across the inductor is zero volts.When the electric current is changing very rapidly (like going from some current to zero when you open a switch), the electric potential difference across the inductor can be huge.And here is the answer to sparking wires: If the circuit contains an inductor then opening or closing a switch (or pulling off a wire) will create a very large change in current (since it goes to zero).This huge current change makes a giant change in electric potential across the inductor.The giant electric potential difference means that you can get super high electric fields around the contact points.The electric field can be large enough to be at the 3 x 106 V/m level that would produce a spark.But wait!What if your circuit doesn't have an inductor in it?Here's a surprise for you: Every circuit is an inductor.Since every circuit makes a loop, it at least has some inductance in itso every circuit can spark when you open or close a switch.Only One Spark Back to the Iron Man scene.Why would there only be a spark on the first cable that is removed from suit?Let's step through this in parts.First, I assume that there is a large current running from the battery to the suit and then back to the battery.This is a complete circuiteverything is good.Second, Tony pulls off one of the cables.If there is an inductance in the suit (highly likely) then this rapid decrease in electric current would induce a large voltage to create a spark.Finally, Tony pulls off the other cable.But there's a big differencehe's already broken the circuit.No complete circuit means no electric current and no change in current.There shouldn't be a second spark.But in the end, it's just a movie and not real physics.Technically, this would be a scientific errorbut it doesn't really have any impact on the plot.And even if it was a plot-related error, that's OK (as I have said many times before).I still like Iron Man.
Torn Between the iPhone X and iPhone 8? Psychologists Have a Name for That:::::You know that feeling.TFW you're in the market for a new phone, and you can't decide which one to buy.For the past month, if you're an Apple fan, chances are you've been feeling that feel a bit more than usual.This year, like every year, Apple released new phonesthe iPhones 8 and 8 Plus.But they also released a newer phone.A "say hello to the future" phone.The iPhone X .It's got an edge-to-edge display , more and better cameras, and a certain je ne sais pas that justwait, no.Lol, no, you totally sais .It's the fanciest phone Apple's ever made.It goes on sale tonight.And lord help you, you want it.You want it so bad.But heavens, that price: $999, to start.Can you afford it?No.But financing.No!You're not falling for that again.You'll go with the iPhone 8 Plus.It's boring , but shut up, you will love it.But then wait, you forgot: The iPhone X also has that sick OLED screen, and emoji you control with your face !Totally worth the extra few hundred dollars.What price can you really put on a talking pile of poop?The answer is no price.Talking poop is priceless.Sounds like you have a tough decision to make.Turns out psychologists have names for this kind of decision, and the hemming and hawing that goes into it."It's a classic example of what we call a multi-attribute decision task," says Ben Newell , a cognitive psychologist at the University of New South Wales Sydney and co-author of Straight Choices: The Psychology of Decision Making .It's a fancy term for situations in which you consider multiple options, each with attributes you use to inform your decision.If you've ever shopped for a laptop, a TV, a blenderanything that lends itself to a spec-sheet comparison or a 20,000-word Wirecutter reviewyou've grappled with a multi-attribute decision.And the cell phone purchase is a particularly perfect example."When we run experiments that examine the kinds of choices people make and why they make them, we often have them decide between phones," Newell says.(Cars show up a lot, too. )They're easy to deconstruct into their constituent specifications, like the number and quality of their cameras, their screen sizes, the relative superiority of their displaysand, of course, their prices.The persnickety among you may even identify with what Newell calls a weighted additive strategy to decision making, whereby you assign each spec a number corresponding to its relative importance.(Which do you value more: a phone that fits in your back pocket, or a battery that doesn't die on the train home from work?If it's the latter, battery life gets a higher number than form factor.)When you're through, identifying your true desire is as simple as tallying the weighted values for each device.Simple in theory, anyway.In practice, almost no one bothers to run literal numbers on choices like these.Gadget lust has a way of undermining rational decisions.But even those, Newell says, are informed to some degree by intuitive atribute-weighing, which can quickly lead to waffling.And the timing of the iPhone X's release only complicates things further.A large body of research suggests that adding a third choice to a field of two options can affect people's appraisal of the original two alternatives.In other words: Humans base their purchasing decisions not just on the attributes of the product they're buying, but on the attributes of those they don't buy.Psychologists call these context effects, and one of the best studied is a phenomenon known as the compromise effect.Say you have two options (A and B) that differ on two dimensions (quality and affordability).Option A is nicer, but option B is cheaper.Adding a third option, C, that is super sweet but super pricey, produces the compromise effect: In the presence of option C, option A becomes a compromise option, and its attractiveness increases.It turns out Apple's 2017 iPhone lineup mimics the experimental conditions behind the compromise effect pretty closely.Here it is in chart form: In a choice between the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus, the latter is less affordable, but higher quality.When Apple adds the iPhone X to the lineup, the 8 Plus becomes a compromise between the X and the 8.Previous studies of human choice behavior reveal a phenomenon known as the compromise effect, by which adding a premium option to the decision field can increase the frequency with which the compromise is chosen.HOTLITTLEPOTATO In the case of the 8 and 8 Plus, the 8 is more affordable, but the Plus has more desireablecall them "high quality"features.Two cameras instead of one, more photography modes, bigger display, and so on.When Apple adds the iPhone X to the lineup, the 8 Plus becomes a compromise between the entry level 8 and the premium X."So this kind of perverse thing could happenif you believe the compromise effect will holdwhere the introduction of the X could cause sales of the 8 Plus to go up," Newell says.A couple big caveats apply here.One: This model ignores the influence of factors besides quality and affordability.It's easy to imagine a third vector that corresponds to the iPhone X's limited supply.Or a fourth linked to security concerns over FaceID .And two, this model assumes that the only phones in existence, as far as the consumer is concerned, are the iPhones 8, 8 Plus, and X. Hardcore fans may only have eyes for the company's newest products, but Apple itself sells eight versions of the iPhone, not counting color or storage configurations.Considerations like these may also help explain why demand for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus has been so weak this past month.(According to Reuters , more customers in the US have sprung for the iPhone 7 in recent weeks than its successor.)Will those numbers change after Friday, when Apple's iPhone X supply inevitably runs dry?Time will tell.In the meantime, keep an eye on those iPhone 8 Plus sales.It's no iPhone X, but I hear it's a solid choice.Not too basic.Not too pricey.Just right.
Telemedicine Is Forcing Doctors to Learn 'Webside' Manner:::::No one knew exactly when the girl would die, but everyone knew it would be soon.A 12-year-old with end stage cancer, the child's parents had recently moved her from the hospital to her home in the suburbs of Los Angeles.Some days later the girl's breath quickened, and her father phoned the family's hospice nurse.Please come, he said.He was worried about her breathing.The nurse knew the visit would require more than four hours of her time: a two-hour drive in each direction, plus her time with the girl.Why don't we connect over FaceTime, she asked.The father agreed, and they connected.The nurse asked the father to move his daughter gently to her side.Then to her back.To lift the child's shirt.To show her the expansion and contraction of the girl's rib cage.The nurse would ask: What do you see, what concerns you, and the father would explain.Then the nurse would do the same.In this fashion the pair examined the girlthe nurse on her computer, the father his iPad.Together they decided that the nurse's presence was not necessary, that the child had more time.Later, the father reported feeling comforted by the nurse.He appreciated her availability, the fact that she could see what he saw, and their ability to discuss it in real time."It's so unique, the visual image, and knowing that everyone is seeing and talking about the same phenomenon," says pediatrician David Steinhorn , director of palliative care at Children's National Medical Centerand the head of the telemedicine pilot the girl's family had been part of.An expert in the burgeoning field of telemedicine, Steinhorn believes in the power of digital tools to connect clinicians with their patients.But more important than the technology, he says, is what clinicians in the field have taken to calling "webside" manner.It's a modern twist on bedside mannera physician's ability to relate with a patient and convey their desire to help."My experience is that, once you get past some initial hurdles, you can maintain an intimate, immediate connection with patients that in some cases may be more therapeutically useful than even in-person interactions," Steinhorn says.But getting there isnt always easy.As anyone who's spent time on a video call knows, communicating via telepresence is very different from communicating in person.It's all the little things, says experimental psychologist Elizabeth Krupinski , associate director of evaluation for the telemedicine program at the University of Arizona.I mean, there's the technology bit, obviously.Webcam resolution, internet connection, and so on.And you have to think about your backdrop, your lighting, what you're wearing as well.But what you've really got to monitor is your behavior.Krupinski should know: U of A is one of the first schools in the country to incorporate telemedicine instruction into its medical school curricula."It sounds strange, but when you're on camera all your actions are magnified," Krupinski says.Sitting six feet away from your doctor, in person, you might not mind or notice her slouching, fidgeting, or gesticulating.But a webcam's intimate vantage point augments these actions in ways that patients can find distracting or off-putting."You take a sip of coffee and your mug takes up the whole screen, and all they hear is the sound of you slurping," she says."Or you turn away to make a note, and now all your patient sees is your shoulder.Maybe you disappear from the frame entirely."If these all sound like awfully little things for physicians to concern themselves with, well, you're right.But that's kind of the point.The considerations are so small and numerous that they can wind up overwhelming otherwise competent clinicians, interfering with their ability to connect with patients."There are some people who are great in person and you put them on camera they're a dead fish," Krupinski says.Some physicians are camera shy.(For others, the physical isolation can actually help them be more empatheticKrupinski says she's seen it both ways.)Telemedicine students are often instructed to disable their video chat's picture-in-picture feature."Turn it off and look at the patient," Krupinski says.That's also kind of tricky: To appear as though they're making eye contact, clinicians are taught to look not at the patient on their screen, but directly into their device's webcam.Some hospitals have gone so far as to design telemedicine clinics, purpose-built to address the peculiarities of virtual examinations."We try our best to control as much of the environment as we can, so the doctors can be doctors," says Jim Marcin , director of the pediatric telemedicine program at UC Davis.The room is staged like an office but with better lighting.There's a nice desk for the clinician to sit behind, a computer situated stage left, and books in the background.A physician taking a video call from home, or somewhere in the ICU, might wear a gaming headseta pair of brawny headphones, equipped with a micto ensure whatever the patient says isn't broadcast to anyone off-camera (a clear violation of patient privacy, Marcin says).But in the secluded confines of the telemedicine clinic, the whole room is mic-ed.The clinician can forego the gaming rig and focus on projecting a natural, empathetic presence.UC Davis' clinic is in many ways the polar opposite of what patients see when they use online services like Teladoc and HealthTap , which rely on networks of tens of thousands of doctors to deliver health care directly to users, often without ever having met.(Neither Teladoc nor HealthTap responded to request for comment.)Marcin, Krupinski, and Steinhorn all say their institutions use telemedicine primarily to follow up with patients they've already worked with in personsomething no longer required in the United States.(Texas was the holdout; earlier this year, it became the last state to allow physicians to connect with new patients virtually rather than first meeting in person.)Ad hoc, virtual visits can work great when a patient needs a quick diagnosis for a sore throat or weird rash.But many experts are skeptical of clinicians' ability to deliver compassionate, high-quality care to virtual strangers."Look, there's variation whether you see a clinician in person or whether you see them online, so I'm not saying in any way that telemedicine is less helpful than in-person visits, or that webside manner is worse than bedside manner," says UCSF pulmonologist Adams Dudley."But webside manner definitely requires more cooperation, and a different kind of cooperation, than bedside manner."That cooperation was often missing from doctor-patient interactions in a studyled by Dudley and published in JAMA Internal Medicine last yearthat investigated the quality of virtual urgent care.The researchers conducted their investigation secret-shopper style, sending dozens of trained patients to direct-to-consumer telemedicine companies.Their scripted symptoms reflected acute illnesses such as ankle pain, low back pain, and recurrent urinary tract infectionsand the researchers observed a huge range in quality of care and webside manner.But more concerning to Dudley was the infrequency with which clinicians referred their first-time patients to specialists in their area."Our ankle protocol was a situation where the clinician should have ordered X-rays.And in an ER, 90 percent of our test patients would have gotten it.But over telemedicine, fewer than 20 percent of patients were referred to radiologists."The reason for the disparity isn't totally clear, but Dudley has a hypothesis: If you're a doctor in Philadelphia diagnosing a patient in Albuquerque, you're not familiar with which local provider to refer them.It's the kind of problem that could be solved with some back and forth or an ongoing patient-doctor relationship.But absent both, a surprising number of clinicians wound up not connecting the dots."So yeah, it's terrible webside manner, and terrible care" says Dudley.Regardless of the current state of virtual care, conscientious providers are always looking to improve.That's why Steinhorn set up his pilot palliative care program in the first place.When he thinks back to the young cancer patient in LA, Steinhorn believes that telemedicine was able to provide the girl and her family support and reassurance.And it can help physicians, too."In my own interactions, Ive used telemedicine to see how a family 100 miles away is coping, that the scene I see in the home appears orderly, and that the family seems together, even in times of tension and distress," he says."And that's been reassuring.
A Massive Health Study on Booze, Brought to You by Big Alcohol:::::A little bit of booze, the conventional wisdom goes, can be good for you.But the evidence for that claimbeyond anecdotal accounts that a nip of whiskey can nip a cold in the budis surprisingly thin.Alcohol studies usually look backwards, comparing participants historical drinking habits with their health problems.But its hard to prove that alcohol caused those problems.The best alcohol study would randomly require people to either drink or abstainbut for many public health researchers, thats always seemed like a bridge too far.Today, though, the National Institutes of Health is planning just such an experiment.The Moderate Alcohol and Cardiovascular Health study, now in progress on four continents, is poised to be a breakthrough in public health: the first time that researchers have followed a group of people randomized to receive a daily drink or nothing at all.But its also the first time the NIH has offered the $1 trillion-plus alcoholic beverage industry a chance to sponsor a project.That exchange of money, along with the study leaders failure to guard against outside influence, are jeopardizing the studys credibility before it has even enrolled its first participant.The study has its origin, strangely enough, in tea.Back in 2006, researchers thought tea drinkers might have fewer heart attacks.So Kenneth Mukamal, an epidemiologist at the Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, recruited at-risk adults and told them to drink either three cups of black tea a day or three cups of water.Getting participants to stick to the program is notoriously difficult, so to make sure they were drinking their tea, Mukumal tested urine samples from a subgroup of participants for gallic acid, a tea breakdown product.After six months, they ran the numbers: Tea had virtually no effect on a persons cardiovascular risk.The results from the tea study may have been moot, but that gallic acid-measuring test was the proof of concept Mukamal needed for a different study.In 2008, Mukamal began giving participants an alcoholic drinka mix of ethanol with Crystal Light or a Kraft lemonade mixcomparing their health markers to a control group that got lemonade without the booze.But people wouldnt drink the ethanol.Like in the tea study, Mukamal was tracking whether his participants stuck to the program, and a blood test that rises with alcohol intake was actually higher in the non-alcoholic group than the alcohol group.A randomized trial to test alcohols benefits, Mukamal concluded, would have to let the participants choose a drink they actually liked.Enter the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.In 2014, the institute solicited Mukamal to plan a six-year study of 7,000 subjects at risk of heart disease, pitting a daily alcoholic drink against total abstinence.Theyd track heart attacks, strokes, heart-related chest pain, and deaththe most comprehensive study of the heart impacts of daily drinking ever done, focusing on adults 50 and over.Instead of giving subjects a mix prepared by research pharmacists, though, the study would reimburse them for the drink of their choice.Paying for more than 3,500 daily drinks for six years, it turns out, is expensive.The NIH would need more fundingand soon, a team stepped up to the plate.The Foundation of the NIH, a little-known 20-year-old non-profit that calls on donors to support NIH science, was talking to alcohol corporations.By the fall of 2014, the study was relying on the industry for separate contributions to the Foundation of the NIH beyond what the NIAAA could afford, as Mukamal put it in an e-mail to a prospective collaborator.Later that year, Congress encouraged the NIH to sponsor the study, but lawmakers didnt provide any money.Five corporationsAnheuser-Busch InBev, Diageo, Pernod Ricard, Heineken, and Carlsberghave since provided a total of $67 million.The foundation is seeking another $23 million, according to its director of development, Julie Wolf-Rodda.The NIH has run into similar ethical problems before.In 2012, the National Football League made a $30 million donation to support research on sports-related medical problems.Later, when the NIH funded an expert on football-related brain injury whom the League disapproved of, NFL representatives contacted senior NIH officers about it.A 2016 Congressional investigation faulted the NFL for attempting to use its donation as leverage to steer [research] funding away from one of its critics.But the investigation also concluded that the Foundation didnt do enough to protect the NIH from its NFL funders.To protect the alcohol study from the influence of its funders, the Foundation uses detailed letters of agreement: Companies are obliged to accept NIH control of the projects scientific and administrative aspects and barred from attempting to influence its design or conduct, and from trying to access non-public project results.Those agreements were in place during the NFL deal, and Wolf-Rodda says the organization has since tightened the language in its agreements, making the rules now a little bit clearer and harder for people to overlook.Both Mukamal and Peggy Murray, a senior leader at NIAAA and the NIH staff scientist on the trial, say they havent spoken to anyone from the alcohol industry about the project, another important wall to prevent any influence, intentional or not, from the companies.But for some scholars, there is no right way to involve the industry in investigating alcohols benefits.Its a clear conflict of interest if the industry thats going to profit from the findings of the research is funding it, says David Jernigan, head of the Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.Richard Saitz of Boston Universitys School of Public Health compares the situation to the tobacco industrys support of research that raised doubts about the risks of smoking.In some circumstances, he says, a firewall is just not quite enough.And although the study has not yet begun recruiting subjects, the medical community has already found reason to validate those concerns.
New Science Could Sharpen Crispr's Gene-Editing Scalpel:::::Stay on target.Thats the mantra you hear in labs and biotech companies around the world as they snip away at DNA.All the techniques for gene editingfrom the famous Crispr-Cas9 to the older TALENs and zinc-finger nucleases share a problem: Sometimes they dont work.Which is to say, they have off-target effects , changing a gene you dont want changed or failing to change a gene that you do.And DNA is not something you want poorly rewired.That goes double if youre trying to make money; companies working on genome-editing based products are valued in the billions of dollars .Thats why two scientific articles published today in the journals Nature and Science are so importantthey tune genome editing up.The Nature paper chases precision at a literally basic levelthe bases, the As, Gs, Cs, and Ts that are the individual units in the genetic code.Crispr-Cas9 works by slicing through the two strands of bases that spiral to create DNAs famous double-helix.But another approach, single base editing, actually converts one base into anothersince the bases pair in predictable ways, A to T and G to C, that modification flips a single genetic bit.Until now, scientists have only been able to change a G-C base pair into an A-T base pair.The new paper takes the other angle, describing an editor that changes adeninethe Ainto a base called inosine, which the cells protein-building machinery reads as guanine, the G. When that molecular machine puts a little nick in the complementary strand of DNA across the gap where the T is, the cells DNA repair machinery fixes it by slotting in a C. In other words, its an A-T to G-C base edit.How cool is that?This class of mutation, changing a G-C to an A-T, accounts for about half of the 32,000 known pathogenic point mutations in humans, says David Liu , the Harvard chemist whose lab did the work.Lius lab has already used this editor to fixin cell culturesthe mutation that causes hereditary hemochromatosis, which causes a person to retain too much iron, and to treat sickle-cell anemia.Getting there wasnt easy.In biology, changing one molecule into another is usually the job of a natural nanotechnological marvel called an enzyme.Enzymes that turn adenine into inosine are called adenine deaminases, but none exists thatll transmogrify adenine embedded in a strand of DNA.So Lius team built one, putting engineered bacteria under evolutionary pressure until it built an enzyme that would target As in DNA.And it goes to the right A, too.One of Crisprs components is a molecule of guide RNA, a length of genetic stuff that points to a target like the scrap of clothing you hand a bloodhound before a hunt.Lius editor uses that part.Normally Crispr-Cas9 makes a double-stranded cut in the DNA, Liu says.We used a form of Crispr-Cas9 thats crippled.It cannot cut the DNA.But it still stays on target.The research in the Science paper takes a different tack on A-to-G conversion.This one, from the lab of Broad Institute researcher Feng Zhang, incorporates an adenosine deaminase (a molecular cousin of the adenine deaminase in the Liu paper) into Crispr-Cas13, a variant genome editor that works on RNAthe copy of DNA that cellular machinery reads to build proteins.Zhangs team calls it RNA Editing for Programmable A to I Replacement, or Repair, proving that if the fights over Crisprs genesis and patent have taught researchers anything, its to come up with better names.Because it acts on RNA, Repair makes a transient change, which could be good for treating problems like acute inflammation or woundspotentially dangerous, but you wouldnt want to turn off someones inflammatory response permanently.There are 12 possible base changes you can do, says Omar Abudayyeh , a researcher at the Broad Institute and one of the papers authors.Now were thinking about the ways to do the other 11.But both approaches attempt to sharpen Crisprs scalpel.With typical Crispr-Cas9 in DNA, the problem isnt the cut; its the repair, which can cause a kind of genetic scarring, so-called stochastic insertions or deletions, or indelsadditional bases tossed in, or a few removed.When you make a double-stranded break in the genome, the cell tries to get the ends back together, and most of the time its successful, Liu says.But every now and then, the cell just can't quite put Humptys DNA together again.If your goal is to seriously bork a gene, indels can be great.But if youre trying to splice in a new stretch of DNA, they're a problem.By operating on RNA, Crispr-Cas13 avoids all that.RNA repair doesnt involve indels, for one thing.And: Theres always a concern for off-target effects with these types of systems, Abudayyeh says.But with RNA you have to think about off-targets a little differently.A miswired stretch of DNA means all the RNA transcribed from it and all the protein translated from the RNA will be busted.If some of the RNA in a cell gets edited correctly and some doesnt, that means the cell will have at least some amount of the right protein.If things go really wrong, the edit is reversible.You can always remove the system, and the RNA will eventually degrade and recycle and revert back to normal, Abudayyeh says.Likewise, editing of DNA that relies on base-pair modification instead of double-stranded cuts gets around some of those other limitations.Davids work follows on his earlier innovative efforts to do genome editing without a double-strand break, says Fyodor Urnov, associate director of the Altius Institute for Biomedical Sciences.And Zhangs work adds to the toolbox by giving us an enzyme that can edit RNA in a precise fashion.Those kind of tools are much in demand.In June 2017, a letter from researchers published in Nature Methods asserted that in addition to the indel problem Crispr messed up the genome in a whole lot of weird ways.Crispr researchers quickly rallied to dismantle the papers methods and analysis, but they all acknowledge that some applications of Crispr-Cas9 yield better results than others.Why bother?Because theres more than just new drugs, new drought-resistant crops, and new materials on the line.A half-dozen or more companies have gotten venture capital to work on Crispr-powered products.Liu, Zhang, and Joung, along with the researcher George Church, are all co-founders of one of the big ones, Editas Medicine .Crispr-Cas9 co-inventor Jennifer Doudna was once on that team as well.Editas and the like-minded companies Intellia and Crispr Therapeutics briefly lost tens of millions in valuation on the publication of that Nature Methods paper.A fight over who actually invented Crispr-Cas9 is ongoing with UC Berkeley, Doudna, and her co-author Emanuelle Charpentier on one side and Church, Zhang, and the Broad Institute on the other.So its critical that Crispr-Cas9 and its follow-on technologies work.Lius single-base editors are a long way from becoming a therapeutic, but multiple modified organisms and treatments made with Crispr-Cas9 are in the approval pipeline.Genome editing is still working on finding the bullseye in the depths of cells, but its also aiming at financial ones, and at changing the world.Its going to need one hell of a good targeting system.
The Guardian GT's 7-Foot-Long Arms Make It the Most Bonkers Robot on Earth:::::Like with jetpacks and flying cars, the Power Loader from Aliens is a robot weve been promised for a long time.Thatd be the exoskeleton that Sigourney Weaver donned to beat the tar out of the movies eponymous alien Queen , of course.Jetpacks are kinda here , flying cars almost , and now a real-life Power Loader has finally arrived, and its orders of magnitude more impressive than the suit of fiction.Behold the Guardian GT from Sarcos Robotics, which in all honesty is full-tilt bonkers.Bonkers in the sense that unlike the clunky Power Loader, these 7-foot-long arms replicate human motions with incredible smoothness and accuracy, each limb lifting 500 pounds, then turning around and manipulating the most delicate of objects.Watching it in action is both hypnotic and highly unsettling.A big problem in robotics right now is manipulation .You take for granted how easy it is for you to, say, pick up a piece of paper off a table.But imagine a robot trying that with clutzy metal fingers.No matter how strong a robot may be, its still miles away from human dexterity.Sarcos Robotics But with the Guardian GT has a couple of advantages that make it remarkably dexterous.For one, it's kinematically equivalent, meaning it's arranged like a human, so the operator is controlling what is essentially a sized-up version of their own body.The distance between those stereo cameras and the shoulder is the same ratio as you have in your own human body, says Ben Wolff, CEO of Sarcos.Same goes for the distance between the shoulder and the elbow and the elbow and the wrist.So it's very intuitive.That kinematic equivalent concept enables a brand new operator with no training at all to be able to get into the machine.On top of that, the robot uses force feedback, so the operator can feel the environment through the machine's hand (which consists of three fingers instead of five).Imagine trying to lift a mug if you could see it but not feel it.With force feedback, the pilot can feel when the robot's hand makes contact with even small objects like switches and buttons.The robot can even pop open an electrical box with the tippy-tip of one of its fingers.The Guardian GT also has a dexterity advantage over other humanoid robots because it's all custom-built.Sarcos didn't buy hands (known more formally as end effectors) from a hand company and slap them on arms from somewhere else.Everything is customized to work in harmony.While it all may look effortless, its not as if the operator isn't feeling a thing when they lift a 1,000-pound pipe.That's a little disorienting, so we give a little bit of load into the arm, Wolff says.Meaning, the robot pushes back a tiny bit.So instead of lifting a thousand pounds you feel like you're lifting five.(How its able to do this without the herky-jerkiness of other robots comes down to special actuators, the bits that move and bend the arms.What exactly is special about them, Wolff declines to say, because hes a good businessman.)Just imagine this thing on a construction site.Doing something like lifting and joining two pipes would require a crane and maybe five or six workers, who would be freed up to do other jobs that require a more human touch (fine manipulation, for instance).With the Guardian GT, all it takes is one supercharged human.It still requires a lot of coordination, sure, but the robot takes the strain out of the equation.Whats interesting about this workplace robot is that its collaborativea human is always in control.And thats what the future of work looks like, especially heavy industry.Fields like construction and agriculture are already facing severe labor shortages, and the machines are poised to pick up the slack.Think automated construction tractors and robots that help humans harvest crops without all the stooping.In the very near future well be working alongside robots, as opposed to robots outright replacing us.Sarcos Robotics So the death of human labor, it seems, has been greatly exaggerated.While I think that we will see increasing amounts of autonomy and AI, says Wolff, I think the real role in work generally is for us to find as humans how to maximize the utility of robots.Allow them to do what they're really good at while still relying on what humans are best at, which is wisdom and judgment.Then there are the jobs that humans simply cant do.Because the Guardian GT rolls on either tracks or wheels, the operator can drive it into danger.Think exploring toxic environments and decommissioning nuclear power plants.With the inherent dexterity of the machine, it could easily manipulate things made for humans hands, like valves and buttons.And, if the time comes, it might save us all from aliens.But lets hope it doesnt come to that.
These Neurons are Alive and Firing. And You Can Watch Them In 3-D:::::For patients with epilepsy , or cancerous brain lesions, sometimes the only way to forward is down.Down past the scalp and into the skull, down through healthy grey matter to get at a tumor or the overactive network causing seizures.At the end of the surgery, all that extra white and grey matter gets tossed in the trash or an incinerator.Well, not all of it.At least, not in Seattle.For the last few years, doctors at a number of hospitals in the Emerald City have been saving those little bits and blobs of brain, sticking them on ice, and rushing them off in a white van across town to the Allen Institute for Brain Science.Scientists there have been keeping the tissue on life support long enough to tease out how individual neurons look, act, and communicate.And today theyre sharing the first peek at these cells in a freely available public database .It provides a more intimate, intricate look into the circuitry of the human brain than ever before.And its just the beginning of a much larger effort to build a complete catalog of human brain cells.This first release includes electrical readings from a few hundred living neuronsall recently removed from 36 neurosurgery patients in Seattle area hospitals.For 100 of those cells, Allen Institute researchers built 3-D models of their branching structures, which they can use to simulate patterns of pulses and zaps.Scientists can see where in the brain neurons start and stop, and how current flows and spreads a signal throughout a neuronal networksignals that might move a muscle, or make a memory.Allen Institute for Brain Science Thirty minutes ago that was part of someones brain, maybe even the part that holds the memory of their first kiss, says Christof Koch, chief scientist and president of the Allen Institute for Brain Science.No one has had access like this before, to healthy brain tissue at the level of individual neurons.Because of the particular peskiness of studying the human brain , most brain maps are built from mice or post-mortem human tissue.Dead brain cells can tell you a lot about shape; you can stain em and characterize their morphology.But they cant tell you anything about the function of circuitsbecause they dont fire.So to keep the post-op cells alive and kicking, doctors pack the pea-sized tissue on ice.They need to keep the brain bit as close to freezing as possibleabout 4 degrees centigradeto slow down metabolism and prevent the tissue from deteriorating.Once it arrives at the Allen Institute, researchers slice the sample into many dozens of sections no thinner than a silicon wafer .Each slice is loaded into special containers Allen scientists developed to keep the tissue on life support.They look kind of like little baskets, floating around a tiny pump that bubbles in a life-sustaining stream of oxygen.Thats enough time for people like Jonathan Ting, an assistant investigator at the Allen, to isolate individual neurons and push and prod them with glass electrodes.By forming a super-tight connection with the cellwhats called a giga-ohm sealhe can measure how it spikes in response to little shocks of energy.Each pattern of spikes acts as a signature that helps identify the function of a neuronmaybe this one forms a thought, while that one feels a feeling.For 150 years neuroscientists have classified cells by the way they looked, says Ting.But, he says, like describing a person, how much can you really know about someone just by looking at them?What about how they talk?How they act?What about their social network?All these different things paint a clearer picture of who a person is.Its the same in neuroscience, says Ting.Were just starting to align morphology with electrical behavior with genetic expression.In addition to the recordings and 3-D renderings released today, the Allen Institutes database now also contains gene expression profiles for nearly 16,000 individual neurons.This emerging field, known as single cell transcriptomics, lets scientists see all the genes that turn on in different kinds of brain cells.And on Monday, the National Institutes of Health awarded the Allen Institute and its collaborators $100 million to continue classifying human brain cells based on their shape, physiology, connective properties, and gene expression.The largest bit of the grants, though, will go toward creating a comprehensive atlas of cell types in the mouse brain, which would be a first for mammals.That effort is part of the federal governments 2013 Brain Initiative, which aims to understand brain circuits well enough to devise new therapies for diseases like epilepsy, Alzheimers, and muscular dystrophy.John Ngai, a cell biologist at UC Berkeley, is partnering with the Allen and four other institutions to document all the cells in the rodent brain over the next five years, which at just about the shape of a sugar cube, is roughly the size of just one of the Allens human brain bits.Unlike those tissue samples though, a mouse brain is completeits got all the parts, from the frontal lobe to the medulla oblongata.And while it may not be as complex as the human brain, simplicity is a plus when youre attempting the first complete cranial catalogue for a warm-blooded creature.Just how much is left to discover?Almost everything, says Ngai.We could double our knowledge base in the next five years and still have over 99.9 percent left to learn.These atlasing projects are really about trying to understand the hardware inside the human head.And to hope like crazy that it provides some insight into the uniquely human aspects of brain function.
SpaceX Keeps Lining Up Covert Military Launches:::::Last September, SpaceX was fueling its Falcon 9 for a routine test fire before launch when a composite liner inside the upper-stage fuel tank failed, letting oxygen seep in.Friction between the tanks aluminum liner and carbon overwrap ignited a towering inferno that engulfed the rocket, the launch pad, and a $200 million satellite owned by Israeli firm Spacecom.It was SpaceXs second disaster in 14 monthspreceded by the explosion of a Falcon 9 heading to the International Space Station in June of 2015.But far be it from Spacecom to get scared off by a little fire and brimstone .According to a Hebrew-language press release published last week , the company will attempt to launch another satellite atop a reusable Falcon 9 rocket in 2019a freebie to make up for the first kablooie.And after that, theyve signed up for another SpaceX launch in 2020.Somehow, it seems, SpaceX has restored confidence in its customers after its failures in 2015 and 2016.This year, it has launched 15 missions, reusing three of its boosters.On that string of successes, Spacecom is returning to SpaceXs launch manifest along with an array of customers lining up for dramatically low pricesand the opportunity to sign up for an even cheaper recycled booster launch.The value proposition is even appealing to that most cagey of customers: the United States military.SpaceX owes a great deal of its reputationand its $21 billion valuationto its repeat customers.In 2013, Luxembourg-based communications provider SES took a risk to fly atop the first Falcon 9 rocket to geostationary orbit.In return, SpaceX offered SES the first reusable orbital rocket launch in aerospace history and all the free publicity that came along with it.The historic mission launched on March 30, and on October 11, SpaceX fired off its third reusable rocket, carrying another SES payload.Another loyal customer, Iridium, indicated last week that its next two SpaceX launches would fly on reusable boosters.I think youre already seeing the commercial satellite industry realize the impact flight proven boosters could have on the market, says former White House space advisor and former SpaceX official Phil Larson.Some are contributing to the overall push for this new capability.The main advantage for SpaceX is obvious: price.Going on just the advertised prices from both SpaceX and competitor United Launch Alliance for the cheapest mission, the difference in costs before taxes and insurance is about $47 million.Elon Musk claims that cost difference for certain launches could exceed $300 millionwhich is the average cost of a satellite.So flying with SpaceX means satellite is basically free, the billionaire tweeted.Which is how SpaceX finally broke into the public sector.In May of 2015, SpaceX won a lawsuit to end the monopoly on Air Force missions held by United Launch Allianceand today, the Air Force is a satisfied and enthusiastic customer.The head of US Space Command, John W. Raymond, told Bloomberg that it would be absolutely foolish not to be utilizing recycled rockets in the future.And SpaceX would be foolish not to fight for those military contracts, which are the biggest it gets.So far, its done well: SpaceX launched its first national security mission earlier this year for the National Reconnaissance Office and followed that clandestine mission with another.In early September, as Hurricane Irma approached Floridas coast, SpaceX launched the secretive Boeing-built X-37B spaceplane for the Air Force.And just last week, SpaceX slated another top-secret missioncode-named Zumain between already planned launches in November.Documents obtained by WIRED point to a classified payload built by Northrop Grumman for the military.The details of the launch are heavily under wraps.Next door to the Air Force at Cape Canaveral is NASA, another customer burned by SpaceX.In June of 2015, SpaceX lost an agency resupply haul bound for the International Space Station when the Falcon 9 exploded minutes after liftoff.But like Spacecom, the agency bounced back .Since the explosion, SpaceX has completed five successful resupply missions for NASAand its making progress toward flying NASA astronauts to the space station in late 2018.NASAs interest in SpaceXs reusable technology seems to be growing as well.Sources at Kennedy Space Center tell WIRED that NASA and SpaceX have preliminarily agreed to launch the next two cargo resupply missions to ISS atop reusable rockets.The agency also announced last week that it has contracted SpaceX to launch the collaborative Sentinel-6A mission in 2020 to gather ocean topography data.Today, SpaceXs mission cadence puts them in a dead heat with the Russians for 2017 launches.Vice President Mike Pence didnt seem to notice, though, as he held the first National Space Council meeting on October 5.America seems to have lost our edge in space, Pence said.SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell sat on the panel, perplexed.
Chasing the Illegal Loggers Looting the Amazon Forest:::::The cargo ship Yacu Kallpa rode impatiently at anchor off Iquitos, Peru, a ramshackle city on a bend in the broad, turbulent waters of the Amazon River.She was a midsize ship, a tenth of a mile long, low-slung, with a seven-story superstructure in the stern and plumes of rust fanning down the hull from her main deck scuppers.She was like any other cargo ship in the world, but with a dark history.At that moment, in November 2015, she needed to get out of town fast.The captain and crew had a long run ahead, nearly 2,300 miles down the Amazon, then another 4,000 miles north to Tampico, Mexico, and finally to Houston, with lumber harvested from the Amazon rain forest.It was a route the ship and its predecessors had run hundreds of times for more than 40 years, hauling millions of pounds of timber at a time, to supply lumberyards and big-box stores across the United States with the ingredients for the floors, decks, and doors of the typical American home.In Iquitos, the waters were too shallow for the Yacu Kallpa to dock amid the tin-roofed stilt houses and the brightly painted tourist boats that lined the riverfront.So small workboats were ferrying stacks of lumber from shore, to be lifted into the hold by two onboard cranes.This was a job that could take two weeks under the best of circumstances.The longer it took, the more time customs officials had to prove that the lumber being heaved aboard the Yacu Kallpa had no business being there at all.Related Stories A Curious Plan to Save the Environment With the Blockchain All the Trees Will Die, and Then So Will You Environmental Justice Enters Its Age of Anxiety As the loading crews worked, 35 inspectors from a government agency called Organismo de Supervisin de los Recursos Forestales y de Fauna Silvestre (Osinfor) were slogging through forests all around Loreto Province.The inspectors were armed with handheld GPS navigators and a few batches of documents that listed the supposed harvest sites and the species of trees on the ship.More often than not, as they visited the sites listed on the paperwork, they found no evidence that any trees had been cut down thereno stumps, no debris, no disturbancemuch less the trees listed on the documents.Sometimes there was no suggestion that trees ever grew there in the first place.Theyd leave a mark in spray paint and jot a note on a report: No existe en un radio 50m , shorthand for no trees logged here, nor within 50 meters in any direction.The vast scale of illegal logging in the Peruvian Amazon has long been an open secret.Government officials didnt care, and until recently there was little anyone else could do to stop it.Local activists often died trying.But for a few defiant government agents, this time there was hope.The urgent question: Could they finally prove that enough trees came from illegal logging sites for prosecutors to stop the ship from sending its cargo into the US market?As the Osinfor inspectors pushed deeper into the Amazonian forests and dockworkers hurried to load the ship, 30 or so staffers at the Environmental Investigation Agency, a nonprofit organization, waited nervously in an office just off Dupont Circle in Washington, DC.They had been developing methods to tie the ship to illegal logging for four years.But at this moment, they just had to wait and see what would happen next.It was up to government agents in Peru and Washington to make stick all the work the EIA staffers and forest inspectors in Peru had done.If everything went right, this would be the last voyage of the Yacu Kallpa .The vast scale of illegal logging in the Peruvian Amazon has long been an open secret.Ian Allen The Environmental Investigation Agency got its start in the mid-1980s when a trio of Greenpeace investigators became disenchanted with that organizations increasing scale and incendiary tactics.The idea was that the new organization should stay smalland focused on environmental crimes.Over the years, the EIAs investigators have made a reputation for meticulously assembling detailed evidence of criminal behavior, via undercover work, in some of the most dangerous corners of the world.One such investigator is a mild, studious figure named Alexander von Bismarck, now 45 years old, tall and thin with close-cropped red hair retreating at the temples to form a widows peak.Von Bismarck grew up spending part of each year with his American mother in the United States and part with his father in Germany.He graduated from Harvard on what he calls the 12-year plan, after a diversion to try his hand as a professional equestrian show jumper, another to study the demise of cichlids in Ugandas Lake Victoria, and finally a tour in the Marines, where he trained as a scout swimmer for an amphibious landing unit.If his name brings to mind Otto von Bismarck, the 19th-century German statesman and grand European strategist, thats because he is descended from the Iron Chancellors brother (a potato farmer, he notes).A penchant for strategic thinking nonetheless persists.EIA chief Alexander von Bismarck.Ian Allen In 2005, von Bismarck set out to persuade Congress to amend the Lacey Act, the nations chief law against trafficking in stolen wildlife.The ambition was to include stolen forests too, making it a federal crime to import illegally harvested plants.Von Bismarck was able to help forge what was later termed a Baptist-bootlegger alliance with US timber producers, who were ready to push for the amendment because, by their own estimate, competition from illegally imported timber was costing them $1 billion a year.As the amendment was under debate, one of von Bismarcks undercover investigations revealed that new terrorism-resistant doors ordered for the US Capitol building may have been supplied by an illegal timber-trafficking network in Honduras, and the wood may have been harvested illegally from a Unesco World Heritage Site.The contract for the doors was quietly canceled.(Other doors from the same source allegedly ended up at Mar-a-Lago, according to von Bismarck.)The Lacey Act amendment sailed through Congress and became law in May 2008.Von Bismarck, who became executive director of the Environmental Investigation Agency in 2007, credits his tour in the Marines with giving him the operational awareness for undercover work.He once tracked wood from a protected tree species stolen from a habitat for endangered orangutans in Indonesia to baby cribs being sold by Walmart in the United States.He and other EIA agents also went undercover in the Russian Far East and helped prove that Lumber Liquidators was knowingly buying hardwood flooring made from illegal timber taken from the last remaining home of the critically endangered Siberian tiger.(Lumber Liquidators pleaded guilty to violations under the Lacey Act and agreed in 2015 to pay a $13.2 million penalty.)Of the logging industry, von Bismarck says: So many of them would love to have a system based on legal woodso many of them feel trapped in a system that is a race to the bottom.He pauses.Then he adds, But some guys just need to go to jail.Swaths of the Amazon forest in Peru are protectedin theory.Ian Allen In 2009, with the Lacey Act amendment in place, von Bismarck began trying to figure out how to make a case with the new law.A trade deal between the United States and Peru was just going into effect, and it included new penalties for illegal logging and made Osinfor an independent agency.Von Bismarck saw an opportunity.He and Andrea Johnson, then director of the EIAs forest campaign, hired a Peruvian journalist named Julia Urrunaga, who had spent 15 years investigating corruption for Perus leading newspapers.Urrunaga is a happy warrior sort, 47 years old, just over 5 feet tall, with a great mane of curly light-brown hair.Im a journalist.I didnt know much about forestry, she admits.She and Johnson, blue-eyed, freckle-faced, and also 5 feet tall, with a degree from Yales forestry school, set off to find out exactly how the lumber business worked.They visited river ports, attended endless meetings, and interviewed people about life in the logging camps.Then, one day out of the blue, an email arrived at the EIA office in Peru.It came from an Italian immigrant in Iquitos named Francesco Mantuano, who said he had been duped into buying a logging concession for what he imagined would be a lazy jungle retirement.Instead, he found himself entangled with the wood mafia, as he called it, in a deeply dishonest business that was sweeping away the rain forest in a maelstrom of semi-slave exploitation, social and environmental changes and looting of biodiversity.Urrunaga was suspicious at first.Maybe someone was sending us the perfect case to lead us to a horrible mistake, she says.But she was also curious, so she and Johnson headed to Iquitos.They found Mantuanoa rail-thin, wildly gesticulating Italian, Johnson sayswith a friend, an Iquitos native.The two men spent their afternoons sipping coffee and smoking in sidewalk cafs, as though Iquitos were Milan and not this chaotic frontier river city where the mufflerless moped taxis drown out anything you say whenever the light turns green, she adds.Urrunaga and Johnson joined the two at their habitual caf to hear out their tales.According to Urrunaga, Mantuano said he had bought into a concession with large stands of trees approved for harvest by the national forest authority.But when timber crews showed up, they left far too quickly to actually have cut the trees they had supposedly purchased.Then the timber merchants expected him to hand over transit documents for large amounts of lumber.The intent, he gradually realized, was to launder timber that had already been illegally cut elsewhereplaces like national parks, indigenous community lands, and other protected areas.Mantuano launched an indignant letter-writing campaign to explain all this to officials in Lima and Washington.But his efforts produced no investigation until Johnson and Urrunaga showed up.Mantuanos story backed up what the EIA was already beginning to suspect: The logging industrys basic operating method was to cut down trees on protected lands and then produce falsified permits, either purchased on the black market or via corrupt government officials.The permits typically listed legal sitesbut ones that often were remote, or sparsely forested, and thus wouldnt yield big profits.Meanwhile, Perus Amazonian rain forests were being destroyed at a rate of 400,000 acres every yearan area larger than the city of Los Angeles.The women could piece together the pattern.But there was a hitch.After a tree was cut down and loaded onto a ship for export, there was no way to prove where it came from.As they compared Mantuanos documents and data with their own, Johnson and Urrunaga started thinking: Why not prove where the trees didnt come from?The key was to compare export documents detailing where protected species, like mahogany and cedar, were supposedly harvested with Osinfor inspections of those areas.The remoteness of the place made cutting timber there about as practical as harvesting trees on the moon.It took nine months of pestering government officials in Lima, but finally the EIA received thousands of pages of crappy photocopies, Urrunaga says.As they waded through them, Johnson and Urrunaga could see, for the first time, where the trees had supposedly been harvested, right next to data on the ships that had sailed away with that wood.Some of those areaslike the most remote parts of Mantuanos concessionhadnt yet been inspected by Osinfor.Now they would just have to follow the paper trail back to the forest themselves.With data from one of the ships many voyages in hand, Johnson set off on a field trip.It took her three days by boat upriver from Iquitos, then a day of hiking into land owned by an indigenous community, and another two days slogging deeper into the forest, trying to find a way aroundand then acrossa dense, almost impassable palm swamp.Exhausted, drenched in sweat, and wiping swarms of insects from her forehead, she finally reached the harvest location.Cedar trees from the site had supposedly been exported to a company named Global Plywood & Lumber, incorporated in Las Vegas, but no one had ever cut trees from anywhere around her.The remoteness of the place made cutting timber there about as practical as harvesting trees on the moon.There was no way the export companies were getting their wood from sites like this one.We had set out looking for one shipment to prove the wood being exported from Peru was illegal, Urrunaga says.We found 100.Until then, most of the government officials the two women had tried to work with had been very hostile, very aggressive when the EIA team approached them about illegal logging, Urrunaga says.But at a meeting with Rolando Navarro, the newly appointed head of Osinfor, she and Johnson laid out evidence that the entire system is corrupt, Johnson recalls.He said, Youre right.Navarro had grown up in a river town, and he knew how loggers operated.He had worked with the World Wildlife Fund in Peru helping local communities find alternatives to illegal logging.He also knew, from Osinfor field inspections, that the documents listing the supposed harvest sites didnt make sense.The women, Navarro, and the Peruvian customs officials they were working with realized that by homing in on suspicious exporters, theyd have a better shot at making a bust.Eventually, customs officials asked Interpol for help, which allowed Navarros agents to expand their investigations.That meant they could get more documents and slog through more forests.Finally, in 2015, a multiagency team released its report: It found that about 90 percent of the wood coming out of the Peruvian Amazon was illegal.But stopping the shipments and putting people in prison, that wasnt happening, Urrunaga says.The Yacu Kallpa kept sailing with what seemed like its old impunity, making four trips in 2014 and three more in the first half of 2015, carrying timber on its regular route to Tampico and then Houston.Julia Urrunaga had been a journalist before tracking down illegal lumber.Ian Allen To stop the shipmentsto stop the Yacu KallpaNavarro pressed for his field agents to get transport documents earlier, while the timber was still being loaded, so they could demonstrate there was enough of a mismatch, enough deceit, to stop it before it set sailor at least before the timber landed on the docks in Houston.So throughout early 2015, customs agents got better at extracting documents from the exporters, while Osinfor agents got more efficient in their field checks.Soon after the ship left Iquitos for its August 2015 voyage toward Houston, Peruvian officials sent word to US investigators: A significant percentage of the timber aboard was of illegal origin.Back in the States, the Department of Justice was just settling its illegal logging case against Lumber Liquidators and was eager to build on that success.But everyone wanted to tread carefully, as the investigation into the Yacu Kallpa could affect trade agreements between the two countries.To complicate matters, Urrunaga had been working with an Al Jazeera reporter and television crew on a story about the use of fake export documents in Perus logging trade, and in August the network aired its story.Prosecutors and investigators worried that it could blow the case.In the Al Jazeera broadcast, a reporter doorsteps Kenneth Peabody, the general manager of Global Plywood, at his home near San Diego.The company had been selling Amazon rain forest timber into the US market for at least eight years, in steadily increasing quantities.Its business with a Peruvian exporter named Inversiones La Oroza had surged from $250,000 in 2012 to $2 million by 2015.Standing in his driveway, a Honda minivan on one side and a Mercedes Benz SUV on the other, Peabody looks like a soccer dadmiddle-aged, in black shorts, a gray CATHEDRAL CATHOLIC DONS T-shirt, sunglasses, and a two-tone Nike golf cap.Id like to talk with you about shipments of illegal wood your company is importing from Peru, the reporter begins.Hes lean, hunched, and dressed in the shabby manner of journalists everywhere.Ah, I dont have anything to say about that, Peabody says, glancing down and then turning away to the SUV.According to Peruvian authorities, the reporter continues, your main supplier, this company called La Oroza, has been shipping many shipments of illegal wood to your company.Ive got three of them here, he adds, holding out some paperwork.You dont know about this?I dont know what youre showing me, Peabody says, turning back now.These are the documents of shipments sent to your company by this company in Peru, the reporter explains.After the reporter reveals that he has been to the tree harvest sites and seen no harvested trees, Peabody swallows and shifts his keys in his hand, ready for his exit.Do you know about the Lacey Act?the reporter persists.Of course.We comply with all the requirements, Peabody says with a dismissive sweep of one hand.The two of them go back and forth for a moment longer.Then Peabody gets into the SUV, the corners of his mouth compressed in disgust, and drives off.(Peabody declined to speak to wired.La Oroza, reached in Iquitos, denied any wrongdoing.)Remarkably, the Al Jazeera broadcast did not stop the Yacu Kallpa from sailing on.As it neared Houston in September, agents from Homeland Security gathered.When the ship finally settled in port, they boarded and set about inspecting the cargo.Then they issued a temporary order detaining the timberdenying, at least temporarily, its import into the US marketand put the wood in a storage facility at the port in Houston.A few days later, in early October, according to an affidavit from a Homeland Security investigator, a man in the dock area was directing forklift operators to move bundles of timber.It was Peabody.Hed flown in from California.Confronted by federal agents, he told them that Global Plywood owned 85 percent of the wood the Yacu Kallpa had just delivered, and it was the largest shipment in the companys history, worth $1 million.An official of the port told Peabody that customs agents would be taking samples of the shipment to verify that the timber species on board matched the timber species listed in the paperwork required under the Lacey Act.A week later, Peabody sent in revised paperwork that added another 40 tree species for this shipment.It seemed like the end of the run for the Yacu Kallpa .But then, as if out of irresistible habit, the ship turned around and headed back to Iquitos to pick up another load.Mahogany, cedar, chestnut, and rosewood are all logged in Peru.Ian Allen By 2015, it had been six years since the Peru free trade agreement, with all its environmental commitments, had gone into effect, and trade between the United States and the South American nation had almost doubled, to $20 billion.It promised to get even bigger under the upcoming Trans-Pacific Partnership.But the Yacu Kallpa was quickly turning into a test case of whether the environmental commitments in free trade treaties amounted to anything more than words on paper.For critics, the ship was a big ugly billboard advertising the utter failure to stop the illegal timber trade.Potentially at stake: free trade between the two countries, and Perus already precarious economy.At the same time, Urrunaga was hearing from her government sources that the lumber bosses were putting pressure on cabinet ministers to rein in Osinfor.Angry workers were taking to the street.Logging, after all, made the livelihoods of thousands of Peruvians.The economy in Loreto moves because of logging, Navarro says.Demonstrators staged noisy, sometimes violent protests, driving logging company trucks and tractors to the agencys offices and carrying banners: osinfor works for the gringos.One inspector received a photograph over WhatsApp of his 1-year-old daughter in her stroller at a local park.The note said simply, I am from Ayacucho, birthplace of the brutal 1980s militant group Shining Path.That same week, demonstrators showed up at Navarros office in Iquitos carrying coffins, one of them bearing his name.Even after changing his phone number, the threatening calls rang through: We know where your family lives.At 3 am on November 30, two men in hoods tossed Molotov cocktails into the front of the agencys office in Pucallpa, another logging town.To get rid of people who are in the way is the normal thing to do, Navarro says.In late November, the Yacu Kallpa was loading up in Iquitos, and Osinfor agents were once again scrambling in the field.By the day before the ship was scheduled to depart, the agents had found that 15 percent of the timber coordinates were faked.A customs agent in Iquitos rushed a summary of the investigation to the local prosecutorwho hesitated.You want me to prosecute them based on where the timber in the shipment didnt come from?he asked, incredulous.The details about what happened next are murky, but according to news reports and Navarro, the prosecutor wasnt even sure he had the authority to stop the ship from leaving.The agent cajoled and bantered with him until 11:30 that night, reminding him that just weeks earlier, the nation had adopted a decree authorizing a prosecutor to seize a timber shipment on suspicion of illegality.Finally, the prosecutor agreed to meet the agent, before dawn, at the Iquitos dockif Osinfor could provide all the documents from the investigation.Osinfors agents spent the next four hours printing out documents, downloaded via the creaky Iquitos internet.Stacks of forestry documents in Iquitos.Ian Allen The reluctant prosecutor and agents from Osinfor and customs arrived at the port before the sun had risen.Iquitos is a small city, and word had gotten out.A platoon of timber company lawyers and managers followed on their heels.Word also reached Urrunaga, who soon had someone recording the scene.The discussion rageda representative of the regional forest department wanted the ship to get under waybut the prosecutor pointed out that he was in charge.Arguments went around for hours until finally the captain said, OK, take your 15 percentmeaning the illegal wood.Reports say the prosecutor was told that the cost of offloading the timber would be $20,000.It then took him days to obtain the necessary permissions, but when he returned to the ship, the price was suddenly more than $200,000.The Iquitos prosecutor finally agreed to accept a declaration from the captain that the ship would bring the allegedly illegal 15 percent of its cargo back after dropping off the rest.So on December 2, the Yacu Kallpa weighed anchor and turned downriver at full speed.In the EIA offices in Washington, Alexander von Bismarck and other staff immediately went on alert.They could track the ships movements minute by minute, as the Automatic Identification System that all cargo ships must use pinged its location, bearing, and speed.Government agents in Peru, the United States, and at Interpol were watching too.When the ship crossed into Brazil, police there, responding to a call from a prosecutor in Lima, boarded it briefly.But they had no Lacey Act nor any other means of real enforcement.The ship pushed on, with captain and crew now aware that everyone was watching.Osinfor investigators were also pushing, heading deeper into the forests, working their way down the long list of GPS coordinates for the cargo.By mid-December, as the ship made its way north along the Atlantic coast, the investigators sent word to law enforcement agencies in Lima and the US: More than 60 percent of the cargo was illegal.On December 20, the Yacu Kallpa paused unexpectedly in Trinidad and emerged again in the new yearsuddenly under a new flag of convenience.I thought I was going crazy, says an EIA technician who was tracking the ship when the flag of Panama popped up on his cell phone.On January 3, the Yacu Kallpa made a beeline for the Dominican Republic and began to unload its tainted cargo.Meaning we lose, von Bismarck says.An EIA staffer called a photographer friend in Santo Domingo and persuaded him to get to the scene and start recording.But then international pressure came down on the Dominican government, and the Yacu Kallpa sailed onMeaning we won, von Bismarck says.The ship staggered onward, jinked briefly toward Jamaica, then reluctantly turned back on

Can Robots Help Get More Girls Into Science and Tech?:::::Heres a depressing number for you: 12.Just 12 percent of engineers in the United States are women .In computing its a bit better, where women make up 26 percent of the workforcebut that number has actually fallen from 35 percent in 1990.The United States has a serious problem with getting women into STEM jobs and keeping them there.Silicon Valley and other employers bear the most responsibility for that: Discrimination , both overt and subtle, works to keep women out of the workforce.But this society of ours also perpetuates gender stereotypes, which parents pass on to their kids.Like the one that says boys enjoy building things more than girls.Theres no single solution to such a daunting problem, but heres an unlikely one: robots.Not robots enforcing diversity in the workplace, not robots doing all the work and obviating the concept of gender entirely, but robots getting more girls interested in STEM.Specifically, robot kits for kids simple yet powerful toys for teaching youngsters how to engineer and code.Vaidas Sirtautus Plenty of toys are targeted at getting kids interested in science and engineering, and many these days are gender specific.Roominate , for instance, is a building kit tailored for girls, while the Boolean Box teaches girls to code.Sometimes there's this idea that girls need special Legos, or it needs to be pink and purple for girls to get into it, and sometimes that rubs me the wrong way, says Amanda Sullivan , who works in human development at Tufts University.If the pink and purple colored tools is what's going to engage that girl, then that's great.But I think in general it would be great if there were more tools and books and things that were out there for all children.So Sullivan decided to test the effects of a specifically non-gendered robotics kit called Kibo .Kids program the rolling robot by stringing together blocks that denote specific commands.It isnt marketed specifically to boys or girls using stereotypical markings of maleness or femaleness.Its a blank slate.Before playing with Kibo, boys were significantly more likely to say theyd enjoy being an engineer than the girls did.But after, boys had about the same opinion, while girls were now equally as likely to express an engineering interest as the boys.(In a control group that did not play with Kibo, girls opinions did not significantly change.)I think that robots in general are novel to young children, both boys and girls, Sullivan says.So aside from engaging girls specifically, I think robotics kits like Kibo bring an air of excitement and something new to the classroom that gets kids psyched and excited about learning.There's a problem, though.While Sullivans research shows that a gender-neutral robotics kit can get girls interested in engineering, that doesnt mean it will sell.If you look at sales data, it clearly shows that they're not being used by girls, says Sharmi Albrechtsen, CEO and co-founder of SmartGurlz , which makes a programmable doll on a self-balancing scooter.Even the ones that are considered gender-neutral, if you look at the sales data it clearly shows a bias, and it's towards boys.That's the reality of the situation.Gender sellsat least when it's the parents doing the buying.Regardless, companies are designing a new generation of toys in deliberate ways.Take Wonder Workshop and its non-gendered robots Dash and Cue .As they were prototyping, they'd test their designs with boys and girls."One of the things we heard a lot from girls was this isn't quite their toy," says Vikas Gupta, co-founder and CEO of Wonder Workshop."This is probably what their brother would play with."Why?Because they thought it looked like a car or truck.So the team covered up the wheels."And all of a sudden girls wanted to play with it," Gupta says."Our takeaway from that in a big way was that every child brings their preconceived notions to play.So when they see something they map it back to something they've already seen."Though not always.What we do find actually, funnily enough, says Albrechtsen of the SmartGurlz scooter doll, is that a lot of boys actually end up edging in and wanting to play.So we have a lot of brothers who are also playing with the product.Whatever gets a child interested, it's on parents and educators to make sure the spark stays alive.And maybe its the increasingly sophisticated, increasingly awesome, and increasingly inexpensive robots that can begin to transform the way America gets girls into science and tech.Short of becoming self aware and taking over the world, the machines certainly couldnt hurt.
NOAA Predicts Its Third Warm Winter in a Row:::::This year, government scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are placing their bets on a warmer-than-average winter .In the East and southern two-thirds of the country, temperatures will be higher than normal, while Southern California, Texas, and Florida will be drier than usual.At first glance, this pattern looks a lot like the past two years: 2015's record-breaking winter was followed by a season that ranked sixth warmest since record-keeping began in 1890.So do three warm winters in a row mean the planet is warming faster, or is the trend just part of normal seasonal variability?NOAA climate scientists incorporate heat-trapping carbon dioxide levels when they run the models that produce their seasonal climate predictions (these ones came out on Thursday, October 19).But they note that there are other global forces that have a bigger impact on their winter predictionnamely the poorly-understood El Nio and La Nia phenomena.These forecasts deal with climate variability at a far larger extent than climate change, says Mike Halpert, deputy director of NOAAs Climate Prediction Center.There is a lot of natural climate variability in the system that can trump any kind of background signal.NOAA Halpert said that a build-up of cool water along the eastern Pacific Oceanthe pattern called La Niahas big effects on North Americas winter weather.Conditions across the tropical Pacific are similar to those observed last year, Halpert said during a press call.We are dancing on the edge of La Nia.For now, NOAA has issued a La Nia watch that might be kicked up to a warning next month, Halpert says.The twin sister of El Nio , La Nia is a complex series of events that occurs when wind patterns shift and warmer water pools in the eastern Pacific every two to seven years.During 2015's record-setting warm winter, climate scientists believe El Nio was responsible for 8 to 10 percent of that winters warming.Which isn't to say that climate change doesn't impact overall weather trends.Some of the effects are indirect: One study in 2014 concluded that so-called strong El Nio events may become more frequent under future climate change scenarios.And climate change has perhaps a stronger effect on the frequency of severe weather events, like Hurricane Katrina or Superstorm Sandy.But don't expect this year's spate of hurricanes or an anecdotally warm winter to change beliefs when it comes to climate change.We find that the direct experience of extreme weather shows a small signal above the noise in terms of people connecting the dots between extreme weather and climate change, says Anthony Leiserowitz, senior research scientist and director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.Its stronger for heat waves and floods than other events.But its small and dwarfed by other factors such as politics.Still, there may be signs of a thaw, at least the beginnings of one.A group of 50 Republican and Democrat members of Congress formed the Climate Solutions Caucus earlier this year to discuss impacts of coastal flooding and sea level rise.These are climate effects that hit both parties congressional districts.This unlikely bipartisan group stuck together last summer to kill legislation that would have banned the Pentagon from releasing a report on the effects of climate change on military installations.Leiserowitz predicts a slow gradual shift in public opinion on climate change as people continue to connect the dots between their own experiences and what scientists have been saying for several years.We dont just experience a hurricane or drought and say Bing, climate change, Leiserowitz says.The links have to be interpreted by people.It can come from lots of different places, some through their experiences, or watching one extreme weather event after another.Not all extreme events can be linked to climate change, but many can be.
Scientists Are Rewriting the History of Photosynthesis:::::Researchers have caught their best glimpse yet into the origins of photosynthesis, one of natures most momentous innovations.By taking near-atomic, high-resolution X-ray images of proteins from primitive bacteria, investigators at Arizona State University and Pennsylvania State University have extrapolated what the earliest version of photosynthesis might have looked like nearly 3.5 billion years ago.If they are right, their findings could rewrite the evolutionary history of the process that life uses to convert sunlight into chemical energy.Quanta Magazine About Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.Photosynthesis directly or indirectly powers and sustains almost every organism on Earth.It is responsible for the composition of our atmosphere and forms the foundation of the planets many interwoven ecosystems.Moreover, as Wolfgang Nitschke , a biologist at the French National Center for Scientific Research in Paris, noted, photosynthesis liberated cells to grow and evolve boundlessly by letting them derive energy from a new, inexhaustible, nonterrestrial source.When photosynthesis entered the picture, life connected up to the cosmos, he said.Scientists want to figure out what made that possible.In its current form, the machinery that converts light energy to chemical energy in photosynthesisa protein complex called a reaction centeris incredibly sophisticated.The evidence suggests, however, that its design, which stretches back almost to the root of the tree of life, was once very simple.Researchers have been trying for decades to fill that enormous gap in their understanding of how (and why) photosynthesis evolved.To that end, they have turned their attention to existing organisms.By studying the molecular details of the reactions that green plants, algae and some bacteria use to photosynthesize, and by analyzing the evolutionary relationships among them, scientists are trying to piece together a cogent historical narrative for the process.The muddy soils around geothermal hot springs in Iceland, like the Geysir spring pictured here, are the natural habitat for primitive photosynthetic heliobacteria.Scientists are now studying those organisms for insights into the early evolution of photosynthesis.Arctic-Images/Getty Images The latest important clue comes from Heliobacterium modesticaldum , which has the distinction of being the simplest known photosynthetic bacterium.Its reaction center, researchers think, is the closest thing available to the original complex.Ever since the biologists Kevin Redding , Raimund Fromme and Christopher Gisriel of Arizona State University, in collaboration with their colleagues at Penn State, published the crystallographic structure of that protein complex in a July edition of Science , experts have been unpacking exactly what it means for the evolution of photosynthesis.Its really a window into the past, Gisriel said.This is something weve been waiting for for 15 years, Nitschke said.In Search of a Common Ancestor At first, most scientists did not believe that all the reaction centers found in photosynthetic organisms today could possibly have a single common ancestor.True, all reaction centers harvest energy from light and lock it into compounds in a form thats chemically useful to cells.To do this, the proteins pass electrons along a transfer chain of molecules in a membrane, as though skipping along a series of stepping stones.Each step releases energy thats ultimately used down the line to make energy-carrier molecules for the cell.But in terms of function and structure, the photosystem reaction centers fall into two categories that differ in almost every way.Photosystem I serves mainly to produce the energy carrier NADPH, whereas photosystem II makes ATP and splits water molecules.Their reaction centers use different light-absorbing pigments and soak up different portions of the spectrum.Electrons flow through their reaction centers differently.And the protein sequences for the reaction centers dont seem to bear any relation to each other.Both types of photosystem come together in green plants, algae and cyanobacteria to perform a particularly complex form of photosynthesisoxygenic photosynthesisthat produces energy (in the form of ATP and carbohydrates) as well as oxygen, a byproduct toxic to many cells.The remaining photosynthetic organisms, all of which are bacteria, use only one type of reaction center or the other.So it seemed as though there were two evolutionary trees to followthat was, until the crystal structures of these reaction centers began to emerge in the early 1990s.Researchers then saw undeniable evidence that the reaction centers for photosystems I and II had a common origin.Specific working components of the centers seemed to have undergone some substitutions during evolution, but the overall structural motif at their cores was conserved.It turned out that big structural features were retained, but sequence similarities were lost in the mists of time, said Bill Rutherford , the chairman in biochemistry of solar energy at Imperial College London.Nature has played small games to change some of the functions of the reaction center, to change the mechanisms by which it works, Redding added.But it hasnt rewritten the playbook.Its like having a cookie-cutter design for a house, building that same house over and over again, and then changing how the rooms are arranged, how the furniture is positioned.Its the same house, but the functions inside are different.Researchers began to make more detailed comparisons between the reaction centers, searching for clues about their relationship and how they diverged.Heliobacteria have brought them a few steps closer to that goal.Harkening Back to an Earlier Time Since it was discovered in the soil around Icelands hot springs in the mid-1990s, H. modesticaldum has presented researchers with an interesting piece of the photosynthesis puzzle.The only photosynthetic bacterium in a family with hundreds of species and genera, heliobacterias photosynthetic equipment is very simplesomething that became even more apparent when it was sequenced in 2008.Its genetics are very streamlined, said Tanai Cardona , a biochemist at Imperial College London.Robert Blankenship, a photosynthesis researcher at Washington University, looks at a flask of cultured cyanobacteria.The organizational simplicity of heliobacteria, he said, harkens back to an earlier evolutionary time.Washington University in St. Louis Heliobacteria have perfectly symmetrical reaction centers, use a form of bacteriochlorophyll thats different from the chlorophyll found in most bacteria, and cannot perform all the functions that other photosynthetic organisms can.For instance, they cannot use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon, and they die when exposed to oxygen.In fact, their structure took nearly seven years to obtain, partly because of the technical difficulties in keeping the heliobacteria insulated from oxygen.When we first started working on it, Redding said, we killed it more than once.Taken together, heliobacteria have a simplicity in their organization thats surprising compared to the very sophisticated systems you have in plants and other organisms, said Robert Blankenship , a leading figure in photosynthesis research at Washington University in St. Louis.It harkens back to an earlier evolutionary time.Its symmetry and other features represent something quite stripped down, Redding added, something we think is closer to what that ancestral reaction center would have looked like three billion years ago.A Glimpse of the Past After carefully taking images of the crystallized reaction centers, the team found that although the reaction center is officially classified as type I, it seemed to be more of a hybrid of the two systems.Its less like photosystem I than we thought, Redding said.Some people might even call it a type 1.5, according to Gisriel.One reason for that conclusion involves greasy molecules called quinones, which help transfer electrons in photosynthetic reaction centers.Every reaction center studied so far uses bound quinones as intermediates at some point in the electron transfer process.In photosystem I, the quinones on both sides are tightly bound; in photosystem II, they are tightly bound on one side, but loosely bound on the other.But thats not the case in the heliobacterium reaction center: Redding, Fromme and Gisriel did not find permanently bound quinones among the electron transfer chains stepping stones at all.That most likely means its quinones, although still involved in receiving electrons, are mobile and able to diffuse through the membrane.The system might send electrons to them when another, more energetically efficient molecule isnt available.Raimund Fromme, Christopher Gisriel and Kevin Redding (from left to right) are researchers in the School of Molecular Sciences at Arizona State University.With colleagues at Pennsylvania State University, they recently determined the crystallographic structure of the energy-producing reaction center in the simplest known photosynthetic bacterium.Arizona State University This finding has helped the research team deduce what early reaction centers may have been doing.Their job was likely to reduce mobile quinones, Redding said.But they werent doing a very good job of it.In the researchers scenario, tightly bound quinone sites are a more recent adaptation, and todays type I and type II reaction centers represent alternative evolutionary strategies, embraced by different lineages of organisms, for improving on the ancestral systems sloppy, less-than-ideal work.But then the question is, why has nature changed this kind of electron transfer chain?Fromme asked.His work supports the hypothesis that it might have something to do with oxygen.When an organism is exposed to too much light, electrons build up in the transfer chain.If oxygen is around, this buildup can lead to a harmfully reactive oxygen state.Adding a firmly bound quinone to the complex not only provides an additional slot to deal with potential traffic jams; the molecule, unlike others used in the transfer chain, also does not pose any risk of producing that deleterious form of oxygen.A similar explanation works for why reaction centers became asymmetric, Gisriel added: Doing so would have added more stepping stones as well, which would have similarly buffered against damage caused by the accumulation of too many electrons.One of the researchers next steps is to put time stamps on when this asymmetry and these tightly bound quinones came into the picture, which would help them determine when oxygenic photosynthesis became possible.All Roads Lead to Oxygen Cardona, who was not involved in the recent study but has begun interpreting its results, thinks he may have found a hint in the heliobacterium reaction center.According to him, the complex seems to have structural elements that would have later lent themselves to the production of oxygen during photosynthesis, even if that wasnt their initial purpose.He found that a particular binding site for calcium in the heliobacterias structure was identical to the position of the manganese cluster in photosystem II, which made it possible to oxidize water and produce oxygen.Tanai Cardona, a biochemist at Imperial College London, suspects that cells may have been producing oxygen through photosynthesis for about a billion years longer than scientists usually assume.Imperial College London If the ancestral [calcium] site at some later stage turned into the manganese cluster, Cardona said, that would suggest that water oxidation was involved in the earliest events in the divergence between type I and type II reaction centers.That, in turn, would mean oxygenic photosynthesis was far more ancient than expected.Scientists have commonly supposed that oxygenic photosynthesis appeared shortly before the Great Oxygenation Event, when oxygen began to build up in Earths atmosphere and caused a mass extinction 2.3 to 2.5 billion years ago.If Cardona is right, it may have evolved nearly a billion years earlier, shortly after photosynthesis made its debut.That timing would have been early enough to predate the cyanobacteria typically credited as the first organisms to perform oxygenic photosynthesis.According to Cardona, it may be the case that a lot of bacteria could do it, but that after mutations, divergences and other events, only cyanobacteria retained the ability.(Cardona published a paper this year citing other molecular evidence for this hypothesis.He has not yet formally presented arguments about the potential link involving calcium for peer review, but he has written about the idea in blog posts on his website and on a scientific networking site for researchers , and he recently began working on a paper about it.)That hypothesis contradicts one of the widely held ideas about the origins of photosynthesis: that species incapable of photosynthesis suddenly obtained the capacity through genes passed laterally from other organisms.According to Cardona, in light of the new discoveries, horizontal gene transfer and gene loss may both have played a role in the diversification of reaction centers, although he suspects that the latter may have been responsible for the earliest events.The finding, he said, might suggest that the balance skews toward the gene-loss hypothesisand toward the idea that photosynthesis was an ancestral characteristic that some groups of bacteria lost over time.Not everyone is so sure.Blankenship, for one, is skeptical.I dont buy that, he said.I dont see any data here that suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis occurred that much earlier.To him, the work by Redding, Fromme and their collaborators has not answered these questions; it has only conjectured about what may have happened.To solve that puzzle, scientists will need the reaction center structures of other bacteria, so they can continue evaluating the structural differences and similarities to refine the twisting roots of their evolutionary trees.I think its entirely a possibility that what [Cardona] is saying is correct, Gisriel said, but I also think the field should sit with it for a while, do some more analysis and see if we understand more about how this structure works.Going the Synthetic Route Some researchers arent waiting for the publication of the next structure.This one took seven years, after all.Theyre pursuing synthetic experimentation instead.Rutherford and his colleagues, for example, are using a reverse evolution technique: They hope to predict the sequences of missing-link reaction centers, using structural information like Reddings to gain an understanding of their architecture.They then plan to synthesize those hypothetical ancestral sequences and test how they evolve.Meanwhile, Redding and his team have just begun artificially converting the symmetric reaction center of heliobacteria into an asymmetrical one, following in the footsteps of two researchers in Japan, Hirozo Oh-Oka of Osaka University and Chihiro Azai of Ritsumeikan University, who have spent more than a decade doing this in another type of photosynthetic bacterium.The groups believe their work will clarify how these adaptations would have occurred in real life in the distant past.Twenty years ago, Nitschke stopped working on the evolution of photosynthesis and turned his attention to other problems.It seemed so hopeless, he said.But the research done by Redding, his team and these other groups has rekindled those ambitions.As they say, your first love always stays with you, Nitschke said.Im really excited about this new structure and plan to go back to thinking about all this again.Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine , an editorially independent publication of the Simons

The Way the World Ends: Not with a Bang But a Paperclip:::::Paperclips, a new game from designer Frank Lantz , starts simply.The top left of the screen gets a bit of text, probably in Times New Roman, and a couple of clickable buttons: Make a paperclip.You click, and a counter turns over.One.The game endsbig, significant spoiler herewith the destruction of the universe.In between, Lantz, the director of the New York University Games Center, manages to incept the player with a new appreciation for the narrative potential of addictive clicker games, exponential growth curves, and artificial intelligence run amok.I started it as an exercise in teaching myself Javascript.And then it just took over my brain, Lantz says.I thought, in a game like this, where the whole point is that youre in pursuit of maximizing a particular arbitrary quantity, it would be so funny if you were an AI and making paperclips.That game would design itself, I thought.Lantz figured it would take him a weekend to build.It took him nine months.And then it went viral.The idea of a paperclip-making AI didnt originate with Lantz.Most people ascribe it to Nick Bostrom , a philosopher at Oxford University and the author of the book Superintelligence .The New Yorker (owned by Cond Nast, which also owns Wired ) called Bostrom the philosopher of doomsday, because he writes and thinks deeply about what would happen if a computer got really, really smart.Not, like, wow, Alexa can understand me when I ask it to play NPR smart, but like really smart.In 2003, Bostrom wrote that the idea of a superintelligent AI serving humanity or a single person was perfectly reasonable.But, he added, It also seems perfectly possible to have a superintelligence whose sole goal is something completely arbitrary, such as to manufacture as many paperclips as possible, and who would resist with all its might any attempt to alter this goal.The result?It starts transforming first all of earth and then increasing portions of space into paperclip manufacturing facilities.Bostrom declined to comment, but his assistant did send this email back when I pinged him: Oh, this is regarding the paper clipping game, she wrote.He has looked at the game but due to the overwhelming number of requests, he hasn't been sharing quotes on it.One of Bostroms fellow doomsayers did agree to explain the origin of paperclips as the End of All Things.It sounds like something I would say, but it also sounds like something Nick Bostrom would say, says Eliezer Yudkowsky , a senior research fellow at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute.Probably, he says, the idea originated years ago on a mailing list for singularity cassandras, which sounds like the worlds most terrifying listserv.The idea isnt that a paperclip factory is likely to have the most advanced research AI in the world.The idea is to express the orthogonality thesis, which is that you can have arbitrarily great intelligence hooked up to any goal, Yudkowsky says.So thats good, right?A paperclip maximizer!Maximize a goal!Thats what an AIs creators want, right?As it improves, they lose control of what goal it is carrying out, Yudkowsky says.The utility function changes from whatever they originally had in mind.The weird, random thing that best fulfills this utility function is little molecular shapes that happen to look like paperclips.So bad, because as the AI dedicates more and more intelligence and resources to making paperclips against all other possible outcomes well, maybe at first it does stuff that looks helpful to humanity, but in the end, its just going to turn us into paperclips.And then all the matter on Earth.And then everything else.Everything.Is.Paperclips.Its not that the AI is doing something you cant understand, Yudkowsky says.You have a genuine disagreement on values.OK, OK, that doesnt make the game sound fun.But I promise it is.See, Lantz is an ace at taking a denigrated game genrethe clicker or incrementaland making it more than it is.Youve seen these, maybe even played them.Remember Farmville?A clicker.In fact, for a while they were so ubiquitous and popular that the game theorist and writer Ian Bogost invented a kind of parody of their pointlessness called Cow Clicker , which, as my colleague Jason Tanz wrote about so elegantly in 2011, itself became wildly, unironically popular.Bogost and Lantz are friends, of course.When I first looked at Cow Clicker , I thought, thats actually kind of interesting, and heres how you would make it more interesting and more fun, Lantz says.And Ian was like, no, thats the point, Frank.But Lantz knew clickers could be fun.To him, clickers are to big-budget, perfectly rendered, massively hyped AAA games as punk was to prog rock.Clickers can be sort of passive, more about immersing in the underlying dynamics of a system than mashing buttons.They have rhythms.What they all have in common is a radical simplicity, a minimalism in an age where video games are often sort of over-the-top, baroque confections of overwhelming multimedia immersion, Lantz says.I really like that clicker games are considered garbage.That appeals to me.For inspiration, Lantz turned to games like Kittens , a seemingly simple exercise in building villages full of kittens that spirals outward into an exploration of how societies are structured.(I think stuff like this forges some deep, subtle bond that makes people play it for months and even years, says the designer of Kittens , a software engineer who uses the alias Alma and designs games as a hobby.AAA games usually try to operate on the same dopamine reinforcement cycle, but they never attempt to make you truly happy.)Lantz had been hanging around the philosophy web site Less Wrong, a hub for epic handwringing about singularities.Hed read Superintelligence , so he was familiar with the paperclip conjecture.And he realized that some really wild math underpinned it.Unfortunately, Lantz is not very good at math.He asked his wife, who is, to help him translate the kind of exponential growth curves he wanted to convey into equationsso that, like, once you had 1,000 automated paperclip factories spitting out enough paperclips to create thousands more paperclip factories, the numbers would skyrocket.The shift from dealing with thousands of something to quadrillions to decillions in the game takes forever, and then happens all at once.Decision Problem To make that work, though, all the equations had to relate to each other, because that's what makes Paperclips addictive.The game isnt fire-and-forget, where you leave it running in an open tab and check back in every so often to see whats what.Its optimizable.You can tweak investment algorithms to get enough money to buy more processors to carry out more operations to do more projectssome drawn from actual topological and philosophical quandaries.Some of the projectscuring cancer, fixing global warmingearn trust from your human masters to let you speed up the cycle all over again.The problems I was struggling with were not the technical problems, because you just look those up on the internet and people tell you how to do it, Lantz says.It was the game design problems of weaving together these large-scale equations and dynamics in ways that made sense, in ways that fit together, that made a certain rhythm, that fit with this overarching story I wanted to tell.Like how?The numbers get really weird once you throw humans under the bus, Lantz says.And I was trying to figure out how many grams of matter there are on the Earth, and if each one of those got turned into a paperclip, how big would that be?It works.The game is click-crack.Lantz announced it on Twitter on October 9, and in just 11 days, 450,000 people have played it, most to completion.But here is my embarrassing admission: I am a piss-poor gamer, and when I first speak with Lantz, I have gotten stuck.I have misallocated my resources to the point that I cant acquire enough memory to release the hypnodrones that destroy the world.The game will not advance.I have been spinning paperclip wheels for hours.Lantz says its not me, its hima flaw in the game design.A lot of people have gotten stuck, he says sympathetically.You can open the javascript console and say memory plus ten.Wait, I say.Are you telling me to Kobayashi Maru your own game?Yes, I am telling you to do it, he answers.Ill send you a link when we get off the phone.After we hang up I pretend to do work, but Im actually watching my screen accrue paperclips, unable to do anything with them, waiting anxiously for Lantzs email.It comes.I crack open the code and cheat.Its like I have been given magic powers.I destroy the world.
Space Photos of the Week: 130 Million Light Years Away, Two Neutron Stars Collide:::::This galaxy, dubbed NGC 2623, might not look like your average galaxy.And its not: This oddly-shaped object is actually two galaxies that have been forced together by gravity.When they collided, the impact sent clouds of dust careening out into space, forming these individual arms, each extending outwards some 50,000 light years.This week the sun was especially active.The dark region seen at the top of this false color image, filtered for the extreme UV spectrum, is a massive coronal hole.These dark areas are actually cooler than their surroundings, and while its not visible in this image, these holes spent the entire week spitting out highly charged particles into space.Many of those particles end up colliding with Earthresulting in auroras at the northern and southern poles.At the center of this diffuse, glowing bubble is galaxy NGC 4993but that bright, shiny object isnt whats grabbing attention this week.Take a look at that speck of light to the upper left, the one the arrows pointing to.Thats first ever seen merger of two neutron stars, an event called a kilonova.The collision took place 130 million light years from Earth, and sent gravitational waves rippling through space until scientists detected them on August 17th at the LIGO facilities in Washington and Louisiana.This series of images model what scientist think may once have been an atmosphere around the moon.A new NASA paper has evidence that the moon was once cloaked with a thin atmosphere made of water, carbon monoxide, and sulfurnowhere near as thick as the Earths, but just enough to hold materials on the surface.While the model suggests the atmosphere may have only lasted around 70 million years (yeah, that counts as short in galactic time), it could account for the water thats been detected in craters on the moon.Kilonova, its time for your close up.This second image zooms into the galaxy where the fateful neutron star merger occurred.The bright dot to the upper left of the red vertical spiral is the mark of the kilonova.Not only was this the first gravitational wave detection of two merging neutron stars, but the first time a photo captured the remnants of the impact.Its a trap!This glaring orange donut-shaped object, captured by the ALMA radio observatory in Chile, is V1247 Orionis, a hot star surrounded by a ring of dust called a circumstellar disc.Over time, that dust gives in to the force of gravity, glomming into balls that eventually turn into planetsone of which, scientists think, carved out that dark region surrounding the star.While the baby planet orbits around its star, it creates a pressure system that might be trapping dust particles, allowing other areas around the star go undisturbed.And that might eventually create a new solar system.
How on Earth Does Aquaman Fly in the Justice League Trailer?:::::I'll be honestI don't know as much about DC superheroes as Marvel superheroes.Still, I'm pretty excited about the upcoming DC movie Justice League .As a kid, I dressed up as Aquaman; my mother was pretty good at making stuff and so she made costumes for me and my two brothers.The other two costumes were Robin and Supermanthe unifying theme being that they don't have complicated masks.My brother wanted to be Batman, but could you imagine how difficult it would be to make that cowl?But back to Justice League which has a new trailer featuring a scene with Cyborg and my alter-ego, Aquaman.Aquaman is apparently fighting some baddies in a cloud.No, I have no idea how he got there (since he can't fly).After fighting, he starts falling (againbecause he can't fly).But wait!Here comes Cyborg (who can fly).He zips in and grabs Aquaman, and after carrying him for a short bit, Cyborg throws Aquaman back in to the fight.Now for the breakdown.I am going to look at three different aspects of this scenejust as an excuse to talk about physics.Flying Cyborg There are a couple of ways a human can fly.(I know, I know, stay with me.)If a human had wings (or was going fast enough) then they could produce lift just like a plane.I don't think that is the main mode of flight in this casebut if you want to learn more about the physics of lift, check out this older post .Instead, it seems that Cyborg flies more like Iron Man and uses some thrusters.These things must shoot propellent out of a nozzle.Since this fuel has mass and velocity, it also has momentum (the product of mass and velocity).In order to increase the momentum of this fuel, there has to be a force pushing on it and this force also pushes back on Cyborg.Boom.That's how a rocket engine works.Again, I'm assuming this is actually a rocket.But there's more to flight than just rockets.These rockets have to do two things in order for Cyborg fly at a constant speed at a constant altitude.Let me start with a force diagram for Cyborg (for simplicity, yes, I made Cyborg a box).In order for Cyborg to move at a constant velocity, these three forces must add up to the zero vector (they have to cancel).But what about these forces?First, there is the gravitational force.This force pulls down towards the Earth and has a value proportional to the mass of Cyborg (who is probably more massive than your average superhero).The second force is the drag force.As he moves through the air, there is a force pushing in the opposite direction as his motion.The faster he moves, the greater this drag force.But you already knew thatit's the same force you feel when you stick your hand out of moving car window.Finally, there is the thrust force that I described above.But the cool thing is the direction of this thrust.In order to match both the drag force and the gravitational force, the thrust cannot be pointed directly horizontal.Instead it has to push both up and to the side.Oh sure.It might look cooler to have completely horizontal thrustbut that's not how it works.I should add one more note.In the absence of air drag, Cyborg would only thrust down and not at all in the direction of motion.Yes, you might think he would still need to thrust forwardbut remember, forces change the motion.A forward thrust without air drag would cause Cyborg to increase in speed.Of course movies often get this wrongexample: R2-D2 flying wrong in Star Wars Episode II .Cyborg Catching Aquaman I've watched the clip several times.It seems like Aquaman is "falling" with a very high horizontal velocity.It's almost as if he is a skydiver with a wingsuit so that he can "fly" as he is falling.That's fine.I'll go with that.But how does he go from moving down and horizontally to moving just horizontal but in the opposite direction?Since this is a change in velocity, it's also a change in momentum (change is again the key word).The way to change momentum is with a force.In this case, there would be a force exerted on Aquaman by Cyborg as he catches him.But wait!If Cyborg pushes on Aquaman, then Aquaman pushes back on Cyborg with an equal force in the opposite direction?Why?Because forces are an interaction between two objectsthat's just the way forces work.What does this force do to Cyborg?Well, if he was flying at a constant speed (as in the previous section) then all the other three forces (drag, gravity, and thrust) were adding up to zero.This new Aquaman-force would be an additional force that would make Cyborg's net force no longer zero and he would also change momentum.Let me show this with a diagram during the "catch."Again, superheroes are just represented with boxes.Hopefully you can tell which box is Aquaman.In a normal collision between two objects, something very similar happens.One colliding object has a change in momentum that is equal but opposite to the change in momentum of the other object.We say that momentum is conserved.That's not quite true in this case since Cyborg clearly has other forces acting on him during this time (namely the force from his thrusters).Still, if the collision is over a short time interval then the force between Cyborg and Aquaman would be huge in order to create a change in momentum.This means that the other Cyborg forces are comparatively small and can be ignored and the change in momentum for the two superheroes would be equal and opposite.But remembermomentum is the product of the mass and velocity.If Cyborg is much more massive than Aquaman, then he could have a much smaller change in velocity but still have the same change in momentum as Aquaman.Here's how I see it happening.Aquaman is falling down at an angle.Cyborg catches him and in the process he slows down and moves downward.That's not quite what we see in the clipbut it still looks cool.Cyborg Throwing Aquaman Now for the last part of this scene, when Cyborg gives Aquaman a nice toss back into the fray.Really, this is almost the opposite of the collision between the two heroes when Cyborg makes the save.It doesn't really matter how strong Cyborg's arms are: It's still true that pushing on Aquaman means that there is a force pushing back on Cyborg.The faster he throws Aquaman, the greater this backwards pushing force.The result of this throw really depends on the mass of Cyborg.I'm just going to assume that he has twice the mass of Aquaman.In this case, Cyborg won't just keeping flying along at a constant speed.But you don't need to imagine how this would lookI have made a numerical model to show you.Check this out.Actually, that is just a gifhere is the code that produces this .Feel free to play around with it and change stuff (and you should).But you can see what happens.Because Cyborg throws Aquaman, his flight path is most likely altered also.Oh sure, he might also be able to compensate with his thrustersbut he would indeed have to do something.
Georgia boy, 2, blocked from getting father's kidney, is rushed to hospital:::::A 2-year-old Georgia boy who was unable to receive his fathers kidney for a transplant -- apparently because the man had violated his probation -- was rushed to an emergency room Sunday morning after suffering an abdominal infection.Anthony Dickerson Jr., who was born without kidneys, made headlines earlier this month when it was reported the toddler couldnt receive a kidney from his father, Anthony Dickerson, 26, over the probation violation in September."Today has not been a good day for baby AJ or the family.But they remain hopeful, strong in spirit even as his body weakens," Attorney Mawuli Davis told WBIR.TODDLER'S KIDNEY TRANSPLANT STALLED AFTER DONOR DAD VIOLATES PROBATION, FAMILY CLAIMS Emory Hospital in Atlanta reportedly worked on behalf of Dickerson, who was in jail, to request he be escorted to the hospital for blood work and pre-operative testing.Anthony's mother, Carmellia Burgess, said that days after testing, she received a letter from the hospital saying her sons surgery would be delayed until Dickerson complied with his parole officer after three months.Theyre making this about his dad, Burgess said.Its not about dad.Its about our son.A petition created by Burgess requesting that Emory Hospital allow Anthony to donate his kidney to his son has more than 52,000 signatures.A vigil for Anthony was scheduled for Sunday evening at Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta.
Arizona seeing 100 opioid deaths per month, data show:::::Opioids have claimed more than 400 lives in Arizona since June 15 alone, a state database has revealed.The deaths a rate of 100 per month were among more than 3,200 suspected opioid overdoses reported in the state over the same time four-month time period, the Arizona Republic reported Friday.The shocking numbers were the latest statistical evidence drawing attention to a drug crisis that has plagued the nation and prompted President Donald Trump on Thursday to declare a public health emergency.The latest data from Arizona were posted Oct. 17 by Cara Christ, director of the Arizona Department of Health Services (AZDHS).The Arizona Republics report came one day after Arizona billionaire John Kapoor, 74, was arrested in connection with an opioid-related bribery scheme.Kapoors predecessor as CEO of Insys Therepeutics of Chandler, Ariz. and five other former executives and managers of the company have been indicted on similar charges.Illustrating the extent of the opioid problem, a Rhode Island doctor pleaded guilty Wednesday to participating in the Insys scheme, Reuters reported, and a Kansas physician whose office was raided by the FBI in July -- faces two lawsuits from patients who claim he pushed an Insys product on them as part of the scheme, the Kansas City Star reported.In her post, Christ writes that only a quarter of the medical professionals prescribing opioids in Arizona had been checking the AZDHS database on overdoses before writing a prescription.But as of Oct. 16, state law now requires clinicians to check the database before prescribing opioids or benzodiazepines, the Republic reported.Christ noted that other states have implemented similar mandates, resulting in fewer opioid prescriptions, the newspaper reported.According to Christ, the data gathered by AZDHS has revealed he following insights into Arizonas opioid problem: - Men in their mid- to late 20s are at the highest risk of opioid overdoses.- Most overdoses occur at home.- Nearly 40 percent of people suspected of experiencing an overdose were prescribed an opioid less than eight weeks earlier.- Chronic pain is the symptom cited most frequently by those who experience a suspected overdose."ADHS will continue to monitor these indicators on a monthly basis to assess progress," Christ said.
Teen's sore throat spirals into life-threatening infection:::::A complaint about a sore throat has turned into a health nightmare for one Rhode Island teen, who is now reportedly facing partial amputation of her right leg.Gianna Cirella, a junior goalkeeper for the Toll Gate High School soccer team, is currently fighting for her life at Hasbro Childrens Hospital in Providence.Cirella first complained of a sore throat while at practice on Oct. 13, and within 72 hours was diagnosed with pneumonia which then progressed to sepsis, The Providence Journal reported.According to a GoFundMe page set up on the familys behalf, the infection cut off oxygen and blood supply to part of her right leg, which will now be amputated.NURSE SERENADES DYING PATIENT WITH HER FAVORITE SONG I couldnt believe what I was hearing, Lonna Razza, Cirellas coach, told The Providence Journal.It was shocking absolutely shocking that it came on so quickly.Cirellas younger sister is a striker on the team, and her teammates have been taking shifts visiting at the hospital.Grief counselors have been made available to players, and the team decided to play against a cross-town rival in her honor.Cirellas sister scored a goal during that game.Of all nights, this was the night she scored that goal, Razza told The Providence Journal.And it was for her sister.We all felt it.We all knew it.Cirellas teammates have taken to wearing purple ribbons and armbands, and helped organize a blood drive as well as spread the word about the familys GoFundMe page.
New therapy 'rewires' the brain to fight depression:::::Each year, Americans spend billions of dollars on antidepressants, but studies show they can be ineffective in up to 40 percent of all patients.California native, Bob Holmes is one of the 16 million people in the U.S. who suffer major depressive episodes each year.Holmes has suffered from depression his entire life, and has tried several different medications to help but nothing seemed to work."They tried to adjust my medication but the medication had side effects that weren't desirable, Holmes said.Doctors at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA Health are taking a different approach to help patients.Instead of drugs, theyre beaming magnetic pulses deep inside a patient's brain to change the way depression symptoms are perceived.It's called transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS and it's currently FDA approved to treat depression only."The idea [is] that by using non-chemical means we can change the brain and how it functions," Dr. Andrew Leuchter, director of the Semel Institutes TMS clinical and research service, said.By pulsing it [the brain] with energy repeatedly, we're changing the way that area works, but also changing the way the whole brain network works."TRUMP DECLARES OPIOID EPIDEMIC PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY HERES WHAT THAT MEANS Doctors said it could also prove helpful in a wide range of conditions like schizophrenia, epilepsy, Parkinsons disease and chronic pain, by rewiring a network of signals in the brain."What TMS is doing is changing how that network functions, really rebooting the network to improve symptoms of mood, anxiety and chronic pain, Leuchter said.Leuchter also said the newest generation of TMS equipment could make treatments less time-consuming.Patients could see treatment sessions cut from 37 minutes to 3 minutes, and can complete a full course in just two weeks.Several patients treated with TMS for depression said the therapy also helped to relieve their pain, which raises the question about whether TMS could one day become an alternative to opioids."This is a really transformative kind of therapy.But, in medicine there's always the wish to do better, to help more people than what we do now," Dr. Ian Cook, the director of the UCLA Depression Research and Clinic Program, said.YOUR BRAIN KNOWS WHEN YOU'VE JUST DIED, RESEARCHERS SAY Doctors have reported that the treatment can feel a bit uncomfortable at first but patients get used to it quickly and find substantial relief from their depression within a few weeks.For Holmes, the treatment has made a dramatic difference in his life."It provided that kind of jolt to get my brain to start work again normally, Holmes said.
1-year-old dies after ingesting powerful synthetic opioid:::::A 1-year-old girl who died in August was exposed to a powerful synthetic opioid that is typically used as a sedative for elephants.The Allegheny County Medical Examiners Office said Audrianna Cohens accidental death was caused by the toxic effects of carfentanil, a substance 10,000 times more potent than morphine, TribLive.com reported.The exact circumstances of her death are unclear, although the substance can be mixed with heroin and cocaine, or used as an illicit substance substitute, the news outlet reported.ARIZONA BILLIONAIRRE FUELED OPIOID CRISIS WITH BRIBERY SCHEME, AUTHORITIES SAY There are discussions if charges should be filed, against whom, and if so which charges should be filed, Allegheny County Police Superintendent Colman J. McDonough said, according to TribLive.com.It wont be today or tomorrow or even the next day.A neighbor said the family has since moved out of the house where the incident occurred.Her death was no accident, Linda McCrackan told CBS Pittsburgh.That baby should never who in their right mind would have that stuff around a baby?Who in their right mind would have that stuff around the house?
Woman sues for $1.8M over hysterectomy, mastectomy:::::An Oregon woman is seeking $1.8 million after she says multiple medical professionals misread test results, resulting in her getting a double mastectomy and hysterectomy last year, the Oregonian reports."I wish this on nobody, nobody," 36-year-old Elisha Cooke-Moore tells KTVL, which has a copy of her lawsuit filed last week.Cooke-Moore says she underwent genetic testing because both her mother and grandmother had cancer.The lawsuit claims Cooke-Moore was wrongly told the test showed she had the MLH1 gene mutation and Lynch syndrome.She says she was told by gynecologist William Fitts that she had a 50 percent chance of getting breast cancer and an up to 80 percent chance of getting uterine cancer.She says nurse practitioner Lori Johns recommended surgery based on the test results.Months after her surgeries, Cooke-Moore says she was reading the test results for herself and says they were clearly marked "negative," the Washington Post reports.Quite frankly, we are stumped to why they would make this mistake, her lawyer tells the Oregonian.The hysterectomy put Cooke-Moore into early menopause, and she says the botched mastectomy has required more than 10 corrective surgeries.She says she's been diagnosed with PTSD."It's terrible," she says."As a woman, they took what God gave me.I don't even feel like I am one at times."The mother of five now says she should have gotten a second opinion before having the surgeries.Her lawsuit names Fitts, Johns, the Curry Medical Practice, the Curry Medical Center, and surgeon Jessica Carlson.(This woman sued after losing her limbs in a donkey attack.)This article originally appeared on Newser: Woman sues for $1.8M over hysterectomy, mastectomy
8-year-old skips birthday presents, asks for donations for toddler with rare illness:::::Rather than throw a big birthday party complete with presents and fanfare, Brooklynn Daniel, who turns 8 on Friday, wants guests who attend her bash to donate to the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research in honor of Evan Brenneman, her 22-month-old friend.Brenneman is the son of Daniels former kindergarten teacher, and suffers from the life-threatening illness that causes compulsive overeating and hormonal issues.Patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome also experience delays in physical milestones, as well as have varying levels of intellectual disabilities, according to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.Daniel, of Indiana, knew Brenneman was sick, but didnt have the chance to meet him until recently at a playground, IndyStar reported.NURSE SERENADES DYING PATIENT WITH HER FAVORITE SONG Hes really cute, she told the news outlet.With her birthday approaching, Daniel initially had her heart set on heading to Great Wolf Lodge, but instead, this Saturday, shell host friends at The Flip Zone, and requested that they make a donation to the Team Evan fundraising page in Brennemans honor.I just thought that it would be something different, and it would be kind, Daniel told IndyStar.Its my kindergarten teacher, I mean, I love her.Daniel, an older sister to twin siblings, also volunteers with special needs students at her school.Her former teacher, Natalie, told IndyStar that shes touched by Daniels kindness.The heart of this girl makes mine burst, she told IndyStar.Brooklynn wants Evan to live life full, which is why she is celebrating her birthday by raising funds for Evan.
Nurse serenades dying patient with her favorite song:::::More than 3 million people have watched a nurse in Tennessee serenade her dying patient with her favorite song after the womans daughter captured the emotional moment on video, and shared it on Facebook.Margaret Smith, 63, was being cared for at Vanderbilt University Medical Center after being diagnosed with liver cancer, Q 13 Fox reported.Smith was headed for a liver transplant, but her health deteriorated and doctors said she was too sick to survive the procedure.Plans were then made to transfer Smith to a nursing home in Cookeville, but before she left, nurse Olivia Nuefelder gave her a special send off.9-YEAR-OLD BATTLING CANCER SERENADES FELLOW PATIENTS DURING TREATMENT Smiths daughter, Megan Smith, captured the moment on video as Neufelder held her hand and sang Dancing in the Sky, by Dani and Lizzy.Both Smith and Neufelder were overcome with emotion during the clip.You never left her side by choice!!Megan Smith wrote alongside Sundays Facebook post.Words cannot describe the appreciation and love we feel for nurse Olivia who mom calls her angel!Your dedication to your patients is beyond any that I have seen, you truly are a beam of light and I cannot thank you enough for the compassion and care and love you shared for my mother.God bless you Olivia!Smith died on Wednesday, Q 13 Fox reported.Neufelder told a local radio station that knowing she will be dancing in the heavens and singing with the angels helps me find peace during this somber time.A GoFundMe page was started to help the family pay for Smiths medical expenses.
Harvey Weinstein scandal led to increase in hotline calls, RAINN officials say:::::A national sexual assault hotline has reported a record number of increased calls in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal.The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), the largest anti-sexual assault organization in the U.S. has said that in the last two weeks, calls to their hotline has gone up by nearly a quarter over the same period last year.The spike occurred after the allegations against the Hollywood mogul first went public two weeks ago.Weve been helping over 800 people a day, RAINN president Scott Berkowitz said to Fox News.Overall, over the last couple of weeks, its up 21 percent over prior [time periods].The increase comes as a larger national discussion about sexual assault and abuse of power has come to the forefront.Some nights, even though weve brought on dozens of additional staff to answer the hotline weve seen queues as high as 60 people waiting for help, Berkowitz said.A Rainn spokesperson says that there is usually a spike in calls after every high-profile accusation of sexual assault, according to a recent report in The Guardian.They say its due to everyday people motivated to share their own stories or are prompted to relieve their past attacks.The result is a surge in calls made to support groups, loved ones, and law-enforcement agencies.The coverage of this story and the many courageous voices that have spoken out have helped survivors [of sexual abuse] feel that they are not alone.The national discussion regarding sexual assault has also spurred a national movement on social media with the hashtag, #MeToo which has shed a light on the long-standing issue.The #MeToo hashtag has been used over 200,000 times, according to the BBC, including from celebrities such as Evan Rachel Wood, Lady Gaga, and Debra Messing.The outcry on social media comes after a number of actresses, including Ashley Judd, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Rose McGowan, have accused disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual abuse, assault and in the case of British actor Lysette Anthony, rape.Fox News Chris Ciaccia contributed to this article.
Identity theft victim stunned by $52G hospital bill: report:::::A San Francisco man who lost identification cards when his backpack was stolen was stunned to receive a $52,310 bill for the thief's medical procedure, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Thursday.The thief apparently used the victim's identity to arrange for the unspecified procedure to be done Sept. 2, authorities said.The victim learned about the bill when the hospital called asking if he'd have a difficult time paying.Authorities were dumbfounded.Usually with identity theft you see people fill a bunch of vehicles with gas, buy goods, electronics, Daly City police Sgt.Ron Harrison told the paper.The alleged victim will not be charged for the procedure and Seton Hospital will likely have to take the financial hit.
The Governor Blocked Medicaid Expansion. Now Maine Voters Could Overrule Him.:::::Kari Medeiros, 40, of Eastport, a tiny town in the states poorest county, earns less than $5,000 a year cleaning houses and pet sitting, and has back pain that has worsened to the point where she can barely mop and sweep.With MaineCare I believe Id be able to find a provider who would see me, she said, referring to the states Medicaid program.But a lot of people here dont vote.So many families here are having addiction problems with their loved ones, and theyre not focused on going to vote even though those are the people that need it the most.Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government picked up the entire cost of new enrollees under Medicaid expansion for the first three years and will continue to pay at least 90 percent.(States cover a significantly larger portion of the expenses of the regular Medicaid program.)The law allows any citizen with income up to 138 percent of the poverty level $16,642 for an individual, $24,600 for a family of four to qualify.The main arguments for expanding the program here are that it would help financially fragile rural hospitals, create jobs and provide care for vulnerable people who have long gone without it.Photo But Mr. LePage and other opponents say that Maine should know better.The state undertook a more modest expansion of Medicaid in 2002, under former Gov.Angus King, an independent.Afterward, Maine struggled with budget shortfalls and fell behind on Medicaid payments to hospitals.People dont want to acknowledge the unintended consequences that Maine has already experienced, said Brent Littlefield, a political adviser to Mr. LePage who is serving as the spokesman for Welfare to Work, the committee leading the opposition.He said that even with the federal government paying most of the cost a situation that could change if Congress eventually succeeds in repealing Obamacare the state could owe close to $100 million a year, according to estimates from the LePage administration.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Office of Program and Fiscal Review has estimated a lower state cost, about $54 million a year once the federal share drops to 90 percent in 2021.Maine would not receive the full 90 percent match for parents of young children because many already qualify for the program.Maines legislature, which is controlled by Democrats in the House and Republicans, by one vote, in the Senate, could move to block the referendum if it were to pass, but since it voted for Medicaid expansion five times already, supporters and opponents alike believe it is unlikely to meddle.And the governor would have no authority to veto the outcome.The only other threat would be if Congress succeeded in repealing the Affordable Care Act and ended the Medicaid expansion program.
One Last Question Before the Operation: Just How Frail Are You?:::::Along with other frailty measures, that meant that surgery is not going to go very well, Dr. Robinson said.In a frank half-hour conversation, he explained to his patient that he faced a 30 to 40 percent risk of dying from the surgery.If he survived, he probably would endure a long, difficult recovery and might not regain the functional abilities he had now.Dilemmas like these will grow more common as the population ages.Already, more than a third of inpatient surgical procedures are performed on patients over age 65.But about 15 percent of the older population, excluding nursing home residents, meets the criteria for frailty, rising to more than a third of those over age 85.Theres a much higher prevalence in the Deep South and among African Americans, said Dr. Jeremy Walston, principal investigator at the Older Americans Independence Center at Johns Hopkins Medicine.Geriatricians like Dr. Walston have been publishing research on frailty for nearly 20 years, as measured by tools developed at Johns Hopkins or by a Canadian group, and variants thereof.The Hopkins approach uses tests like grip strength and walking speed; the Canadian index relies on health deficits, including chronic illnesses and dementia.Both assessments do a good job of identifying patients vulnerable to health problems, regardless of chronological age.A British group has used meta-analyses, for instance, to show that frail older adults are more prone to falls, fractures, hospitalizations, dementia and nursing home placement.In the United States, though, its the surgeons who have picked up the banner, Dr. Walston said.Theyre starting to use frailty to help make decisions about which procedures make sense for which older patients.You can see why: Frailty involves decreased physiological reserve, which helps determine how patients respond to physical stress.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Surgery brings plenty of that, said Dr. Carolyn Seib, a general and endocrine surgeon at the University of California, San Francisco.The effects of anesthesia and inflammation, the risk of blood clots or infection, muscle weakness caused by days in bed all can take a toll.The more frail a patient is, the higher the risk of complications, Dr. Seib said.Researchers have shown that after major operations including cardiac and colon cancer surgery and kidney transplants frail older patients are more prone than others to longer hospital stays, being readmitted within a month of a procedure and winding up in nursing homes after theyre discharged.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Theyre also more likely to die.But a study that Dr. Seib and her colleagues published in JAMA Surgery this month shows that frail seniors face higher complications even after ambulatory surgery, outpatient procedures often considered routine.Hernia repairs, thyroid or parathyroid surgery, operations for breast cancer patients and providers often dont think twice about these, Dr. Seib said.Yet when the researchers looked at 141,000 patients over age 40 in a national surgical database, they found that serious complications were two to four times higher in patients with moderate to high frailty, although complication rates overall were low (1.7 percent, with .7 percent experiencing serious complications).We have to take frailty into account for any operation, big or small, Dr. Seib said.Although surgeons increasingly screen for frailty, I wouldnt say its routine yet, she added.So she and other researchers recommend that before an operation, patients and families ask: Is my mother showing signs of frailty?Should we do an assessment that indicates how frail she might be?Unlike some conditions, frailty is something patients and doctors can actually do something about.There are interventions that can improve or even resolve it, said Dr. Linda Fried, dean of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University and a pioneer in frailty research.First, many surgical centers offer a prehabilitation program, shown to improve patients results through exercise, better nutrition and smoking cessation.Undertaken even for a few weeks before an operation, it improves your bounce-back capability, Dr. Fried said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Physical activity, in particular, seems to be the key to preventing frailty and its progression, Dr. Fried added even for those not contemplating surgery.Second, surgical decision-making is not a binary choice between patients agreeing to the standard operation or doing nothing.Alerted to frailty, a surgeon might opt for a less aggressive approach or a different kind of anesthesia.A patient, understanding that she may be looking at an altered future even if the surgery fixes the physical problem, will have her own priorities to weigh.With frailty, Im going to counsel the patient differently, Dr. Robinson said.Maybe change the surgery I do.Maybe find an alternative.Theres a spectrum of possibilities.Take his patient with gallstone disease.After their discussion, the man decided that instead of undergoing what would be, for him, a high-risk operation, he would go home and try to avoid foods that triggered his symptoms.If the pain flared again, Dr. Robinson would insert a tube through his skin to drain the gallbladder, a much safer procedure.Because the tube, and the bag into which it drained, would be permanent, it might not represent a welcome alternative for a healthier patient.But for a physiologically vulnerable older adult, Dr. Robinson said, its a whole different equation.
Trump Declares Opioid Crisis a ‘Health Emergency’ but Requests No Funds:::::This was an idea that I had, where if we can teach young people not to take drugs, Mr. Trump said, its really, really easy not to take them.He shared the story of his brother Fred, who he said had struggled with alcohol addiction throughout his life and implored Mr. Trump never to take a drink advice the president said he had heeded.We are going to overcome addiction in America, the president said.The designation of a public health crisis, formally made by Eric D. Hargan, the acting health secretary, would allow for some grant money to be used to combat opioid abuse, permit the hiring of specialists to tackle the crisis, and expand the use of telemedicine services to treat people in rural areas ravaged by opioid use, where doctors are often in short supply.Mr. Trump said his plan would include a requirement that federally employed prescribers be trained in safe practices for opioid prescriptions, and a new federal initiative to develop nonaddictive painkillers, as well as intensified efforts to block shipments of fentanyl, a cheap and extremely potent synthetic opioid manufactured in China, into the United States.Photo He also said he would act to suspend a rule that currently prevents Medicaid from funding many drug rehabilitation facilities.We cannot allow this to continue, Mr. Trump said.It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction.Congressional Republicans as well as law enforcement and physicians groups said the presidents announcement was a crucial first step in building awareness about the opioid crisis and confronting its causes and devastating effects.In a statement, Patrice A. Harris, the chairwoman of the American Medical Associations opioid task force, described it as a move that will offer needed flexibility and help direct attention to opioid-ravaged communities.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There is plenty of work ahead, Dr. Harris added, and the emergency declaration adds further urgency to this epidemic.But Democrats criticized Mr. Trump for what they characterized as a tepid response to an urgent calamity, arguing that his failure to request funding for the effort revealed a lack of seriousness about addressing the issue.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.America is hemorrhaging lives by the day because of the opioid epidemic, but President Trump offered the country a Band-Aid when we need a tourniquet, said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts.Instead of a commitment to emergency funding for our states and communities, President Trump offered empty words and half-measures.Andrew Kolodny, the co-director of opioid policy research at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University, said that no emergency declaration would do much to alleviate the impact of opioids without a substantial commitment of federal money and a clear strategy for overhauling the way the country treats addiction.What we need is for the president to seek an appropriation from Congress, I believe in the billions, so that we can rapidly expand access for effective outpatient opioid addiction treatments, Dr. Kolodny said in an interview.Until those treatments are easier to access than heroin or fentanyl, overdose deaths will remain at record-high levels.Mr. Trumps campaign promise to focus on the opioid crisis helped propel him to a crucial victory in New Hampshires primary last year.As president, he appointed an opioid commission in March, installing Gov.Chris Christie of New Jersey, a rival for the Republican nomination who had championed the issue during the 2016 race, as chairman.In July, the commission recommended that the president declare a national emergency either under the Stafford Act, which would have allowed the allocation of Federal Emergency Management Agency funds, or the Public Health Service Act, the option Mr. Trump chose.Although Mr. Trump called the opioid crisis a national emergency over the next month, he did not sign a formal declaration of the designation, and the idea ran into stiff resistance in his administration to making an open-ended commitment of federal funds to deal with an issue that has shown no signs of abating.Administration officials argued that a national emergency declaration was not necessary or helpful in the case of the opioid crisis, and that the powers associated with a public health emergency were better suited to address the issue.They said the White House would soon send Congress a request for money to combat opioids, with the goal of including it in a year-end spending package.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Christie praised the president on Thursday for what he called bold action to address the opioid crisis, and said the commission would put forth a comprehensive plan next week.Beyond the lack of funding, it is unclear how much impact the public health declaration will have in the short term, given that Mr. Trump has yet to name central players who would carry it out.That includes a drug czar to steer a broader strategy on opioids and a secretary of health and human services who would tailor policies and identify sources of funding.Among the questions left unanswered by the presidents announcement is whether the Department of Health and Human Services will use its authority under the public health declaration to negotiate lower prices for naloxone, a drug that quickly counteracts the effects of opioid overdoses.Lawmakers and public health and anti-addiction organizations have argued that such a measure is crucial to expand access to the drug.Jim Hood, a founder and the chief executive of Facing Addiction, who lost his 20-year-old son, Austin, to an accidental overdose five years to the day before Mr. Trumps announcement, said he was grateful that the president took the time to talk about a crisis that had too often been ignored, but worried that his message missed the mark.That undercurrent that if all of you just decided not to do this, wed be in a better place I can tell you, my son did not decide that he wanted to become addicted, much less die, Mr.Hood said.We might have been much better served by framing this as a very serious illness, a very serious health issue.
The Opioid Epidemic: A Crisis Years in the Making:::::Advertisement The Opioid Epidemic: A Crisis Years in the Making Image Examining the body of a woman who died of an overdose in August.Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times The current opioid epidemic is the deadliest drug crisis in American history.Overdoses, fueled by opioids, are the leading cause of death for Americans under 50 years old killing roughly 64,000 people last year, more than guns or car accidents, and doing so at a pace faster than the H.I.V.epidemic did at its peak.President Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency on Thursday, though he did not release additional funding to address it.Had he declared it a national emergency, as he promised to do in August, it would have led to the quick allocation of federal funds.The New York Times has been covering the outbreak from when it started bubbling up in towns around the United States years ago to now, as it decimates communities and families.Here is a roundup of our best reporting on the epidemic, including short answers to hard questions about it.Snapshots of a Public Health Crisis A team of reporters went inside the epidemic, from New England to safe injection areas in the Pacific Northwest, to explore the experiences of addicts and those trying to stem the tide.I dont know how Im alive, honestly, one Massachusetts woman said.Here are their stories .Image Even babies are affected by the crisis, with a surge of newborns dependent on opioids.Credit Ty Wright for The New York Times The youngest members of society have not been exempt from the crisis.Toddlers and young children are increasingly being found unconscious or dead after consuming an adults drugs, and a surge of opioid-dependent newborns has forced doctors to rethink treatment .The Numbers Our reporters have been deciphering and providing context to masses of data about the many and varied ways opioids are affecting Americans.Image How overdose deaths rippled across the United States.Credit Haeyoun Park and Matthew Bloch/The New York Times Illustrated in a series of maps , heres how overdose deaths rippled across the United States from 1999 to 2014, along with a breakdown of the large concentration of deaths in regions like Appalachia and the Southwest.This interactive quiz aims to provide a deeper understanding of the mounting toll by asking readers to compare drug overdose deaths with other causes of death.Video Its the deadliest drug crisis in American history.It kills about 90 Americans every day.Here are answers to some key questions about the crisis.The governments account of drug deaths in 2016 was the first national data to break down the growth by drug and by state, which revealed that deaths involving synthetic opioids, mostly fentanyls, had risen 540 percent in just three years .While Mr. Trump fulfilled his vow to add urgency to the rapidly escalating opioid problem, his declaration falls short of the national emergency declaration he had pledged.These are the 28 currently active national emergencies .Health Care Drug companies and doctors have been accused of fueling the opioid crisis, but insurers may also be playing a role by making it easier to get opioids than the drugs that treat addiction to them.Here are the findings of our analysis .Image A patient had to begin taking a hydrocodone, an opioid, to treat her pain after her insurer changed what it covered.Credit Kevin D.

The Facts on America's Opioid Epidemic:::::Its the deadliest drug crisis in American history.It kills about 90 Americans every day.Here are answers to some key questions about the crisis.
‘Fat but Fit’? The Controversy Continues:::::The bottom line is that metabolically healthy obesity doesnt exist, said Dr. Rishi Caleyachetty, of the College of Medical and Dental Sciences at the University of Birmingham in England, who was the lead author of the paper, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.Obesity is not a benign condition.But critics say the analysis, based on the electronic health records of 3.5 million British patients who were followed from 1995 to 2015, leaves a lot out.Doctors records dont typically capture lifestyle habits, so the study fails to account for the wide-ranging effects of diet.They classify weight status by using body mass index, a formula based on height and weight that doesnt distinguish muscle from fat.Most important, critics say, such analyses dont take fitness level or physical activity into account.Other studies have found a higher rate of heart failure among obese individuals, said Dr. Carl Lavie, the medical director of cardiac rehabilitation and preventive cardiology at the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute in New Orleans.But when it comes to coronary heart disease outcomes, studies that take both weight and physical fitness into account have concluded that fitness is more important than fatness, at least for the moderately obese, he said.For the very large number of people who are overweight or mildly obese, I dont think its doomsday if they can keep themselves out of the low fitness level, Dr. Lavie said.Dr. Caleyachetty, the author of the new paper, agreed that the lack of information about fitness and exercise was an important caveat.Those people who are metabolically healthy, obese and vigorously active may have a decreased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, he conceded.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Critics say thats an important message to convey, because many people will find it easier to embark on an exercise regimen and stick with it than to lose weight and maintain the weight loss.I do think thats a better message than telling people, You better not gain weight, Dr. Lavie said.People arent trying to gain weight.Theyre not trying to get to be obese.A better message would be to tell people that if they get themselves to be more physically active, they can improve their prognosis, despite carrying a few extra pounds.Thats a better message, and a more obtainable message.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Jennifer W. Bea, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Arizona Cancer Center who was a co-author of an editorial accompanying the new study, said, we havent heard the whole story yet and questioned whether someone can be obese but metabolically healthy.Obesity itself is a metabolic disorder, Dr. Bea said, noting that being overweight and obese is often associated with low-grade inflammation that may contribute to cardiovascular disease, regardless of metabolic measures.That doesnt mean that weight trumps all.Indeed, the study found that individuals who were considered to be of normal weight but who had a single risk factor such as diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol were actually at greater risk for coronary heart disease than the healthy obese people.The messaging is always, lose weight no matter what, said Patrick Bradshaw, an epidemiologist at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley.But when youre at normal weight, youre not given a lot of lifestyle guidance.Your doctor may say exercise and eat right, but if you have these metabolic abnormalities youre at higher risk of disease, and you may need more intensive lifestyle modifications not to lose weight, but to improve health.One of the messages of this new paper is that metabolic health is important regardless of your weight, Dr. Bradshaw said.That goes for people who are considered underweight as well.The new study found, for example, that underweight individuals with no metabolic problems were at higher risk for stroke than normal weight, overweight or obese people with no metabolic problems, and if underweight people had metabolic issues, their risk increased even further.Interestingly, while the risks of being overweight and obese draw scrutiny, doctors are often at a loss to explain the risks of being too thin.
C.D.C. Panel Recommends a New Shingles Vaccine:::::Once a person has had chickenpox, the virus lies inactive in nerve tissue.Years later, it may reactivate as shingles.The C.D.C.estimates that about one million cases are diagnosed in the United States each year.This is what weve been waiting for, said Dr. Anne Louise Oaklander, an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and an expert in the disease.Shingles is an unappreciated and common cause of severe problems throughout the nervous system.Dr. Oaklander said that while rash symptoms lead some people to consider shingles as minor as a bad sunburn, the illness can cause strokes, encephalitis, spinal cord damage and loss of vision.Photo Given in one dose, Zostavax had shown a 51 percent reduction in shingles and a 67 percent reduction in nerve pain.Shingrix is given in two doses, and the company said clinical trials showed it to be about 98 percent effective for one year and about 85 percent over three years.By preventing shingles, the vaccine also drastically reduces the overall incidence of severe nerve pain, a lasting complication for about one in three people who get shingles.GlaxoSmithKline said it tested the vaccine in more than 38,000 people.We believe Shingrix will provide confidence in the protection one can expect from a shingles vaccine, said Luc Debruyne, the companys president of global vaccines.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The recommendation of the advisory committee will be considered an endorsement of Shingrix over Zostavax, although the closeness of the committee vote, 8 to 7, may mitigate the market loss for Merck.Dr. Kathleen Dooling, a medical officer in the C.D.C.s division of viral disease, said she expected the agencys final recommendation to be issued early next year.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Shingrix vaccine has the potential to prevent tens of thousands of cases of shingles and its complications, Dr. Dooling said.She cautioned, however, that more people had adverse reactions to Shingrix than to Zostavax, including fever and muscle aches.Patients and health care providers should be aware that this vaccine is very effective, but it also causes more reactions than they may be used to with other adult vaccines, she said.All indications are these are not dangerous to ones health, but they may interfere with your daily activities for a few days.GlaxoSmithKline said its new vaccine would cost about $280 and would be available next month.Zostavax costs about $223.
To Mend a Birth Defect, Surgeons Operate on the Patient Within the Patient:::::But now Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead are testing a new, experimental technique one that some in the field are eager to learn, but that others regard warily, questioning its long-term safety for the fetus.The surgeons had made a wide incision in the mothers lower abdomen, gently lifted out her uterus still attached internally and made two tiny, 4-millimeter slits.In one, they inserted a fetoscope, a small telescope fitted with a camera, light and grasping tool.The second slit was for other miniature instruments.Lit from within, the uterus glowed, red and magical in the darkened room.Spina bifida occurs early, at three to four weeks of pregnancy, when the tissue forming the spinal column should fold into a tube but does not close properly.There are 1,500 to 2,000 cases a year in the United States.Photo The causes are not fully understood, but in some cases a deficiency in the B-vitamin folic acid plays a role, which is why supplements are recommended for pregnant women and the vitamin is added to grain and cereal products.Introducing prenatal surgery for spina bifida was a bold step.In the early days, doctors were so worried about risk that they operated only for conditions that would be fatal if left unrepaired; if the surgery did harm, it would be to a fetus that would have died anyway.Spina bifida is generally not fatal, so the standard practice was to operate after birth.But the results of postnatal surgery were mixed: most children could not walk and had other problems.Doctors began to suspect that outcomes might be better if they could fix the defect before birth.Some of the spinal damage is caused by amniotic fluid, which turns increasingly toxic to the exposed nerve tissue as the pregnancy progresses and the fetus passes more and more wastes into the fluid.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Surgeons thought that if the opening could be closed before birth, sealing out the fluid, some of the nerve damage might be averted.They began operating in the 1990s, but it was not clear the surgery was helping.A landmark study published in 2011 found that for carefully selected fetuses prenatal surgery was better than operating after birth.The percentage of children who could walk independently rose to 40 percent from 20 percent, and the need for a shunt was cut in half, to 40 percent from 82 percent.The percent who benefit, I wish it was higher, Dr. Whitehead said, adding that so far prenatal surgery does not seem to help with bladder incontinence, and most children with spina bifida need catheters to pass urine.The ideal time for the surgery is from 24 to 26 weeks of pregnancy, Dr. Belfort said early enough to prevent some nerve damage, but late enough so that the baby has a decent chance of surviving and doing well if something goes wrong and it has to be delivered.Prenatal Surgery for Spina Bifida Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the spinal column does not close properly during the earliest stages of fetal development.In some cases, surgery on the fetus may reduce the severity of the condition.EMBRYO A groove along the embryos back folds together to form the neural tube, an enclosed space that will fill with the brain and spinal column.But a gap at the base of the tube can lead to spina bifida.Embryo at 21 days 22 days 28 days Head Back Gap DEVELOPING FETUS If the base of the neural tube fails to close, the spinal cord and nerves may be exposed or protrude through a gap in the spine, and the brain stem may be pulled down into the spinal column.Gap Embryo at 21 days 22 days 28 days Head Gap Back Gap EMBRYO A groove along the embryos back folds together to form the neural tube, an enclosed space that will be filled with the brain and spinal column.But a gap at the base of the tube can lead to spina bifida.DEVELOPING FETUS If the base of the neural tube fails to close, the spinal cord and nerves may be exposed or protrude through a gap in the spine, and the brain stem may be pulled down into the spinal column.His patient, Lexi Royer, 28, and her husband, Joshuwa, 29, were high-school sweethearts who had always wanted children.But Mrs. Royer had health problems that doctors said made pregnancy unlikely.She had one miscarriage and then did not conceive again.So the couple were thrilled in May to discover that she was pregnant.During an ultrasound exam at 13 weeks, they saw their son for the first time.There were a lot of happy tears, Mrs. Royer said.Then the ultrasound tech said she had to go back and get the doctor.A wrenching series of tests and visits to specialists followed.With each one, the news got worse.The defect was big and severe, and the brain stem was being pulled down into the spinal column.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It sounded like we were looking at brain damage, feeding tubes, a breathing tube, a wheelchair, just a bad quality of life, Mrs. Royer said.Termination was offered as an option, and Mrs. Royer felt that doctors were pushing it.But this might be their only chance to have a child.They wanted to learn more about their sons condition.Mrs. Royer, a hairdresser, and her husband, a firefighter and emergency medical technician, turned to the internet and discovered Facebook groups for parents of children with spina bifida.Some reported good results from a procedure that doctors in their home city, San Diego, had never even heard of: fetoscopic surgery.In early September, they went to Houston for two days of testing.The results confirmed that their son had a severe spinal defect, but still gave them hope.
U.S. Hospitals Wrestle With Shortages of Drug Supplies Made in Puerto Rico:::::Some device and supply companies have already begun limiting shipments of certain items from the island, ranging from mesh for repairing hernias to surgical scalpels and tools used in orthopedic surgery.On Monday, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, questioned companies statements that their plants were back in operation: We understand that manufacturing is running at minimal levels, and certainly far from full production, Dr. Gottlieb said in prepared remarks published Monday by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.He is scheduled to be questioned by the committee on Tuesday.In his prepared statement, Dr. Gottlieb said many plants are running at below 50 percent capacity, with many firms operating around 20 percent capacity, and some even less.We have found no firm operating above 70 percent of their normal operation.Photo In a recent interview, Dr. Gottlieb said he was worried that if conditions dont improve, more shortages of both drugs and medical devices might follow by early next year.Pharmaceutical products made in Puerto Rico account for nearly 10 percent of all drugs consumed by Americans, and about 80 firms make medical products there, the F.D.A.has said.I dont think weve dealt with a situation where weve had so many simultaneous impacts to what are very important facilities, Dr. Gottlieb said.So far, we have been able to mitigate these issues, but its been all hands on deck at the F.D.A., and theres been close calls.Dr. Gottlieb says the F.D.A.is watching the supply of about 30 drugs that are made on the island, in addition to medical devices.Most companies are still running on diesel generators, and manufacturers that have been able to connect to the power grid are still encountering an unpredictable supply of electricity, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Cathy Denning, the senior vice president of sourcing operations at Vizient, which negotiates with medical companies on behalf of its member hospitals, said several device manufacturers, including Medtronic, which makes surgical staples, and Stryker, which makes orthopedic surgery products, were shipping reduced supplies of some products to hospitals because of Hurricane Maria.We here at Vizient had an aha moment when we realized how much manufacturing actually takes place in Puerto Rico, she said.Last week, a Johnson & Johnson executive told investors that the company couldnt rule out intermittent shortages of some formulations of its products, although he noted that many were made elsewhere.Johnson & Johnson makes Tylenol and the H.I.V.drug Prezista in Puerto Rico, as well as other products.Soon after the storm, Johnson & Johnson Vision informed customers that a product used in cataract surgery might go into short supply, according to Vizient.A spokesman for Johnson & Johnson said production of the product has resumed, but that it has not yet been shipped from Puerto Rico.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The F.D.A.has been supplying logistical help to companies, providing fuel for the generators and assisting with moving finished products off the island.Dr. Gottlieb said some companies had gotten down to a 24-hour supply of diesel fuel, and representatives for the medical-device industry had said some generators were beginning to break down, requiring emergency repair.Pharmacists at half a dozen hospitals, from Utah to North Carolina, said in interviews that the fluid bag shortage had had a domino effect, leading to scarcities of a range of products as administrators race to stock up on the supplies they need to keep their hospitals running smoothly.Even products like empty bags and plastic tubing, which are also made by Baxter in Puerto Rico, have been hard to come by, some said.With drug shortages, it is often a race to see who can find a supply of the drug on shortage and also any alternatives, said Philip J. Trapskin, who is the program manager of medication use strategy and innovation at UW Health, the University of Wisconsin-Madisons health system.We have been able to get what we need to avoid disruptions in patient care, but the mix of products is not ideal and there are no guarantees we will continue to get the supplies we need.Photo Baxter recently announced that the F.D.A.had allowed it to import bags from the companys factories in Ireland and Australia, and said production in Puerto Rico was slowly resuming.The company, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., said it was also helping its employees on the island, including distributing generators and propane-powered cooktops for the workers use.While the storm devastated the island in a day, the recovery will take time, the company said in a statement.Baxter did not provide a timeline for when the bags would be back in stock, and pharmacists said they anticipated that the bags might not be available for many more weeks or months.This is a big deal for hospitals across the country, said Scott Knoer, the chief pharmacy officer at the Cleveland Clinic.Were really still trying to get the information we need to manage it.Baxter has been rationing its supply, shipping limited orders of the bags filled with saline and dextrose to hospitals based on a percentage of what the institutions typically use.We are getting small amounts, but it is nowhere what we need in order to take care of patients, said Jeff Rosner, who oversees pharmacy contracting and purchasing at the Cleveland Clinic.The impact has rippled throughout the clinics normal operations.Alternatives, such as injecting some drugs into an IV known as an IV push take more time for nurses, which divert them from attending to other needs.And the method is not appropriate for some drugs.This has repercussions, Mr. Knoer said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The pharmacists said the shortage had not yet affected patient care, although some of the alternatives require that employees learn new systems or adopt complex practices that can introduce human error.If the shortage persists, some said elective procedures, like knee replacements, might be postponed.It is a predicament that is all too familiar.While Hurricane Maria caused the latest problem, drug shortages have plagued the nations hospital system for years.The affected products are typically longstanding staples, like epinephrine or morphine, and are often sterile injectable drugs that sell for low profit margins.In 2014, a shortage of large saline bags, which were manufactured by Baxter and are not currently scarce, led to state and federal investigations into its business practices.Even the Mini-Bags have previously been in short supply, and pharmacists said shipments of the small bags had been unpredictable before the hurricane.Its like, do we have any great faith this company is going to be able to turn this shortage around, when they havent been able to effectively turn around the shortages they had in existence before?said Debby Cowan, the pharmacy manager at Angel Medical Center, a small hospital in Franklin, in North Carolinas Smoky Mountains.Like Dr. Gottlieb, many of the hospital administrators said their eye was on the horizon.With so many drug companies manufacturing products in Puerto Rico, Mr. Rosner said, I am fearful that this may not be the end of the shortages it may only be the beginning.
Jewish Philanthropists Create a Prize for Christian Missionaries:::::The tiny country is one of the worlds poorest and suffers from the same ethnic divisions and political violence that led to the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda.Photo The money, according to the African Mission Healthcare Foundation, which oversees the award, is paying for a new surgical building and refurbished laboratory, where local medical students will be trained in surgery, and also for operations and prosthetics to help 350 people walk again.This years prize will go to Dr. Russell E. White, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Tenwek Hospital in western Kenya.Thousands of Kenyans have heart valves scarred by rheumatic heart disease, which hardly exists in wealthy countries with ready access to antibiotics but is common in poor nations.The valve damage, which can be debilitating or fatal, typically emerges years after a childs routine strep throat has gone untreated.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The money will be used to train cardiac surgeons to repair valves and to treat esophageal cancer and complications of tuberculosis, as well as other common local ailments.It will also pay for ultrasound screening in schools and for antibiotics for students whose strep infections have not yet damaged their hearts.Mr. Gerson began raising money in 2002 when a college friend, Dr. Jon Fielder, worked in a missionary hospital in Kenya and described an overwhelming dilemma: Faith-based institutions provide 20 to 50 percent of all medical care in Africa estimates vary but the American and European congregations that once supported mission hospitals have shrunk.The doctors who staff these facilities struggle to buy modern equipment, but every day they spend away raising money means dozens of patients go unseen.With the money he makes through the Gerson Lehrman Group, which pairs experts and investors seeking advice, Mr. Gerson also supports United Hatzalah in Israel, a network of 3,500 motorcyle-riding volunteer paramedics who whip through traffic faster than ambulances can.The new award, he hopes, will galvanize attention around what these superheroes do.
When the Make-Believe World Is All Too Real:::::But then the delusions turned on her.The voices said she wasnt going to make it, there was no point in even trying, she was better off not being here.Thats how she ended up in the hospital the first time.They gave her medication.The delusions eventually went away.She was depressed for a long time afterward.They gave her more medication, and then she got better.Our son was 5 months old when the second episode happened, just as unexpected as the first.My wife was on medication, she was seeing a therapist, everyone thought that the psychosis was a one-time thing, but it still happened, right on the eve of Halloween.They now called it bipolar disorder.I took my son out to explore the neighborhood in our improvised lumberjack outfits.I read somewhere, maybe in a pamphlet from the hospital or on a forum online, that you shouldnt engage a psychotic persons delusions.Talking about the delusions might breathe more life into them, and will only get the person more agitated.Acknowledgment of the surreal is akin to nurturing it.So when my wife was in the hospital for the second time, and found it reassuring to talk about her idea that heaven was a place on earth, I changed the subject.Her delusion was pleasant, but it wasnt real.And yet, as a parent, I love imagination.I constantly make believe with my son, to make the world more exciting and interesting.Theres Fred the Friendly Coyote, whom we sometimes hear at night in the hills nearby; the monster broom in our closet to sweep the scary monsters out of the house; the tree on our favorite hike where we leave acorns wrapped up in leaves for the friendly forest monster Totoro.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In my vision of parenting, the laws of logic, gravity and time dont matter all that matters is that the world feels safe and loving for our son.Which I guess is a way of saying that heaven should be a place on earth.The third episode of psychosis crept in slowly.It began the same, with a loss of appetite, sleeplessness and anxiety, but we tried to avoid taking Giulia to the hospital.We thought maybe she could ride it out at home.But the night before Halloween, long after Jonas had fallen asleep, our plan came crashing down.Giulias psychosis pulled her in different directions first, she said I was dangerous and needed to get away; then, she was the dangerous one.I called the hospital and they said they wanted to admit her.Giulia was calm, resigned to the fate of a third hospitalization, but I felt so torn.Her focus this time was on the interconnectedness of all life on earth, a beautiful concept, one I too believe in.I was taking her to the hospital because of an idea I wanted to pass on to our son.But the way Giulia fixated on the idea and spoke of it over and over again made it clear she wasnt well.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I spent all day at the hospital, until I had to leave to take Jonas trick-or-treating.Thankfully I tagged along with other families, because I couldnt muster the effort to match his energy.We went home and fell asleep on the couch in front of the TV.Jonas was still in his costume.The next morning, Jonas and I got dressed and took our dog out for a hike to our favorite tree.We gathered acorns and leaves along the way, so we could leave them as gifts for Totoro.In the Japanese anime movie, Totoro comforts two young girls whose mom is in the hospital.They exchange acorns as a sign of their affection.This morning, more than any other, I needed Totoro to wrap Jonas and me in a cocoon of protection and affection.So we went out to offer acorns for a friendly forest monster that doesnt exist.Its been three years since Giulia was last hospitalized.We have never known why her illness recurred at Halloween.Jonas is 5 now he is dressing up as Harry Potter this year.Ive continued to try to build a world with him where he feels included and comforted, even though I know that the world can be anything but.I put on costumes, and invent magical creatures, all in the aim of building that sense of safety for him.We hope that psychosis never returns for Giulia.Its a terrible, disorienting experience, and Im relieved that we know which medications help her weather that storm.But if it does, Im going to listen to her more as she wrestles with her conflicting thoughts.Maybe theres more that I can do than just shutting down the things that arent real.Maybe just as the make-believe world is a place of delight and refuge for Jonas, theres something profound or even helpful in what Giulia envisions.Maybe.
Should I Get Revaccinated as an Adult?:::::Photo Q.Is there any benefit to revaccinating adults against measles, mumps, whooping cough and other diseases making a comeback?A.Yes, there are some vaccinations that are recommended for adults, to protect themselves or infants too young for vaccination.A student at a college with a mumps outbreak, for example, may be asked to get revaccinated to increase protection, because immunity wanes over time, said Dr. Amanda Cohn, a pediatrician and senior adviser for vaccines at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In adulthood, mumps can cause severely swollen glands and testicles as well as aseptic meningitis, which produces such symptoms as fever, headache, stiff neck and vomiting.The mumps part of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is the weak link, said Dr. Cody Meissner, chief of pediatric infectious disease at Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center in Boston and a member of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee, which advises the federal government.We could use a better mumps vaccine, he said, though theres unlikely to be a new one because of the economics of vaccine development.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With measles, anyone who was born after 1957 and received two doses of the measles vaccine in childhood should have lifelong protection, said Dr. Matthew Leibowitz, chief of infectious diseases at Newton-Wellesley Hospital outside Boston.People who are unsure whether they got two shots in childhood should get revaccinated if they are traveling to areas where measles is common, including South America, Asia or Africa, he said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Most Americans who get measles now are unvaccinated or under-vaccinated, Dr. Cohn said, because they grew up in a country where vaccination was not required, chose not to be vaccinated, are too young for vaccination or have compromised immune systems.

Rath, a former associate director of the naval laboratory, said, Isabella Karle took the task of deciphering the theory to provide not only a solution but also to show that it could be used to solve very complex molecules, such as proteins.Other scientists took notice in the mid-1960s.With a clearer picture of the structure of biological molecules, drug researchers now have a much better idea of the chemistry going on inside the body and how to formulate drugs to treat illnesses.After I found some structures that no one could have dreamt of solving before, it started to get a lot of attention, Dr. Karle told The New York Times in 2013.When Jerome Karle and Dr. Hauptman were awarded the Nobel for their work in 1985, Jerome Karle was deeply disappointed that his wife was not also honored.He wanted to not accept it, Ms. Hanson said, and she told him, Go ahead, thats silly, you should accept it.Photo Isabella Helen Lugoski was born in Detroit on Dec. 2, 1921, the daughter of Polish immigrants.Her father, Zygmunt Lugoski, worked for the citys transportation system.Her mother, the former Elizabeth Graczyk, ran a restaurant eventually with Isabellas help.My mother realized fairly early that I like numbers, Dr. Karle recalled in an interview in 2015.I soon became the accountant, so to speak.Fresh meat was delivered every day, and the butcher left the bill that had to be paid once a week.So once a week I added up all the numbers of the money that was owed him.She skipped a couple of grades in elementary school.Later, she learned she would need to take a science class in high school to attend a university.By whim, she said, she chose chemistry, and the teacher, a woman, sparked her passion for the subject.(Her father was initially disappointed.He had hoped she would be a lawyer, as he had wanted to be.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story She attended Wayne University (now Wayne State University) in Detroit for a semester before obtaining a four-year scholarship to the University of Michigan, where she received her bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees, all before she turned 23.She met her husband while an undergraduate: The spaces in the physical chemistry laboratory were assigned in alphabetical order, so Karle was seated next to Lugoski.I walked into the physical chemistry laboratory and theres a young man in the desk next to mine with his apparatus all set up running his experiment, Dr. Karle said.I dont think I was very polite about it.I asked him how did he get in here early and have everything all set up.He didnt like that.So we didnt talk to each other for a while.Eventually, they did talk again.They married in 1942.Both worked in Chicago on the Manhattan Project, the government effort during World War II to develop an atomic bomb.Isabella Karle developed processes to synthesize plutonium chloride out of lumps of impure plutonium oxide.The Karles moved to the Naval Research Laboratory after the war and stayed there until both retired on the same day in July 2009.Jerome Karle died in 2013.In addition to her daughter Louise, Dr. Karle is survived by two other daughters, Jean Karle Dean and Madeleine Karle Tawney; four grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.Isabella Karle published more than 350 papers.She was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.In 1993, the Franklin Institute presented her with the Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science, and in 1995 she received the National Medal of Science from President Bill Clinton in a White House ceremony.Dr. Rath, who supervised Dr. Karles work in Washington, said that her renown within the scientific community was so wide that when scientists from around the world visited the Naval Research Laboratory, they would very often make one request.They all wanted to see Isabella, he said.
Underweight Women at Risk of Early Menopause:::::Photo Underweight women are at increased risk for early menopause, a new study has found.This study, in Human Reproduction, followed 78,759 premenopausal women ages 25 to 42 beginning in 1989.Over the following 22 years, 2,804 of them reported natural menopause before age 45.After controlling for smoking, pregnancies, oral contraceptive use and other factors, they found that compared with women who had a body mass index of 18.5 to 22.4 (within the normal range), those with a B.M.I.under 18.5 at any age had a 30 percent increased risk of early menopause.Overweight women (B.M.I.25 to 34.9) had a slightly lower risk of early menopause, and there was no significant increased risk in very obese women with a B.M.I.higher than 35.The lead author, Kathleen L. Szegda, who was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, when the work was done, said the reasons for the link between weight and the timing of menopause are unclear and that more research is needed to replicate these results.Still, she said, Underweight women may want to discuss the findings with their doctors.Early menopause is associated with several health conditions, including osteoporosis, dementia, heart disease and early death, and has implications for family planning.
Why Doing Good Is Good for the Do-Gooder:::::Why is the first instinct for many to volunteer and donate after a natural disaster?One reason is that as humans weve evolved to survive in groups, not alone.Rallying together makes us feel less alone in the experience, explained the sociologist Christine Carter, a fellow at the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley.When our survival is threatened, we are going to reach out and strengthen our connections with people around us.We show generosity.We show compassion.We show gratitude.These are all emotions that function to connect us with each other, Dr. Carter said.Scientific evidence supports the idea that acts of generosity can be beneficial when we volunteer and give back regularly and not just after a natural disaster.Volunteering is linked to health benefits like lower blood pressure and decreased mortality rates.Dr. Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist and founder of the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, has been studying the effects of positive emotions, such as compassion and kindness, on the brain since the 1990s.He said the brain behaves differently during an act of generosity than it does during a hedonistic activity.When we do things for ourselves, those experiences of positive emotions are more fleeting.They are dependent on external circumstances, he said.When we engage in acts of generosity, those experiences of positive emotion may be more enduring and outlast the specific episode in which we are engaged.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Helping others also gives us a sense of purpose.Dr. Linda Fried co-founded Experience Corps, a program that engages retirees as literacy tutors, after she discovered a strong association between a sense of purpose and well-being throughout life.Older adults who volunteered to help children with reading and writing tended to experience less memory loss and maintain greater physical mobility, one study suggested.Giving back is a fundamental teaching of many religions.Jesus had the Golden Rule.Buddha said in order to brighten ones own path, one must light the path of others.During a trip to India in 2016, I experienced firsthand how the benefits of doing good are well established in Indian society.I paid a visit to a Vedic astrologer because I was anxious about an uncertain future, my own personal crisis, and received a list of prescriptions to help others to get through it.The first task was to buy a black-and-white checkered blanket, then visit a local leper colony and donate it to the first person I saw.My next task was to buy a six-pound bag of lentils, circle it around my head, chant a Sanskrit mantra and give it to a homeless person.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Certainly, many Westerners would roll their eyes at these unconventional prescriptions, but they were familiar to my Indian friends, who believe they hold real power.Later, to better understand the significance of the rituals, I reached out to Dr. Deepak Chopra, author of You Are the Universe.He said the philosophical underpinnings in India come from the Vedas and Buddhist traditions, where all human suffering is a result of the hallucination of the separate self.Dr. Chopra explained: The moment you identify yourself as separate from other beings, or other people, or separate from life in general then you will suffer.And it all begins with initial anxiety because when youre disconnected from people and life, you feel fear, and that creates the beginning of suffering.Would Western doctors ever prescribe acts of generosity?Dr. John Rowe, a professor of health policy and aging at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, doesnt rule it out.We have sufficient scientific information to justify a very significant public health initiative, he said.If there were a retiree in my office I would ask them, Do you smoke?Do you exercise?What is your diet like?I should also be asking them if they volunteer.
The More Lavish the Gifts to Doctors, the Costlier the Drugs They Prescribe:::::Photo When drug companies give gifts to doctors, the doctors prescribe more and more expensive drugs.The more lavish the gifts, the greater the effect.Researchers used data from the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services on the prescriptions written by doctors in Washington, and information from the D.C. Department of Health on gifts from pharmaceutical and medical device companies given to providers in 2013.The study, in PLOS One, found that 39.1 percent of prescribers received gifts ranging in value from $7 to $200,000, while the rest received none.Health care providers given gifts wrote an average of 892 prescriptions compared with 389 for those who accepted none.The average cost of a prescription was $135 for gift recipients and $85 for the others.Gift recipients chose the brand-name drug a third of the time, compared with a quarter of the time for non- recipients.Any gift was associated with higher cost prescriptions, but the larger gifts had an even greater effect.Those who received gifts worth more than $500 during the year averaged $189 per prescription.The senior author, Dr. Adriane J. Fugh-Berman, director of PharmedOut, a project on drug prescribing based at Georgetown University Medical Center, had some straightforward advice for patients.You shouldnt see doctors who see drug reps, she said.Less than a minute of talking to a drug rep will increase prescribing of brand-name drugs.
The Battle of Brains vs. Brawn:::::But whether a similar trade-off occurred with our muscles has remained in doubt.Muscles potentially provided another route to survival during our species early days.With sufficient brawn, animals, including people, could physically overpower prey and sprint from danger.But muscles are also very calorically needy and, like brain tissue, use blood sugar as their primary fuel.So scientists have wondered whether and how early humans bodies balanced the fueling needs of their brains and their brawn.Did one take precedence over the other?If so, that choice could tell us something about the underpinnings of human development and also how best, even now, to manage thinking and moving.Since experiments on cavepeople are, however, not practicable, researchers at Cambridge University in England decided instead to focus on the bodily machinations of 62 elite, collegiate rowers for their new study, which was published this month in Scientific Reports.The scientists hoped to suss out what happens when both muscles and minds are stressed, and if one of those operations gets preferential treatment from the body.To find out, they asked the rowers, who were all young, male and fit, to visit a university lab on three separate occasions.During one visit, the men sat quietly while dozens of words were displayed on a large screen in front of them.The men had three minutes to memorize the words and then, immediately afterward (when the screen went dark) write down as many as they could remember.This was their mental task.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.On another day, they rowed on a rowing machine as intensely as they could for three minutes while the researchers tracked their power output, testing muscular prowess.Finally, on the last visit, they rowed for three minutes while simultaneously viewing a list of new words and then, immediately afterward, writing down as many as they could recall.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Then the researchers simply compared their performance on each task.Almost uniformly, the men had been able to produce fewer watts and recall fewer words when they performed the muscular and mental tasks together.But the falloff in physical functioning was much steeper than the mental slump.The rowers lost almost 13 percent of their power output, a decline that was about 30 percent greater than their loss in word recall after the combined session.Our proposed explanation for this finding is that they were both competing for the same resource, which in this case was blood sugar for fuel, says Danny Longman, a postdoctoral research fellow at Cambridge who led the study.And the brain won.The implication of this victory is that thinking probably provided more advantage for us during evolution than brawniness, Dr. Longman says, and on those occasions that both systems needed to be fed, the brain got its portion first.Of course, this study was very short-term and viewed the tug-of-war between brains and muscles only indirectly.The researchers did not track actual changes in blood sugar uptake by any tissues.They also looked only at quite-intense exercise and used memory recall as their sole marker for thinking.But even with these limitations, the study to some extent advances our understanding of how we became the species that we are, Dr. Longman says.For me, the main message of this study is a bit philosophical, he says.An enlarged and highly functioning brain is one of the key factors that make us human.This study demonstrated, in a very simple way, this defining characteristic of our species.More humbly, the results also indicate that intense workouts may not be the optimal time to compose your next epic poem or calculate tax withholding.
Arsenic Reductions in Drinking Water Tied to Fewer Cancer Deaths:::::Photo The Environmental Protection Agencys revised rule on arsenic contamination in drinking water has resulted in fewer lung, bladder and skin cancers.In 2006, the E.P.A.reduced the arsenic maximum in public water systems to 10 micrograms per liter, from the previous level of 50 micrograms.The rule does not apply to private wells.Using data from a continuing nationwide health survey, researchers compared urinary arsenic levels in 2003, before the new rule went into effect, with those in 2014, after it had been fully implemented.There were 14,127 participants in the study, and the scientists adjusted for arsenic contributions from tobacco and dietary sources.The report is in Lancet Public Health.They found a 17 percent reduction in arsenic levels among those using public water systems.The researchers estimate that the new rule resulted in 200 to 900 fewer lung and bladder cancers and 50 fewer skin cancers annually.The senior author, Dr. Ana Navas-Acien, a professor of environmental health sciences at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, said that water treatment to remove arsenic is expensive and a challenge for smaller cities.We are trying to provide information in a way thats useful for policymakers, she said.If we could eliminate arsenic entirely, it would be ideal.But we have to be realistic.
Lights, Camera and, Yes, Music: Reporting From the Operating Room as Doctors Perform Fetal Surgery:::::I learned about this one when I contacted Dr. Belfort about a YouTube video in which he described the need for tiny tools to operate on fetuses.Hes got a book full of his own detailed drawings a cross between Leonardo and Rube Goldberg of instruments he wants made.In our conversation he mentioned spina bifida surgery, and I wanted to see it.Permission was not immediate: Doctors, patients and hospital officials had to consent.Once they agreed, a public relations person was assigned to accompany me and a photographer in the operating room.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Before the operation started, one of the surgeons who would assist, Dr. Oluyinka O. Olutoye, shared a sobering thought about the potential risks of performing surgery on two patients at once.Fetal surgery, he said, is one of the few operations with a 200 percent risk of mortality.Operating rooms are usually kept cool, almost chilly.But not for fetal surgery.If the temperature is too low, the fetuss heartbeat can slow down too much, so this operating room was pretty hot.When the photographer, Batrice de Ga, and I were changing into scrubs in the womens locker room, a nurse warned, Its going to be like a sauna in there.It was crowded, too.Besides Dr. Belfort and a pediatric neurosurgeon, Dr. William Whitehead, there were two anesthesiologists, a pediatric cardiologist and two doctors who would steady the uterus and help to gently hold the fetus in position, as well as several nurses.For reporters in the operating room, the job is to see whats going on, stay out of the way and not touch or even get near anything draped in blue, which is the sterile stuff.Its O.K.to look over the surgeons shoulders as long as you dont brush their gowns.And the reporter has to stay out of the photographs, too.In this case there were amazing views of the surgery, on three flat screens that showed images from the camera inside the uterus.Because the doctors were operating through the tiny slits, they needed those images to see what they were doing.People often ask if Ive ever felt sick or faint in an operating room.So far, no: Whats going on is invariably so interesting, and Im so caught up in trying to understand it, that squeamishness just doesnt happen.I dont like the smell: Surgeons seem to cauterize everything they cut, and burning flesh has an acrid odor, but either it doesnt last or my nose gets used to it.At 9:28 that Tuesday morning, the soft Pandora music had moved on from Eric Church to Neil Youngs Harvest Moon, and he was singing, I want to see you dance again, as Mrs. Royers son came into view.He seemed to be kneeling inside her womb; we could see his bottom and the soles of his feet, impossibly small.Photo The operation was an endurance test for the surgeons.They stood shoulder to shoulder for hours, hands and arms in the air as they worked through the slits, painstakingly snipping tissue, stretching it over the open spine and stitching it shut to make a watertight seal.The spinal defect was so big that there seemed barely enough skin to cover it, and it was painful to watch it being tugged into place.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The room was so hot that I took off a gown Id been given to put over my scrubs, and I found a chair to sit in periodically, to give my legs a break.There were no breaks for the surgeons.Israel Kamakawiwoole was singing Over the Rainbow as the last stitch went into the fetus.By noon, the surgeons were done.I sweat like hell, Dr. Belfort said, peeling his gloves off pale waterlogged hands that looked as if theyd spent too long in the bath.Mrs. Royers husband, Joshuwa, his mother and Mrs. Royers parents were waiting anxiously, and crowded into a small room when Dr. Belfort arrived.Everything went very well, so you can relax, he said, showing them pictures of the fetuss back, before and after.So far, so good.Now we have to hope and pray she doesnt go into preterm labor.Mr. Royer was stoic, but the parents, the reporter and the photographer all burst into tears and hugged one another.Later, Mrs. Royers mother, Raquel Bourgeois, said the family understood that the operation was not a cure, and that her grandson would almost certainly have some degree of disability.But were strong believers in God, and were at peace, Mrs. Bourgeois said.This baby is going to be so loved.We just dont care.She went on: Lexi and Josh are very strong together.This is not going to break them.They are the best possible parents for this child in this situation.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I am wishing the best for Mrs. and Mr. Royer and their son, and I hope to report on how theyre all doing after hes born.
The Symptoms of Protracted Dying:::::We can place a long-term breathing tube in her neck and a feeding tube in her stomach, I said, but there are no cases in the medical literature of someone like her living independently again.The best we could hope for is a life of near-complete dependence.When we first came to the hospital, doctors told us my mom might be brain-dead, one of Geraldines daughters countered.Now, she takes breaths on her own sometimes.Shes already improving.Just as Geraldine was stubborn and exceptional in life, her family believed she would be exceptional in beating her prognosis.It might be different if my mom was 70 or 80, her daughter went on, but shes only 56.For Geraldines family, the immediate fear of watching her die outweighed the unfamiliar pain of sustaining her on machines and watching her disappear in a long-term care facility.Our medical team had seen hundreds of people like Geraldine, most of whom returned to the hospital month after month to manage complications of immobility.Sparse cases of recoveries were overwhelmed by painful, expensive, drawn-out deaths, ones we would never wish for ourselves or our own families.But for Geraldines family, every decision was new.For them, nobody was like Geraldine.In every other part of medicine, doctors make recommendations for medications, lifestyle changes and surgeries.We dont offer cancer patients six different chemotherapy regimens and ask them to weigh the pros and cons.Yet when it comes to end-of-life decisions, doctors are terrified of violating patient autonomy.We are scared of our own medical opinions.Instead of saying, I recommend..., we often offer a platter of life-prolonging measures, most of which are unlikely to improve a patients quality of life, but which offer the possibility of hope.The patients heart will still beat.Her personality will be gone, but her chest will still rise and collapse.Families see an opportunity for loss to be delayed, perhaps even dodged.Then we are surprised when they take us up on the offer to prolong dying.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I think she would want more time to try and recover, Geraldines daughter said.So we kept Geraldine alive.A plastic breathing tube sprouted from her neck and a feeding tube with peach-colored formula buried itself in her stomach.In the hospital, Geraldines family learned the common complications of immobility: infection, blood clots and bedsores.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.When the infection started, a fever sounded the alarm.We counted the possible causes.Geraldine had a breathing tube in her windpipe, a feeding tube in her stomach and an IV line in her neck, each an access road for bacteria.Lying in bed put her at risk for pneumonia and urinary tract infections.Like mosquitoes in standing water, infections proliferate when the body is still.Geraldines blood clots werent a surprise.Medical students are inculcated with the famous triad of conditions that predispose patients to clots, and Geraldine had all of them.Her body was inflamed and torn from the heart attack, infections and procedures that caused her blood vessels to release molecules that helped blood to clot.Lying in a hospital bed, not moving anything unless it was moved, her circulation slowed.Pools of static blood dried into a thick paste in her blood vessels.Thanks to aggressive nursing care, when Geraldine developed a bedsore it was managed at an early stage.But the term bedsore is an understated euphemism.It recalls the annoyance of a cold sore or the tenderness of muscles after the gym.The grotesque image of bone pressing through skin is hidden.In people who are immobilized, bedsores develop under bony prominences like the heels and the skull.At first, the skin becomes red.If the bedsore progresses, the skins outer layer, then the inner layer, breaks down.Finally, in the most severe stage, bone, muscles and tendons are exposed.The entire process can happen in just a few days.Sixty days after her heart attack, Geraldine was stable enough to leave the I.C.U.She was in a persistent vegetative state unresponsive to external stimuli.She opened her eyes, as if she were about to say something, but nothing ever came out.Her gaze roved around the room.An ambulance took her to a long term care facility, where she was dependent on machines and people.When you first hear someone you love is sick, you think its a short term thing, her daughter told me over the phone a month later.Its adjusting to the long term aspect thats hard.Geraldines daughter woke up at 5 a.m. every day to spend time with her mom before work.I think its more of a disappointment for my dad, she said.He told us that if he ever gets sick, he doesnt want any of this.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Geraldines family lived between hope and guilt, with the weight of each side in flux.If my mom knew what we were doing right now, shed probably be mad at us, her daughter reflected a few weeks ago.Yet in the same breath, her voice rose and she said: My moms a fighter, so I think she would be happy with us giving her a shot.Were hoping for this miraculous turnaround.It did not come.Geraldine died of sepsis earlier this month, after more than four months of care.People dont know what theyre in for, Geraldines daughter reflected after the funeral.It hurt all of us to see her like that.In the final days of Geraldines life, a doctor asked if the family of another patient in the I.C.U.could visit Geraldine to see what prolonged dying looked like.Geraldines family was kind enough to agree.The visiting family chose to transition their loved one to hospice care.
The Rules of the Doctor’s Heart:::::M. was on this list of supplicants.His own heart, meanwhile, was failing so precipitously that he needed constant medical monitoring.Weird, deadly electrical rhythms arose out of his dying cardiac muscles, like ripples on a stagnating pond, necessitating defibrillating shocks to reset his rhythm.Fluid pooled in his feet, and the skin on his calves came off in strips.Photo There was a second reason to monitor M.s status.Hearts are so rare that patients have to be under constant surveillance to ensure that they continue to qualify for the transplant.Transplantation is a touch-and-go procedure; a patient on the wait-list must be in the best possible condition before receiving the donor organ.An innocuous-seeming infection, or kidney failure, can spiral out of control after the transplant.If its bad now, itll only be worse later, the transplant nurse told me, grimly.She was efficient-looking, dressed in a white nursing smock.She noted M.s vital signs and then disappeared down the corridor with her book.And so we watched him.Every vital sign temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate was dutifully recorded in the log books and on the residents notes.I was on call every third night.I would stop by to say hello to M. and wait for the transplant nurse to come around.He would be puzzling over 40-across on the Sunday crossword.She would check his numbers.Maybe there will be one tonight, she would say, before signing off for the day.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It must have been on the third or fourth week of M.s hospitalization, sometime late in the evening, that the transplant unit called up to the I.C.U.A kid had dead-ended his motorcycle on a concrete barrier on the expressway.He was declared brain-dead shortly after the accident, but his heart was intact.M. was on the top of the transplant list.I half-ran, half-walked to his room to bring him the news.He had been dozing through most of the day and night a sign, perhaps, that he was having trouble pumping blood to his brain.He woke up, smiled wearily and then drifted off to sleep again.Around midnight, I was paged to the unit.Hes spiked a small fever, the unit nurse said.She tried to look at me blandly.Its nothing, she wanted me to say.Its not real.Nothing to see here, folks.Get back to work.How small?101.Well, lets retake the temperature.She measured it again.101.His systolic blood pressure had also dropped ever so slightly a few, barely discernible notches.But his pressures had always been low.I paused for a moment, weighing my choices.Try another thermometer.And check the pressure again.Actually, lets wait and try in 10 minutes.She brought another instrument out from the nurses station.M. began to sense the slowly building hubbub in the unit.He sat up woozily.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Do you feel anything wrong?A chill?Nope, he said.Nothing.I examined him, pore by pore, looking for a potential source.The nurse entered the room and made a tiny motion to see her outside.I met her by the nurses station.Should we record the temperature?she asked, whispering, as if the intercom might be eavesdropping.The stakes could not have been clearer to both of us.If we put the number in the chart, M. would temporarily fall off the list for the next morning.The transplant surgeons at this hospital, I knew, would never risk taking a febrile, potentially septic, patient to the operating room.I felt paralyzed.Medicine depends on looking at data objectively, dispassionately; a decade of training had taught me that.But it also depends on understanding that tests can mislead us, that data can deceive: What patient ever fits squarely into an assigned box?My fingers hovered above the computer, where I was meant to write my note and record the fateful temperature spike, but I found that I couldnt type a word.Advertisement Continue reading the main story At 1 a.m., I called the attending physician.I felt foolish: I imagined her scuffling around her nightstand for her spectacles, anticipating a question about an acute cardiac crisis.Instead, there was a mumbling, hesitant resident trying to decide whether to write a note.But she understood immediately.She walked through the details of the case.Had I really evaluated the infection?Yes, yes, I reassured her or rather, tried to reassure myself.Its really your decision, Sid, she said.But youve got to consider that in some other hospital, theres some other young guy a doctor, with a Ph.D. waiting for that same heart.If your patient goes to the O.R.infected, hes not going to make it, and the new heart is going to die with him.I put the phone down and turned to the nurse.The fever had come down to 100 degrees.What if we hadnt measured it in the first place?What if wed forgotten to take the vitals on one shift?How about all the things we dont measure?Muscle tone?Wakefulness?If a temperature spikes in a forest....I returned to the computer, tried to type my note, hesitated and stopped again.I wrote my final note at 2 in the morning.Temperature: 101 degrees, currently 100.No obvious source of infection.A chest X-ray showed no signs of a pneumonia.A complete history and physical exam was unrevealing.Awaiting blood-culture data.At rounds the next morning, I felt as if I had let the team down.I presented the case quietly, feeling the eyes of my co-residents burning holes into my skull.No one had any questions.There were just a few more days left in the rotation, and I went to say goodbye to M.

Iowa Withdraws Request to Leave Obamacare Market:::::Critics said approving the Iowa waiver would have paved the way for other states to follow, eroding the health laws protections for low- and middle-income Americans.Some had planned on filing a legal challenge if the Trump administration had said yes to the request, known as a state innovation waiver.This is a case of the laws guardrails protecting people and their coverage, said Sarah Lueck, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning group that had opposed the waiver.Hopefully now Iowa can start looking at more practical and less disruptive solutions to deal with the challenges in its market.The Washington Post reported recently that President Trump in August had asked Seema Verma, the federal official in charge of reviewing Iowas plan, to reject it.Some supporters of the law saw that as a deliberate effort to keep premiums high; Mr. Trump frequently cites sharply rising premiums as proof that the health law is failing.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But Ms. Reynolds said the Trump administration had worked with Iowa to the greatest extent possible to get the waiver approved.The health law allows such waivers only if a state proves the alternative coverage will be as comprehensive and affordable, covers a comparable number of people and does not increase the federal deficit.Last week, the administration informed the state that its plan would likely increase the federal deficit, but that it would take several weeks to figure out by how much.That, Ms. Reynolds said, prompted her to withdraw the request.In a joint statement with Ms. Reynolds, Ms. Verma echoed Mr. Trumps contempt for the 2010 law, calling it unaffordable, unsustainable and unworkable.The individual insurance market is particularly fragile in Iowa, partly because the state has allowed tens of thousands of healthy people to keep old plans that do not comply with the health law.Aetna and Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield, the states most popular insurer, are both withdrawing at the end of the year.The only insurer remaining in Iowas Affordable Care Act marketplace for next year, Medica, is seeking premium increases that average 56 percent, blaming Mr. Trumps decision to stop paying subsidies known as cost-sharing reductions that lower many peoples deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs.Most Iowa customers will not feel the increase, however, because they qualify for premium subsidies that will rise to cover it.But state officials have predicted that most of the 28,000 people who receive no subsidies will cancel their coverage.So far, the Trump administration has granted state innovation waivers to three states, Alaska, Minnesota, and Oregon; they will use federal money to help insurers cover the claims of their most expensive customers next year, with the intent of lowering premiums.Oklahoma abruptly withdrew a similar request last month one that state officials said would have reduced premiums by an average of 30 percent saying that the Trump administration had been too slow to approve it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The administration on Monday also deemed a similar waiver request from Massachusetts incomplete and said there would not be enough time for the state to put in place a so-called reinsurance program for 2018.
Stricter Gun Laws Tied to Fewer Firearm Injuries After Gun Shows:::::Photo Gun shows in a state with weak gun restrictions increase the short-term risk for firearm-related injuries, a new analysis has found.Researchers studied deaths, emergency department visits and hospitalizations related to firearms before and after 915 gun shows in California and Nevada from 2005 to 2013.California has laws requiring background checks, waiting periods, documentation and Department of Justice surveillance at gun shows.Nevada has no regulations pertaining explicitly to gun shows.When gun shows were held in California, there was no difference between rates of firearm incidents in the two weeks before and the two weeks after the shows.But after Nevada shows, incident rates rose 69 percent in regions of California within two hours driving distance.The study is in the Annals of Internal Medicine.Were seeing a pattern that suggests that Californias strict gun regulations may be effective in preventing short-term increases in firearm injuries after gun shows, said the lead author, Ellicott C. Matthay, a doctoral candidate at the University of California, Berkeley.Also, travel to less restrictive states may threaten the effectiveness of firearm laws in California.Still, she said, This study is not definitive.Policy differences are one of many possible explanations there might be other factors operating that could explain the findings.Wed need more studies to figure out the impact of gun shows and the policies that regulate them.
Courts Reverse Johnson’s Baby Powder Judgments for Nearly $500 Million:::::Photo In back-to-back victories for Johnson & Johnson, the courts have reversed two judgments against the consumer products giant totaling nearly $500 million.The money had been awarded to women who said that they developed ovarian cancer after using the companys talcum powder for decades.On Friday, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge tossed out a $417 million award won in August to Eva Echeverria.She was found to have ovarian cancer in 2007, after using Johnsons Baby Powder for more than 40 years.In her ruling, Judge Maren E. Nelson granted the companys motion for a new trial.The judge cited the insufficiency of the evidence and said that the damages awarded were excessive.Ms. Echeverria has died, The Associated Press reported, but her lawyer, Mark P. Robinson Jr., said in a statement that he planned to file an appeal immediately.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We will continue to fight on behalf of all women who have been impacted by this dangerous product, Mr. Robinson said on Friday.
The Cookie Crumbles: A Retracted Study Points to a Larger Truth:::::Before the study period, about 20 percent of the children chose an apple, and 80 percent the cookie.But when researchers put an Elmo sticker on the apple, more than a third chose it.Thats a significant result, and from a cheap, easily replicated intervention.While the intervention seems simple, any study like this is anything but.For many reasons, doing research in nutrition is very, very hard.Photo First, the researchers have to fund their work, which can take years.Then the work has to be vetted and approved by an Institutional Review Board, which safeguards subjects from potential harm.I.R.B.s are especially vigilant when studies involve children, a vulnerable group.Even if the research is of minimal risk, this process can take months.Then theres getting permission from schools to do the work.As you can imagine, many are resistant to allowing research on their premises.Often, protocols and rules require getting permission from parents to allow their children to be part of studies.If parents (understandably) refuse, figuring out how to do the work without involving some children can be tricky.Finally, many methodological decisions come into play.Lets imagine that we want to do a simple test of cookies versus apples, plus or minus stickers as this study did.Its possible that children eat different things on different days, so we need to make sure that we test them on multiple days of the week.Its possible that they might change their behavior once, but then go back to their old ways, so we need to test responses over time.Its possible that handing out the cookie or apple personally might change behavior more than just leaving the choices out for display.If thats the case, we need to stay hidden and observe unobtrusively.This matters because in the real world its probably not feasible to have someone handing out these foods in schools, and we need the methods to mirror what will most likely happen later.Its also possible that the choices might differ based on whether children can take both the apple and the cookie (in which case they could get the sticker and the treat) or whether they had to choose one.I point out all these things to reinforce that this type of research isnt as simple as many might initially think.Without addressing these questions, and more, the work may be flawed or not easily generalized.Advertisement Continue reading the main story These difficulties are some of the reasons so much research on food and nutrition is done with animals, like mice.We dont need to worry as much about I.R.B.s or getting a school on board.We dont have to worry about mice noticing whos recording data.And we can control what theyre offered to eat, every meal of every day.But the same things that make animal studies so much easier to perform also make them much less meaningful.Human eating and nutrition are typically more complex than anything a mouse would encounter.Overcoming these problems and proving spectacular results in preteens are some of the reasons this study on cookies and apples, and others like it, are so compelling.The authors have transformed this work into popular appearances, books and publicity for the Food and Brand Lab.Photo But cracks began to appear in Mr. Wansinks and the Food and Brand Labs work not long ago, when other researchers noted discrepancies in some of his studies.The numbers didnt add up; odd things appeared in the data, including the study on apples and cookies.The issues were significant enough that JAMA Pediatrics retracted the original article, and the researchers posted a replacement.The problems didnt end there.As Stephanie Lee at BuzzFeed recently reported, it appears that the study wasnt conducted on 8-to-11-year-olds as published.It was done on 3-to-5-year-olds.Just as mice cant be easily extrapolated to humans, research done on 3-to-5-year-olds doesnt necessarily generalize to 8-to-11-year-olds.Putting an Elmo sticker on an apple for a small child might matter, but that doesnt mean it will for a fifth grader.On Friday, the study was fully retracted.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Making things worse, this may have happened in other publications.Ms. Lee has also reported on a study published in Preventive Medicine in 2012 that claimed that children are more likely to eat vegetables if you give them a cool name, like X-ray Vision Carrots.That study, too, may be retracted or corrected, along with a host of others.As a researcher, and one who works with children, I find it hard to understand how you could do a study of 3-to-5-year-olds, analyze the data, write it up and then somehow forget and imagine it happened with 8-to-11-year-olds.The grant application would have required detail on the study subjects, as well as justification for the age ranges.The I.R.B.would require researchers to be specific about the ages of the children studied.I reached out to the authors of the study to ask how this could have happened, and Mr. Wansink replied: The explanation for mislabeling of the age groups in the study is both simple and embarrassing.I was not present for the 2008 data collection, and when I later wrote the paper I wrongly inferred that these children must have been the typical age range of elementary students we usually study.Instead, I discovered that while the data was indeed collected in elementary schools, it was actually collected at Head Start day cares that happened to meet in those elementary schools.This is a level of disconnect that many scientists would find inconceivable, and I do not mean to suggest that this is the norm for nutrition research.It does, however, illustrate how an inattention to detail can derail what might be promising work.The difficulties of research in this area are already significant.Distrust makes things worse.The social sciences are already suffering from a replication problem; when work that makes a big splash fails to hold up, it hurts science in general.We want to believe there are easy fixes to the obesity epidemic and nutrition in general.We want to believe there are simple actions we can take, like putting labels on menus, or stickers on food, or jazzing up the names of vegetables.Sadly, all of that may not work, regardless of what advocates say.When nutrition solutions sound too good to be true, theres a good chance they are.
Buckle Up a Helmet to Save a Life:::::But a few weeks ago I learned firsthand how foolish it was to worry more about my hair than my head.Luckily, my helmet was securely in place when, for reasons unknown, I fell forward over the handlebars while riding slowly uphill a few houses from home.Although I suffered a mild concussion and have no memory of the accident (I also sustained a nasty cut on my chin, badly bruised ribs and a scraped knee), my helmet prevented a serious brain or facial injury.I will never again mount a bicycle without the helmet on my head where it belongs, not in my backpack, bike basket or, worse, at home.There are laws requiring young cyclists to wear helmets in 21 states and Washington, D.C., and at least 200 localities, but very few cover adult riders.A common sight in my neighborhood: Fathers riding helmetless with their helmeted child on a bike seat behind them.There are many reasons besides helmet hair that keep people from wearing helmets.One of the most frequent excuses: Im only going to the store (or the gym).Yet, as with car accidents, the majority of bike accidents happen close to home, as mine did, and not necessarily in traffic or at high speeds.Even low-speed falls on a bike trail can scramble brains.A very low-speed fall can be just as dangerous as a fall at higher speeds, said Randy Swart, director of the consumer-funded Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute.All it takes is gravity the distance to the ground to cause a head injury.Teenagers seem especially resistant to wearing helmets, yet with their still-developing brains they probably incur the greatest risks and have the most to lose from a head injury.Theres often a rebellion aspect among teens, Mr. Swart said.They say, All through childhood, my parents forced me to be safe.Now I want to make my own decisions about risk.College students and young adults often also think similarly, he said.I worry too about younger children, even those whose parents insist that they wear a helmet when riding a scooter, tricycle or bicycle.I see many such riders with parents in tow in my Brooklyn neighborhood, and in at least half the cases Ive observed, the helmet is too big or is not on correctly and likely to provide little protection in a serious fall or crash.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The most common error is positioning: If the helmet sits too far back on the childs (or adults) head, it will not protect the most vulnerable part of the brain in a hard fall, especially if the skull fractures.When the straps are too loose (or, as Ive often seen even among adults, the chin strap is not clasped), the helmet will fly off in a fall and offer no protection whatsoever.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The helmet should sit on the head straight, front to back, and not move when you shake your head.The straps extending from the helmet to the chin strap should each form a V right under the ears.A bike helmet is a like a seatbelt it should feel snug, not tight, when you first put it on, but when you start riding, you should be able to forget all about it, Mr. Swart said.Another excuse Ive heard, perhaps from those familiar with concussions among football players, is that helmets do not prevent concussions.And that is true.You dont even have to actually hit your head to get a concussion.A concussion results when the gel-like brain sloshes violently or slams into the unyielding bony skull, and this can happen with almost any significant impact to the head.What the helmet can do is reduce the energy of the impact and the likelihood of a skull fracture or brain bleed.If cost is a deterrent, Mr. Swart gleefully noted that many inexpensive helmets perform just as well as expensive ones.His organization had three extremely cheap helmets ($15 to $20 range) tested along with three very expensive ones ($150 and above) and, he said, their performance level was almost identical.So if youre not overly concerned about fashion or brand names, you can feel confident purchasing inexpensive helmets for every rider in the family at a chain or big-box store, he said.They all must meet the standards set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.After determining a proper fit for head size and comfort within your price range, my advice is to select a helmet that is brightly colored; one of mine is red-orange and the other lime-yellow, the same as the colors of the jackets and backpacks I wear with them.Now, don that helmet, enjoy the ride and come home safe and sound.
Pediatricians’ New Germ-Control Advice: Bring Your Own Toys:::::But concerned parents dont necessarily have to stay in the waiting room, she said; you can check with the desk about how long its likely to be and then take a walk or wait in the car, and ask the staff to call your cellphone when its your childs turn.The policy also provides guidelines for cleaning exam rooms in between patients, disinfecting equipment (including wiping stethoscopes with alcohol), cleaning up after any spills involving body fluids, and general housekeeping.(Certain infections require more than just cleaning, of course; if a child has measles or chickenpox, we have to track down everyone who was exposed and offer specific protections to those who arent fully immunized, and measles is so infectious that cleaning the room isnt enough we actually have to leave it empty for a while to get rid of the risk.)Parents might want to ask about infection control when they are choosing a pediatrician, Dr. Jackson said.Look to see that surfaces and toys look easy to clean, that tissues and a place to dispose of tissues are provided, that hand sanitizer is easily accessible.You might also want to ask how the practice handles children who are not adequately immunized, and whether they are kept out of the waiting room when theyre sick.Ask, How do you triage?What does your waiting room look like?Are your health care workers immunized against influenza?Do you have a policy for infection control?she said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.No matter where we start, we always come back to good hand-washing or the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer.Hand hygiene at all levels is critical, said Dr. Mobeen H. Rathore, the lead author on the policy statement, who is a professor of pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Jacksonville, and the chief of pediatric infectious disease at Wolfson Childrens Hospital.Parents should be vigilant, he said, teaching their children hand hygiene, practicing their own hand hygiene, insisting health care providers practice hand hygiene its O.K.to ask.And then there is what we now refer to as cough etiquette, that is, covering a cough, coughing into your elbow rather than your hand, and, yes, again, practicing hand hygiene after wiping your nose or dealing with a cough.But while infection control in the waiting room and the exam room are important, the best ways to protect your child actually go back well before that trip to the doctor.First and foremost, make sure your child is fully immunized, including getting the annual influenza vaccine as soon as its available.Yes, I know, that means going to the doctors office, but its still the most crucial thing you can do, and if you get the flu shot early in the season, your child will have had time to generate a full immune response before theres a lot of flu going around.Advertisement Continue reading the main story And if the bad thing happens, in spite of everyones best efforts, and theres that dreaded waiting room exposure for a very contagious disease like measles or chickenpox, you at least want to be one of the people who was there with a fully immunized child.Theres nothing better than giving your child vaccines to prevent infections, Dr. Rathore said.More immediately, for any given visit to the doctor, good infection control precautions start before you actually come in, and they involve both the parent and the pediatric office staff.The people you talk to on the phone should have the training they need to ask you if there are concerning symptoms a funny rash, a fever, a bad cough which suggest that your child should not spend any time in the waiting room.If you have a sick child, make sure to explain the symptoms when you make the appointment, and tell the staff if there are additional details that might raise the odds that its something contagious (recent return from exotic travel, exposure to someone with a known infection, child not properly immunized).Maybe they can put you into an exam room right away or have you come at the very beginning or the very end of the day.We had a case very recently, a parent who called us, said the child may have chickenpox, Dr. Rathore said.We asked them not to bring the child in to the clinic.We looked at the child outside.If you have a child who is particularly vulnerable to infections, you might ask whether there is a way to minimize time in the waiting room, especially during the winter months.Some practices try to batch the well child checkups, or the newborn and young-infant checkups, for example, so that there are certain hours or days when the waiting room and exam rooms are dedicated to infants, too young to be fully immunized (we dont start giving flu shots till 6 months, and babies born premature are especially vulnerable to respiratory infections).If you have a child who is at risk for serious complications of certain infections, like flu, you dont want them waiting in the waiting room, Dr. Jackson said.Again, ask if you can come at a particular time when you can go right into an exam room.
Researchers use patients' DNA to inform treatment decisions:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- A recent study may provide new hope for patients with recurring glioblastoma, one of the most aggressive and deadliest forms of brain cancer.The average overall survival for patients with glioblastoma is 15 months from diagnosis.Researchers from the Translational Genomics Research Institute, or TGen, the University of California San Francisco and the Ivy Foundation Early Phase Clinical Trials Consortium collaborated on the study involving 16 recurring glioblastoma patients.The clinical trial used comprehensive DNA and RNA sequencing of a patient's tumor to determine treatment for patients in real time.Results of the trial, published today in Clinical Cancer Research, found that several patients with recurring glioblastoma survived more than a year after informed treatment."To our knowledge, this is the first report of a prospective profiling study in recurrent glioblastoma to show patients with extended time to progression following treatment with genomics-informed therapy," Dr. Sara Byron, research assistant professor in TGen's Integrated Cancer Genomics Division, said in a news release."This is a primary example of the benefits of genomics-driven precision medicine being applied for patients with aggressive and refractory tumors."Fifteen of the 16 patients were given TGen's genomics-informed treatment recommendations and seven of the 15 were treated by their doctors based on those recommendations."Notably, two of the patients experienced progression-free survival -- meaning their tumor did not return or increase in size -- for more than a year, with one of these patients progression-free at 21 months, three times longer than the time to progression on their previous therapy," Dr. Michael D. Prados, a chair in Neurological Surgery at UCSF, said.Challenges in glioblastoma treatment include its penetration to surrounding tissue making it impossible to completely surgically remove all of the tumor in the brain.The other challenge is treatment being able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, buffering the brain from the body's circulatory system."This precision-medicine study provides one of the first prospective demonstrations of using genome-wide molecular profiling to guide treatment recommendations for patients with recurrent glioblastoma within a clinically actionable time frame," Dr. Michael Berens, TGen deputy director for Research Resources, and professor and director of TGen's Cancer and Cell Biology Division, said.
Newly discovered molecule may hold promise in HIV vaccine:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- A new HIV vaccine candidate is showing effectiveness in animal studies in stimulating an immune response against sugars that form a shield around HIV.A team of researchers from the University of Maryland and Duke University created a new protein-sugar molecule that could protect against HIV."An obstacle to creating an effective HIV vaccine is the difficulty of getting the immune system to generate antibodies against the sugar shield of multiple HIV strains," Lai-Xi Wang, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UMD, said in a news release."Our method addresses this problem by designing a vaccine component that mimics a protein-sugar part of this shield."Researchers designed the vaccine candidate with an HIV protein fragment from gp120, which covers HIV like a protective envelope.The HIV virus's defenses are strengthened by a sugar shield that covers the gp120 envelope.When tested on rabbits, the vaccine stimulated antibody responses against the sugar shield in four different strains of HIV.The research overcame two problems that have plagued researchers in creating an HIV vaccine that can target gp120.The sugar shield on HIV is similar to sugars in the body so it does not create a strong immune response and secondly, there are more than 60 strains of the HIV virus currently and the virus often mutates so finding antibodies against gp120 in one strain may not work in another.The study, published Thursday in Cell Chemical Biology, could pave the way for an HIV vaccine.
Researchers map advanced artificial limbs in the brain:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- Scientists from the Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne in Switzerland have made a breakthrough in mapping how the brain can control artificial limbs.The research, published today in the journal Brain, examined how targeted motor and sensor reinnervation, or TMSR, changes the way the brain processes motor control and somatosensory input.TMSR is a surgical procedure performed on patients who have had amputations of limbs.The TMSR reroutes residual limb nerves to intact muscles and skin to fit them with a limb prosthesis for improved control.The TMSR system works by transferring residual nerves from the amputated limb to reinnervate and activate new muscle targets, so that when a patient is fitted with a TMSR prosthetic, it sends motor commands to the reinnervated muscles where movement intentions are decoded and sent back to the artificial limb.Researchers at EPFL used ultra-high field 7 Tesla fMRI to demonstrate how the brain encodes and integrates artificial touch and movements in prosthetic limbs.This method measures brain activity by identifying changes in blood flow.The team mapped out changes in the cortices of three patients with upper-limb amputations who had TMSR.They found that motor cortex maps of amputated limbs are similar in strength, extent and topography to maps of individuals without amputations but different compared to individuals with amputations who did not have TMSR but used regular prosthetic limbs.The results show the first neuroimaging study of patients with bionic limbs with TMSR prosthesis.Researchers were also able to find maps of missing fingers in the somatosensory cortex of TMSR patients, which were activated via reinnervated skin from the residual limb and chest area.
Men face higher risk of nursing home placement if lacking a caregiver:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- Older men who experience a stroke are much less likely to recover without the aid of a full-time caregiver compared to women, according to a new study.Researchers from the Department of Health Care Organization and Policy at the University of Alabama at Birmingham analyzed 10 years of data from Medicare claims from 2003 to 2013 and interviews from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study conducted from 2003 to 2007 to determine that men are at a greater risk of needing nursing home care after a stroke if they did not have a caregiver available.The study, published in the October edition of the Journal of American Geriatrics Society, of 256 men and 304 women aged 65 and older who had experienced a stroke found that within five years of the stroke, 119 participants were placed in nursing homes.Researchers found that the risk of nursing home placement was higher in patients who lacked available caregivers at home.Lacking an available caregiver after a stroke increased the risk of nursing home placement by 70 percent, within five years by 68 percent and was limited to men only."Our research highlights older adults as being vulnerable to the loss of independent living if they cannot identify anyone to care for them," Dr. Justin Blackburn, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said in a news release."This is particularly true for older men, who may be unable to access or reluctant to use formal services delivered within their home or community."
Half of food allergies in adults begin in adulthood:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- Food allergies are common among children, however, a recent study found that almost half of all adults with food allergies had adult-onset food allergies.The study, published in the November edition of the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, and presented this week at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Annual Scientific Meeting, revealed a significant increase in the prevalence of food allergies in adults."Food allergies are often seen as a condition that begins in childhood, so the idea that 45 percent of adults with food allergies develop them in adulthood is surprising," Dr. Ruchi Gupta, ACAAI member, said in a news release."We also saw that, as with children, the incidence of food allergies in adults is rising across all ethnic groups."Researchers found the rate of adults diagnosed with shellfish allergies has risen from 2.5 percent in 2004 to 3.6 percent.It's the most common allergy among U.S. adults.Adult tree nut allergies have increased to 1.8 percent compared to 0.5 percent in 2008.It is believed that many adults do not often realize they have a food allergy and instead believe they have food intolerance, thereby not seeking treatment from an allergist.A 2014 study by Northwestern University found that of 1,111 adult food allergy patients, 15 percent were first diagnosed over age 18 and most had their first reaction in their mid-30s.The study also showed that unlike food allergies in children, more adult women than men were diagnosed with adult onset food allergies."Our research also found that, among black, Asian and Hispanic adults, the risk of developing a food allergy to certain foods is higher than for whites, specifically for shellfish and peanuts," Christopher Warren, Ph.D. candidate, said."For example, Asian adults were 2.1 times more likely to report a shellfish allergy than white adults, and Hispanic adults reported a peanut allergy at 2.3 times the frequency of white adults.Because many adults believe food allergies mostly affect children, they may not think to get tested.It is important to see an allergist for testing and diagnosis if you are having a reaction to a food and suspect a food allergy."
Education may help HPV vaccination rate in college men:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Researchers have found that an education program can increase knowledge of human papillomavirus infection in college men leading to higher vaccination rates.The study, published today in The Nurse Practitioner, revealed that male college athletes have low rates of HPV vaccination and relatively little knowledge of their high rates of risk factors for infection, such as multiple sexual partners, unprotected sex and being young at sexual initiation.The findings are of particular importance since a study published last week found that 1 in 9 males age 18 to 69 in the United States are infected with oral HPV, which can cause cancers of the head, neck and throat."The incidence of this cancer has increased 300 percent in the last 20 years," Ashish Deshmukh, a research assistant professor at the University of Florida College of Public Health and Health Professions, said in a UPI article Oct. 16.There is no cure currently for HPV but the HPV vaccines are effective at preventing initial infection of the disease.Preteen boys and girls are encouraged to get the series of vaccines before becoming sexually active and doctors say it is still effective for young adults who did not receive the vaccine as an adolescent.However, in the current study of 114 male college athletes, found that more than two-thirds had not had the HPV vaccine.Researchers developed a program to educate college students on the risks of HPV and the benefits of getting the HPV vaccine.Of the study participants, 77 were football players and 37 were baseball players who attended an educational session on HPV and were questioned before and after the session to assess changes in opinions about HPV and the vaccine.The study found that immediately after participating in the educational session, the men had significant increases in their knowledge of HPV, but in a three-month follow-up survey, only 12 percent of the unvaccinated men reported getting the HPV vaccine."The ability to provide HPV education to high-risk populations will further empower individuals to make informed decisions regarding high-risk behaviors, increase HPV vaccination rates, and decrease HPV infection rates," the authors stated.
Survey: At least one-quarter of American workers go to work sick:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- American workers are not doing their part to combat the spread of influenza, according to a new survey by NSF International.The survey suggests that, while nearly everybody judges coworkers who come in when they are sick and more than half of people would tell a sick coworker to go home, at least a quarter of people still turn up at the office while under the weather.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates nearly stagnant flu vaccination for the 2016-2017 flu season, aside from small increases in individuals age 50 and older.The Department of Health and Human Services announced a focus this flu season on increasing the number of people receiving the vaccine, with former HHS Secretary Dr. Tom Price encouraging anybody six months or older to get their shot, specifying several higher risk groups especially need to be vaccinated."Vaccines are only as useful as when we take advantage of them," Price said at the press conference in September.However, the new survey by NSF showed vaccination rates do not have an affect on the number of American workers who go to work sick.The survey found 26 percent of Americans admit going to work while sick mainly due to workload, deadlines and loss of income.Nearly 42 percent of participants said they were afraid they would have too much work to make up if they were sick and 37 percent reported that they could not afford to take a sick day and miss work.The study also found that 98 percent of those surveyed admitted they judge co-workers who come to work sick, although just 16 percent said they viewed their co-workers who come in sick negatively.Men were twice as likely to come to work sick compared to women, 33 percent and 17 percent respectively.A previous survey by NSF in 2014 showed that one-quarter of workers who went to work sick said their boss required them to do so, 37 percent said they needed money and 42 percent blamed the workload.Healthcare providers recommend getting the flu vaccine each year to protect against the virus, along with proper hand washing practices and avoiding going to work to reduce the chance of spreading illness.
Outpatient antibiotics increase risk for C. difficile in the community:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Research shows outpatient antibiotic use can increase a person's risk of developing C. difficile infection after discharge from the emergency room.C. difficile, is a bacterial infection that results in inflammation of the colon known as colitis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Symptoms of the disease include severe diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal pain.C. difficile is commonly associated with antibiotic use in hospital settings but beginning in 2014, 41 percent of all C. difficile infections have come from outside hospitals.Earlier research has detailed how antibiotics can promote C. difficile infection by killing helpful bacteria in the gut.In that study from 2016, researchers from North Carolina State University found that a single course of antibiotics can allow C. difficile to thrive because the antibiotics kill off bacteria responsible for altering bile acid.For the current study, published today in Open Forum Infectious Diseases, researchers enrolled 452 patients from 10 U.S. sites from 2014-2015 who tested positive for C. difficile as an outpatient or within three days of being hospitalized, and who had not been admitted to a hospital within the past 12 weeks with each patient being matched with a control who had not tested positive for C. difficile.The study showed 82 percent of patients with community-associated C. difficile had previous outpatient healthcare visits, 62 percent had taken antibiotics compared to 58 percent who were not infected and 10 percent who had taken antibiotics."There's a lot of work that needs to be done in terms of improving outpatient prescribing practices and making sure that providers are appropriately prescribing antibiotics," Dr. Alice Y. Guh, of the CDC, said in a press release."Health-care associated C. difficile infection is still a huge burden, but there is increasingly more recognition that community-associated C. difficile can occur.Outpatient antibiotic use is a risk factor, and we need to improve antibiotic stewardship not just in inpatient settings but also outpatient settings."The findings point to emergency rooms being the source of infection in the community.
CDC: Americans getting a handle on cholesterol:::::Oct. 26 (UPI) -- A new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals that improvements in the rate of high total cholesterol in Americans has remained steady.Total and HDL cholesterol are commonly used to assess a patient's health along with systolic blood pressure, diabetes and smoking.Doctors use these factors to identify risk for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.Total cholesterol is a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in the blood and is based on LDL, often referred to as bad cholesterol, HDL, or good cholesterol, and triglycerides, which are a type of fat in the blood used for energy by the body.The study, published today by the CDC, found that from 1999-2000 to 2015-2016 there were declining trends in high total cholesterol levels and from 2007-2008 to 2015-2016 in low HDL cholesterol.CDC researchers analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for the study.The analysis reveals that about 12.4 percent of adults had high total cholesterol in 2015-2016, down from a high of 18.3 percent in 1999-2000.The percentage of adults with low HDL cholesterol has dropped to 18.4 percent, down from 22.2 percent in 2007-2008.The study showed the incidence of high total cholesterol was greater in men aged 40-59 than men aged 20-39 and 60 and older.Roughly 18 percent of adults had low HDL cholesterol, especially among Hispanics when compared to non-Hispanic white, black and Asian adults.Researchers believe the results come from a growing awareness of the danger of having high cholesterol, the reduction of the use of artificial trans fats in food production, cholesterol-lowering statin drugs and more health conscious diets.
Timing of treatment may predict cancer cell response:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- A study at the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center found that the timing of DNA damage impacts the fate of cells, and could lead to new cancer treatments.DNA damage to cells caused by normal processes, smoking or sun exposure happens regularly during the process of making new DNA.The study, published today in Cell Systems, showed that checkpoints within cells preventing them from dividing before damaged DNA can be repaired are ignored and, in the case of cancer cells, go on to divide with damaged DNA -- essentially spreading cancer.Using time-lapse microscopy to study cells as they transition through cycle phases, UNC Chapel Hill researchers found cellular response to DNA damage during certain phases could be strong and halt the cycle, while in other phases cells were less sensitive or showed delayed progression.The researchers found "commitment points" in cell phases that allow them to move forward to the next cycle regardless of unrepaired damage to DNA."It's very important to look at the timing of cell damage because depending on when it occurs within a certain cell cycle, there can be a totally different outcome," Sherry Chao, a graduate research assistant in the UNC School of Medicine Department of Genetics, said in a press release."Some stages of the cell cycle are very vulnerable to DNA damage."Researchers used the information to create a mathematical model of how timing affects checkpoint behavior to show that exact timing of DNA damage determines checkpoint behaviors and can also change the outcome for damaged cells.These new findings could create new treatment strategies for treating cancer."Conceptually, it makes sense that if you could get all of the cells in the same cycle at the same time, you could damage them all with one shot," Jeremy Purvis, UNC Lineberger member and assistant professor in the UNC School of Medicine Department of Genetics, said."The key will be finding ways to separate cancerous and healthy cells based on the timing and synchronization of their cell cycles."
Study finds gaps in care for Rhode Island hepatitis C patients:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- A study by Brown University described gaps in care for young opioid users at risk for hepatitis C. The study found it's much less common for young opioid users to receive hepatitis C care than it is for them to get screened for the disease.Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that ranges from mild to serious and lifelong.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were an estimated 30,500 cases of acute hepatitis C in the United States in 2014 and there are an estimated 2.7 to 3.9 million people living with chronic hepatitis C in the United States.A CDC study in 2015 showed that rates of hepatitis C more than tripled in Appalachian states that included rural areas of Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, and Tennessee, where rates of hepatitis C infection increased by 364 percent between 2006 and 2012.For the current study, researchers found that between January 2015 and February 2016, 78.6 percent of the 196 young adults ages 18 to 29 in the study who used opioids recreationally in Rhode Island reported getting HCV screening.Of those who were screened, 18 tested positive for HCV.Of the participants who tested positive, 13 had a follow-up test to confirm the diagnosis, 12 were referred to specialists, 10 received information on protecting others from contacting the disease and nine received education on how to live with the disease."Many young people who are at risk for hepatitis C may acquire the infection and then not know it, and then through drug injection practices may transmit it to others," Brandon Marshall, associate professor of epidemiology in the Brown University School of Public Health, said in a press release."For this reason, we need to not only be screening, but also providing care to young people who test positive for hepatitis C." The study was published today in the Journal of Adolescent Health."Screening for HCV is free in many parts of the state, but financial and other barriers exist for youth who test positive and are in need of additional resources and hepatitis C care," Marshall said."We need to work on improving access to hepatitis C treatment programs and other referral services for young people."
Weight loss from bariatric surgery improves heart health:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- Losing weight after being overweight or obese has been shown to have numerous health benefits, but now a new study finds weight loss after bariatric surgery can help the heart.Findings from the new study, which will be presented this week at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress 2017, suggest weight loss from bariatric surgery can return the heart to its natural shape and function.Both are altered due to large amounts of belly fat.Excess body weight causes the heart to have to generate more force in order to pump more blood through the body.In a previous study, researchers found that women may have a lower risk of heart disease compared to men after weight-loss surgery.That study of 2,000 patients found that women had a 41 percent reduced risk of heart disease after bariatric surgery, compared to a 35.6 percent in men."We know that obesity is the most prevalent disease in the United States.And that the cardiovascular system is significantly affected by this disease process," Dr. Raul J. Rosenthal, chairman, department of General Surgery at the Cleveland Clinic in Weston, Florida, said in a news release."But we wanted to know to what degree the shape of the heart changes in someone who is obese, what the heart looks like in someone after having bariatric surgery and losing weight, and how that change in geometry affects heart functionality."For the new study, researchers at Cleveland Clinic analyzed data from 51 obese men and women who had bariatric surgery between 2010 to 2015.The patients had an average body mass index of 40, or roughly 100 pounds overweight, and were an average age of 61.Preoperative and postoperative echocardiography was taken and assessed to measure the size and geometry of the heart as well as heart function.Researchers found that one year after surgery there were significant improvements in the patients' heart shape, including that the size of the ventricles that decreased by 15.7 percent."When the size of the chambers gets bigger and the walls of the heart get thicker, the blood flow to the heart is not as good, the functionality of the heart is not as good, and the heart itself doesn't get enough blood," Rosenthal said."The whole body suffers because there is less blood going to your feet and to your toes and to your brain."Researchers do not yet know if the duration of obesity has an affect on the chances to restore heart shape and function.
Retailer, insurance company move to tackle opioid crisis:::::Oct. 25 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump has signaled he may formally declare a national emergency over the opioid crisis in America this week, but some private industry stakeholders aren't waiting for government action.Retail chain CVS and the Cigna health insurance company are launching their own efforts to combat an epidemic of overdoses on potent opioid-based painkillers by restricting prescriptions of OxyContin.Cigna told UPI it plans to work with patients, doctors and pharmacists to reduce use of OxyContin, identifying another drug it says works just as well but has less risk of misuse and abuse.The company will also soon stop approving payments for the drug for its plan participants.CVS plans to limit the size and dose of prescriptions, based on conversations with individual doctors to be sure patients receive what they need, the company told UPI.Although public health emergencies are generally related to outbreaks of disease or other medical issues, the idea of declaring a national emergency would offer wider availability of resources to states, counties and municipalities struggling with an epidemic of addiction and deaths.Trump has called the crisis a "national emergency."He has scheduled an announcement for Thursday at the White House.A formal declaration could spur funding for urgent treatment centers, closer work with healthcare providers to limit the spread of non-medical or overuse of opioid-based painkillers, and lower prices of overdose treatments like Naloxone.Overdose deaths from prescription opioids and the sales of prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with more than 180,000 deaths in the United States between 1999 and 2015 linked to prescription opioids.The overprescription of opioid-based painkillers is a contributing factor.A CDC study found that the average supply administered by doctors for opioid prescriptions increased from 13 days in 2006 to 18 days in 2015.In March, Trump established a task force, the Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, headed by New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie.The panel has published recommendations for dealing with the crisis, though no government action has been taken.Meanwhile, CVS became the first drugstore chain to limit all opioid prescriptions to a seven-day supply.The company told UPI pharmacists will consult with physicians on a case-by-case basis to find alternatives or make exceptions if needed.Health insurance giant Cigna announced Oct. 4 that it will start removing OxyContin from its group commercial drug lists beginning Jan. 1 -- but not other painkillers that contain oxycodone, the active ingredient in OxyContin."This is a nationwide change," Cigna spokeswoman Karen Eldred told UPI."It is important to note that individuals who have started using OxyContin for hospice care or cancer treatments will continue to have the medication covered in 2018.In addition, Cigna will consider approving coverage for OxyContin for reasons determined to be medically necessary through conversations with our customers' treating physicians."The company says it is in the process of notifying customers with current OxyContin prescriptions and their doctors of the change so there is time to discuss treatment options.Cigna signed a contract with the company Collegium, which manufactures the drug Xtampza ER, that "ties financial metrics to dosage levels being prescribed for Cigna customers."Eldred said Collegium is financially accountable if the average daily dosage strengths of Xtampza ER prescribed for Cigna customers exceed a specific threshold.If the threshold is exceeded, Collegium will reduce the cost of the medication for Cigna customers, which the insurer believes will encourage better education for healthcare providers to prevent overprescribing."We believe linking financial terms to dosage metrics will incentivize more education to prevent overprescribing," Eldred said.Cigna wouldn't comment on any plans for other prescription opioid drugs containing oxycodone, which include the widely used Percocet, as well as Endocet, Percodan, Endodan and Combunox.The White House commission, in an interim report published July 31, calls for increased funding and oversight for drug monitoring programs, enhanced education for healthcare providers and efforts such as those by CVS and Cigna.The commission calls on the federal government to increase research and funding into government- run efforts, but to go beyond lawmaking and law enforcement efforts as outlined in the report."It is not only critical that the federal government provide sufficient resources to prevent and combat this disease," commission members wrote in the report, "it must also provide the easiest pathway for private providers and local and state governments to achieve success."
Arsenic in drinking water may cause cancer decades after exposure:::::Oct. 24 (UPI) -- A new study reveals that inorganic arsenic, found naturally occurring in drinking water in some countries, can cause cancer decades after initial exposure ends.Inorganic arsenic is naturally occurring at high levels in groundwater in many countries across the globe and can cause several types of cancer, including skin, kidney, lung and bladder cancer, among other diseases.A recent study found the U.S. government's tighter limits on arsenic in drinking water since 2006 have resulted in a 17 percent decrease in the levels of arsenic found in individuals, according to public water systems with an estimated 200 fewer cases of lung and bladder cancer the following year.In the study, published today in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, researchers found that arsenic in drinking water has one of the longest dormancy periods of any carcinogen, possibly up to 40 years after exposure ended.Researchers studied the affects of arsenic contamination in a water source in Antofagasta, Chile.The town experienced a sudden dramatic increase of arsenic in its drinking water in 1958.This increase was followed in 1970 by a dramatic reduction in exposure when an arsenic removal plant was installed.By analyzing medical records and data from residents who lived in Antofagasta during that time period, researchers found that lung, bladder and kidney cancer mortality rates began to increase roughly 10 years after the spike in arsenic exposure occurred.This increase in cancer mortality rates did not peak until nearly 20 years after exposure reduction started.Cancer mortality rates for lung, bladder and kidney cancers remained high for 40 years after the high arsenic exposure was halted.Researchers believe these findings mean the incidence of arsenic-related diseases will remain high for years to come.
New drug may block muscle scarring linked to heart failure:::::Oct. 24 (UPI) -- Excessive scarring of the heart muscle can lead to heart failure, a potentially deadly condition with no cure, but a new drug may provide hope for patients.Muscle scarring or fibrosis, including skeletal and cardiac muscle fibrosis, are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with no real treatment options.A study, published today in Nature Communications, tested the efficiacy of an experimental drug to prevent heart muscle scarring after a cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack.The experimental treatment works by targeting molecules on alpha V integrins, or scar-forming cells."Cardiac fibrosis is a major contributor to chronic heart failure, which is a major cause of death worldwide," Neil Henderson, of the Medical Research Council Center for Inflammation Research at the University of Edinburgh, said in a news release."Our research has identified a promising therapeutic target in the development of new treatments for patients with chronic heart failure."An earlier study by the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill found a method to reprogram scar tissue cells into healthy heart muscle cells.UNC researchers identified two methods to regenerate cardiomyocytes, heart muscle cells that normally remain damaged following a heart attack.For the current study by the University of Edinburgh, researchers blocked the alpha V integrins molecules with an experimental drug."We found that Pdgfrb-Cre effectively targeted quiescent PDGFR+ cells and activated myofibroblasts in both skeletal and cardiac muscle," study authors wrote."Selective depletion of v integrins on PDGFR+ cells protected mice from fibrosis in both these muscle types, and v integrin depletion on PDGFR+ cells had no adverse effects on skeletal muscle regeneration."Researchers also found that treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of v integrins, or CWHM 12, weakened fibrosis in both skeletal and heart muscle after the fibrotic process was established."Scarring of the heart muscle has a major impact on the heart's ability to pump effectively," said Jeremy Pearson, professor and associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation."This can lead to heart failure and there is no effective treatment at the moment.By finding a new way to limit scarring in the hearts of mice, this research has unlocked the route to a potential treatment for this life-threatening problem."
Researchers find lung cancer driver in non-sun melanoma:::::Oct. 23 (UPI) -- Researchers know all melanomas are not alike but a new study has revealed how much different non-sun-related melanomas are from sun-related melanomas.Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is most commonly related to sun exposure but the can also be genetic in nature and not related to the sun.These types of melanomas are not susceptible to the same targeted treatments as sun-related melanomas.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 76,665 people in the United States were diagnosed with melanoma in 2014, and 9,324 people died from the disease that year.The new study, published in the October edition of Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, identified ALK-fusion, a genetic change, in a patient sample of the mucosal melanoma, a melanoma subtype not caused by sun exposure.Researchers treated the sample with crizotinib and ceritinib, U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for ALK-positive lung cancer and found that the tumor shrank dramatically.The results seemed to reinforce the theory that genetic changes that cause cancer might be shared among different cancer types."Maybe these non-sun-exposed melanomas are molecularly more like a lung cancer or a colorectal cancer, and maybe we should be treating them like that," Kasey Couts, an assistant research professor at the CU School of Medicine, said in a news release.A genetic change known as gene fusion involves genes that should sit adjacent on the genome but instead are accidentally spliced together in a process that creates a new fusion protein.Researchers found that the gene ALK gets fused with the EML4 gene to create the fusion gene EML4-ALK, creating a new protein responsible for a subset of non-small cell lung cancers.Researchers found EML4-ALK fusion in the sample of mucosal melanoma, which they successfully treated with ALK-inhibitors used to treat ALK-positive lung cancer."It seems like these melanomas that don't come from sun exposure may have fusions not seen in the more common form of the disease, and thus may be more susceptible to targeted treatments that attack these fusions than they are to drugs developed to treat other kinds of melanoma," Couts said.
Teens unaware Adderall is an amphetamine, underreport use:::::Oct. 23 (UPI) -- A new study is highlighting a problem with teenagers, the underreporting of amphetamine use mainly due to lack of knowledge of which drugs are amphetamines.Amphetamine is the most common stimulant drug prescribed in the United States for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.Two of the most commonly prescribed drugs for ADHD are Ritalin and Adderall.Due to the ability of these drugs to enhance cognitive function, focus and ultimately academic performance, many high school and college students take the drugs for nonmedical use, a dangerous practice that can lead to abuse, dependency, cardiovascular events and seizures.The study, published in the October edition of Drug and Alcohol Dependence, was conducted by the Center for Drug Use and HIV/HCV Research at New York University Meyers College of Nursing.Researchers analyzed data from more than 24,000 high school seniors questioned in the Monitoring the Future study from 2010-2015 regarding nonmedical Adderall use and nonmedical amphetamine use."Our findings suggest that many young people are unaware that Adderall is amphetamine," Joseph Palamar, an associate professor of population health at NYU Langone Health, said in a press release."In addition, such conflicting reports mean that prescription stimulant misuse may be underestimated."Roughly 6.9 percent of teens said they used Adderall for nonmedical purposes, 7.9 percent said they used amphetamine for nonmedical purposes, however, 28.7 percent of those surveyed who reported nonmedical Adderall use also reported no amphetamine use for nonmedical reasons.Of those reporting nonmedical Adderall use and no nonmedical amphetamine use, older students over age 18, African American students and those whose parents had a lower level of education were the most likely to fall into that category."Over a quarter of teens who reported using Adderall without a doctor telling them to take it contradicted themselves by saying they do not use amphetamine," Palamar said."As a result, the estimated prevalence of nonmedical amphetamine use of 7.9 percent may be an underestimate; it may be as high as 9.8 percent, or one out of 10 high school seniors, when considering the discordant reporting we found."
Irregular heartbeat may be tied to elevated thyroid levels:::::Oct. 23 (UPI) -- A review of 11 studies from Australia, Europe and the United States found that patients with atrial fibrillation have higher levels of thyroid hormone.Atrial fibrillation impacts 2.7 to 6.1 million people in the United States and is expected to impact up to 12.1 million by 2030.According to researchers, previous studies have found that the risk for atrial fibrillation, or irregular heartbeat, is higher in people with an overproduction of thyroid hormone.A 2013 study found that both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism increased atrial fibrillation in studies on rats.In the new study, published today in Circulation, researchers analyzed data from two cohort databases, finding that participants with higher levels of the thyroid hormone free thyroxine, FT4, were more likely to develop an irregular heartbeat than those with normal levels.People with hypothyroidism typically are treated with medications containing thyroxine to increase their hormone levels."Our findings suggest that levels of the thyroid hormone, free thyroxine, circulating in the blood might be an additional risk factor for atrial fibrillation," Dr. Christine Baumgartner, specialist in General Internal Medicine from the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland, and currently a postdoctoral scholar at University of California San Francisco, said in a press release."Free thyroxine hormone levels might help to identify individuals at higher risk."Researchers examined the incidence of atrial fibrillation in people with normal thyroid hormone levels.Participants who had higher blood levels of FT4, but still within the normal range when the study began, were at an increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation compared to those with lower levels of the hormone.Patients who had the highest levels of FT4 had a 45 percent increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation and even modest increases in FT4 had an increased risk."Patients who are treated with thyroxine, one of the most frequently prescribed drugs in the United States, generally have higher circulating free thyroxine levels compared to untreated individuals," Baumgartner said."So, an important next step is to see whether our results also apply to these patients, in order to assess whether target free thyroxine thyroid hormone concentrations for thyroid-replacement therapy need to be modified."
More symptoms mean greater risk of readmission for cancer patients: Study:::::Oct. 23 (UPI) -- Patients with advanced stage cancer with more severe physical and psychological symptoms are at a greater risk of longer hospital stays and readmissions.In a study, published today in Cancer, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital found a relationship between the number and severity of symptoms in patients with advanced stage cancer and an increase in hospital stays and readmissions."We know that hospitalized patients with advanced cancer often experience a higher symptom burden compared with those treated in the outpatient setting, but until now, most efforts to improve symptom management have focused on ambulatory patients," Dr. Ryan Nipp, an instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School, said in a press release."There is a critical need to focus on efforts to alleviate suffering among hospitalized patients with advanced cancer.For example, future efforts should determine the efficacy of implementing symptom monitoring and supportive care interventions for such patients in an effort to relieve their symptoms, improve quality of life and enhance the quality of their cancer care."Of 1,036 study participants with advanced cancer, who received palliative care for comfort and pain relief between September 2014 to May 2016 at MGH, more than half reported moderate to severe fatigue, pain, lack of appetite, drowsiness and overall poor well-being.One-quarter of patients reported significant depression or anxiety.The study found that the more significant the physical and psychological symptoms in patients, the higher the risk of longer hospital stays and increased risk of unplanned readmissions.These patients were not the only group that have higher risks of unplanned hospital readmission rates."Hospitalized patients with advanced cancer experience an immense burden of physical and psychological symptoms," Nipp said."Patients' symptoms represent potentially modifiable risk factors, and prior research has shown that interventions aimed at symptom improvement can enhance patient-reported outcomes.""We found novel results regarding the relationship between patients' symptoms and their use of health care services, which highlight the critical need to develop and test interventions addressing the symptoms experienced by hospitalized patients with advanced cancer to improve both the care these patients receive and their utilization of health care services."
Patients using less opioids after hip, knee replacement surgery:::::Oct. 23 (UPI) -- It seems that there is at one area where the opioid abuse trend is on the decline -- patients having hip and knee replacement surgery.The study, conducted by University of Massachusetts Medical School, is being presented this week at the ANESTHESIOLOGY 2017 conference in Boston."Opioids are powerful pain medications but have many unwanted side effects, including the risk of addiction," Philipp Gerner, a medical student at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, said in a press release."This has prompted more interest in offering patients multimodal therapies to manage pain while also reducing the amount of opioids prescribed.Our research reflects that there has been steady progress over time toward achieving that goal."Researchers analyzed medical records for more than 1 million patients who had knee or hip replacement surgery between 2006 to 2014 from the Premiere Perspective nationwide database of joint replacement surgeries.There were 377,657 hip replacement and 779,338 knee replacement surgeries between 2006 and 2014 listed in the database, which collects information from 546 hospitals.A November 2016 revealed that older surgical patients -- age 66 and up -- are at significantly lower risk of developing an addiction to opioids after surgery compared to younger patients.The current study found fewer patients having hip and knee replacement surgery received prescription opioids as the sole treatment for pain during recovery.More of these patients successfully used a variety of pain management methods, including acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, peripheral nerve block, gabapentin/pregabalin, COX-2 inhibitors or ketamine to control pain instead of prescription opioids.Roughly 27 percent of patients who received opioids alone to manage pain for hip replacement surgery in 2006 solely used opioids.In 2014, that number dropped to 10 percent.For knee replacement patients, 23 percent used opioids alone in 2006, and just 7 percent in 2014."While we tend to think of large, academic hospitals as implementing changes more effectively, smaller hospitals -- especially specialty institutions performing a lot of orthopedic surgeries -- may be more open to evidence-based changes in practice to stay competitive," said Dr. Stavros G. Memtsoudis, director of critical care services in the Department of Anesthesiology at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.
New pneumonia vaccine protects against dozens of additional forms:::::Oct. 20 (UPI) -- A new vaccine being developed at the University at Buffalo not only targets 72 forms of S. pneumoniae, but can anticipate future versions of the disease.In laboratory animal testing, the new vaccine triggered an immune response to the 23 most common forms of bacteria that cause pneumonia, which are currently covered by the Prevnar 13 and the Pneumovax 23 vaccines.Pneumonia is responsible for the deaths of nearly 1 million children each year worldwide under the age of 5, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In the United States, more adults are impacted by the disease with nearly 1 million Americans being hospitalized each year and 50,000 deaths caused by the infection."We've made tremendous progress fighting the spread of pneumonia, especially among children," Blaine Pfeifer, an associate professor of chemical and biological engineering at the University at Buffalo's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, said in a press release."But if we're ever going to rid ourselves of the disease, we need to create smarter and more cost-effective vaccines."Vaccines like Prevnar 13 and Synflorix work by connecting to the unique polysaccharides in each strain of pneumonia via a shared protein called CRM197, forming a covalent bond.This covalent bond triggers the body to find and destroy bacteria before they have a chance to colonize in the body.However, this method of creating covalent bonds for every strain of S. pneumoniae is costly and time consuming for scientists.Other negatives to this type of immunization called a conjugate vaccine makes the body eliminate the targeted bacteria types even if the bacteria is not attacking the body."Traditional vaccines completely remove bacteria from the body.But we now know that bacteria -- and in a larger sense, the microbiome -- are beneficial to maintaining good health," Charles H. Jones, of the University at Buffalo, said."What's really exciting is that we now have the ability -- with the vaccine we're developing -- to watch over bacteria and attack it only if it breaks away from the colony to cause an illness.That's important because if we leave the harmless bacteria in place, it prevents other harmful bacteria from filling that space."Researchers believe that even though forms of pneumonia not covered by the current vaccines are only responsible for 7 to 10 percent of the disease in U.S. children, these forms could eventually replace the 23 common forms targeted in the current vaccines.By utilizing a liposome that acts as storage for the sugars in pneumonia, the sugars are not covalently bonded so the liposome can host all the sugars appear in individual strains of the disease.The new vaccine not only has been shown to trigger a strong immune response like that of Prevnar 13, but can also easily have sugars added to it depending on the type of strains that become more prevalent."The advantage of our approach is that we don't have to apply the more complex covalent chemistry that is required for Prevnar," Pfeifer said."As a result, we can extend beyond the 13 types of sugars, potentially providing universal coverage against bacteria that cause pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis and other types of pneumococcal disease.It holds the promise of saving hundreds of thousands of lives each year."
Scientists reveal e-cigarettes may trigger unique immune responses:::::Oct. 20 (UPI) -- As the debate over the safety of electronic cigarettes rages, a new study found that e-cigarettes trigger damaging immune responses not seen from tobacco cigarettes.Research from the University of North Carolina has found that not only do e-cigarettes cause potentially damaging immune responses seen in traditional cigarettes, but they can also trigger a new immune response that has not been seen before in traditional cigarettes."There is confusion about whether e-cigarettes are 'safer' than cigarettes because the potential adverse effects of e-cigarettes are only beginning to be studied," Dr. Mehmet Kesimer, an associate professor of pathology at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, said in a press release."Our results suggest that e-cigarettes might be just as bad as cigarettes."In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded its oversight of tobacco products to include e-cigarettes after ongoing questions about their health effects and safety.An earlier study in September by the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm found that nicotine in e-cigarettes can cause stiffened arteries leading to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.In June, researchers at the University of Connecticut found that e-cigarettes contain a nicotine-based liquid as harmful as unfiltered tobacco cigarettes and that the vapor from non-nicotine e-cigarettes can lead to similar amounts of DNA damage as filtered cigarettes.For this study, researchers compared sputum samples from 15 e-cigarette users, 14 traditional cigarette smokers and 15 non-smokers.E-cigarette and traditional cigarette smokers both showed significant increases in biomarkers of oxidative stress and the activation of defense mechanisms linked to lung disease.They also found increased mucus secretions including mucin 5AC, which has been linked to chronic bronchitis, asthma, wheezing and bronchiectasis.But researchers also found immune response triggers that were unique to e-cigarette smokers alone.E-cigarette smokers had significant increases in neutrophil granulocyte and neutrophil extracellular trap-related proteins that contribute to inflammatory lung diseases like cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.They also found the NETs, neutrophils that are associated with cell death in tissues lining the blood vessels and organs, existing outside the lung.This finding has researchers concerned about potential systemic inflammatory diseases like lupus."Our data shows that e-cigarettes have a signature of harm in the lung that is both similar and unique, which challenges the concept that switching from cigarettes to e-cigarettes is a healthier alternative."Kesimer said.
New neural network restores diaphragm function after spinal cord injury:::::Oct. 20 (UPI) -- Researchers at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine have made a discovery that may revolutionize the treatment of spinal cord injuries.Individuals who experience spinal cord injuries are often reliant on a ventilator due to the fact that the diaphragm becomes paralyzed as in quadriplegia.The researchers at CWR found that two different sets of neural signals control the movement of the diaphragm in rats and mice -- one neural pathway originates in the brain, and the other in the spinal cord.The study, published in the October edition of Cell Reports, used a drug to turn this alternative nerve pathway on and restore breath-like movements in rodents."We found a way to make the diaphragm work again in mice and hope the same approach could be applied to humans," Jared Cregg, a graduate student in the Neurosciences Department at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, told UPI."We discovered a new circuit in the spinal cord that nobody knew of before.We describe it functionally based on the types of neurons in the network.We induced cervical level injury in rats and mice.We induced paralysis on the left side and found that correlated to the diaphragm function on the left side.We applied drugs that block inhibitions which kind of released the brakes so the diaphragm could start moving again."Spinal cord injury leads to paralysis in approximately 17,000 people in the U.S. each year.Many of those injured must rely on mechanical ventilators to breathe.By discovering the new network, researchers could help spinal cord injury patients bypass missing brain signals and return motor function below injury sites -- reducing the need for ventilators.Patients on ventilators for a long period of time are at an increased risk for developing serious, potentially fatal infections.Bacteria can grow in breathing tubes in the lungs, leading to pneumonia or septicemia.Diaphragm muscle atrophy, which can develop from not using their diaphragm during long-term ventilator use, can reduce the chance of patients of ever breathing on their own.According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, ventilator-associated pneumonia is a serious risk factor for patients on ventilators and other complications include risk for blood clots, serious skin infections, pneumothorax, lung damage and oxygen toxicity."It would benefit patients to be able to get them off the ventilator," Cregg said.When researchers treated the rodents with inhibitor drugs, they were able to induce electricity that originated in the spinal cord, not the brain.The researchers then used optogenetics -- the use of light to "flip switches" inside neurons -- to induce electrical signals in the diaphragm.The findings show the diaphragm can operate via nerve circuitry entirely separate from the brain."We have discovered a way to control the diaphragm in the absence of input from the brain.This exciting discovery may pave the way for future strategies aimed at augmenting motor output after cervical spinal cord injury," Cregg said.Cregg cautions that the research is in the early stages and they have conducted acute experiments for short periods of time, but that longer term studies need to be done before expanding to human trials.
New study finds HPV vaccine to be safe for adult women:::::Oct. 19 (UPI) -- Although most human papillomavirus prevention efforts are targeted toward adolescents, a new study found that the HPV vaccine is safe for adult women.While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration originally approved Gardasil, a vaccine against HPV, in 2006 for use with pre-teen and teen girls, and later added approvals for boys, more adult women are opting for vaccination and the safety of the vaccine in adults has not been the subject of many trials.HPV causes genital warts, which can lead to cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis, anus and cervical cancer in women.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 11,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year in the United States, so preventing HPV in adult women is a major priority for healthcare professionals.Nearly 14 million people become infected with HPV each year, meaning most sexually-active men and women will develop at least one type of HPV in their lifetime.There are more than 100 types of HPV but just 13 have been linked to cancer -- and HPV 16 and 18 have been shown to lead to 70 percent of cervical cancers.Gardasil protects against HPV 6 and 11, and both Gardasil and another vaccine, Cervarix, are effective at preventing infection from HPV 16 and 18.Researchers found the newest HPV vaccine, 9vHPV, is effective at preventing HPV infection and can protect against HPV 16, 18, 6, 11, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58.A 2014 study found that women in Australia age 27 to 45 had limited vaccine coverage due to barriers such as cost, time constraints and the three-dose schedule required.The study, published Wednesday in the Journal of Internal Medicine, investigated the effect of the HPV vaccine in more than 3 million adult women age 18 to 44 in Denmark and Sweden.Researchers aimed to find any association between the HPV vaccine in women and 44 chronic diseases, which the team narrowed down to seven, including Hashimoto's thyroiditis, celiac disease, localized lupus erythematosus, pemphigus vulgaris, Addison's disease, Raynaud's disease and other encephalitis, myelitis or encephalomyelitis.The study found no adverse association between the HPV vaccine in adult women and these diseases, except for an increased risk of developing celiac disease in women of Danish decent.Researchers say, though, that celiac disease is significantly underdiagnosed in the general population in Denmark and the increase could also be due to undiagnosed pre-existing conditions."This is the most comprehensive study of HPV vaccination safety in adult women to date.It is not unreasonable to expect different safety concerns in adult women compared with young girls, and our study is an important supplement to the safety studies in young girls," Dr. Anders Hviid, of the Statens Serum Institut, in Denmark, said in a press release.
Level of preventive screenings, care similar regardless of mental health condition: Study:::::Oct. 19 (UPI) -- Preventive health screenings are conducted at the same or better rates in people with mental illness as they are in healthy individuals, according to a new study.The study, published today in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, analyzed data on more than 800,000 patients enrolled in Kaiser Permanente healthcare and patients attending safety-net clinics.The study was divided into 100,000 adults who were diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or other mental health disorders compared to 700,000 adults without mental health disorders.According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, 9.8 million U.S. adults have a serious mental illness, with 1.1 percent of adults in the United States diagnosed with schizophrenia and 2.6 percent of U.S. adults having bipolar disorder.Researchers examined the prevalence of preventive care in patients with mental health disorders compared to the general public.They found that patients who were diagnosed with a mental health disorder received 80 and 81 percent of the recommended preventive care, while roughly 80 percent of people without a mental health condition received preventive care.The preventive health care included in the study was related to diabetes, tobacco use, colorectal cancer, obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and preventive vaccines like the influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.The researchers found a larger difference in patients visiting safety-net clinics, with those diagnosed with mental health disorders receiving 62 and 70 percent of preventive care, compared to 60 percent in patients without mental health disorders.Studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia were roughly three times more likely to die prematurely, often due to lack of care for preventable causes of death such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and diabetes, as well as negative lifestyle factors such as poor diet, smoking, lack of exercise and drinking."It may be that people with mental illnesses aren't getting the support and treatment they need to prevent chronic disease," Bobbi Jo Yarbrough, a researcher with the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research, said in a press release."For example, we know that the medications people take to manage serious mental illnesses can cause rapid weight gain, but there are few programs to help these people manage their weight while they are on the medications."
CVS bid for Aetna: A $66 billion bet on cutting drug costs:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - The proposed merger between U.S. pharmacy operator CVS Health Corp and No.3 health insurer Aetna Inc represents a $66 billion bet that insurers can drive down high U.S. drug prices by cutting out the middleman.FILE PHOTO: The CVS logo is seen at one of their stores in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016.REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo The move is the most expensive effort to date that would enable a national health insurer to take back full control of prescription medicines for their customers by negotiating prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and setting customer out-of-pocket costs for each drug.CVS, one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers, has offered to buy No.3 health insurer Aetna for more than $200 per share, sources said on Thursday.It could take at least several weeks for any deal to materialize.If the deal happens, it would likely pressure rival insurers, drugmakers, pharmaceutical benefits managers, and retail pharmacies to also consider mergers or switching partners to try to keep up with the potential healthcare cost savings or increase in profit margins.Its an alternate model at this point.Its not clear that its definitely a better one, BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch said.More consolidation could lead to pressure on some of the brand-name drug prices and a better counterweight to the big pharma companies.For years, insurers paid drug benefits managers like CVS and Express Scripts Holdings Co to negotiate down drug prices, with both parties taking a share of any discount by the time a medicine was paid for by consumers.But outrage over the high costs of drugs has grown as consumers have picked up a larger portion of the tab for drug costs and it is threatening profit margins all along the drug supply chain, from manufacturers to distributors, insurers and pharmacies.UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana Inc currently have in-house pharmacy benefits businesses, and say that it has helped them keep medical costs down.Anthem Inc recently decided to go down that same path.It cut ties with Express Scripts during a $3 billion legal fight, and said it would use CVS to build its own pharmacy benefits business in the next few years.That tie-up could now be at risk if CVS reaches a deal to buy Aetna, Leerink analyst Ana Gupta said.CVS also provides management services for Aetna rival Cigna Corp.If CVS buys Aetna, that could revive Cignas interest in buying Humana, analyst Christine Arnold of investment bank Cowen & Co said in a research note.Aetna earlier this year closed the door on a deal with rival insurer Humana Inc after antitrust regulators said that combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp were anti-competitive.The pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance could need to match its business model closer to CVS to attempt to stay competitive, Arnold said in a note, and may look at buying Express Scripts.Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said that Express Scripts could also be a target for Amazon Inc which is reported to be looking to get into the pharmacy business.SWINGING PENDULUM Over the past decade, health insurers have diverged on the value of the pharmacy benefits business.Anthem sold its pharmacy benefit manager to Express Scripts and outsourced almost all of the business in 2010.UnitedHealth took the opposite approach when it decided in 2011 to bring its pharmacy benefits management in house, then bought an even bigger standalone benefits manager, Catamaran, in 2015.Humana operates its own pharmacy benefit manager and Cigna and Aetna have hybrid approaches where they manage some parts in house and outsource others.Until recently, insurers sought to expand their profit margins by reducing their spending on hospital services, using their size to negotiate down what they pay to healthcare providers.But with those profits in hand, and with drug prices representing a bigger proportion of overall healthcare spending, they see new opportunity in targeting the pharmacy benefits, Leerinks Gupta said.Another potential lure of a deal for Aetna would be to capitalize on the growing number of simple health services offered in a CVS store, from flu shots to blood pressure checks.Reimbursing such patient care outside of a doctors office or hospital could cut healthcare costs, Gupta said.
Insys founder resigns from board after charges in U.S. opioid bribe case:::::(Reuters) - The billionaire founder of Insys Therapeutics Inc, John Kapoor, has resigned from the companys board of directors, Insys said in a statement on Sunday.The billionaire founder of Insys Therapeutics Inc. John Kapoor, exits the federal court house after a bail hearing in Phoenix, Arizona , U.S., October 27, 2017.REUTERS/Conor Ralph Kapoor was arrested on Thursday on U.S. charges he participated in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe a fentanyl-based cancer pain drug, marking a step by authorities to fight the opioid epidemic.I am confident that I have committed no crimes and believe I will be fully vindicated after trial, Kapoor said in a statement on Sunday.Kapoor, Insys majority shareholder who stepped down as chief executive in January, said on Sunday that his continued involvement with Arizona-based Insys would draw unnecessary attention to the company.Kapoor plans to put his shares in a trust that will be independently controlled, he said.Insys board member Patrick Fourteau, who has served since 2011, has also resigned for personal reasons, the company added.Kapoor was charged with engaging in conspiracies to commit racketeering, mail fraud and wire fraud in an indictment filed in federal court in Boston.The charges marked a major escalation of investigations related to Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray that contains fentanyl, an addictive synthetic opioid.They came as U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency.Kapoor was added as a defendant in a case against six former Insys executives and managers, including former Chief Executive Michael Babich.Following a court hearing in Phoenix, Kapoor, 74, was released on a $1 million bond.We will continue to cooperate with ongoing investigations and strive to resolve them as circumstances permit, said Insys President and Chief Executive Officer Saeed Motahari, in a statement on Sunday.Insys has previously disclosed that it was working to resolve a U.S. Justice Department probe.Nasdaq Inc on Thursday, said it had halted Insys trading for additional information requested.Insys stock price fell 22.64 percent to close at $5.74 on Thursday.
Merck Keytruda sales soar, but European application pulled:::::(Reuters) - Merck & Co (MRK.N) on Friday said quarterly sales of its Keytruda cancer immunotherapy exceeded $1 billion for the first time, but it withdrew an application for European use of the drug in lung cancer, raising questions about future sales.The logo of Merck is pictured in this illustration photograph in Cardiff, California April 26, 2016.REUTERS/Mike Blake/Illustration/File Photo Mercks shares, which fell 6 percent to close at $58.24, were down another 3 percent at $56.68 after hours.Despite a near tripling in Keytruda sales to $1.05 billion, Merck said that the cost of a June cyber attack that temporarily crippled manufacturing coupled with lower sales of off-patent products caused its third-quarter revenue to fall 2 percent to $10.33 billion.The drugmaker said nearly one in three new lung cancer patients in the United States were starting with Keytruda and that the launch in bladder cancer was going well.Lung cancer is by far the most lucrative oncology market.Despite approvals for numerous cancer types, Keytruda is almost completely reliant on the performance in first-line lung cancer, said Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez.Late Friday Merck said it had withdrawn a European application for use of Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy as an initial treatment for nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of the disease.European approval had been expected next year, according to Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to that combination May, making Keytruda the first, and so far only, immunotherapy approved for first-line lung cancer.Merck earlier on Friday said a decision to make overall survival a main goal for a large, pivotal lung cancer trial of Keytruda plus chemotherapy would delay those results until February 2019.Merck spokeswoman Pam Eisele said no decisions have been made about when the European application would be resubmitted, but there would be opportunities for the company to conduct interim analyses of trial data.Merck said quarterly sales were cut by about $240 million as it had to borrow from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventions stockpile doses of its Gardasil vaccine to prevent cancer caused by the human papillomavirus.Revenue fell by about $135 million from lost sales and there was another $175 million in costs related to the NotPetya cyber attack.The company expects a similar impact in the fourth quarter.Mercks Zostavax shingles prevention vaccine is also about to face potentially withering competition from GlaxoSmithKlines (GSK.L) just-approved Shingrix, which appears to maintain efficacy far longer.Zostavax sales rose 23 percent to $234 million.Merck cautioned that its Januvia diabetes drug would face continued pricing pressure.It along with the related Janumet saw sales fall 2 percent to $1.52 billion.The companys recently off-patent cholesterol medicines Zetia and Vytorin saw sales cut in half at $462 million.They need to identify other growth drivers for the business, said Fernandez, noting other areas under pressure, such at intense competition for the hepatitis C franchise.Chief Executive Ken Frazier said business development was an important priority, but that he would prefer bolt-on deals to enhance innovation rather than a major acquisition.Mercks animal health business reached $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time.We see animal health as a pillar of growth for the company, Frazier said.Merck now expects full-year adjusted earnings of $3.91 to $3.97 per share, above Wall Street estimates of $3.87, according to Thomson Reuters data.It previously forecast earnings of $3.76 to $3.88.Due to a $2.35 billion charge related to its collaboration with AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), Merck posted a third-quarter net loss of $56 million.Excluding items, the company earned $1.11 per share, beating analysts average estimates by 8 cents, with help from cost controls.
In pro-Trump Ohio county, opioid announcement disappoints:::::COLUMBUS, Ohio (Reuters) - Doug Corcoran is in the trenches every day in the fight against the opioid crisis in the rural Ohio county he helps oversee.Ross County Commissioner Doug Corcoran poses in Chillicothe, Ohio, U.S., September 12, 2017.REUTERS/Tim Reid So President Donald Trumps failure this week to formally declare the overdose epidemic a national emergency - words that would have freed up more federal funds to tackle the crisis - was disappointing for him.I have been hopeful for the last several years that the federal government would step up and help us with this crisis, and they havent.Theyve really dropped the ball on this and its sad, said Corcoran, a county commissioner in Ross County, home to 77,000 people an hour south of Columbus, Ohio.The countys child services budget nearly doubled in the past five years to almost $2.4 million from $1.3 million, because of the number of children needing care due to addicted parents.For a county with a general fund of $23 million, that is a stress on the finances.Corcoran struggles constantly to make funds available from the county budget for the likes of drug treatment centers, the county jail and anti-drug education programs.The disappointment about Trumps announcement is more bitter in Ross County given that more than 60 percent of the county voted for the Republican at last years presidential election against Democrat Hillary Clinton.ACROSS THE COUNTRY Corcoran, who attended a youth education event about opioids on Friday in the city of Chillicothe, is not alone as the crisis strains local budgets across the country.Brian Namey, a spokesman for the National Association of Counties, which represents 3,069 county and local governments, said Trumps declaration on Thursday that the opioid crisis is a public health emergency rather than a national emergency lasts only 90 days and frees up no additional federal funds.We strongly urge the administration to release additional money to confront this emergency, Namey said.The opioid epidemic played a role in more than 33,000 deaths in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The death rate has kept rising, both in cities and in many rural areas across the country, estimates show.Opioids, primarily prescription painkillers, in addition to heroin and fentanyl - a pain medicine 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine - are fueling the drug overdoses.More than 100 Americans die daily from related overdoses, according to the CDC.Republican lawmakers called the presidents declaration an important step in combating the crisis.Some critics, including Democratic lawmakers, said it was meaningless without additional funding.The National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), representing nearly 3,000 local health departments, also expressed disappointment that Trump did not go further and call the crisis a national emergency.The declaration of an opioid public health emergency and not a state of national emergency does not go far enough, said NACCHOs Laura Hanen, the associations interim executive director.We strongly urge the Administration to act further and release additional monies to bring this emergency to an end.Matt Osterberg is a county commissioner in rural Pike County, Pennsylvania.He said the county jail has roughly 120 inmates, the majority of whom are incarcerated for a drug-related crime.The county of 55,000 has an overall annual budget of $42 million.It spends $3.5 million annually treating drug addicts inside the jail, but often when inmates are released they start taking drugs again and end up back behind bars.Additional federal funds would be vital to help finance treatment centers for inmates once they are released, something the county cannot afford.If people got proper intensive treatment after they get out of jail, that would be my dream, Osterberg said.
CVS deal for Aetna could help retailer face Amazon entry: analysts:::::(Reuters) - U.S. pharmacy operator CVS Health Corps (CVS.N) move to buy health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) could shore-up CVS vulnerable pharmacy business and spur another round of dealmaking in an industry fearing Amazons arrival, analysts said.Shares of Aetna, the third-largest U.S. health insurer, closed down 3 percent on Friday after closing 12 percent higher on Thursday on reports of the deal.CVS Health was down 5.9 percent.CVS Health has made an offer to acquire Aetna for more than $200 per share, or over $66 billion, making it the biggest deal of the year.[nL2N1N12JO] A potential combination would diversify CVS profit streams ahead of an Amazon entry and set the stage for a new healthcare-retail delivery model, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note.Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is planning to move into online prescription drug sales, multiple media reports have said, potentially posing an existential threat to brick-and-mortar pharmacies.That possibility has hit shares of most drugstore operators on fears that the online retailer would leverage its vast ecommerce platform in prescription drug sales.We believe CVS does need to respond to the potential threat and strike a different path, Cowen & Co analyst Charles Rhyee said in a note.A deal would make CVS-Aetna a one-stop shop for customers health care needs - ranging from employer healthcare and government plans to managing benefits and running drug stores.FILE PHOTO: The CVS logo is seen at one of their stores in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016.REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo The vertical integration of retail pharmacy, PBM, and insurers fits with broader healthcare themes of expanded access, consumerism and cost reduction, Jefferies analysts said, adding that the deal chatter was not a complete surprise.It would address each companys need for a fresh script.The deal between companies in two very concentrated industries will likely prompt concern about their rivals having an access to market, or foreclosure, two antitrust expert said.But the deal will likely win approval from antitrust enforcers because the two companies are in different businesses along the same supply chain, or a vertical merger, other experts said.I dont doubt that there will be a lot of people that will be concerned about such a huge deal, said Andre Barlow of the law firm Doyle, Barlow and Mazard.But articulating an antitrust theory (to stop it) is difficult.The two companies overlap in at least one area - providing Medicare Part D pharmacy prescription drug coverage.Analysts at Evercore ISI estimated that 23 percent of Aetnas Part D clients were in counties where there may be antitrust concerns but these could likely be remedied through asset sales.Some analysts said the deal could also trigger a wave of consolidation across the industry.It could be a possible catalyst for higher health insurance sector valuation, BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Bosch said, adding that WellCare Health Plans (WCG.N), Humana (HUM.N) and Centene (CNC.N) could be possible acquisition targets.Aetna earlier this year scrapped plans to merge with rival Humana after antitrust enforcers said that the combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N) were anti-competitive.
CVS makes more than $66 billion bid for Aetna: sources:::::(Reuters) - U.S. pharmacy operator CVS Health Corp has made an offer to acquire No.3 U.S. health insurer Aetna Inc for more than $200 per share, or over $66 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.A deal would merge one of the nations largest pharmacy benefits managers and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide.Aetna shares rose more than 11 percent, or $18.48, to $178.60, while CVS shares fell 3 percent, or $2.22, to $73.31, after the Wall Street Journal first reported on the talks earlier on Thursday.Healthcare consolidation has been a popular route for insurers and pharmacies, under pressure from the government and large corporations to lower soaring medical costs.Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) such as CVS negotiate drug benefits for health insurance plans and employers, and have in recent years taken an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with drugmakers.They often extract discounts and after-market rebates from drugmakers in exchange for including their medicines in PBM formularies with low co-payments.A tie-up with Aetna could give CVS more leverage in its price negotiations with drug makers.But it would also subject it to more antitrust scrutiny.The deal could also help counter pressure on CVSs stock following speculation that Amazon.com Inc is preparing to enter the drug prescription market, using its vast e-commerce platform to take market share from traditional pharmacies.CVS made the offer earlier this month, although the two companies have been in discussions about a potential deal for several months, the sources said.These talks were carried out primarily between CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, and were aimed at making executives comfortable with the idea of a merger, the sources said.CVS and Aetna started discussing terms only recently, and a deal is not expected for a few weeks, one of the sources added, cautioning that the pace of the talks could accelerate given the publication of the negotiations.The sources did not specify how much of CVS bid is cash versus stock, but given CVSs and Aetnas market capitalizations of $77 billion and $54 billion, respectively, a substantial stock component is likely in any deal.FILE PHOTO: The CVS logo is seen at one of their stores in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016.REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo Aetna and CVS declined to comment.Aetna earlier this year closed the door on a deal with rival insurer Humana Inc after antitrust regulators said that combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp were anti-competitive.UNCERTAIN TIMES AHEAD The deal comes after years of major changes to the U.S. health insurance industry under former President Barack Obama, whose 2010 Affordable Care Act created new ground rules for how insurers operate and expanded insurance to 20 million more Americans.Republican President Donald Trump has promised to turn back many of the Affordable Care Acts facets, but Congress has not been able to agree on a repeal or a replacement.The lack of progress - as well as Trumps executive order to bring down healthcare costs - has created uncertainty for insurers as they head into 2018.After the deal with Humana fell apart, Bertolini has said that he did not believe large deals were possible in the insurance industry.But analysts have speculated about a tighter partnership between Aetna and CVS since early in the year.CVS and Aetna have a long-term contract in which CVS has provided pharmacy benefits for Aetna customers.Aetna really makes the best sense said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.Its their largest client on the PBM side.They really have similar views as to where healthcare should go, which is to the retail setting.Jonas, who owns both Aetna and CVS shares, noted the two companies were already talking about working together on Minute Clinic, on home infusion and other services.To go from that to a full merger is a big step but its not huge, he said.Last week No.2 insurer Anthem Inc. announced plans to manage its own pharmacy benefits with the help of CVS, a move that would give it a set-up similar to UnitedHealth Group Inc. and its Optum unit.Insurers want more control over the pharmaceutical component of care as they implement pricing schemes with doctors and hospitals that are based on health outcomes, not just procedures.They also want to work on driving down costs, and as a pharmacy benefit manager, would negotiate directly with drugmakers.
McDonald's sets new welfare standards for chickens:::::CHICAGO (Reuters) - McDonalds Corp will require suppliers to follow new standards for raising and slaughtering chickens served in its restaurants, the company said on Friday, the latest changes affecting popular menu items like McNuggets.FILE PHOTO: The logo of a McDonald's Corp <MCD.N> restaurant is seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 24, 2017.REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Animal activists said the mandates fall short of commitments made by other restaurants, such as Burger King and sandwich chain Subway, and failed to address their primary concern about chicken production: birds bred to grow quickly to large sizes.Under McDonalds updated guidelines, suppliers such as Tyson Foods Inc and Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] must comply by 2024 with rules dictating the amount and brightness of light in chicken houses, provide birds with access to perches that promote natural behavior, and take other steps to improve animal welfare.The worlds largest restaurant chain by revenue also pledged to conduct trials with suppliers to measure the wellbeing of different chicken breeds.I think its one of the most comprehensive programs that Ive seen for chickens, said livestock researcher Temple Grandin, who pioneered humane slaughterhouse practices and works with McDonalds.The treatment of animals in the food chain has become increasingly important to some consumers in recent years as animal welfare groups have released undercover videos showing abuse at U.S. facilities, including those associated with Tyson.McDonalds requirements are the latest changes to affect its menu that address concerns about animal and human health.It previously stopped buying chicken meat for U.S. restaurants from birds raised with antibiotics deemed important to human health and said it would shift to using cage-free eggs in the U.S and Canada.Such moves generally raise costs for producers.McDonalds, which has been working to boost flagging traffic at its U.S. restaurants, said it will not raise menu prices as a result of its new standards.While this might not be a direct impact on sales at McDonalds, it might help certain segments of our customer base make purchasing decisions that they might not have otherwise made, Bruce Feinberg, a senior director for McDonalds, said about the requirements.Tyson and Cargill supported McDonalds moves.However, animal welfare groups said the chain failed by not committing to buying meat from breeds that grow slowly enough to protect chickens health.Birds bred to grow more quickly can suffer organ failure and struggle to walk because they become too heavy, they said.McDonalds at this point is allowing the industry to continue in this inhumane direction, said Josh Balk, a vice president for The Humane Society of the United States.
Sex and drugs: U.S. study links marijuana use to more intercourse:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - Where there is smoke, there tends to be fire, say medical researchers who found frequent marijuana users have about 20 percent more sex than those who abstain.Stanford University School of Medicine researchers unveiled the link between marijuana and the frequency of sexual intercourse in a study published on Friday in the Journal of Sexual Medicine.Researchers in California reached their conclusions after a retrospective analysis of data on 50,000 Americans ages 25 to 45, compiled from 2002 to 2015 by the National Survey of Family Growth.The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sponsors the survey.Respondents were asked how many times they have had heterosexual intercourse in the past four weeks and how frequently they have smoked marijuana over the past 12 months, Stanford researchers said in a press release.Women who were daily pot users had sex an average of 7.1 times during the previous four weeks, compared with 6.0 times reported by those who denied using marijuana in the past year.For men, daily users reported 6.9 times compared with 5.6 for non-users.In other words, pot users are having about 20 percent more sex than pot abstainers, said the studys senior author, Dr. Michael Eisenberg, assistant professor of urology at Stanford.Given that the average couple has sex about once a week, Eisenberg said, the bottom line for partaking in a bong or blunt could add up to 20 more instances of sexual intercourse each year.FILE PHOTO: A participant smokes a marijuana joint during the Global Marijuana March 2017, in support of the legalization of marijuana in Mexico City, Mexico, May 6, 2017.REUTERS/Henry Romero/File Photo I think if you asked a man or a woman, 20 more times to have sex over a year, that would seem like a lot, Eisenberg said.It used to be thought that couples mostly smoked after sex, but Eisenberg said his findings show the opposite is true for all races, ages, education levels, income groups and religions, every health status, whether they were married or single and whether or not they had kids.Marijuana is legal for medical or recreational adult use in 29 states and the District of Columbia, said spokesman Morgan Fox of the Marijuana Policy Project.FILE PHOTO: Women wearing marijuana leaf masks kiss at the 4/20 marijuana holiday in Civic Center Park in downtown Denver.U.S., April 20, 2013.REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo A record percentage of Americans - 64 percent - now believe adult use of the drug should be legal, according to a Gallup poll published this week.Eisenberg cautioned the study should not be misinterpreted as having proven a causal link.It doesnt say if you smoke more marijuana, youll have more sex, he said.Still, for many, research in the name of science may never be so fun.(This version of the story refiles to fix typo in Stanford in paragraph 6)
Large decrease in uninsured new cancer patients linked to Affordable Care Act:::::(Reuters Health) - The number of newly diagnosed cancer patients without health insurance declined by one-third in 2014, which is likely an effect of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), a small study suggests.Either the impact of the ACA was that people who were now insured had access to screening services that uncovered cancer, or people who knew they had cancer came forward.Their journey was at least less stressful because they were covered and had access to care, Dr. Clifford A. Hudis, chief executive officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, told Reuters Health by phone.My only wish is that the evidence in this study would have some positive impact and influence the current debate about the potential rollback of a provision that might have given us some gains, said Hudis, who wasnt involved in the study.Starting in January 2014, the ACA - commonly called Obamacare - expanded Medicaid coverage and provided subsidies so nonelderly Americans could buy affordable health insurance.It led to historic gains in the number of people covered by health insurance.For the analysis, published online October 19 in JAMA Oncology, researchers used the National Cancer Institutes Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to analyze the percentages of uninsured patients with newly diagnosed cancers from 2010 to 2014.Overall, they looked at data on more than 858,000 adults, ages 19 to 64, in 13 states.The states include 28% of the population and are representative of national demographics, said lead author Aparna Soni, a doctoral candidate in business economics and public policy at Indiana University in Bloomington.Nine states in the study participated in the ACAs Medicaid expansion program; the other four did not.In 2014, after ACA was implemented, the uninsured rate remained unchanged in states in the SEER database without Medicaid expansion but declined sharply in expansion states, Sonis team reports.Overall, the proportion of new cancer patients who were uninsured fell to 3.8% from 5.7% in the preceding three years a decrease of about 16,500 people, or 33%.Lack of insurance has been linked with late cancer diagnosis, poorer treatment and poor survival, said Ahmedin Jemal, vice president for surveillance and health services research at the American Cancer Society.We cant underestimate the importance of the Medicaid program which provides timely access to cancer care, Jemal said.The study found significant gains in insurance coverage across many ethnic and demographic groups, as well as numerous stages and types of common cancers, including colorectal, prostate, thyroid, breast and lung and bronchial cancers.The proportion of newly diagnosed cancer patients without insurance dropped by 39.9% among adults of Hispanic ethnicity and by 46.2% among other ethnicities.By cancer type, the largest decrease in percent uninsured a drop of 32.7% - occurred in patients with lung and bronchial cancer.There was a 33.3% decline in uninsured patients with cancer that had spread to other places in the body.Soni pointed out in a phone interview that although the research didnt examine the effect of insurance coverage on cancer diagnosis, people without insurance coverage are more likely to wait and see their physician only when they cant ignore their symptoms so they are more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage cancer.Cancer treatment is very expensive.Without insurance it is unaffordable.Insurance status determines the type of treatment someone can afford, Soni said.The study only included data from 13 states and tracked insurance coverage for only one year after the ACA was implemented.Soni said there could be further decreases in uninsured adults with new cancer diagnoses during the remaining years of the program.
Cancer competition drives robot surgery, clinic closures in UK:::::(Reuters Health) - As more British men are bypassing their local hospital to get prostate cancer surgery farther from home, many treatment centers are closing and many that remain are operating with high-tech robots, a recent study suggests.We do not know whether centers adopting new technology offer better quality care, said study leader Dr. Ajay Aggarwal of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.A potential concern with this pattern of closures is that some patients will now have to travel further for cancer surgery as a result of closures, which may have an impact on equality in access to cancer surgery given that lower socioeconomic groups and the elderly are less likely to travel for care, Aggarwal said by email.Aggarwals team examined data from 2010-2014 on 19,256 men in England who underwent radical prostatectomy.They also mapped where men lived and where they received care.Patients were more likely to bypass their local hospital and opt for treatment farther away from home when they got robotic surgery, the study found.Competition for patients, and mens choice to travel for care, contributed to a rise in robotic surgery and the closure of several treatment centers, researchers report in Lancet Oncology online October 3.At the start of the study period, there were 65 centers offering radical prostatectomy, including 12 that performed robotic surgery.By the end, 10 centers had closed, and 39 of the remaining 55 centers, or 71%, offered robotic surgery.Overall, 23 of the surgery centers that were still open had gained patients during the study period.Ten of these (43%) were established robotic surgery centers.At the same time, 37 of the still-open centers lost patients during the study, including two that offered robotic surgery.Ten of the centers that lost patients stopped offering radical prostatectomy by the end of the study period.Radical prostatectomy centers that closed were more likely to be located in areas with stronger competition than in areas with few alternative treatment centers.No robotic surgery centers closed, regardless of the size of net losses of patients.One limitation of the study is that researchers used geographic areas rather than specific residential addresses to map how far men lived from the place they went for treatment, the authors note.This may mean the study didnt accurately reflect whether men bypassed a local hospital to get care in every case.Furthermore, the researchers couldnt tell whether men had better outcomes when they chose a surgery center far away, and thats also a concern, said Dr. Kalipso Chalkidou, author of an accompanying editorial and a researcher at Imperial College London.We have no idea whether more and newer is better for each patient who moved to access the high tech, Chalkidou said by email.We also dont know what this wave of new investments has meant for patients who could not or would not move, for patients with other conditions (e.g., heart disease) or for future patients whose taxes or premiums may go up to fund the arms race ...The question of whether men need surgery done by humans or robots also masks the fact that many men also might not need operations at all, Chalkidou noted.Often, men will do fine, and avoid surgical risks like incontinence and impotence, by opting for whats known as watchful waiting, or periodic screening to make sure tumors arent getting worse.The evidence is clear that in many cases watchful waiting is a much better option for prostate cancer than intervening, Chalkidou said.
Fossil footprints reveal existence of big early dinosaur predator:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A trail of fossilized three-toed footprints that measure nearly two feet (57 cm) long shows that a huge meat-eating dinosaur stalked southern Africa 200 million years ago at a time when most carnivorous dinosaurs were modest-sized beasts.Fabien Knoll, Honorary Senior Research Fellow at the University of Manchester, lies next to the exceptionally large carnivorous dinosaur footprints found in Lesotho, Africa in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters October 26, 2017.Fabien Knoll/University of Manchester/Handout via REUTERS Scientists on Thursday described the footprints from an ancient river bank in Lesotho, and estimated that the dinosaur, which they named Kayentapus ambrokholohali, was about 30 feet (9 meters) long.No fossilized bones were found, but the footprints alone showed a lot about the animal.The scientists concluded it was a large theropod -- the two-legged carnivorous dinosaur group that included later giants like Tyrannosaurus and Giganotosaurus -- but that it was more lightly built than those brutes.The theropod group also gave rise to birds.Kayentapus lived early in the Jurassic Period, shortly after a mass extinction that doomed other large reptilian terrestrial predators that lived in the preceding Triassic Period, when dinosaurs first appeared.Our finding corroborates the hypothesis that theropods reached a great size relatively early in the course of their evolution, but apparently not before the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, said paleontologist Fabien Knoll, of the Dinopolis Foundation in Spain and the University of Manchester in Britain.There are no skeletal fossils of meat-eating dinosaurs this large so early in the dinosaur evolutionary history.It lived on the ancient southern hemisphere super-continent of Gondwana.There are other fossilized footprints from Poland that indicate a similar-sized theropod inhabited the northern super-continent of Laurasia around the same time.Theropods of similar size do not appear in the fossil record until 30 million years later, Knoll said.The footprints were found on what was once a river bank, bearing telltale ripple marks and desiccation cracks.It is the first evidence of an extremely large meat-eating animal roaming a landscape otherwise dominated by a variety of herbivorous, omnivorous and much-smaller carnivorous dinosaurs, added paleontologist Lara Sciscio of the University of Cape Town in South Africa.The research was published on Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE.In separate research, other scientists on Thursday described another new dinosaur, a plant-eater called Matheronodon provincialis, that lived 70 million years ago.Its fossils were unearthed in southern France.Matheronodon is distinctive for its large teeth with a chisel-like cutting edge that provided a powerful shearing action like scissors to eat tough vegetation, said paleontologist Pascal Godefroit of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels.That research was published in the journal Scientific Reports.
Mystery space object may be first confirmed interstellar visitor:::::LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A small asteroid or comet that has been spotted racing through our solar system may have come from elsewhere in the galaxy, U.S. space scientists say, possibly marking the first such interstellar visitor observed from Earth.The mystery object, so far known only as A/2017 U1, was discovered earlier this month by a researcher using a sophisticated telescope system at the University of Hawaii that continually scans the universe for such phenomenon.We have been waiting for this day for decades, said Paul Chodas, manager of the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations Center for Near Earth Object Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.Its long been theorized that such objects exist -- asteroids or comets moving around between the stars and occasionally passing through our solar system -- but this is the first such detection, Chodas said.The mass, a quarter mile (400 meters) in diameter, quickly stood out for scientists because of its extreme orbit, coming from the direction of the constellation Lyra, almost directly above the elliptical plane where the planets and other asteroids orbit the sun.It crossed under that plane just outside Mercurys orbit on Sept. 2 before being slung by the suns massive gravity into a sharp turn under our solar system.The closest the object came to Earth was about 15 million miles away on Oct. 14.It is going extremely fast and on such a trajectory that we can say with confidence that this object is on its way out of the solar system and not coming back, NASAs Davide Farnocchia said.Astronomers were urgently tracking A/2017 U1 with telescopes as it makes its journey through our solar system, hoping to use that data to confirm the objects interstellar origins and learn what they can about its composition.If the object is formally established as the first of its kind spotted from Earth, rules for naming it would have to be set out by the International Astronomical Union, NASA scientists said.
Raccoon-sized dinosaur with 'bandit mask' amazes scientists:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A raccoon-sized, feather-clad dinosaur that roamed China 130 million years ago shared a distinctive trait with the furry modern mammal that topples trash cans in North America: a stripe across their eyes resembling a bandit mask.This figure shows the best-preserved fossil specimen of Sinosauropteryx from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota of China and an interpretive drawing of the bones, stomach contents, and darkly pigmented feathers.The scale bar represents 50 mm.Photo courtesy of Jakob Vinther, intrepretive drawing by Fiann Smithwick/Handout via REUTERS Scientists said on Thursday an analysis of fossilized feathers on the dinosaur called Sinosauropteryx revealed a camouflage pattern that included the bandit mask, a light-colored underbelly, dark-colored back and a striped tail.Its color pattern also hinted at the environment Sinosauropteryx inhabited: an open savannah rather than a forest, the researchers believe.This was quite a surprising discovery, paleontologist Fiann Smithwick of the University of Bristol in Britain said of the bandit mask.That feature may have given Sinosauropteryx certain advantages.In birds, the evolutionary descendants of dinosaurs, a bandit mask pattern often obscures the eyes.Predators and prey look for eyes as a giveaway of an animals presence, Smithwick said.The color patterns we found are all known to be associated with camouflage in modern animals, and so it is likely that Sinosauropteryx was under strong predation pressure as well as needing to hide from its own prey.It was likely both the hunter and the hunted, Smithwick added.Sinosauropteryx measured about 3.5 feet (1 meter) long, was two-legged with short arms, large thumbs and a very long tail, and was covered in filament-like feathers.Previous research indicated its dark feathers were brownish-red.It possessed small, sharp teeth, and ate small vertebrates like lizards.It would have looked like a skinny version of a raccoon mixed with a turkey, said University of Bristol molecular paleobiologist Jakob Vinther.Scientists ability in recent years to identify color patterns in fossilized dinosaur skin and feathers has boosted the understanding of these bygone creatures.The camouflage pattern seen on the side of Sinosauropteryxs body is called countershading, which helps animals blend in with the background.Animals inhabiting open environments like savannahs often have a countershading pattern like that of Sinosauropteryx that transitions dramatically from dark to light high on the side of the body, the researchers said.Forest animals typically have countershading that changes from dark to light much lower and more gradually on the side of the body.We know that at least two other dinosaurs had countershading, neither of which were feathered, so it seems that it was a common color pattern, Smithwick said.The research was published in the journal Current Biology.
Earth is fragile, pope tells astronauts who see planet from "eyes of God":::::VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The earth is a fragile thing that could even destroy itself, Pope Francis told astronauts on the International Space Station on Thursday, saying they had an opportunity to see the planet from the eyes of God.Pope Francis attends an audio-video connection with crew members of the International Space Station, ISS Expedition 53, at the Vatican October 26, 2017.Osservatore Romano/Handout via Reuters Francis spent about 20 minutes in a video call to the six crew members on the space station, asking them several questions, sometimes with the gee-whiz wonder of a school boy.Hello ESA (European Space Agency) in the Vatican.This is Space Station.We hear you loud and clear.Good morning or Good evening.Because when one is in space you never know, the pope said from behind a desk with a television monitor in front of him.The pope seemed moved by comments by mission commander Randy Bresnik, one of three Americans on board, who said what gave him the greatest joy in space was to be able to look outside and see Gods creation maybe a little bit from his perspective.People cannot come up here and see the indescribable beauty of our earth and not be touched in their souls, Bresnik told the pope, adding, theres no borders, theres no conflict; its just peaceful.In his response, the pope said Bresnik had managed to understand that the earth is too fragile and it passes in a moment.Pope Francis attends an audio-video connection with crew members of the International Space Station, ISS Expedition 53, at the Vatican October 26, 2017.Osservatore Romano/Handout via Reuters It is a very fragile thing, the atmosphere is thin, so capable of doing harm, of destroying itself, and you have gone to look at it from the eyes of God.Francis, the second pope to phone the space station - Pope Benedict did so in 2011 - has made many appeals for the protection of the Earths environment.Slideshow (3 Images) An encyclical, or major letter, he published in 2015 called for action to reduce the harm from global warming caused by human activity.Sergey Ryazanskiy, one of two Russians on the space station, said he had decided to be a cosmonaut because his grandfather was one of the chief engineers who built Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, which the Soviet Union sent into a low Earth orbit in 1957 during the Cold War.Roots are our hope and our strength.Dont forget roots, Francis replied approvingly of the reference to being inspired by a grandfather.Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli, who acted as translator for his Russian and American crew mates, thanked the pope for coming on board and for taking us higher.Then a voice from mission control announced: Station: We are now resuming normal operational communications.
'Bloodhound' car kicks off bid to speed into record books:::::NEWQUAY, England (Reuters) - The Bloodhound Supersonic Car, effectively a fighter jet on wheels, on Thursday kicked off a bid to roar into the record books by eventually reaching 1,000 mph (1,610 kmh).Before a crowd of spectators, the blue and orange, spacecraft-like vehicle with a high tail and long, rocket-shaped nose made two test runs down a 1.7-mile (2.7 km) track, attaining 200 mph (320 kmh) in about nine seconds.It was the first public trial of the vehicle, powered by an EJ200 jet engine from a Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet, ahead of a world record bid in South Africa in the next few years.Twenty years after setting the current world land speed record of 763 mph in the Bloodhounds predecessor, Andy Green, a British air force pilot, will aim to surpass his achievement.We came here to say Bloodhound is Go!And thats exactly what we managed to demonstrate today, Green said after the test run in Newquay in the southwest of England.The Bloodhound SuperSonic Car, which is attempting to break the 1,000mph barrier in 2019, does its first public test run at Newquay airport, Newquay, Britain, October 26, 2017, REUTERS/Toby Melville The performance, the handling, the stability of it - I cant fault the car at all, it just worked brilliantly.Slideshow (9 Images) The Bloodhound project was launched in 2008 in London with the objective of designing a car able to reach speeds of 1,000 mph.About 30 million pounds ($39.49 million) has been invested in the project thanks to support from the public and sponsors including Chinese auto group Geely and Rolls Royce among others.The overall price tag could reach 60 million pounds.If the roughly 13-metre(39-foot)-long vehicle achieves its target 1,000 mph, that would surpass the low-altitude speed record for aircraft of 994 mph, according to the Bloodhound project website.At 1,000 mph, it would cover a distance equivalent to over four football pitches every second.
Saudi fund agrees plan to invest in Virgin space ventures:::::RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabias Public Investment Fund plans to invest about $1 billion in Richard Bransons space company, Virgin Galactic, and sister companies The Spaceship Company and Virgin Orbit, according to a joint statement published on Thursday.FILE PHOTO: Sir Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group and Virgin Unite, takes part in a discussion during the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting in New York, September 28, 2015.REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo This investment will enable us to develop the next generation of satellite launches and accelerate our program for point to point supersonic space travel, the statement quoted Branson, the British billionaire founder of London-based Virgin Group, Virgin Galactics owner, as saying.We are now just months away from Virgin Galactic going into space with people on board and Virgin Orbit going into orbit and placing satellites around the Earth.Last year Virgin Galactic was granted an operating license by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to fly its passenger rocketship with the worlds first paying space tourists aboard once final safety tests are completed.Under a non-binding memorandum of understanding there is an option for $480 million of future additional investment in space services, said the statement, issued at the end of a three-day Saudi investment conference in the capital Riyadh.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman said the deal reflected the progress the conservative kingdom was making toward creating a diversified, knowledge-based economy.The future of Saudi Arabia is one of innovation, he said.Its through partnerships with organizations like Virgin Group that we will make active contributions to those sectors and technologies that are driving progress on a global scale.
Ancient Papua New Guinea skull called oldest-known tsunami victim:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A mysterious partial skull unearthed in Papua New Guinea in 1929 that once was thought to belong to an extinct human species now turns out to have another unique distinction.Scientists believe it belongs to the oldest-known human tsunami victim.The cranium of a person who lived in what's now Papua New Guinea, 6,000 years ago is pictured in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters October 25, 2017.Arthur Durband/The Field Museum/Handout via REUTERS Researchers said on Wednesday that new examinations of the sediments where the 6,000-year-old skull was found detected hallmarks of a tsunami, with a composition remarkably similar to the remnants of a deadly 1998 tsunami that lashed the same area.The skull was discovered near the town of Aitape, about 7 miles (12 km) inland from Papua New Guineas northern coast.It is one of the earliest human remains from the island of New Guinea, and initially was mistaken for a species called Homo erectus that died out about 140,000 years ago.Later scientific dating revealed it was actually 6,000 years old.As probably the oldest-known tsunami victim in the world, the Aitape skull speaks volumes about the long-term exposure of human populations along the worlds coastlines and how such events in the past will have undoubtedly had fundamental effects on human migration, settlement and culture, said tsunami expert James Goff of the University of New South Wales in Australia.The scientists examined geological deposits at the river-bed site where the skull was found, identifying clear signs of tsunami activity.They spotted microscopic organisms from the ocean in the sediment, similar to those found in soil after the 1998 tsunami.We also employed chemistry and examined the size of sediment grains, finding they were indicative of a tsunami, said anthropologist-archaeologist Mark Golitko of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana and the Field Museum in Chicago.Tsunamis, giant waves typically caused by underwater earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, are particularly dangerous natural disasters.The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, caused by a massive earthquake off Sumatra, killed more than 230,000 people.The 1998 Papua New Guinea tsunami killed more than 2,000 people, wiped out villages, destroyed crops and forced many survivors to relocate.The tsunami 6,000 years ago apparently was similar.Much like the 1998 tsunami, we suspect that one or more large waves very suddenly impacted the coast, washing near-shore villages and anyone living there further back into swamps and lagoons that dot the coast, Golitko said.The skull was found without other bones.The researchers noted that in the 1998 tsunami, many victims were washed into lagoons and their bodies scavenged by crocodiles.The research was published in the journal PLOS ONE.
U.S. scientists unveil powerful new tools to fix genetic faults:::::CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. scientists on Wednesday unveiled two new molecular editing tools designed to fix mutations that cause the majority of human genetic diseases, some of which have no known treatment.One technique, by David Liu of Harvard University and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, offers a highly precise way to fix single-letter mistakes in genes, which are stretches of deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA.A second, by Broad Institute molecular biologist Feng Zhang, focuses on editing ribonucleic acid or RNA, which carries the genetic instructions to make proteins, without altering DNA.Both techniques build off of the game-changing CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tool, a type of molecular scissors for trimming unwanted parts of the human genome to replace with new stretches of DNA.The genome consists of six billion DNA letters, or chemical bases.In a paper published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, Liu and colleagues build on his pioneering work called base editing.Unlike CRISPR, which causes breaks in DNA, base editing chemically corrects single-letter errors in DNA.CRISPR is like scissors, and base editors are like pencils, Liu said in a statement.Base editing tinkers with DNAs four chemical bases, adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).It takes two bases to form base pairs which make up rungs in the spiral DNA ladder, and they follow specific rules - C pairs with G, and T pairs with A. Single-letter mistakes, called point mutations, can give rise to genetic diseases.Last year, Lius team described a base editor that could change CG base pairs into AT pairs.In a paper published in September, researchers at Sun Yat-sen University in China described using that system to correct a faulty gene that causes the blood disorder called beta-thalassemia in human embryos.For the latest study, Lius lab researchers engineered an entirely new enzyme that could convert an AT to a GC pair, something that had previously not been possible.The research goal was tantalizing because about half of the 32,000 disease-associated point mutations are caused when an GC base pair mistakenly becomes an AT in a specific spot in the genome.They came up with an enzyme that is very specific and very effective, said Dana Carroll, a gene-editing expert at the University of Utah who was not involved in the research.It really was a heroic effort, and very beautifully done.Carroll said gene editing enzymes would be very useful tools for both research and practical studies in medicine and possibly agriculture.Since base editing does not cause a break in the DNA, it might produce more predictable results than CRISPR, which can cause slightly unpredictable insertions or deletions in the genetic code, Professor Robin Lovell-Badge of the Francis Crick Institute in London said in an email.In the second study published in Science, Zhang, an early developer of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, created a new version of CRISPR that can edit RNA, which could help scientists make precise changes in cells at different points in development.David Cox, a graduate student in Zhangs lab and a lead author on the study, said the RNA editing system, called REPAIR, can fix mutations without tampering with the genome.However, the changes are not permanent because RNA degrades over time.Carroll said both editing systems offer the chance to correct specific disease mutations, either in DNA or messenger RNA.But neither is ready for human trials yet.There are a number of hurdles that need to be overcome, including proving efficiency, specificity and safety, he said.The scientists also need to develop ways to deliver the editing systems into the correct cells in the body.
Shrews it or lose it: a critter's incredible shrinking skull:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It is not the taming of the shrew, but rather the shrinking of the shrew.A common shrew or Sorex araneus is shown in this September 27, 2008 handout photo.Courtesy of Karol Zub/Handout via REUTERS Scientists this week described one of natures most intriguing phenomena, the shrinkage of the skull and body of a type of shrew as lean winter months approach and the subsequent regrowth of the critters for the flowering of spring.This exotic trait of the common shrew, a tiny insect-eating mammal inhabiting central and north Europe and a large part of Asia, was first noted in the 1940s but no previous research had studied changes in individual shrews.The scientists periodically caught, measured and X-rayed wild shrews near the German village of Mggingen.Individual shrews shrank their braincase by up to 20 percent -- 15 percent on average -- from summer to winter, then in the spring regrew by up to 13 percent -- 9 percent on average, not quite returning to their original size.Body mass also decreased by winter and then increased in spring.Wild shrews live about 13-15 months and never regain their previous size.In these extremely high metabolic animals, reducing body mass during winter, a period of resource scarcity, might increase their survival chances, as this would reduce food requirements, said evolutionary biologist Javier Lzaro Tapia of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany.And reducing brain size, as well as other tissues, might save energy as the brain tissues are energetically so expensive.In other words, we are observing a wintering adaptation in terms of energy saving, an alternative strategy for a non-migratory and non-hibernating species.Common shrews, whose favorite meal is earthworms, are very active, and must eat constantly to supply their ravenous metabolism.They are territorial and solitary, starting fierce fights when meeting other shrews, and tolerate each other only during breeding season.Regarding the biological mechanisms behind the shrinking and regrowth, Lzaro said braincase shrinkage is probably achieved by a resorption of tissue at the cranial sutures, joints between skull bones, with a regeneration of bone tissue during the regrowth phase.If we think of our own skull and imagine it changing in size by 20 percent, this is astounding and unimaginable, Lzaro said.This image is what we want the reader to take home: how flexible seemingly rigid structures can be if evolution warrants it, making this tiny high-power engine of an animal so successful.The research was published on Monday in the journal Current Biology.
Apple sees its mobile devices as platform for artificial intelligence:::::TAIPEI (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) sees its mobile devices as a major platform for artificial intelligence in the future, Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said on Monday.An Apple employee showcases the augmented reality on an iPhone 8 Plus at the Apple Orchard Shop in Singapore September 22, 2017.REUTERS/Edgar Su Later this week, Apple is set to begin taking pre-orders for its new smartphone, the iPhone X which starts at $999 and uses artificial intelligence (AI) features embedded in the companys latest A11 chips.The phone promises new facial recognition features such as Face ID that uses a mathematical model of a persons face to allow the user to sign on to their phones or pay for goods with a steady glance at their phones.We think that the frameworks that weve got, the neural engines weve put in the phone, in the watch ... we do view that as a huge piece of the future, we believe these frameworks will allow developers to create apps that will do more and more in this space, so we think the phone is a major platform, Williams said.He was speaking at top chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Companys (2330.TW) 30th anniversary celebration in Taipei, which was attended by global tech executives.Williams said technological innovations, especially involving the cloud and on-device processing, will improve life without sacrificing privacy or security.I think were at an inflection point, with on-device computing, coupled with the potential of AI, to really change the world, he said.He said AI could be used to change the way healthcare is delivered, an industry he sees as ripe for change.Williams said Apples integration of artificial intelligence wouldnt be just limited to mobile phones.Some pieces will be done in data centers, some will be on the device, but we are already doing AI in the broader sense of the word, not the machines thinking for themselves version of AI, he said referring to the work of Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), a leader in AI.Global tech firms such as Facebook (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Amazon, and Chinas Huawei are spending heavily to develop and offer AI-powered services and products in search of new growth drivers.Softbank Group Corp (9984.T), which has significantly invested in artificial intelligence, plans a second Vision Fund that could be about $200 billion in size, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.At Mondays event, TSMC Chairman Morris Chang described his companys relationship with Apple as intense.Williams said the relationship started in 2010, the year Apple launched the iPhone 4, with both parties taking on substantial risk.He credited Chang for TSMCs huge capital investment to ramp up faster than the pace the industry was used to at the time.Apple decided to have 100 percent of its new iPhone and new iPad chips for application processors sourced at TSMC, and TSMC invested $9 billion to bring up its Tainan fab in a record 11 months, he said.
Regular marijuana users have more sex, study says:::::(CNN) Dr. Michael Eisenberg , an assistant professor of urology, sees a lot of patients at the Stanford University Medical Center who have problems performing in the bedroom.To determine what the problem is, they'll go through a laundry list of regular activities.Often, patients will ask whether they need to smoke less marijuana.There isn't a lot of research on the topic.However, with marijuana becoming legal in a growing number of states, Eisenberg thought it'd be worth exploring.What he found surprised him."Usually, people assume the more frequently you smoke, the worse it could be when it came to sex, but in fact, we learned the opposite was true," Eisenberg said.His study was published in this week's Journal of Sexual Medicine.in the four weeks prior to the survey and how frequently they used marijuana in the past year.The study looked at data from the US government's National Survey of Family Growth .It asked more than 28,000 women and nearly 23,000 men how often they had sexin the four weeks prior to the survey and how frequently they used marijuana in the past year.Women who didn't use marijuana reported having sex six times on average during the past four weeks.Women who used marijuana daily had sex 7.1 times on average.The trend was similar for men.Men who abstained from marijuana said they had sex an average of 5.6 times in the four weeks before the survey, compared with the daily marijuana users who reported having sex 6.9 times, on average."We were surprised to see the positive association between users," Eisenberg said."This was across the board: marital status, race, none of that mattered."The study focused on heterosexual sex, and it didn't explain why there might be a connection between sex and marijuana.Eisenberg said past research on human and rodent models has shown that marijuana use may generally increase arousal.However, studies have also shown that too much marijuana use can decrease sperm count , and while men may want to have sex more, orgasm may be a challenge."It can have a different impact on different people," said Joseph Palamar , an associate professor in the Department of Population Health at New York University, who is not connected with the current study.He thought it was a "cool epidemiological paper" that "did the best it could with the data," but it did have limitations."It's unclear from the data if people had marijuana in their system before or during sex," Palamar said.Someone could smoke in the morning but not have sex until the evening, when it wouldn't be in their system any more, for example.He added he'd like to see a study that could show more of a direct effect on frequency.Palamar authored a small study comparing the sexual experience of people who are under the influence of alcohol versus marijuana.Studying 24 adults , his research found that people under either influence had increased feelings of self-attractiveness, but alcohol seemed to make people more social and bold and helped them make more connections with potential partners, compared with those people using marijuana.It showed that drinkers typically have more regrets about who they slept with and are less choosey, whereas marijuana users tended to be more selective.Because marijuana is still illegal in the majority of places, Palamar found that most people have to smoke in private, and that could lead to more opportunities to initiate intimacy, compared with people who drink, since alcohol is everywhere.Marijuana may also have increased some people's sensitivity during the act itself, although some reported getting so "lost in their own heads," they weren't paying as much attention to their partners, and they did not enjoy sex as much."And if marijuana makes you paranoid, as it does with some people, it could really, pardon the pun, screw your ability to have an orgasm," Palamar said.Some women also reported vaginal dryness when they smoked pot, and that too can limit sexual pleasure.Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Both scholars hoped these studies will encourage other researchers to dive deeper into the topic.In the meantime, Eisenberg said that if a patient asks whether his frequent marijuana use is getting in the way of his sex life, he will tell them that "it may not be the culprit."Regular marijuana use can have other impacts on your health.Research in adults is still limited, but what we know is that smoking can irritate your lungs, and studies have shown it can raise your heart rate, making you more vulnerable to a heart attack."For most people, we tell them instead to go to the gym and lose 20 pounds," Eisenberg said.Being overweight can give men arousal problems "We always talk about anything that can be good for your heart can be good for your penis," he said."For a lot of guys, hearing that is an amazing motivator."
How to have more sex: Better sleep:::::(CNN) If you think you're too tired for sex, you're not alone.According to a large new study , women over age 50 who get fewer than seven hours of sleep are less likely to report being sexually active than their peers who sleep more, a problem that increases with age.Sleep disorders can also interfere with sex.Research suggests that men with obstructive sleep apnea, a condition marked by snoring and breathing difficulties, have decreased levels of sexual activity, possibly because they produce lower amounts of testosterone.Sleep apnea can also increase the risk of cardiovascular problems, which may be related to sexual dysfunction.But the reverse appears to be true, too: Another recent study that looked at sleep and sex in college students found that for those in romantic relationships, every extra hour they slept corresponded to higher sexual desire, greater vaginal lubrication and a 14% increase in the chances of getting frisky the next day.That's probably because a good night's sleep leaves us feeling refreshed, relaxed and energetic -- all important for feeling sexy."This type of research builds on previous research demonstrating that lifestyle behaviors influence people's sexual lives," said Debby Herbenick, associate professor at Indiana University and president of the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and Therapists.Eating, exercise and stress levels can also influence sexual behavior, sexual desire and interest in sex.But sleep is one of the big categories, largely in our control."Dr. Alfred Kinsey noted this many years ago in his books, and more recent research supports it," Herbenick explained."For example, a study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine demonstrated that sleep apnea has been linked with sexual difficulties including erectile dysfunction and more global sexual difficulties.Other research has suggested that -- of the many reasons that menopause can impact sexual lives -- sleep deprivation (for example, due to night sweats) can be one of the reasons.And a 2015 study showed that women who slept longer at night were more likely to experience stronger sexual desire the following day ...It's clear that sex and sleep are closely tied together."Although some couples may use fatigue as an excuse not to have sex rather than acknowledge deeper relationship difficulties, that's not always the case."Being too tired is the number one reason that women blame for their loss of desire," University of Florida psychology professor Laurie Mintz said."A great number of women say that their primary issue is simply being too depleted to have interest in sex and not some looming relationship problem."Of course, if you've scrimped on sleep and are feeling cranky and exhausted, an amorous romp is probably low on your to-do list.The sex-sleep cycle Ironically, a sex drought can actually worsen sleep, setting you up for a vicious cycle of irritability.That's because sex helps us relax, unwind -- and, yes, fall asleep.Remember the classic stereotype of a guy dozing off immediately after sex?There's some truth to that, for both men and women.The reasons are largely chemical in nature.After orgasm, our bodies release significant amounts of the "cuddle hormone" oxytocin, which lowers levels of the stress hormone cortisol, resulting in deep relaxation.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Sex also has gender-specific benefits."For women, estrogen levels increase after sex, which can enhance a woman's REM cycle for a deeper sleep.In men, the hormone prolactin is secreted after orgasm and has been tied to sleepiness," explained licensed psychologist Rachel Needle, co-director of the Modern Sex Therapy Institutes.Sex and sleep may be linked in other ways as well.To be able to fall asleep, we need to let go, said Lawrence Siegel, a clinical sexologist and certified sexuality educator at the Sage Institute for Family Development.Sex is similar, particularly for women, who typically need to be able to relax to have an orgasm."Many people experience a type of sleep disturbance where their defense system kicks in just as they're falling asleep and they're snapped back from the brink and now wide awake, heart racing due to the adrenaline and cortisol coursing through their veins," he explained."Over many years of clinical experience, I have seen a connection between reports of this type of sleep disturbance and reports of the inability to orgasm."Just do it So how can you break the no sleep/no sex cycle?First, I recommend taking basic steps to promote good sleep hygiene: Make sure your mattress and pillow are comfortable, dim the lights at least an hour before bedtime, and use a white noise machine if your bedroom is loud.Try not to use your smartphone, tablet or other gadgets in bed; the light they emit can interfere with sleep.Make sure you're not using electronics as a way to avoid intimacy, a common diversionary tactic by people who may feel anxious about sex, according to certified sex therapist and licensed marriage and family therapist Amanda Pasciucco.And see your doctor if you think a sleep disorder might be interfering with slumber.Finally, the best advice for fostering a healthy sex life is to just do it, even if you're tired.That may require some scheduling, but that can pay off in the long run."I recommend that couples have 'trysts' or planned sexual encounters," Mintz said."These can be planned for times other than at night, when exhaustion is at its peak.Having trysts will also alleviate the all-too-familiar tension couples experience when crawling into bed at night, when one partner wants sex and the other feels too exhausted for a sexual encounter."If you'd prefer to ease into things, that's fine, too."You could say to your partner, 'I've had a long day and I'm exhausted; can we just snuggle tonight?'" certified sex therapist Francie L. Stone suggested."That snuggling helps release oxytocin, which may result in sexual play and result in a good night's rest.Worst-case scenario, you're bonding and feeling closer."That's a win-win to me.
Why Americans are having less sex:::::(CNN) Today, sex seems more available to us than ever before.With just a swipe on their phones, singles can schedule their next hookup, while committed couples have an apparent "sure thing" every night.This is also known as "the marriage advantage."Why, then, are Americans having less sex than they were 20 years ago, not more?According to a recent study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior, the large general social survey (GSS) found that American adults had sex about nine fewer times per year in the early 2010s than they did in the late 1990s, a decline that wasn't explained by longer work hours or increased use of pornography.The GSS is a project of the independent research organization NORC at the University of Chicago, with principal funding from the National Science Foundation.Although it's not entirely clear what is behind this dip, theories about the potential causes abound.For instance, people are having children later in life, which may make them too tired for sex.The parenting effect "A lot of parents feel like they've already done about 50 things they didn't want to do that day, like getting up at dawn, dealing with their child's tantrums.Adding sex to the menu just seems like too much," said Samantha Lutz, a psychologist."So we turn to things like Netflix to unwind, which leads to immediate gratification with zero energy expended."Parents also seem to be much more involved with their children's lives than in the past."Parents are constantly driving their children to school and extracurricular activities," said Amanda Pasciucco, a licensed marriage and family therapist.In previous years, children had more freedom and fewer organized activities, which meant more free time for their parents.Eric Marlowe Garrison, a certified sexuality counselor, agreed."We're seeing more helicopter parenting, which is zapping energy that could go toward sex and other sensual activities."But has the marriage advantage become a disadvantage?Photos: 10 reasons to have sex tonight Photos: 10 reasons to have sex tonight The health benefits of sex go way beyond the pleasures of orgasm.You get a health boost in all sorts of ways from fooling around, from lowering blood pressure to stress reduction.Read on for all the excuses you need to schedule sex tonight.Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: 10 reasons to have sex tonight 10 reasons to have sex tonight Sex, especially orgasm, releases the bonding hormone oxytocin, which promotes a feeling of well-being and happiness.And you don't have to act like bunnies to get the benefit;

Stone, a clinical psychologist, has observed similar behaviors."In speaking with young women and men, it seems (they use) dating and hookup apps more as a way to affirm themselves.The women in particular say that they use these apps when they are drunk or bored.They never meet up and have no intention to; they just enjoy the sexual banter.They're using it as a replacement for 'real-life' sex and to explore their own sexuality, what they may like and what they may not like, all in the safety of their own environment."This may lead people to masturbate instead."I think young singles having less sex boils down to them having more choice.They can be picky, and they are," said Holly Richmond, a certified sex therapist."If it can't be a stellar experience, they'd rather not bother when they know they can go home to great porn and high-quality toys that deliver grade-A orgasms."Herbenick, also an associate professor at Indiana University School of Public Health, added that "we may be having less sex, but I would argue it's better sex.We actually don't know if singles are having 'less sex' since the (survey) never defined sex and doesn't ask about the many kinds of sex play that people engage in (including masturbation, oral sex and sex toy play), especially during hookups.It is possible that singles are having less frequent intercourse but about the same (or more or less) of other kinds of sex, such as oral sex or hand stimulation or sex toy play."Is less sex really a bad thing?"As a certified sex therapist, I am more concerned with the type of sex -- is it intense on an emotional, intellectual, physical and spiritual level?-- than I am on the number of times per week," Pasciucco said.In fact, the drop in sex might be the result of culture shifts and female empowerment, explained Margie Nichols, a psychologist.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Compared with earlier generations, women might be viewing sex as less of a duty to their husbands and more of a personal choice."It makes sense that women in relationships might be losing their sex drive and saying 'no' more, as opposed to my mother's generation that just spread their legs and composed a shopping list in their heads during sex," she said."If that's true, then the decline in frequency is a good thing."On that note, remember, a healthy sex life is whatever works for you and your partner.It can't be measured by a statistic.
Marijuana for pain, PTSD: Studies find evidence lacking:::::(CNN) Medical marijuana is now legal in 28 states and the District of Columbia.Increasingly, people are turning to cannabis to treat a range of symptoms and conditions, including nausea, bipolar disorder and seizures.But when it comes to using marijuana to treat chronic pain or post-traumatic stress disorder , two related reviews published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine find little scientific evidence to support either its effectiveness or its safety.Up to 80% of people who request medical marijuana want to ease pain, while more than a third cite PTSD as their primary reason, the US Department of Veterans Affairs researchers wrote, citing a separate recent small study As a result, physicians increasingly need to talk with patients about the potential benefits and harms of cannabis use, the authors note.Where can doctors turn for evidence-based material?More harm than good?The researchers found 27 studies that examined the use of cannabis products for chronic pain in adults.But they discovered insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about whether medical marijuana was helpful to pain sufferers, with one exception: neuropathic or nerve pain.Even there, the team found only weak evidence that cannabis alleviates chronic neuropathic pain.By contrast, they discovered sufficient evidence to conclude that cannabis use among the general population probably increased the risk of car accidents, psychotic symptoms and short-term cognitive impairment.Next, the team reviewed data from two reviews and three studies assessing plant-based cannabis preparations used to treat PTSD among adults.Here, the authors found the available scientific studies to be flawed due to either small numbers of participants or a failure to include non-cannabis-using control groups.Once again, the researchers decided the evidence was insufficient and not rigorous enough to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of cannabis in this patient population.Worse still, one study of veterans with PTSD showed a small but "significant" worsening of symptoms among veterans who either started or continued using cannabis during the study period, the team said."We found low- to moderate-strength evidence that cannabis use is associated with an increased risk for psychotic symptoms, psychosis, mania, and -- in active users -- short-term cognitive dysfunction," the authors noted.Schedule I substance Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said "it is still too early to really understand how effective cannabis may be for chronic pain or PTSD or to fully understand the ways in which cannabis could provide relief."Additional research would take time, said Gupta, who was not involved in the new study but has reported on medical marijuana extensively in three CNN documentaries entitled "Weed."" Weed 3 ," which first aired in 2015, gave viewers a front row seat to the first federally approved clinical study on the use of marijuana for PTSD.With respect to the new research, Gupta said that scientists would need to first address safety issues and reliable, consistent dosing strategies.Cannabis remains a Schedule I substance, the Drug Enforcement Administration classification for drugs believed to have a high potential for abuse along with some potential to create severe dependence.With federal restrictions placed on marijuana, scientists must overcome various legal and procedural hurdles to research it.Gupta noted, "that makes these important studies harder to conduct."Dr. Dermot P. Maher, an assistant professor in the Johns Hopkins Department of Anesthesiology, noted that the authors searched several sources to identify "under-reported results," which helped create a "more complete picture" of medical marijuana's possible treatment utility."The potential benefits and harms of medical marijuana should be evaluated and compared against other available treatments, such as physical therapy, spine interventions, pain medications and surgery," Maher, who did not contribute to the review, wrote in an email.He added that the economic and societal "costs" of chronic pain emphasize "the need to examine all available tools."In an editorial accompanying the research, Dr. Sachin Patel of Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital noted that the findings are not unique.With very little quality evidence available, the efficacy of cannabis -- and cannabinoid products -- for treating pain and PTSD remains unknown.One possible reason why some people find cannabis helpful in easing pain -- despite scientific evidence suggesting otherwise -- could be that the effects of cannabis depend on potency and dose, Patel wrote in an email.Meanwhile, most studies use lower doses and lower potencies of medical marijuana than what is found in dispensaries."Pain is a multifaceted symptom, which includes sensory, cognitive, and emotional components," he wrote."Perhaps cannabis decreases the clinical effect of chronic pain" in ways unrecorded by pain rating scales.If scientists looked at emotional symptoms, such as anxiety, quality of life and sleep, instead of traditional symptoms, that "may begin to tell us which specific areas of 'pain' are most likely going to be helped by cannabis, if any."An everyday issue at the VA Jane Metrik, an associate professor at Brown University School of Public Health, calls the new research both "timely" and "very well-done."Though she did not contribute to the review, Metrik works as a clinical psychologist at the Providence VA Medical Center and routinely treats veterans with PTSD who use cannabis."It's a growing issue that VA providers are grappling with every day," she wrote in an email.Cannabis users often report a "short-term alleviation of PTSD symptoms": Sleep is easier, for example, and tension relieved.Often, though, they become dependent on the drug, increasing both quantity and frequency, possibly leading to cannabis use disorder , which includes 11 behavioral symptoms outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5.PTSD combined with cannabis use disorder "is frequently associated with greater symptom severity, worse treatment outcomes, and increased use of health services," Metrik wrote."In light of insufficient evidence on the benefits of cannabis use in patients with PTSD, it is particularly important to increase access to evidence-based trauma-focused treatments for PTSD."In particular, the VA has highlighted prolonged exposure and cognitive processing therapies , while Metrik recommends cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia for veterans with problems sleeping.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter."Veterans expect cannabis to provide relief from symptoms of combat-related trauma and perceive cannabis to be a low-risk or safe substance unlike other drugs," Metrik wrote.But "the science behind the legislative action of legalizing medical cannabis as treatment for individuals with PTSD is lacking."She said controlled studies on its effectiveness and safety are needed to substantiate self-reported positive claims and "to test whether benefits of using plant-based cannabis outweigh the risks."

Is there a link between sugar and cancer?:::::A biologic mechanism in yeast cells may explain the relationship between sugar and malignant tumors, according to a recent study published in the journal Nature Communications.The nine-year research project may even influence personal medicine and diets for cancer patients, the authors concluded.The study begins by looking closely at cancer cells' appetite for sugar.Scientists understand that cancer cells support their rapid reproduction by rewiring their metabolisms to take glucose, ferment it and produce lactate.Conversely, healthy cells continue with normal respiration, a process in which they take glucose and break it down into carbon dioxide and water.This "switch of cancer cells from respiration to fermentation is something that was discovered by Otto Warburg, a German biochemist, about 70 or 80 years ago," said microbiologist Johan M. Thevelein, senior author of the study and a professor at KU Leuven in Belgium.It is known as " the Warburg effect ."Fermentation of sugar to lactic acid produces about 15 times less energy than respiration of sugar, Thevelein noted.Yet cancer cells "grow much more rapidly than normal cells, and yeast actually grows the fastest when they ferment," he noted."This is weird," he said, and it raises an important question: Is the Warburg effect a symptom of cancer -- or a cause of it?Searching for the answer, Thevelein and his colleagues experimented with yeast cells since, just like cancer cells, they are known to favor fermentation over respiration.The researchers found an intermediate compound that is a "potent activator" of the RAS protein.RAS is a proto-oncogene: a gene that codes for proteins that help to regulate cell growth and differentiation.Proto-oncogenes can become oncogenes or cancer-causing genes when mutations occur.Mutant forms of RAS proteins are present in many tumors, Thevelein said.The new study, then, reveals "a vicious cycle," he said.As sugar is broken down in cells, the intermediate compound activates the RAS proteins, and this in turn stimulates cell proliferation, he said.This cycle seen in yeast cells might help explain the aggressiveness of cancer."Very interesting," said Dr. Jennifer Ligibel, chairwoman of the American Society of Clinical Oncology's energy balance committee .Still, she urges caution in interpreting these findings."It's important to not make too many jumps into a patient message based on a study of yeast," she said.Eating sugar or too much weight?Even though the researchers pinpointed some similarities between yeast and human cancer cells, Ligibel explained, "it's important to recognize we're a few steps away from even human cancer cells in a test tube."The study showed only an increased rate of cell growth triggered by glucose, she said.Even though the team showed RAS pathways being activated, this "actually didn't result in the cells replicating more quickly," she said.Still, the data are "incredible," said Ligibel, who is also an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School."This is really one of the first studies that's provided a biologic mechanism that could explain a relationship between glucose itself and cancer progression."When we think about the relationship between sugar and cancer -- when we think about what drives the level of sugar in someone's body -- it's primarily related to their weight," Ligibel said.When people are heavier, their bodies manage sugar differently than those of people who are lighter.This sugar management is what leads to type 2 diabetes, a disease in which blood sugar is high and levels of insulin, the hormone the body uses to manage blood sugar, begins to rise because the body becomes resistant to its effects."We've known for a while that having a higher blood sugar and having a higher level of insulin in your system are both linked to the risk of developing cancer," Ligibel said.At the same time, studies that have tried to look at how eating sugar might be linked to cancer risk "have been much less consistent," she said.One large study of older US adults, for instance, did not find a relationship between the amount of sugar people ate and the risk of developing cancer.Conversely, she noted, other studies show that people diagnosed with colon cancer who ate a higher proportion of their total calories in sugar had a higher risk of cancer recurrence -- but only for people who were already overweight and obese.Once again, how the body manages sugar -- and not the sweetener itself -- may be key.Studies in breast cancer patients have compared low-carbohydrate diets to low-fat diets and found that the amount of weight people lost, not the diet itself, was important, Ligibel said.If it led to weight loss, either diet brought an identical lowering of sugar in the blood stream and an identical lowering of insulin."Whether you achieved that through one diet versus another didn't seem to be as important as the amount of weight you lost if you were overweight or obese," she said.Translated into practical advice for cancer patients: "If you have someone who is obese or overweight, helping them to lose weight is going to be an important thing.We know that from a lot of different lines of study."I think that sugar definitely contributes to weight gain.I think that sugar doesn't have a lot of nutritional value," Ligibel said.Still, cancer patients need to focus on maintaining a healthy weight by balancing exercise and the food they eat.Sugar can cause obesity which leads to cancer Asked whether he believes that eating more sugar leads to more cancer, Thevelein immediately answered, "No!definitely not."He and his co-authors do not state that in the paper; instead, they explain how normal, healthy cells can handle sugar in a controlled way."On the other hand, we all know that when you eat a lot of sugar, you have a tendency -- that has been clearly shown -- to become more obese," Thevelein said."And obesity is linked to a higher risk of cancer."Though it's "too early to say," Thevelein said that when you eat too much sugar over a long time, "maybe this can also lead in some way to dysregulation of the RAS protein in the normal cells," and possibly it is this "dysregulation" that triggers RAS genes into becoming mutants."It's better not to eat too much sugar so that you don't become obese," he said."And if at the same time, you also decrease your risk of cancer, the better -- but this is something we cannot make a statement about at this moment."Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.If anything, he would suggest that cancer patients eat less simple sugars and more complex sugars, such as those found in starch and whole grains.Complex sugars are released more slowly and are taken up by the body more slowly, and this might be helpful to cancer patients."That would be our message," Thevelein said: "Try to look for alternative ways of providing sugar and energy to cancer patients rather than rapidly metabolized simple sugars."
'Detox' from overly processed foods: Why and how to cut back:::::(CNN) If nutrition headlines catch your attention, you've probably heard the advice to eat more fresh, whole foods and consume fewer processed foods.It sounds straightforward enough, and you may have chosen to abide by this "food rule."But like many topics in nutrition, the advice is not as simple as it sounds.Before you do a pantry or freezer overhaul, keep in mind that "processed" is a very general term.Some processed foods serve as important players in filling nutrient gaps and contribute to the availability of a safe and convenient food supply.Others are, well, pretty much junk food.The challenge lies in knowing which ones to include in your diet and which processed foods pose a problem.Processed Foods 101 Processed foods include any food that has been deliberately changed before we consume it."I think it is important that people understand, anytime you alter the food from its natural state, that is actually considered 'processed,' " said Kristi L. King, a senior registered dietitian at Texas Children's Hospital and a national spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.According to the International Food Information Council, processing can be as simple as freezing or drying food to preserve nutrients and freshness, or as complex as formulating a frozen meal with the optimal balance of nutrients and ingredients.Minimally processed foods retain most of their inherent nutritional and physical properties.Examples of these include washed and cut fruits and vegetables, bagged salads and roasted nuts.Those, along with foods processed to help preserve and enhance nutrients and freshness of foods at their peak -- canned tuna, beans and tomatoes, as well as frozen fruits and vegetables -- are healthful and offer important nutrients.Other processed foods include sauces and dressings, as well as ready-to-eat breakfast cereal, crackers, nut butters, yogurt and milk fortified with calcium and vitamin D. It's the more heavily processed foods, snacks and meals high in added sugars, sodium and unhealthy fats that are the "problem" processed foods, as consuming too many of them can lead to health problems.Also known as "ultra-processed" foods, they are formulations of salt, sugar, oils and fats, as well as flavors, colors and other additives."The problem with highly processed foods is, they are usually loaded with sodium for shelf stabilization, sugar for taste or added fats, including saturated and trans fats, for mouth feel," King said.Research has linked all of these ingredients to chronic health problems, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and some types of cancer, according to King."The cookies, chips, snack cakes that we all know and think of as 'processed foods' would be ones that are not so healthy for us, as well as sugar-sweetened beverages and highly processed meats such as sausage," she said.How to cut back on highly processed foods According to experts, the key to an overall healthy diet is to limit your intake of "ultra-processed" foods, which make up about 60% of our calories and contribute 90% of calories from added sugars, while choosing healthier, unprocessed and minimally processed foods that offer a variety of nutrients.And there are some relatively painless ways to do it.1.Start slowly."If you eat a significant amount of highly processed foods, try taking small steps toward a less processed diet," said Jackie Newgent, a registered dietitian, culinary nutritionist and author of "The All-Natural Diabetes Cookbook.""There's no need to go cold turkey today -- and often, if you slowly ease into a less-processed eating plan, your likelihood of continuing your wholesome new habits increases."2.Supplement your meals with fresh foods.Try adding a banana or apple at breakfast or as a snack, or a vegetable at lunch."Ultimately, half of your plate at lunch and dinner should be fruits and vegetables," King said."Simply adding a freshly prepared salad to an otherwise not-so-fresh meal makes it better for your body ... and more enjoyable," Newgent said.3.Fewer sugar-sweetened beverages, more water.If you get tired of water, King recommends carbonated water or adding fruit to water for flavor.4.Stop adding salt to foods."If you need an extra flavor boost, add garlic or pepper instead," King said.5.Choose whole grains over processed grains."Go with brown rice in place of white rice, whole-wheat pasta instead of 'white' pasta and whole-grain bread instead of 'white' bread.These swaps are nuttier-tasting and more filling, too," Newgent said.6.Limit or avoid processed meats.Meats such as bacon, ham, hot dogs and sausage have been Meats such as bacon, ham, hot dogs and sausage have been linked to increased risk of colorectal cancer 7.Plan ahead."If you find that you are reaching for the highly processed foods because they are convenient and you are in a hurry to get to your meeting or your kid to soccer practice, try planning out snacks on the weekend for the weekdays," King said.Set aside portions of trail mix, carrots and celery with hummus, Greek yogurts, and fruit with natural nut butters so they are ready to grab and go.8.Use substitutes for highly processed snacks and foods.Instead of potato chips, try nonfat popcorn, which is whole grain and a good source of fiber and still gives the crunch you're looking for."You can add a dash of chili powder or Parmesan cheese for flavor," King said.You can also replace sugar-sweetened cereal with unsweetened oatmeal and add fruit for flavor.9.Make your own versions of traditionally processed foods.Consider homemade kale chips, granola and even salad dressings."Instead of bottled salad dressing that may contain preservatives your body doesn't need, whip up your own," Newgent said."Simply whisk together three tablespoons of olive oil and one tablespoon vinegar of choice for an easy two-ingredient vinaigrette.Or add that oil and vinegar to a blender with a small handful of berries for a lovely fruity salad dressing."10.Make healthier versions of frozen meals."Try batch cooking on the weekend or a weeknight when you have time," King said.Consider a homemade mac and cheese with whole-wheat pasta and veggies or turkey burger patties with sauted vegetables.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.11.Don't be fooled by the advertising.If you see fat- or sugar-modified food, such as fat-free mayo or sugar-free yogurt, be wary."These foods may have artificial ingredients -- such as the artificial colors yellow No.6 or red No.40 -- or other chemical additives, such as the artificial sweetener acesulfame potassium, making them more processed and potentially less healthful for you," Newgent said."Read the ingredient list on packaged foods, and look for a list that reads more like a recipe rather than a pseudo-science experiment," she added.
Caffeine 'detox': How and why to cut back on your daily fix:::::(CNN) Are you one of those people who can't get your day started without a cup of coffee?Perhaps you need an espresso at work to keep you alert in the late afternoon.Maybe you grab energy drinks when cramming for an exam or late-night work project.Or maybe you have a habit of drinking caffeinated soft drinks.Regardless of the form, an estimated 90% of the US population regularly consume caffeine, a stimulant and ingredient that has been enjoyed for thousands of years.It's not hard to do so, as caffeine is ubiquitous in our food supply, found in beverages, chocolate and pain medications, to name a few."Caffeine is the most commonly consumed psychoactive drug," said Mary M. Sweeney, an instructor who researches caffeine's effects on individuals in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine."When we consume caffeine, it has positive effects on mood and alertness, and people like these beneficial effects."Although we know it can be counted on for a pick-me-up, more and more research is revealing other upsides of caffeine, including improved memory, enhanced athletic performance, beneficial effects on liver health and possible protection against Parkinson's disease.For some, caffeine may have the unintended consequence of staving off hunger, and it may even make foods seem less sweet, though few professionals would endorse it as a diet aid.But can there be too much of a good thing when it comes to caffeine?And if so, how much is too much?When might it be wise to cut back on caffeine consumption?What are the recommendations on caffeine?A recent systematic review involving nearly 400 studies looked at adverse health effects associated with caffeine consumption, including general toxicity, cardiovascular effects, effects on bone and calcium, behavioral effects, and reproductive and developmental effects.The research evaluated caffeine intake from any source and was supported with grants from the American Beverage Association and the National Coffee Association, though neither association participated in any aspect of the review.The review also revealed that healthy pregnant women can consume up to 300 milligrams of caffeine daily, an amount that is "generally not associated with adverse reproductive and developmental effects," though the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists cautions pregnant women to limit caffeine to 200 milligrams daily.Researchers also recommend that children and adolescents not exceed an intake of 2.5 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight per day, though they state that the available literature for these groups was "scant."For a child weighing 55 pounds, this translates to a daily limit of 62.5 milligrams of caffeine.Caffeine tolerance is individual Though caffeine recommendations are based on a specific amount of milligrams, the effects can vary from person to person, and different individuals may be able to tolerate different amounts."People vary in their tolerance to caffeine," Sweeney said."Many people consume caffeine without negative consequences, but for some individuals, either regularly consuming too much caffeine or consuming too much at once can cause distress."An individual's tolerance to caffeine may depend on body size and how they metabolize caffeine, which can be related to genetic differences."Some break it down quickly and may be less likely to experience negative effects," Sweeney said.Lifestyle factors also affect caffeine metabolism, including pregnancy and the use of oral contraceptives, both of which slow caffeine metabolism in the body, according to Sweeney.When your daily fix becomes a 'problem' Research shows that most Americans consume less than the daily 400-milligram limit, and stronger effects of too much caffeine are typically seen at much higher doses, according to Sweeney.Still, too much is any amount that leads to gastrointestinal problems, trouble sleeping, nervousness, anxiety, irregular heartbeat or excessive urination, she said.It's also a red flag if one's caffeine consumption is causing a meaningful impairment at work or at school."Caffeine is so ingrained in our day-to-day habits that we don't of think of it as a source of a potential problem," Sweeney said."It's not to say everyone will have the same effects, but it's important to be aware that it has psychoactive effects, and it can interfere with things in ways that we don't expect."As caffeine can aggravate and accelerate one's heart rate, it can be a problem for those with an existing heart condition, according to Dr. Vince Bufalino, a spokesman for the American Heart Association and senior vice president and senior medical director of Cardiology-AMG, Advocate Health Care, in Naperville, Illinois.For example, if you have atrial fibrillation (commonly known as irregular heartbeat) or hypertension, he recommends limiting caffeine intake to one to two cups daily, but if you are sensitive to caffeine, you should cut it out completely.Other research points to the fact that caffeine may become indirectly harmful if its consumption provokes other unhealthy habits, such as when coffee drinking promotes doughnut eating or cigarette smoking, or when energy drink consumption promotes alcohol intake For some, the idea of dependency in and of itself, along with its associated symptoms of withdrawal, can be enough of a reason to cut back."Withdrawal symptoms can interfere with day-to-day functions and can include severe headaches, difficulty concentrating, irritability, depressed mood or even flu-like symptoms," Sweeney said.Symptoms of caffeine withdrawal have been observed after discontinuing doses as low as 100 milligrams per day, though in general, the higher your daily dose of caffeine, the greater your severity of withdrawal symptoms, she said.So whether you think you're a little too dependent on caffeine or you have a medical or other personal reason to cut back (perhaps you're planning on becoming pregnant, and that triple shot venti latte will be on the "do not drink" list), here are some tips to help you get started.Tips for cutting back on caffeine 1.Keep a caffeine diary.It can inform you of how much caffeine you are consuming, and it may be more or less than what you may think, Sweeney said.This strategy was a helpful intervention for people seeking treatment to reduce their caffeine use in a study conducted by Sweeney and other researchers at Johns Hopkins University.( It can inform you of how much caffeine you are consuming, and it may be more or less than what you may think, Sweeney said.This strategy was a helpful intervention for people seeking treatment to reduce their caffeine use in a study conducted by Sweeney and other researchers at Johns Hopkins University.( In the study , which also involved brief counseling, people reduced their caffeine intake from an average of 600 milligrams per day to 50 milligrams during a six-week period.)2.Know all of the sources of caffeine in your diet.Remember, caffeine is found in coffee, tea, soft drinks, energy drinks and shots, as well as cocoa and chocolate.It's also present in fortified snack foods, some energy bars (like Clif Bar's Cool Mint Chocolate and Peanut Toffee Buzz) and even some pain medications, including some forms of Excedrin and Midol.(For a more extensive list of caffeine content from various

chart from the Center for Science in the Public Interest.)3.If you drink coffee, gradually cut back on the number of cups per day."The key recommendation we have suggested to people looking to cut back is to gradually reduce caffeine consumption over a period of days or weeks," Sweeney said."If you're drinking four cups of coffee per day, you may reduce it by one cup per week.You might also substitute one cup with decaf, or blend in some decaf with each cup," she said.4.Try coffee alternatives, such as green or black tea.Tea can still give you a boost but has Tea can still give you a boost but has less caffeine than coffee .An 8-ounce cup of black tea contains about 47 milligrams of caffeine, and green tea has about 25 milligrams per cup, compared with 75 to 165 milligrams in an 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.5.Anticipate when caffeine cravings may occur.As part of the counseling component in the Johns Hopkins study, and as part of the unit's ongoing work, individuals identify situations or moods in which they are most likely to crave caffeine.The unit advises avoiding situations that trigger cravings, especially during the first few weeks of modifying caffeine use, and having a plan for when cravings occur, like taking a five-minute relaxation break involving deep breathing exercises.Remember to always discuss any major lifestyle or dietary changes with your health care provider first, as changes may affect your mood or medical conditions.
Your Halloween costume has never been more politically loaded:::::(CNN) Offending and being offended have become Halloween traditions as obvious and predictable as jack-o-lanterns rotting on the front porch.It seems, however, that the yearly agitations over blackface, sombreros and topical shock get-ups carry more weight now.We're in a time when hate has a prominent spot on the national stage.But it's also a time when we're discussing complex issues of race and privilege more nimbly and more widely than ever before.In this climate, Halloween costumes have become a litmus test of sorts.From the blatant bigotry of blackface to the more nuanced ills of cultural appropriation, colleges and social organizations are seeking to establish guidelines regarding what and why certain portrayals offend.And as they do, they're butting heads with those who decry what feels, to them, like restrictive -- if not dangerous -- oversensitivity.Why it's nuanced Blackface, of course, is the most verboten and overtly offensive of costume choices.Below that, a whole array of potentially bad ideas unfold, from the obvious (terrorist costumes and Native American headdresses, to name just two) to the more oblique.For instance, a recent article on Good Housekeeping points out an "Adult Granny Costume" for men.This, and other men-dressed-as-women gags, the article says, could be seen as transphobic.(The costume was removed from Walmart's website.)An "Adult Granny" costume from Spirit Halloween Other ideas that could be considered offensive include costumes depicting sexual harassment, mental illness or animal abuse.Then there's the concept of cultural appropriation versus appreciation.There is a difference between caricatures of pale-faced geishas and sacred Native American headdresses at college house parties and, say, eating another culture's food or learning another culture's language.How do you distinguish between the two?In March, Kimberly Griffin, an education professor at the University of Maryland at College Park told Inside Higher Ed that students of color may feel more sensitive to or threatened by appropriations of culture as the climate of hate and social justice changes around them."While they have long experienced marginalization, Latino, black and Native American students are living in campus communities that are perhaps more openly hostile than they once were," she said."They are also managing and navigating political rhetoric and policies that are often at best marginalizing, and at worst, racist."How it can get overblown Earlier this month, "Riverdale" actress Lili Reinhart was criticized when she posted a photo of a young white woman painted head-to-toe in black, with demon-like details.A Twitter user defends actress Lili Reinhart's costume idea.Angry social media users said it was an example of blackface.Reinhart apologized.But there was also overlapping anger that what was clearly a supernatural look was being lumped in with blackface.Several commenters claimed blackface is a direct representation of black people, and doesn't include every single conceivable use of dark makeup on the face."Dressing up as a demon - not racist," one Twitter user wrote ."Comparing a demon to black people = racist."Even those who are sensitive to cultural appropriation can find some outrage goes a little too far.Some corners of the internet lit up this year when a Halloween costume sites appeared to offer an "Anne Frank" costume.Various listings also described it as a "World War II costume" or a "World War II Evacuee Girl."An "Anne Frank" costume sold by several online retail hubs.After substantial online outrage, a spokesman for the costume retailer Fun Costumes apologized.In a deleted tweet , it said the company sells the costumes not just for Halloween, but also for school projects and plays.Why the intent matters Being faced with more complex rubrics of social acceptability has left some people wondering -- good naturedly or otherwise -- where the line between freedom of expression and personal responsibility is, and whether there is one at all.In 2015, a lecturer at Yale publicly criticized a campus-wide email warning about Halloween costumes.She said the university's guidelines exerted an "implied control" over students."I wonder, and I am not trying to be provocative: Is there no room anymore for a child or young person to be a little bit obnoxious, a little bit inappropriate or provocative or, yes, offensive?"Her words caused such ire, hundreds of students protested and called for her removal.She eventually resigned , but reflected on the incident a year later in the Washington Post."I had hoped to generate a reflective conversation among students," she wrote."What happens when one person's offense is another person's pride?Should a costume-wearer's intent or context matter?Can we always tell the difference between a mocking costume and one that satirizes ignorance?"JUST WATCHED Is this Halloween costume offensive?Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Is this Halloween costume offensive?01:38 Not all critics of costume policing are so academic.For some, wearing offensive costumes is an act of gleeful rebellion, an inversion of Hanlon's razor driven chiefly by malice and intended to provoke.This year's tasteless costume du jour is "The Wall."It's a play on President Trump's proposed Mexican border wall.A "Wall" costume sold by Party City According to the various voices in the great Halloween costume debate, such an outfit could be read as unforgivable racism, trolling, a defensible exercise of free speech or a flight of youthful satire.Why we need guidelines The University of Texas in Austin publishes a series of suggestions and guidelines regarding costumes and theme parties .The document has existed for several years and isn't just for Halloween.But last year, it became a favorite target of critics who mocked its broad scope.The guide, which was slightly updated this year, lists potentially harmful costumes and themes like stereotypes of Asian and indigenous cultures, "ghetto fabulous," "chicks and hicks" and "Pimps & Hoes."It also includes questions for theme party planning like, "Is the theme or costume referring to a living culture or people?"Angry commenters said such suggestions "ruin" Halloween and threaten free speech.JUST WATCHED Campaign on offensive Halloween costumes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Campaign on offensive Halloween costumes 00:59 Fox Business covered the guidelines during a "Risk & Reward" segment this month."Every piece of literature I've seen from these colleges highlight the impact that these damaging costumes could have," said guest Allie Stuckey."And my question is what?What tangible impact are these costumes having?"Sara Kennedy, the manager of Strategic and Executive Communications at the school, told CNN the idea of the guide is not to restrict or scold, but to get students thinking about the value and impact of their choices."After something happens, students can find out why [insensitive costumes] are a bad idea," she said."While there is a lot of learning in that moment, part of our goal is helping students avoid that confrontation, and maybe learn some of those lessons without causing hurt to others or themselves."How they're ignored anyway Despite the widespread warnings and the accompanying eye rolls from social justice critics, there's a steady stream of students being called out for their offensive attire.Last year, the Sigma Tau Gamma fraternity sent out an email to all chapters before the Halloween season."Please, brothers, be attentive of what you wear this Halloween season," it read."What might be harmless to you, might be extremely offensive and hurtful to others."Just days later, a white student at the University of Central Arkansas was photographed in what appeared to be a Bill Cosby sweater, in full blackface.He was suspended, as was the fraternity's chapter of the school.Earlier that October, two students at Allbright College in Pennsylvania were suspended for an online video of one student mocking the Black Lives Matter movement while wearing blackface.The college's president called the stunt a "hurtful, offensive act."Mercifully, as the Halloween season ends, this year's offensive costumes will be filed away with past years' -- next to ebola doctors and Caitlyn Jenners and other homemade bad ideas too awful to mention.Next year, it'll be joined by others, and so on and so forth, until there's either no more hatred or no more Halloween.It's safe to bet on the latter.
Floods could strike NYC every five years, climate study says:::::(CNN) In the coming years, New York City might look less like a concrete jungle and more like a concrete swamp.The Big Apple could see a surge in significant floods every five years between 2030 and 2045 as an impact of climate change, according to a study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences The study suggests that as global sea levels rise and as a warming atmosphere drives tropical storms, the combination could leave the city facing more frequent and more dangerous flood events."We know that storm surge flooding tends to be the deadliest aspect of many tropical cyclones," said Andra Garner, a climate researcher at Rutgers University and lead author of the study."It is very important that we take action to mitigate future warming in order to avoid the worst-case scenarios of future sea-level rise, which would help to limit the increases we see in future flood risk," she said."This work emphasizes the need for adaptation planning for the New York region in order to protect the city's coastal infrastructure in both the near future and in centuries to come."Garner and her colleagues pointed in their study to Hurricane Sandy , which spawned devastating floods in New York City in 2012, as an example of extreme weather events the city could face.Forecast models show that a big storm could hit the Northeast on Sunday -- the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Sandy's US landfall -- and into Monday morning.The storm could bring flooding rains from the mid-Atlantic through New England.However, the storm system is not forecast to be as strong as Sandy, which was directly responsible for about 147 deaths in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center For the new study, scientists used computer models to project probable sea level rise and storm surges in New York City from the preindustrial era before 1800 to 2300.The scientists took a close look at the frequency of troublesome flood heights of 2.25 meters, or 7.38 feet, above the average tidal level for the region; in contrast, Hurricane Sandy had a storm surge of 2.8 meters, 9.19 feet, above the mean tidal level, according to the study.The models projected that flood heights of 2.25 meters above the mean tidal level will become more frequent over time.During the preindustrial era, such flooding occurred only about every 500 years, the researchers found.By the modern period, such flooding occurred about every 25 years, and it could occur every five years in the future.That study also suggests that less than about half of the observed rise in sea levels in the 20th century would have occurred in the absence of global warming.New York, for instance, has experienced at least a foot of sea level rise since 1900, mostly due to the expansion of warming ocean waters, according to the state's Department of Environmental Conservation Additionally, scientists argue that the effects of climate change, including rising sea levels and warmer oceans, recently made Hurricanes Irma and Harvey more powerful than they otherwise would have been.In the new study, even though the climate models showed more frequent flooding, they also projected that tropical cyclones could shift farther east and farther out to sea, the researchers found."The track shift was really not something we expected to find in this work and not something we had originally set out to investigate," Garner said."The finding reveals the need for additional research into the way that future storm tracks may behave in the Atlantic basin, and it's something that we hope to look into more."Even with a possible track shift, Kim Knowlton, senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York City who was not involved in the study, highlighted that rising sea levels would still have a significant impact on flooding in the future and public health, which "is an area of big concern," she said."It's quite likely that we're going to see that sea level contribution to coastal floods for some time, that we're going to have to contend with this," said Knowlton, who is also an assistant clinical professor at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.Frequent flooding, such as what was projected in the new study, could influence public health by posing the direct risk of potential drowning and injury, as well as other health consequences associated with evacuation efforts and power outages, and mental health impacts, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, she said.There are numerous public health concerns related to flooding beyond the most obvious risks of drowning and trauma, said Jonathan Patz, a professor and director of the Global Health Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who was not involved in the new study."These range from contaminated drinking water and risk of infectious diseases simply from wading in floodwaters, to asthma and other respiratory illness from exposure to mold and fungus during post-event cleanup when people return to their homes," Patz said.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Patz added that prolonged power outages can further delay access to clean water and cause heat-related deaths due to a lack of air conditioning."The most important thing that we can do to avoid such devastating floods is to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases by pursuing a clean energy economy," he said."That pursuit in itself offers enormous and immediate health benefits, from improved air quality from clean energy, and improved fitness levels from urban design to enhance walking or biking opportunities."

Houston officer saves hundreds in Hurricane Harvey:::::Watch "New Day" and "CNN Newsroom" each Friday to see inspiring stories of officers going above and beyond the call of duty.Houston (CNN) As Hurricane Harvey punctuated its arrival with a seemingly never-ending deluge of rain, no one would have blamed Houston Police Officer Norbert Ramn if he chose to seek shelter.The soft-spoken 55-year-old is battling stage 4 colon cancer, and the disease has spread to his liver and lungs.But as parts of Louisiana and Texas began to flood from Hurricane Harvey, Ramn couldn't stand the idea of not doing his job.Do you know an officer who has gone above and beyond what the job requires?E-mail us at BeyondtheCallofDuty@cnn.com."Our oath is to go out and protect and serve other people," Ramn said."You're always concerned about other people.You don't dwell on yourself."He's an officer first Ramn, after all, is not a man who gives up.When all the rain was making it impossible to find a way to his station downtown, he "(got) up on the curb just to make the turnaround and get back on the freeway," he recalled.He then drove to the one station he knew he could still reach: Lake Patrol, right on Lake Houston.Ramn, who is in his 24th year on the force, contacted his sergeant and told him that's where he would be helping out.For the month of August, Ramn had been on desk duty.While enduring chemotherapy every two weeks, he needed a break from the blistering Texas heat.But now it was the start of September and he was itching to get back outside."(I'd) rather be out in the street," Ramn explained."I enjoy being out there.""Out there," in this case, meant out in the water.The officers took the boats normally used to patrol the lake and put them in the floodwaters above the now sunken streets.On the boats, they had to navigate around trees and cars that sat below the water's surface as they made their way to residents in need of rescue."Once we got there, then it was just normal work," Ramn said."We were just working.We're loading people, getting them out."The people were taken to buses that took them to shelters.Back and forth the officers navigated the murky water to rescue people.Amid the chaos, there were some images that Ramn won't forget."What sticks in my head is those children.I mean, you'd see different emotions.Some were, you know, scared.Some were excited.Some were happy," Ramn recalled, noting that there was often sadness in the adults' eyes."There was a lot of people walking in the water.There were kids out there swimming."Reason for concern But there were risks.The water was full of bacteria, Ramn's platelet count was low and he was putting in long days.Working in 12-hour shifts, the officers were responding to an onslaught of calls from people who needed to be rescued from their flooded homes and apartments.Bayous snake throughout much of the Houston area.As these waterways overflowed their banks, the water had nowhere else to go but up, swiftly surging into neighborhoods and putting residents at risk.Houston Police Officer Norbert Ramn, pictured here with his wife, Cindy (right), sent her a picture of himself while in the midst of boat rescues so that she would know he was feeling fine.Over three days, from sunrise to sunset, the entire unit pulled some 1,500 people to safety.Ramn estimates he helped rescue 200 or 300 people, maybe more.While all this was going on, Ramn's wife of 13 years, Cindy Ramn, was at home watching the water that had infiltrated their neighbors' yard creep closer to their property.She kept track of the water and would text updates to her husband, who stayed at the police station in the midst of the flooding.Luckily, their home was spared.While Cindy was worried about their house, she was more concerned about her husband's health."I didn't know how it would affect him, but at the same token, I knew there was nothing I could say or do that was going to hold him back," Cindy said.Houston Police Sgt.Epi Garza, who has known Ramn for about 15 years, was one of the first to learn of his cancer diagnosis.With Ramn now working from Lake Patrol, Garza felt somewhat responsible for him."I knew that I had to monitor him, see for myself," Garza said."At no time he showed me or the guys any types of signs that this disease was affecting his performance."In fact, Ramn was not in any pain and he was comfortable even though he was soaking wet.The only thing bothering him was a blistery rash across his face, a side-effect from the chemotherapy.'He's not looking for sympathy' For boat rescues, Ramn was paired with Senior Police Officer Alvin Steelman, who had no idea Ramn is battling cancer.When the two met, they had to get straight to work; there was no time to get to know each other.But Steelman saw a man who was holding his own with all the other first responders."He's not looking for sympathy.He just wants to be part of the team and he was," Steelman said."He's stepping up and just doing what's necessary to help someone else without even looking back.No hesitation at all, and I was pretty amazed by it."Garza believes in some ways Hurricane Harvey brought Ramn some relief."For three days of his life after being diagnosed, he was in a world where he didn't have to think about it," Garza said."He was really happy being occupied knowing that he was doing something that was amazing, which was helping people."Officer one day, cancer patient the next Lake Patrol was in full-on rescue mode for three days, and a little bit of the fourth.On the fifth day, Ramn quietly slipped away.With the airports closed from Hurricane Harvey, he and his wife drove to Oklahoma so he could get chemotherapy."The only time it hits me, reality hits me, is when I have to leave ... and go get my chemo," Ramn said, getting emotional."I'm out there on the street and then I got to leave half the day to go out there and do that."He pauses and takes a breath before continuing, "But as long as I'm with these guys, you know, they keep me up."At 50 years old, Ramn had a colonoscopy."They did find some polyps and they told me to come back in three years," Ramn said."Came back in three years, no symptoms, just had a regular colonoscopy -- and they told me I had cancer."Houston Police Officer Norbert Ramn was diagnosed with cancer in March 2016, and wants to use his platform to encourage other cancer patients to stay optimistic.That diagnosis in March 2016 was devastating; the cancer was already stage 4.Ramn immediately underwent surgery to remove part of his intestine and started chemotherapy two months later."There was no in between," he said, remembering how he was in the best shape of his life when he found out he was sick."I [had] started seeing a nutritionist.I lost all this weight.I was running.I was down to like 7% body fat."'It can be beat' While he has been told he has about five years to live, he's using his platform to encourage other cancer patients to stay optimistic."People have told me that they were diagnosed with just six months to live and now they're on their 19th year," Ramn said."So I mean, it can be beat.You just got to figure out where to go and what to do."For Ramn, that means spending time fishing with Cindy, talking about anything but cancer and, of course, continuing to work as a Houston police officer."As long as they put me on full duty and doctors say 'you can go out there,' I just want to be treated like I don't even have it," Ramn said, his voice just above a whisper."Just a regular officer without cancer."
Equipping more kids for on-the-field success:::::"I was wearing jerseys all the time, watching sports on TV," he said."It was what I spent every second of my free time doing."In college, Levitt promptly chose Sports Management as his major.He started his first internship as the equipment manager for the college football team."I'll never forget walking into the equipment room," Levitt said."Shelves full of the nicest cleats, shoulders pads, training gear ... it was all top of the line."Then, right before the start of the season, Levitt was told to throw out all the equipment.The team needed to make space for the brand-new equipment arriving the following week."Some of this gear was barely used," Levitt said."I was throwing away footballs that the running back held a few times in practice."Levitt knew there must be a better use for it.He started thinking about the equipment that was being wasted all over the country -- not just at the college level, but among secondary schools and families."I had a very fortunate upbringing; I could play any sport I wanted and just go to Sports Authority and get whatever I needed," Levitt said."But when I got to college, I met kids who didn't have the opportunities I had.I thought they really could have used equipment like this when they were kids."In 2011, Levitt decided to make his college dream a reality.He started Leveling the Playing Field, a nonprofit that he describes as a "food bank for sports equipment."In 2013, he quit his job to run the organization full time.Today, the group has a 4,000-square-foot warehouse in Silver Spring, Maryland, with more than $1 million worth of athletic equipment.The majority of equipment donations come from local school teams and individuals.The organization donates to low-income schools and nonprofits that apply for equipment.Once a school or team is approved, they can receive free equipment in perpetuity."Every kid should have the opportunity to play on a team," Levitt said."You learn work ethic, structure, sportsmanship, perseverance.You learn so much that will shape the person you become."CNN's Meghan Dunn spoke with Levitt about his work.Below is an edited version of their conversation.CNN: Why is access to sports opportunities a challenge for some kids?Max Levitt: There are so many barriers in the way of a low-income kid trying to play a sport.The registration fees to join a team are incredibly high, not to mention how much money you have to spend at a sporting goods store just to come home with enough stuff to play.We're talking about $250 to $500 for equipment that the kid is going to outgrow rather quickly.That sometimes is the equivalent of multiple months of paying your heating bill or a week's worth of dinner for your kids.And for families that struggle to even do that, to think about investing in baseball equipment that is going be no good within a year or two, it's not a decision.They cannot let their kid play baseball.CNN: Who do you donate to and what is the process to get equipment?Levitt: We're donating it to Title 1 schools, charter schools, after-school youth programs, like a Boys and Girls Club or a YMCA.It could be a church or a neighborhood after-school care program.Really any organization that is trying to engage low-income kids in athletics, we want to be there as a resource to them.One of the core values of what we do is just making it very simple and easy to work with us.We just want them to be able to get the equipment.They come in here, and within an hour, they leave with everything they need to start that program.A battle they've been fighting for 10 years is solved in such a simple way.Some people are flabbergasted by that.CNN: What does the future look like for Leveling the Playing Field?Levitt: When we started in my parents' basement, I remember just envisioning a warehouse with racks full of sporting equipment.There's a lot of stuff that I envisioned and it's incredibly satisfying to see them come to reality.Now, I'm envisioning more warehouses like this.Hopefully, in a couple years from now we'll have a couple locations.I don't even think we've really scratched the surface in terms of the amount of equipment we can collect.Want to get involved?Check out the Leveling the Playing Field website and see how to help.To donate to Leveling the Playing Field click the CrowdRise widget below.
Opioid epidemic: Emergency declaration is key to curbing it, experts say:::::(CNN) President Donald Trump's declaration of the opioid epidemic as a public health emergency Thursday is a key step in curbing the problem, as it helps redirect funds and ease state laws for those fighting on the front lines, according to public health experts and medical professionals."In practical terms, I believe this declaration of public health emergency will unify the country and our leadership in a nonpartisan way around finding solutions to this growing problem in the US," said Dr. Halena Gazelka, an anesthesiologist who chairs the Mayo Clinic's Opioid Stewardship Program."As state, federal and private funds are directed at curbing the primary issues (of) supply and demand, hopefully we'll see a rapid decrease in the overdose deaths and related health issues."Although the emergency declaration doesn't change guidelines for doctors, Gazelka said she hopes the declaration will empower providers to write "only the right amount of opioid for the right patient.""No longer should patients be able to request and receive opioids 'easily,' and they should receive them only when truly warranted by medical diagnosis," Gazelka said."No longer should providers freely write prescriptions without care and consideration to who is truly going to use those medications and for what purpose.""In the last several years, US life expectancy has actually declined, not because of cardiac disease or cancer or an incurable new virus but because of opioid overdose," Gazelka said."This is incredibly tragic and wasteful and must be halted with that trend in life expectancy reversed."Lainie Rutkow, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who has studied public health emergencies, said Thursday's measure could lead to increased grant funding for states to address opioid use disorders."The availability of additional funds, particularly for the states, to address opioid use disorders will be critical," Rutkow said.Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Leana Wen said she was glad the president was focusing on the issue, but she expressed disappointment he didn't declare it a national state of emergency."Right now, the announcement today calls for repurposing of existing funding, instead of new funding -- and that's what we desperately need."Michael Fraser, executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, a consortium of senior public health officials from all 50 states, US territories and the District of Columbia, applauded the measure because it puts pressure on Congress and federal agencies to make the opioid crisis a priority."It means a lot for the President to make a statement," Fraser said."Words matter.He's the President, and this means this is a national priority."He said he hopes that the politics of Washington don't get in the way and that appropriate funds for states get approved."It would be awful if the opioid emergency funding got caught up in the year-end budget," he said.Jessica Hulsey Nickel, the president and chief executive of the Addiction Policy Forum, a nonprofit organization that works to raise awareness of the opioid epidemic, called Trump's announcement "an important step toward preventing and treating substance use disorders.""Prioritizing this national crisis will bring much-needed resources to communities, improve access to services and facilitate better coordination among government agencies," she said."In particular, I am heartened by the decision to bring all federal government agencies to the table to play a unique role."Impact of a health emergency declaration It is not often that a public health emergency is declared.The US Department of Health and Human Services declared one in Puerto Rico last year after more than 10,000 Zika cases were reported there.Before that, the last emergency declaration unrelated to a natural disaster was during the 2009-10 flu season, when there was widespread concern over a potential pandemic.Dr. Arthur Reingold, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California-Berkeley, worked with the World Health Organization on providing advice during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009.The crucial thing an emergency declaration does, he said, is mobilize resources and bring much-needed attention to the problem, especially in getting politicians, leaders and the public on the same page."Typically, humans don't get motivated until there's actually a problem," Reingold said."In this case, this is a problem that has been festering for some time -- and now we're finally paying attention to it."Dr. Alberto de la Vega at the University of Puerto Rico who evaluated over 1,000 pregnant patients with Zika said the public health emergency declaration last year "definitely helped."It brought attention and forced resources from federal agencies to work toward bringing an end to the epidemic, he said.Puerto Rico's health department poured a lot of money into the effort, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."We definitely received a benefit from the classification and receiving more funds.There's no question about it," de la Vega said."But the bureaucracy, in making those allocation of funds reach us, always comes later than we wish."'The fight must go on' In an interim report in late July , the president's commission examining the opioid epidemic recommended that Trump declare a public health emergency.The commission, led by New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie, recommended rapidly increasing treatment capacity for those who need substance abuse help; establishing and funding better access to medication-assisted treatment programs; and making sure that health care providers are aware of the potential for misuse and abuse of prescription opioids by enhancing prevention efforts at medical and dental schools.Reports in recent days had suggested dysfunction and chaos within the commission.On Wednesday, commission member Patrick Kennedy said he wanted to see action."We don't want any more visits to rehab centers and photo ops, saying how courageous we are.Enough already.We want to save lives," said Kennedy, a former House representative from Rhode Island who has spoken about his own recovery from drug and alcohol addiction On Thursday, surrounded by members of families affected by the opioid crisis, first responders and members of Congress, Trump hailed the emergency declaration as means of stopping the epidemic.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter."As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction," he said."We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.We can do it."Experts on the front lines are now waiting to see the measure turned into action."After the razzle dazzle and public interest dies down -- and after politicians have ceased to make a name for themselves and moved on to other pressing concerns -- the fight must go on," Gazelka said.
Can the kratom plant help fix the opioid crisis?:::::(CNN) Multiple surgeries couldn't help Lisa Vinson with the chronic abdominal pain stemming from endometriosis, a condition in which tissue begins to grow outside the uterus.Her doctors' answer was pills and more pills."It makes you feel better for a little while, but then after a little while, it doesn't help as much, " said Vinson, 41, of Crystal River, Florida, who has been coping with pain for most of the past decade.Like many opioid users, Vinson built up a tolerance to the doses of painkillers she was prescribed."Every month, (the doctors) say, 'How are you?'I say, 'Well, it's not really helping as much.I'm still in a lot of pain.'" To give her some relief, her doctors would say, "OK, well, add this to it.This pill and then this patch."Eventually, she was on 12 prescriptions, some to manage her pain and others to manage the side effects of the pills she was taking for the pain.She didn't want to be on the pills, but without them, she couldn't function at all."I was torn between not being able to care for my family or (taking) care of them if I just take some more pills.Which shame do I choose?"Vinson said.The stigma of pain Despite more meds, her pain persisted.About a year ago, she was back in the hospital, begging for relief.A surgeon was called over."I thought he was going to come and save the day, and he's going to agree to do the surgery," she recalled, Instead, she said, she was judged.She remembers being told, "You don't have a surgery problem.You have a drug problem."Vinson felt stigmatized for asking for help and decided she would take matters into her own hands: She stopped taking the pills.But not only did the pain come back even stronger, the withdrawal symptoms weren't manageable.She began researching natural remedies to treat pain and came across kratom.In Malaysia, kratom leaves are traditionally crushed and made into a tea.According to Darshan Singh Mahinder, a professor at the Centre for Drug Research at the University of Science Malaysia , throughout Malaysia, the leaves of the kratom plant are traditionally crushed and made into a tea.It's used to "self-treat heroin/morphine dependence, or to reduce opiate withdrawal among illicit drug users," he said.It can also be used for pain relief.But in the United States, it's sold as a supplement, usually in the form of powder, pills, capsules or even energy drinks, and loosely regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.Vinson was dubious at first."If this is so good, why isn't it the first thing I see?Why haven't I read about it?"she asked.After having no luck with other home remedies such as magnesium and Imodium A-D, potassium and Benadryl, she decided to try kratom."I need this to stop.Clearly, I don't have what it takes to get through this withdrawal.As strong as I think I am, I'm not.I can't," she recalled.She left the house and bought some kratom capsules.Within several hours of her first dose, she was able to start working around the kitchen.She had a full night's sleep for the first time in years.She was convinced.'Kratom saved my life' On online forums such as Reddit or Bluelight, there are thousands of posts about kratom.People like Vinson testify about personal miracles."Kratom saved my life by getting me through the hardest thing I've ever had to do.""Hooked on Oxy, Hydro and Aderrall for over a year.Kratom helped me kick the habit.""Was using norcos and tramadol ... for pain management though they weren't much help.I found kratom back in November and within weeks I was completely free of both.... Its not perfect but it has definitely changed my life.""There's a huge wealth of anecdotal evidence, and some scientific, that there is definite medical potential for this plant.If it's not in the treatment of mild and moderate pain, it's definitely in the treatment of potential opioid withdrawal," said McCurdy, a medicinal chemist at the University of Florida and director of the UF Translational Drug Development Core .He is one of few scientists in the country who's examined kratom closely.He believes that the success of the plant may lie in its two principal alkaloids, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine.These chemicals can bond to the body's opioid receptors and act very much like opioids do, providing some pain relief and causing a release of dopamine, but at a much more toned-down level than prescription pills or heroin.Users say there are mild, if any, withdrawal symptoms.Kratom, or Mitragyna speciosa, is an everygreen plant native to Southeast Asia.McCurdy pointed out that his studies indicate that 7-hydroxymitragynine may have some addictive qualities, but when looked at in the entire plant, the ratio of that element is so little that the plant has very low abuse potential, one he likened to coffee.And unlike opiods, McCurdy said, kratom doesn't slow breathing.And that's key.When people overdose on opioids, whether it is a legally prescribed oxycodone or illicit heroin, their body's respiratory system completely stops."We've never seen respiratory depression in the animal studies that we've conducted, and we've never seen or heard reports of respiratory depression in the human population that's been using.And this is something that's really amazing when you start thinking about a potential treatment for opioid addiction or opioid withdrawal."A devastating epidemic McCurdy believes it boils down to money."There's no financial incentive for any drug company to really pursue developing this into a drug."Developing kratom into a therapy would cost hundreds of millions of dollars, he said.On top of that, patenting a plant it is nearly impossible."There's no profit incentive for a pharmaceutical to spend millions of dollars -- to do the studies the FDA requires ... to get approval," said Jag Davies of the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance.Davies said it is an issue that faces many botanical drugs, including marijuana."The FDA approval (process) is only geared toward single novel (or) single compound drugs," he said.In turn, without much interest from pharmaceutical companies, there isn't much research into this plant.A search of PubMed, the US National Library of Medicine archive, found just a handful of studies of the plant in its entire canon.Turning kratom into a therapy is something McCurdy is working on: isolating the plant to the essential molecules he believes have potential."If we can come up with some sort of standardized, modified, unique and proprietary formulation, then there's a way to gain some patent stance around that, and then there might be a way to entice a pharmaceutical company into pursuing this as a potential treatment option," he explained.But until then, the cost-benefit is just too high for a pharmaceutical company, he said, adding that he will keep doing the heavy lifting of trying to create a standard drug.The FDA provided guidance for the development of botanical drugs in 2004, but since then, according to the agency, there have been only two botanical drugs approved: Veregen, for warts, and Mytesi, an anti-diarrheal for HIV patients on antiretrovirals.The FDA doesn't keep track of how many drugs have been submitted that were unsuccessful in gaining approval.The Wild West of supplements In the meantime, kratom has found a home on the poorly regulated supplements market.It's now sold in head shops and gas stations, and there is no clear standard as to what passes for kratom.Though the kratom plant itself can grow only in Southeast Asia, American distributors are buying leaves to dry and make into powders and pills.Last year, the Drug Enforcement Administration considered designating kratom as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, the same category as heroin and LSD.According to the DEA, Schedule 1 compounds have "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse."The DEA says there were 15 deaths related to the plant between 2014 and 2016.In addition, the CDC found over five years a tenfold increase in calls about kratom to poison control centers, from 26 in 2010 to 263 in 2015.However, while 7% of the calls were for serious side effects, including one death, most of the calls reported minimal to moderate side effects.McCurdy has analyzed samples of kratom from emergency room patients and found that they frequently aren't what they claim to be."We've unfortunately seen them spiked with morphine in some cases, and we've also seen ones that have been spiked with oxycodone."He's also seen them spiked with increased concentrations of 7-hydroxymitragynine, the more addictive of the plant's naturally occurring alkaloids."We're in a totally unregulated environment," McCurdy said, a "buyer-beware marketplace."As he sees it, this is the extreme opposite of the DEA's consideration "to put it into the most restricted class of scheduled substances.And then we make it very difficult to find out if that medical potential is really there."Since the DEA's public comment period about regulating kratom ended in December, it has not made any announcements about the herb."Right now, the kratom industry is trying to self-regulate," Davies said.And that means people like Vinson are left to having to reach out to Internet boards and rely on the word of mouth from other users."You don't know," Vinson said."The best thing for me personally, I only buy from one person that I trust very much."'I'll never go back' Vinson believes in the plant so much that she's introduced kratom to her older sister, Patrica Coleman Slevin.Slevin began using narcotics about five years ago to help with chronic pain, she said.Within months, she was dependent.Two years after getting her first prescriptions for pain medication, she was alternating between high dosages of Dilaudid and oxycodone daily.Her body needed higher doses to get rid of the pain and manage the withdrawal."Everything hurts.You're sick.You're nauseous.You're throwing up.Diarrhea.Your will to live is gone because you can't, it's just the most unfathomable feeling.Everything, everything is just broke," explained Slevin, 45, of Live Oak, Florida.When she couldn't get more pills, she turned to heroin.Her husband also began using.Coleman eventually lost her job as a server.They lost their home."It takes no time for the bottom to fall out," Slevin said.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Last year, she was caught shoplifting and ended up in jail.When she got out, she called her sister.Vinson remembers picking up the phone and saying, "I will not send you money for drugs ... but I will buy you kratom."In November, Slevin and her husband moved in with her parents, and she hasn't touched heroin since.Will kratom keep her off heroin for the rest of her life?"It's a powerful, powerful, powerful drug, but I think as long as I have kratom, as long as I

Opioid addiction and the most controversial bathroom in New York:::::(CNN) Of all the provocative strategies to reduce harm from opioid addiction, the one that I am about to describe is near the top.Over the past several months, hardly anyone I spoke to about the abuse of opioids in the United States, including pain pills and heroin, had a neutral point of view about what is happening in a small but important corner of the larger epidemic.The place is where a former security guard named Hector Mata became an expert at reversing overdoses and probably saved 25 lives in the process.It is not a hospital or a clinic.Mata's infirmary is the Corner Project, a syringe exchange program that began operating in the New York neighborhood of Washington Heights, which houses a bathroom where drug users can more safely inject heroin.On first glance, there is not much that is special about this bathroom except that there is someone checking in on an intercom every three minutes to make sure the user is still conscious."A moral obligation" If a user doesn't respond on the check-in, Mata, or someone similarly trained, will press a button to unlock the door and rush in, armed with a syringe full of naloxone, also known by the brand name Narcan, and hopefully reverse the effects of the opioid drugs.After seven years and at least 25 overdoses, he says he has never failed.While to some people, this sounds like a "consumption room," or a safe injection site, the staff here say it is simply a bathroom.After all, injection sites aren't legal under US law.I sat down with the Corner Project's director, Liz Evans, and asked her just how a place like this legally exists.She told me that public bathrooms are the frontline of the opioid epidemic."People are dying in those bathrooms, and so there's an acknowledgment that as a syringe exchange provider, we have a moral obligation to make sure that people don't die in our building."And so, the Corner Project has implemented a safety net to make sure that people don't die from overdoses in the bathroom in their building.Everything in this story is a murky gray.Perhaps the story of the Corner Project could have been predicted.A heroin addict goes to a needle exchange, obtains clean needles and immediately heads to the bathroom to inject drugs.After all, according to recent studies in New York City, nearly two-thirds of drug users visit places like abandoned buildings, cars, and public bathrooms to inject drugs.The Corner Project started out as a street based community outreach group in 2005.In 2009, when the Corner Project moved to its current brick and mortar location, the bathroom was just a matter of convenience for clients.Within a short time, however, there was an overdose in the bathroom, followed by another and so on.Without a system in place, the workers at Corner Project would hear a characteristic thud from someone passing out in the bathroom, make a mad scramble for the keys and then work to revive the person.Though they were mostly successful, it was always frightening.The Corner Project could have simply closed the bathroom or searched people before they used the facility, but the workers chose to do neither.Instead, they kept it open and put in safety measures, like an intercom system, timers, and naloxone to help prevent overdoses.They stayed open knowing that if they closed their doors addicts would simply find another public restroom to use their drugs, far from the people who might be able to save them.And with that, the Corner Project pushed the limits of harm reduction in the United States.Since last year, the New York State Department of Health has followed the Corner Project's lead and instituted regulations and recommended procedures on how to best prevent overdoses in the places where users are likely to use: syringe exchange bathrooms.Criminalization vs. rehabilitation In the great debate of criminalization versus rehabilitation, many commonly held assumptions have been torn to shreds.For example, some believed the legalization of drugs like marijuana would lead to increased use.Yet in Colorado, which legalized recreational pot, teen marijuana use has dropped.When it comes to opioids, the number of people who overdose and die from legal prescription painkillers is about equal to the number of people who die from illicit drugs like heroin.Another commonly held belief is that a safe injection site would implicitly condone the use of drugs and lead to increased use.And yet we now know that theory starts to fray when we look at what has happened at the Corner Project and at a place called InSite in Vancouver, Canada, which Liz Evans also helped found.InSite started as a pilot project in 2003 and was the first legal supervised drug injection site in North America.To help manage the opioid crisis in Canada, Health Canada has approved more sites in recent months.Though the centers don't provide any illicit drugs, the medical staff are there to provide first aid, including naloxone for overdoses, addiction counseling and mental health assistance.InSite has seen more than 3 million people since it opened, treated over 6,000 overdoses and not had a single person die.a 35% reduction in overdose deaths from the two and a half years before it opened, compared with a 9% drop in the rest of Vancouver.Although it is unclear the impact of InSite on decreasing the total number of drugs users, it has led to increased admissions for addiction treatment and detoxification.Furthermore, a 2011 Lancet study revealed that in the neighborhoods surrounding InSite, in the two years after it opened, there wasa 35% reduction in overdose deaths from the two and a half years before it opened, compared with a 9% drop in the rest of Vancouver.Although it is unclear the impact of InSite on decreasing the total number of drugs users, it has led to increased admissions for addiction treatment and detoxification.And that also means cleaner communities.Streets and public restrooms aren't littered with needles and other drug paraphernalia.In fact, a recent survey of drug users from an undisclosed safe injection site in the United States found that if they hadn't used the site's facilities, over 90% of the users would be using in public bathrooms or out on the street These statistics are now the subject of dozens of studies in medical journals and were also recited to me as Mata showed me around the Corner Project's bathroom.But he emphasized again, "It's not a safe injection site," he told me.He points out that unlike InSite, the Corner Project doesn't have actual medical professionals monitoring the bathroom.In fact, if a doctor or nurse were to actually supervise its bathrooms, he or she could lose their license.He also doesn't care for the term "consumption room," which has been around in Western Europe since the 1990s.Instead, Mata insists I just call it a bathroom.Because unlike Canada or some countries in Europe, what I witnessed isn't actually legal in the United States.At the front desk, a staff member monitored the clock and the intercom, checking to see whether any help was necessary.Considering the number of lives nearly lost in its bathroom, the mood in the Corner Project was calm and controlled.The soft music, brightly colored walls and chalkboards, and chestnut-colored tables with staff members casually engaged in small talk gave it the feel of a neighborhood coffee shop, more than a place where overdoses are prevented.A self-inflicted wound Mata said my tour needed to be quick because the bathroom is in use almost all the time, and there is a waiting list that often lasts more than an hour.One of the men in line was Taylor Prince, 35.Mata gave him a hug and then told me, "Taylor is a frequent flier."I found out later that Mata saved Prince's life on three occasions.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.We find ourselves in the middle of an opioid epidemic that is the worst drug crisis in American history.It is a self-inflicted wound and one that is predominantly made in America, as we consume more than 80% of the world's supply of opioid pain pills, even though we are less than 5% of the world's population.Many of those prescriptions have led to heroin use; three out of four new heroin users started with prescription narcotics.And there is no single strategy, as provocative or revolutionary as it may be, that is going to be the answer to turning those numbers completely around.Not even a controversial bathroom in the Washington Heights Corner Project could possibly do that, but in the meantime, Mata and others will work on saving as many lives as possible.
This is fentanyl: A visual guide:::::(CNN) Of all the painkillers being used and abused, a single one -- fentanyl -- has been called by public health officials and even members of Congress the "third wave" of the opioid epidemic.It's a synthetic opioid, similar to heroin, but physicians can prescribe it legally.It is most frequently is prescribed for patients dealing with severe chronic pain, but over the past few years, increasing amounts of fentanyl derivatives have been manufactured illicitly and sold on the street.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that of the more than 64,000 US overdose deathslast year from any drug, more than 20,000 were attributed to synthetic opioids, many of them related to fentanyl and its variations.A recent CDC analysis of overdose deaths in 10 states found that fentanyl was involved in 56% of opioid overdose deaths from July 2016 through December 2016.A drug more powerful than heroin Pharmaceutical fentanyl is an opiate drug that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine.It is usually administered to patients in severe pain through injection, a patch or a lozenge.Most of the fentanyl that people are buying on the street isn't diverted from pharmacies or hospitals but rather illegally made in clandestine labs, much of it chemical variations of legal fentanyl.chemical difference between fentanyl and carfentanil is just a few molecules.But the difference in potency is significant: Fentanyl is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine, but carfentanil is up to 10,000 times more powerful than morphine.Carfentanil is used as a tranquilizer for large animals like elephants and has been blamed in fatal drug overdose outbreaks in For example, thechemicaldifference between fentanyl and carfentanil is just a few molecules.But the difference in potency is significant: Fentanyl is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine, but carfentanil is up to 10,000 times more powerful than morphine.Carfentanil is used as a tranquilizer for large animals like elephants and has been blamed in fatal drug overdose outbreaks in Ohio and West Virginia.Illicit drug makers change compositions so that if they are caught with the drug, they technically have a different chemical compound from fentanyl or some other already regulated compound.The idea is to get around the law.So the Drug Enforcement Administration is constantly adding new variations to its list of controlled substances.It's a cat and mouse game.Deadly dose Why add these fentanyl variations into the mix?Because they are so potent that it just a little bit can be cut and mixed into other drugs such as heroin or pills, stretching out the supply.Consider that you can buy about a kilogram of black-market fentanyl or a derivative online for about $8,000.That can be used to cut 1 million pills, and on the street, those pills can bring in a total of $20 million to $30 million.But that potency can also be very deadly.An amount you can't even see can kill you.There's also no real quality control over the final drug.One batch may have fentanyl evenly distributed throughout, while another may have some pills with much higher concentrations of fentanyl than others.Made in China According to US law enforcement, most illicit fentanyl is coming from China, where weak regulations and poor monitoring have created an environment ripe for underground labs to thrive.Illegal fentanyl and the chemicals to make it can be easily bought on the internet.Most are shipped into Mexico, where they are further processed before they are smuggled over the border.Sometimes, these drugs are shipped directly into the US.US Customs and Border Protection agents.In fact, according to the agency, it has had to change its drug testing protocols to prevent accidental overdose from inhalation or absorption through the skin.Of the are actually handling fentanyl.It's a major challenge forUS Customs and Border Protectionagents.In fact, according to the agency, it has had to change its drug testing protocols to prevent accidental overdose from inhalation or absorption through the skin.Of the 328 air, land and sea entry points into the US that the agency oversees, at least 15 locations , including some along the US-Mexico border, now have naloxone, the opioid overdose antidote, in case of accidental overdose.However, not all offices are equipped with the field testing equipment needed to determine whether agentsare actually handlingfentanyl.Special delivery But there's another route that drug smugglers have also found to be effective: the US Postal Service.Some drug dealers are even buying from China directly into the United States.Considering that the Postal Service handles about 154 billion pieces of mail every year, it's the proverbial needle in the haystack.Working with Customs and Border Protection, the Postal Service uses a range of tools, such as dogs, X-rays and an their intrinsic ability to spot something that just seems out of the ordinary.Law enforcement officials say that at the moment, the government can't effectively identify which packages to inspect because so little tracking information accompanies international mail bound for the United States.
Ancient skull may belong to earliest tsunami victim:::::(CNN) An ancient skull dating back more than 6,000 years may have belonged to the earliest known human victim of a tsunami, scientists say.The Aitape skull -- named after a small coastal town in the north of Papua New Guinea, where it was found -- was discovered in 1929 by Australian geologist Paul S. Hossfeld.Since then, archaeologists and anthropologists have been trying to unravel the circumstances that resulted in it ending up there.The most recent study, published Wednesday, suggests the skull may have belonged to a human who drowned in a tsunami or had his or her grave displaced by the tsunami's waves.Tracing ancient shorelines When Gossfield stumbled upon the skull in 1929, he mistakenly believed it belonged to Homo erectus, a prehistoric species of humans originating in Africa.But radiocarbon dating has shown it is, in fact, much younger, dating back 5,000 to 6,000 years.The area around Papua New Guinea is prone to tectonic disturbances, and often affected by natural disasters like tsunamis and earthquakes.More than 3,000 people died in 1998 when a tsunami struck the region near Aitape.Because sea levels were higher thousands of years ago, the remains probably originated from the area behind what would then have been the shoreline.The field team in Aitape, led by Ethan Cochrane and Mark Golitko In 2014, Ethan Cochrane and Mark Golitko led a team of researchers back to the location where Gossfield had found the skull more than 90 years ago."We have now been able to confirm what we have long suspected," said James Goff, the study's lead author."The geological similarities between the sediments at the place where the skull was found and sediments laid down during the 1998 tsunami that hit this same coastline have made us realize that human populations in this area have been affected by these massive inundations for thousands of years."Balancing risk and reward The discovery will help anthropologists understand how people adapt and thrive in coastal areas that are subject to these natural hazards, and why they chose to move into such areas and remain there despite the environmental dangers."It might be because the New Guinea north coast is also very productive at this time in terms of food resources," explained Cochrane, a senior lecturer at the University of Auckland ."So perhaps people are balancing risk and food reward."Understanding these kind of adaptive tradeoffs will be key to mitigating risk and ensuring the livelihoods of coastal populations today," he added.The Papua New Guinea region is vulnerable to techtonic disturbances.A 7.9-magnitude quake struck the area in 2016.The new study, published in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS ONE , adds to a trail of research that has seen contributions by scientists from France, the UK, Australia, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand."If we are right about how this person had died ... we have dramatic proof that living by the sea isn't always a life of beautiful golden sunsets and great surfing conditions," said its co-author John Terrell, Regenstein curator of Pacific anthropology at the Field Museum in Chicago.Terrell, who has conducted extensive research in Papua New Guinea, also noted that the skull might help convince skeptics "that all of us on earth must take climate change and rising sea levels seriously."
After Harvey Weinstein, a focus on online sexual harassment:::::Kelly Wallace is a CNN digital correspondent and editor-at-large.Read her other columns and follow her reports on Twitter.It's been a stunning few weeks of sexual harassment allegations against extremely powerful men.Women, trying to claim some of their own power, responded in droves on social media using the hashtag #MeToo, often sharing stories of when they've been sexually harassed at work.But sexual harassment is not limited to the workplace.Sue Scheff, author of the recently released book "Shame Nation: The Global Epidemic of Online Hate," which includes a foreword by Monica Lewinsky, says that in the digital age, sexual harassment is prevalent online, as well."In 'Shame Nation,' we're giving a voice to the women that have been sexually harassed online," said Scheff, a family Internet safety advocate who was herself the victim of online shaming in 2003."We're letting you know that these people are just as emotionally ... in pain" as women who are sexually harassed by a boss or colleague.Twenty-one percent of women ages 18 to 29 said they have been sexually harassed online, more than twice the number of men in the same age group who say they have experienced it, according to a Pew Research Center survey released in July.The survey found that overall, men are more likely than women to experience any form of online harassment, which includes physical threats and name-calling, but women expressed more concern about it, according to the survey.Seventy-percent of women -- and 83% of women 18 to 29 -- believe online harassment is a major problem, the survey found, versus 54% of men -- and 55% of young men.'Who saw me?'Annmarie Chiarini, a mother of two and a college English professor who was interviewed for "Shame Nation," knows firsthand how painful online sexual harassment can be.When she was going through the worst of it, she says, she was afraid to leave her house."I was at my son's soccer practice, and I was looking around at all the fathers there, and I kept thinking, 'Who saw me?'" said Chiarini, whose revealing photos were posted online without her consent, in an interview."When you are a victim of online harassment, no place is truly safe."Annmarie Chiarini, a victim of revenge porn, now works to help other victims of online sexual harassment.Chiarini's experience began with a Facebook request from an old high school boyfriend in 2009, which ultimately led to a romantic relationship.At some point, her boyfriend started begging her for nude photos."I was never comfortable with it for a lot of reasons, but ... finally I relented," she said, deciding to share some seminude shots with him.The relationship started to deteriorate after she says he became extremely possessive and jealous, wanting to know who she was with at all times and accusing her of cheating, so she decided to end it.But her ex wasn't happy and fired off threats: Either she would take him back, or he would put nude photos of her up for auction on eBay.During a call, she says, he told her he would destroy her and then hung up the phone.The next day, Chiarini said, he followed through on his threat and posted the auction featuring photos of her on eBay.He reposted the photos as quickly as she could request that eBay take them down, she said."The first thing I felt really was just, I was embarrassed.I was just embarrassed.I never, just the thought of my sexuality, my body, my privacy being available to others, that was just awful," she said.She hoped no one would see the pictures, but she would learn that a couple of her students and two of her colleagues saw them."I didn't have time to feel angry at him.I didn't have time to feel betrayed.I was panicked.I just wanted it over.I had no one to turn to for help," she said.She went to the police, who did nothing, she said, telling her that no crime had been committed.At the time, there were no laws in place to protect against this type of online behavior.She remembers the panic of not knowing where to look to make sure the photos hadn't been shared somewhere else and waking up in the middle of the night on a regular basis to scour the Internet."Three a.m. was my witching hour, and for some reason, that's when I would pop awake, and I would have to search Facebook.I would have to search eBay.I would have to google my name.I would have to check all my email accounts," she said.A year later, she learned that an online profile was created using her seminude images and inviting men to come to her home for sex.She reached out to state police and the FBI for help, and she even contemplated suicide."Online abuse is very abstract," she said."It's the thundering footsteps of an invisible pursuer.You hear it.It's there.It's present.It's 24/7.It's nonstop.It comes at you from all angles, but you don't know, I didn't know who it was."The site was viewed 3,000 times before a friend figured out how to help her get the photos removed."I was so lucky.The average victim who is posted is typically on a minimum of a thousand websites," she said."There are close to 4,000 websites dedicated to nonconsensual pornography."After her experiences, she decided to turn her attention to making changes and helped lobby for a new law now in effect in Maryland, making the release of nonconsenual pornographic images a criminal offense."I wanted something on the books that would serve as a deterrent with the message that there are consequences for this behavior.This behavior is unacceptable.If you choose to engage in it, there will be consequences," she said.Many forms of online sexual harassment Online sexual harassment can take many forms, and Scheff provides numerous examples in "Shame Nation."Those include the case of Jessica Valenti, a columnist with The Guardian who writes about feminism.She announced that she was taking a break from Twitter in 2016 after receiving "a rape and death threat" against her 5-year-old daughter.At the time, she wrote, "I am sick of this shit.Sick of saying over and over how scary this is, sick of being told to suck it up."I am sick of this shit.Sick of saying over and over how scary this is, sick of being told to suck it up.Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) July 27, 2016 Scheff also mentions the experience of actress Ashley Judd.The University of Kentucky basketball fan shared via Twitter in March 2015 how she was called a host of sexual and derogatory names after she accused another team of "playing dirty" during the NCAA Tournament.She wrote that when she expressed a "stout" opinion during March Madness, she was called "a whore, c---, threatened with sexual violence."She added, "Not okay.'" When when I express a stout opinion during #MarchMadness I am called a whore, c---, threatened with sexual violence.Not okay.ashley judd (@AshleyJudd) March 15, 2015 In an op-ed for Mic.com, she wrote that what happened to her is the "devastating social norm experienced by millions of girls and women on the Internet.""Online harassers use the slightest excuse (or no excuse at all) to dismember our personhood.My tweet was simply the convenient delivery system for a rage toward women that lurks perpetually.I know this experience is universal."Sue Scheff is the author of "Shame Nation."Scheff was the victim of online shaming in 2003.As an education consultant who worked with families of troubled teens, she was attacked online by what she calls a "disgruntled client" who she says tried to ruin her career and destroyed her emotional well-being."When you are being attacked online, you just go into this deep dark place," Scheff said.The woman started calling her a "crook" and "con artist" and said that she kidnapped kids and exploited families, Scheff said.Trolls started to pile on, and sexual innuendo began, with people posting that they had red panties that belonged to Scheff and asking others to bid on those panties, she said."It was so humiliating.It was horrifying," said Scheff, a mother of two.She didn't take any action until she learned from a psychologist who recommended families to her that they weren't going to see Scheff because of what they found when they googled her name."What happens is, they always keep coming back, and they keep saying, 'Do you realize who you are referring us to?Do you know what Google is saying about her?'" Scheff recounted the psychologist telling her.The implications for her were real: a loss of future clients."If you are being sexually harassed online or if you have any type of shaming online, your employer, your college admissions (officer), anyone, they're not going to take a moment to decide whether it's Internet fact or Internet fiction," she said."They're moving on to that next applicant."Scheff ended up suing the person who attacked her online and won a landmark case in 2006 for Internet defamation.She told her story in the book "Google Bomb: The Untold Story of the $11.3M Verdict That Changed the Way We Use the Internet."She was motivated to write "Shame Nation" after hearing about the tragedies connected to online bullying and harassment, such as the case of Tyler Clementi , a college student who committed suicide after a sexual encounter with a man was streamed online."I remembered that dark place that I felt, that place of hopelessness, that place of 'should I end my life?'which I never would," she said."Being 40-something years old, I had the maturity to know that, you know what, it's going to get better, so this is the importance of a book like 'Shame Nation' to let people know that you can survive it, there are ways to prevent it, and the best part about it is you can overcome it.You redefine your life after you've been shamed."Advice if you've been harassed online Her advice to anyone who has faced online sexual harassment or any other online shaming is to report the harasser to the platform and flag it as abusive.Many women are afraid to report it because they may feel embarrassed or humiliated, or wonder if they brought it on themselves."I mean, I know initially ...I was like, 'Oh, my God.Did I do something wrong?What did I do?'... You're thinking, 'Oh, my God, will the authorities think that this was my fault?'And that is sometimes enough to prevent you from wanting to report it, and that's how this escalates, and this is how men or a perpetrator can get away with it," Scheff said.Samantha Silverberg is a licensed professional counselor who works with Online SOS, a nonprofit that provides confidential and professional support to people experiencing online harassment.In "Shame Nation," she tells Scheff that the most important thing she can do to help victims is make sure that they realize they didn't do anything to deserve it."There's a lot of negative self-talk that comes up with you experiencing something like this.I challenge them with evidence.... People think, 'This only happens to me, and it's something about me,' " Silverberg said.Chiarini, the victim of revenge porn, also encourages people to collect evidence, which includes taking screen shots and printing out everything related to the abuse.She also says they should research the laws in the state where they live and where their perpetrator resides.There are also online resources such as the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative , which has a guide on how to remove photos that were posted against a person's will, and groups like Online SOS, which provides counseling support.Scheff says victims should tell a friend, because they won't be able to tackle this on their own."A lot of people try to go at this alone and I did it.For months, I didn't tell anybody.I felt embarrassed.You feel humiliated but tell a friend."Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter."Definitely, definitely, definitely talk to someone," Chiarini agreed.She said that her therapist was her lifeline and that as she talked to more people about it, she realized she was not alone."Reach out to people.Anybody who's been through this, anybody who works for these nonprofits ... we will stop what we are doing and help you because we know what it's like," she said."People are so afraid to reach out and to share their story."
Beware these Halloween safety ghouls:::::(CNN) Halloween is usually full of fun and adventure -- and candy -- making it a favorite holiday for many.Cloee Cooper, a research analyst in Boston, remembers it that way."You get to dress up as someone else, walk all over town, attend haunted house parties and celebrations at school," she said.But Cooper says that when she was growing up in Mount Shasta, California, her parents had a few rules: "Don't go inside a person's house unless you know them.Don't take unwrapped candies, and I had to be back home by a certain time."Before you hit the sidewalks on Halloween, make sure that your family gets the most out of the day by playing it safe.Cosmetic caution Face paint might seem simple enough, but the national Campaign for Safe Cosmetics released studies in 2009 and 2016 that found toxic chemicals in them."We found lead in nearly 20% of the Halloween face paints tested.Cadmium in nearly 30%," said last year's report, citing research on dozens of products."Lead is strongly associated with learning disabilities and developmental problems.Cadmium is linked to breast, kidney, lung and prostate cancer."The coalition recommends picking costumes that do not require face paint.Colored contact lenses are another Halloween staple, enhancing the scary look.Dr. Thomas Steinemann, clinical spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, recommends buying only lenses that are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration and sold by an FDA-approved vendor."The legal and safe way to wear color lenses is to have a qualified eye care professional measure the dimensions of your eyes, try on the lenses and make sure it fits," he said.Many lenses sold online and in stores are not FDA-approved, he said."Such lenses may be contaminated and can cause terrible infection."Colored lenses should not be worn continuously, as they interfere with oxygen transmission to the cornea.The wearer should know the rules for safe wear and care."If experiencing pain, poor vision or red eye, take the lenses out immediately and consult an ophthalmologist," Steinemann said."The colored lenses have to be disinfected every time it is worn, just like ordinary lenses."Maybe you're considering a wide-eyed, doll-like look.But the FDA has not approved "anime or circle lenses" and warns against buying them.And whether you're buying your costumes or sewing them at home, the FDA recommends flame-retardant materials like polyester or nylon.Consider using flashlights or battery-powered tea lights in carved pumpkins instead of candles or other open flames, said Dr. Elaine B. Josephson, spokeswoman for the American College of Emergency Physicians.Eyes on the road Pedestrian injuries to children are the most common injuries during Halloween, said Dr. Sarah Denny, a member of the American Association of Pediatrics' Council on Injury, Violence and Poison Prevention.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on average, children are up to four times as likely to be hit by a car and killed on Halloween than on any other day of the year.According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 47 people in the US died between 6 p.m. October 31, 2016, and 5:59 a.m. the next day.Almost one-third of the Halloween crash fatalities were pedestrians, compared with 16% on an average day.And from 2012 to 2016, 22% of pedestrian fatalities on Halloween night involved a drunken driver."My advice is to wear glow-in-the-dark necklaces or bracelets, stay on sidewalks, cross streets together using crosswalks and not cross between parked cars," Denny said.The CDC recommends fastening reflective tape to clothing and carrying a flashlight to help motorists spot trick-or-treaters on the road.The American College of Emergency Physicians cautions against ill-fitting clothes and masks that may obstruct vision.Careful with the candy Halloween is incomplete without candy.And with a lot of candy comes a lot of responsibility -- toward teeth.Dr. Mary Hayes, spokeswoman for the American Dental Association and a pediatric dentist, said parents must emphasize to children that they should not end up with cavities and brush their teeth and floss twice a day.She hands out toothbrushes along with treats to encourage children to brush after eating candy."Chocolate is a better treat than sugar candies," she added."It has some oils which are detrimental to the growth of bacteria."That bag full of candy can be tempting, but eating too much at once could also make children sick.Mickey Silverstein, a public school teacher in Wilmette, Illinois, recalled one Halloween when her 6-year-old son, who's now an adult, ate all his treats in one sitting."He threw up a mountain of chocolate," she said."That never happened again."Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter."For the next day, specially in the pediatric population, there is a potential for candy-induced diarrhea from ingesting an unusually large amount of sorbitol-containing candy," Dr. David Toro, an assistant clinical professor of clinical emergency medicine at Indiana University, wrote in an email.Parents should prevent children from eating too much candy, he said.But if they develop diarrhea, he recommends drinking lots of fluids to stay hydrated, such as fruit juice or soup, but not sugary drinks, sports drinks or bottled juice.If the diarrhea is severe, he advises visiting the emergency room.The American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents to carefully inspect candy for signs of tampering and then allocate portions to be eaten in the weeks after Halloween.
Undocumented special-needs girl in federal custody after emergency surgery:::::(CNN) An undocumented 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy was taken into US Customs and Border Protection custody shortly after emergency gallbladder surgery in Texas in a case that advocates say shows the harmful extent of the President's hard line on immigration policies.On Tuesday, Rosa Maria Hernandez and her adult cousin, a US citizen, had to go through an interior Border Patrol checkpoint while in an ambulance to get from Laredo, Texas, to a Corpus Christi hospital for emergency gallbladder surgery, family attorney Leticia Gonzalez said Thursday.Customs and Border Protection runs checkpoints along major thoroughfares leading away from the border in the Southwest, where travelers and vehicles are checked for legal authorization to enter the United States.Border patrol agents determined that Rosa Maria was undocumented and followed the pair to the hospital, where the girl underwent surgery.The agents remained at the hospital until she was discharged into their custody, according to Gonzalez.In a statement, the agency said agents "escorted" the pair to the hospital.Rosa Maria is now in a shelter run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which falls under the Department of Health and Human Services, as is customary with undocumented, unaccompanied minors.The child remains without her parents, and it's unclear when she'll be released or what will happen to her, according to Gonzalez.The family and their supporters characterized the apprehension as cruel and unnecessary, though immigration officials say the procedures were routine enforcement of the nation's immigration laws.10 year old Maria Rosa is at a hospital & @CustomsBorder is right outside her room waiting to deport her Sign&Share https://t.co/IYVjAkF37w pic.twitter.com/bIkRJzYwSa DreamActivist (@DreamAct) October 25, 2017 A child with special needs Rosa Maria came to the United States from Mexico when she was 3 months old.She was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and has the mental capacity of a child half her age, according to her mother, Felipa De La Cruz, who said her daughter doesn't understand what's happening."I told her she was only there because she was recovering and when she was recovered that she could come with me," she said Thursday."I start to think about her, and I want to start crying, and I become desperate."De La Cruz was able to video chat with her daughter in the children's home, but she still doesn't know whether Rosa Maria will ever return home to Laredo.While she was recovering in the hospital, up to four federal agents were stationed outside her open hospital room door, Gonzalez said.The agents did not allow Rosa Maria's cousin to close the door for privacy.After Gonzalez arrived and demanded privacy, citing attorney-client privilege, it was eventually allowed, she said."Anywhere the child went, even within the hospital, for studies to surgery, the agents followed," Gonzalez said.In a statement, Customs and Border Protection said it was committed to enforcing the nation's immigration laws."Due to the juvenile's medical condition, border patrol agents escorted her and her cousin to a Corpus Christi hospital where she could receive appropriate medical care.Per the immigration laws of the United States, once medically cleared she will be processed accordingly.The Mexican Consulate has been advised of the situation by Laredo Sector Border Patrol," the agency said.Health and Human Services said in a statement that it "does not identify individual (unaccompanied alien children) and will not comment on specific cases."Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, lambasted the Trump administration, saying that too many people who pose no threat to national security are being deported.The Department of Homeland Security "claims to be prioritizing its apprehension but Rosa Maria is not a threat to anyone's safety.(Immigration and Customs Enforcement) has the discretion to release Rosa Maria anytime and they are choosing not to do so," the congressman said, though the girl is not in that agency's custody."This is just one story but this administration's immigration policies are affecting families across Texas and across the nation."An Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said the agency had no involvement in this specific case.However, it has a "sensitive location" policy that prohibits routine enforcement arrests in hospitals, schools and churches, but that policy is distinct from Customs and Border Protection's enforcement at checkpoints, where travelers must show documentation.ICE doesn't make arrests at sensitive locations like hospitals, schools, or churches except in the case of a serious public safety threat pic.twitter.com/Yudor4ed7S ICE (@ICEgov) October 26, 2017 A family in distress Rosa Maria remains in Health and Human Services custody, as virtually all undocumented unaccompanied minors are in immigration cases, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said.The child's 85-year-old grandfather -- a legal permanent resident for 45 years -- petitioned Customs and Border Protection for custody of his granddaughter.His request was denied, Gonzalez said.The Office of Refugee Resettlement has procedures for finding sponsors and guardians to whom they can release minors in its custody.The hospital discharge papers indicate that due to Rosa Maria's diminished mental capacity, she needs to be cared for by people she knows and is comfortable with, her attorney said.Typically in these types of cases, the office will find a sponsor for the minor, and then the notice to appear -- which triggers immigration court proceedings -- will be transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement's local Enforcement and Removal Operations field office, the official said.Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.That notice to appear usually comes from Customs and Border Protection once they encounter and process the individual.Enforcement and Removal Operations will file the notice with the immigration court, and a court date will be scheduled to begin removal proceedings.An immigration judge makes the final ruling on whether to provide some sort of relief for the individual or could issue a final removal order, clearing the way for deportation, the official said.JUST WATCHED Meet the guardian to over 800 children Replay More Videos ...

Pharmacist acquitted of murder in 2012 meningitis outbreak:::::Story highlights Pharmacist was cleared of the most serious charges against him Prosecutors says he was callous; defense says he did not commit murder (CNN) A Boston jury found former supervisory pharmacist Glenn Chin not guilty of murder in the deaths of 25 people during a 2012 meningitis outbreak, but convicted him of other charges.Chin, who worked at the New England Compounding Center, or NECC, was convicted Wednesday of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and false labeling.He was acquitted of second-degree murder.Glenn Chin leaves a Boston federal court during his trial.The deaths were allegedly caused by contaminated vials of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate, a steroid manufactured by the compounding pharmacy."Mr. Chin ran NECC's clean room operations with depraved disregard for human lives," said acting US Attorney William D. Weinreb in a statement."As a licensed pharmacist, Mr. Chin took an oath to protect patients, but instead deliberately violated safety regulations, causing the largest public health crisis caused by a pharmaceutical drug in US history."Read More
Pesticides: How 'bout washing them apples?:::::(CNN) Perhaps you run an apple under water for a moment before chomping down.Perhaps you give it a good rub on your shirt, or maybe you don't even remove the sticker before taking a bite.But chances are, that apple was treated with pesticides to protect it from threats like insects and fungi.Pesticides can boost harvests, but some can be toxic to humans in high concentrations, according to the World Health Organization.Fruits and vegetables do get washed before they hit the shelves -- for example, with bleach solutions But some researchers have wondered whether that wash was enough."We want to see whether or not the factory level (of washing) is already effective" at removing pesticides, said Lili He , a food scientist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.On Wednesday, He published a study comparing bleach, tap water and baking soda in removing two pesticide residues: phosmet and thiabendazole.In the new study, baking soda came out on top.The authors say this is because the pesticides degrade faster in baking soda, making them easier to physically remove by washing.She said this could be accomplished by mixing roughly a teaspoon of baking soda into two cups of water, though the measurement "doesn't have to be that strict."Bleach, on other hand, is primarily meant to kill bacteria and other germs that might build up, He said.In He's study, no method was 100% effective in removing pesticides from the apples, which were not taken directly from orchards but rather coated with pesticides in the lab.This is partly because thiabendazole is a "systemic" pesticide, meaning it penetrates below the surface.He's team estimated that 80% of thiabendazole residues were removed by the baking soda solution, versus over 95% of phosmet."The further the pesticides got penetrated in, the harder it was to wash away," He said.Her study did not test any other home cleaning methods, like vinegar, nor did she include the full panoply of pesticide residues that might be found on apples.For this reason, "I wouldn't be too concerned about which is the best way," said Dr. Motoko Mukai , a toxicologist in the Department of Food Science at Cornell University's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences who was not involved in the study.Mukai said different pesticides may degrade -- or not degrade -- in the presence of baking soda or other compounds."It all depends on the chemical properties of the pesticide, so it's not one fit for all," said Mukai, who generally uses tap water alone to wash her fruits and vegetables.She added that research has shown that washing produce is effective at reducing pesticide residues, but there is "not a clear winner."Other types of cooking or food processing, like blanching or juicing, can also lower residue levels.You can also buy organic, Mukai said, but "it's not entirely pesticide-free.I would still wash before consuming it."Another option is peeling fruit, "although that reduces the nutritional content, so that's a tradeoff," Mukai said.Some experts say that pesticide levels are too low to be harmful to humans, while others warn that long-term low-level exposure could still have damaging effects -- particularly on agricultural workers and their kids."Produce has been tested ... to make sure that pesticides are below threshold of what we consider to be toxic to humans," Mukai said.for each pesticide between 1994 and 2015.Of the two pesticides that He tested, the USDA's Pesticide Data Program shows only three presumed violations for thiabendazole and none for phosmet.For the USDA database, over 7,000 samples of apples were testedfor each pesticide between 1994 and 2015.Phosmet is an insecticide, and thiabendazole is an antifungal that can prevent different types of molds and rots.Thiabendazole can also be used in humans to treat parasites such as roundworms, but in much greater doses than might be found on a storebought apple, according to the EPA.Environmental officials have "determined the extremely low levels of those residues are not a food safety risk, and the presence of such residues does not pose a safety concern," according to the USDA."We have pretty good control of pesticide amount," He said."That doesn't ensure that there's no risk at all.""What we really can do is reduce the risk" by washing, she added.Experts say the health benefits of eating fruits and vegetables far outweigh any potential pesticide risk.The FDA recommends washing all produce under running water, even if you don't plan to eat the skin.Firm fruits and veggies, like apples and cucumbers, should be scrubbed with a produce brush before drying with a clean towel, the agency says.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.When it comes to buying organic, the jury is still out as to whether there are solid health benefits.According to one study, "our findings do not indicate that substituting organic ... commodities for conventional forms will lead to any measurable consumer health benefit.As for He, she prefers to play it safe for her two children, ages 3 and 7."For my kids, I'm going to wash longer.Maybe I'll add a little bit of baking soda in there," He said."If it's just me, I'll probably just wash it a few seconds."She did not eat the apples after her experiment.
Missouri college requires students to attend patriotism class:::::(CNN) The College of the Ozarks, a private, Christian college near Branson, Missouri, has a new mandatory course that it unveiled this week called Patriotic Education and Fitness.The school said it's designed to encourage students' understanding of America's heritage, the nation's civic responsibilities, love of country and willingness to defend it."This is about understanding the military.We will require everyone to take the class, and everyone will benefit from their exposure to military science, in and out of the classroom," school president Jerry C. Davis said in a statement ."We have seen a decrease in the understanding of our military and the important role it plays in our democracy.We will do our part to correct this."The four-credit hour course involves more than just reading about America's values or learning basic flag protocol.It also teaches military skills like pistol and rifle marksmanship, map reading and land navigation -- even Army rappelling techniques.
Venezuela: A child's life cut short amid country's crisis:::::(CNN) Deivis Perez didn't say how much pain he was in.His tears and splitting skin spelled it out.The teenager needed dialysis treatments for his failing kidneys.But instead of aid, Deivis contracted a deadly bacterial infection called sepsis at a children's hospital in Venezuela, a nation grappling with severe shortages of medicine and proper equipment amid a wider array of crises.The water that the hospital used for Deivis' dialysis machine wasn't properly kept and filtered, doctors say, allowing bacteria to enter his bloodstream.Deivis lost 22 pounds in his first two months in the hospital after starting his dialysis treatment.An ulcer in his throat made it too painful to eat solid food.A severe outbreak of dark spots covered his upper body, which created a burning sensation.His 14-year-old body shrank to that of a 7- or 8-year old.When CNN met with Deivis and his mother, Sandra Galindez, in late July, he cried and buried his head in his hands."I want everyone to see what's happening with us here.It's not just what you're seeing on TV: the protests, the clashes.We are in the hospital suffering," said Galindez, a single mother with two other young adult children.Galindez gave up her job to take care of Deivis.He couldn't sleep through most nights, so she often got only three to four hours rest at a time.Deivis suffered for three more weeks before dying the night of August 17 after going into respiratory shock.After his death, Galindez was overwhelmed with "sadness, anger, an enormous emptiness in my heart, in my soul.""It really hurts knowing that you bring your son (to the hospital) for one thing, he gets worse from others, then you get him back in a box," she said.Deivis Perez's 14-year-old body shrank to that of younger child.Venezuela is in its own crisis.Skyrocketing inflation has created extreme shortages of food, medicine and other essentials.A political crisis peaked in July when President Nicolas Maduro replaced the opposition-controlled legislature with an entirely new legislature filled only with his supporters.Several governments, including that of the United States, have labeled Maduro's regime a dictatorship.Deivis was one of eight children to die this year just in the dialysis ward at the public children's hospital.Last year, only three children died in the dialysis unit at Hospital de Nios J.M.de los Rios in Caracas.Deivis wasn't the only child infected by the bacterial outbreak in the dialysis unit at this hospital.At least four children died as a direct result of the infection, according to the head of the nephrology unit, Dr. Belen Arteaga.The other four died from complications related to their renal illness.The quality of the care Deivis received is a point of contention between Arteaga and Galindez.Arteaga says that the hospital isolated the infected children and stopped the outbreak's spread and that Deivis' bacterial infection was stabilized.She says the hospital had blood for a transfusion to give him and even had the right catheter.But the hospital didn't have a functioning operating room where the catheter could be replaced.Arteaga noted that Deivis' body didn't respond well to the transfusions he received early in his hospital stay.After his death, Deivis' mother felt "an enormous emptiness in my heart, in my soul."Galindez blames the hospital and Venezuela's health ministry, which oversees public hospitals.She says neither did anything as she alerted hospital staff that Deivis' condition was deteriorating.Venezuela's health ministry did not respond to a request for comment.Arteaga acknowledges that the hospital lacks even the basics: gloves, masks, antibiotics and resources for certain operations, such as replacing a catheter for a blood transfusion.Most of its medicines and supplies come from foreign nongovernmental organizations and foundations.Venezuela's health ministry hasn't responded to many of the hospital's requests for supplies, Arteaga says."If we don't offer everything that they truly need to get better, the mortality rate will undoubtedly go up," she said."We don't even have emergency surgical rooms."Galindez says she found a matching kidney for Deivis last summer.But it was a futile search: Kidney replacements for children haven't happened since April because the hospital doesn't have the resources to perform the operation.Functional filters for dialysis machines are also hard to come by.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Sadly, Deivis' death is one of many in Venezuela's spiraling humanitarian crisis.Malaria cases soared to 240,000 in 2016, a 76% increase over 2015, according to a rare release in May of records from the health ministry.That's telling: Venezuela eradicated malaria in its most populated states by 1961, according to the World Health Organization.Maternal deaths in Venezuela rose 66% last year to 756.Infant deaths shot up to 11,466, a 30% jump.Maduro has both rejected foreign aid and called for medical relief, though the situation on the ground shows no signs of changing.Some outside experts speculate that if the government accepted the aid, it would be acknowledging that it can't solve its crises on its own.What Galindez would say to Maduro after losing her son: "Resolve all the crises in the country -- and if he doesn't feel prepared to do that, then simply hand over power."
The alarming story of a woman who sweats blood from her palms and her face:::::(CNN) Sweating blood from her face and the palms of her hands, a 21-year-old woman was admitted to an Italian hospital.Drs.Roberto Maglie and Marzia Caproni, both dermatologists at the University of Florence, reported the case Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.The patient, whose identity remains anonymous as is customary in case studies, had no signs of scratches or wounds.Her spontaneous bleeding episodes had no obvious trigger and each instance lasted anywhere from one to five minutes and then ended on its own.Sometimes the bleeding occurred while the young woman was sleeping, at other times, while she was exercising or physically active.The patient had endured the condition for three years.Embarrassed by the ghoulishness of her symptoms, the young woman had socially isolated herself and experienced symptoms of major depression, as well as panic disorder.Analysis of her skin where the bleeding had occurred showed nothing unusual.Tests of her blood revealed no coagulation issues or other problems.Maglie did not respond to a request for comment.According to the journal, Maglie and Caproni diagnosed hematohidrosis, a rare disease marked by spontaneous discharge of "blood sweat" through intact skin.The doctors first treated her depression and panic symptoms with an antidepressant, paroxetine, and an anti-anxiety medication, clonazepam.Next, they prescribed propranolol, a beta blocker prescribed to patients with heart conditions, a drug which had been used in similar cases in the past.This treatment reduced her bleeding, but did not end it.Though Duffin did not treat or write about the patient, she explored the history of sweating blood cases and this particular case in an "I believe the case is real," said Dr. Jacalyn Duffin, a retired hematologist, and a medical historian and professor at Queen's University in Ontario.Though Duffin did not treat or write about the patient, she explored the history of sweating blood cases and this particular case in an editorial published this week in the same journal.Skepticism overcome by facts Duffin traced the earliest mention of sweating blood back to Aristotle's writing in the third century B.C.In two instances, the Greek scientist and philosopher described sweat that either looked like, or really was, blood.Reading about "lots of cases all around the world," Duffin said they shared surprising similarities in the way they occurred and how they happened."The more research I did historically, the more I realized these people didn't know each other ... and so they couldn't be inspired by each other," said Duffin.These individual cases, then, could not be attributed to copycat behavior.In the accounts she read, the most common sites for sweating blood were the forehead, scalp, face, eyes and ears."Some of them have had it on their trunk, some on their limbs -- it appears it can be anywhere," said Duffin.Pain or tingling preceded some instances of sweating blood, while several patients experienced headaches or hypertension.Sweating blood is not exclusive to females, but most patients were women."Although it's horrible to look at and horrible to suffer, it seems not to be associated with negative [health] outcomes," said Duffin, adding that none of the patients reported in modern times had died of it.Most patients, like the Italian woman, experience distress.A couple of the patients Duffin read about were infants."I'm not sure that the infants experienced distress, but certainly their parents do," she said."It's terribly embarrassing and when nobody seems to know what causes it, it's very frightening to have it," said Duffin."Doctors are perplexed and yet it's so obvious and scary looking."The medical confusion is not for a lack of trying to understand this condition and its cause.Multiple causes?"In all the cases that were published, the blood was tested and there was no coagulation problem -- including in the case today," said Duffin."Because the first thing you think is, 'Oh, they're a bleeder, they have a bleeding disorder.'There was nothing wrong with their blood, so that implies there's something wrong with their skin."There, too, the evidence was inconclusive.In some cases, blood appears in the sweat ducts, yet the ducts of other patients remain clean of blood.Skin biopsies appear normal.While theories abound, none have been proven, said Duffin.An unrelated case study of sweating blood was reported from Hospital General Universitario de Alicante in Spain."It could be that this phenomenon of having blood appear on your face could have multiple different causes," she said, having speculated herself on the condition's physiological origins.In some cases, she noted, patients have experienced a terrible fright before the bleeding starts."Suddenly your adrenaline goes up and if your adrenaline goes up, maybe it does something to the microvasculature -- your tiny capillaries -- in your skin that causes them to shrink or explode," suggested Duffin.This unproven scenario could be one cause of bleeding skin."Or perhaps it's an inherited fragility of the blood vessels in the skin," said Duffin."Or maybe it's triggered by some chemical we don't know about.""What we learned from the cases I reviewed in the literature, it can spontaneously remit -- in other words it can just vanish with no explanation," said Duffin."It comes with no explanation and it goes with no explanation."This lack of explanation leads others to turn to religion.Christian overtones "A lot of the medical literature that we're familiar with in the West is written through the lens of Christianity," said Duffin.So many of the doctors who write about sweating blood refer to the description of Christ sweating blood before the crucifixion."The religious authors and the medical authors both seem to be citing each other," said Duffin, referring to this as "mutual reinforcement and endorsement."Yet, religion is non-scientific by definition.Perhaps it is this religious aspect that has caused medicine "to steer away from it," Duffin suggested.Whether they are believers or not, religion is something doctors "want to be respectful of and not treat in a cavalier way," she said.She also noted that cases have been reported around the globe, yet this is the first case study appearing in a North American journal.Meanwhile, "blood sweat" is extremely rare.Duffin completed her research by consulting older hematologists yet none had ever seen a case for themselves.She said, "it's not there in the books so it's like it doesn't exist, and that raises the question: How do new diseases ever get recognized?"Overall, the many cases over time convinced Duffin that patients' symptoms were true, unexplained phenomenon.And babies certainly would not be faking it, she said, though when children have unusual, unexplained symptoms, doctors "think the mother is faking it -- doing that to her child."Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter."If somebody knows that it's false and how this falseness can be produced, I would be fascinated to learn," she said.There's enough cases in the scientific literature now that it's really hard to believe all these doctors were duped."There comes a point where you have to say, 'Hmm this looks like something real.'And now it befalls the rest of us to figure out what it might be," she said."I am no longer as skeptical as I was."
CDC recommends new shingles vaccine to replace older one:::::On the heels of Friday's Food and Drug Administration approval of Shingrix , a new vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline for the prevention of shingles, a federal committee of immunization experts voted Wednesday to recommend Shingrix for all Americans 50 and older.Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a painful, itchy rash that develops on one side of the body and can last for two to four weeks.One in three Americans will develop shingles in their lifetime, with the risk increasing to half of adults over 85, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the CDC on vaccine usage, also recommended that adults who received Zostavax, a shingles vaccine made by Merck, be revaccinated with Shingrix.Additionally, the committee expressed its preference for Shingrix over Zostavax.GlaxoSmithKline says Shingrix will be available "shortly."Zostavax was licensed and recommended by the committee in 2006 for people 60 and older, including those who have had an episode of shingles.Until now, it has been the only approved vaccine to protect against the virus.Vaccine differences Vaccines "teach" the body's immune system how to identify and protect itself against a virus or microbe it has not come into contact with.Shingles is caused by a reactivation of the varicella zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox.Zostavax, a live-attenuated vaccine, introduces a weaker (attenuated) version of the varicella zoster virus in order to stimulate the immune system.By comparison, Shingrix is a non-live, subunit vaccine that works by introducing only an essential subunit of the actual microbe.The intention of using part rather than the whole pathogen is to reduce the possibility of the body having an adverse reaction.Zostavax is a single-shot vaccine that is given once.Shingrix is also a one-time-only vaccine, yet two shots are given two months apart.Between 10% and 18% of patients will experience a complication known as postherpetic neuralgia, which causes pain and lasts from three months up to several years, once the shingles rash is gone.Studies presented to the committee show that Zostavax is 51% effective against shingles and 67% effective against postherpetic neuralgia.In contrast, Shingrix is 97% effective against shingles for people between the ages of 50 and 69 and 91% effective for people 70 or older.It is 91% effective against postherpetic neuralgia for people 50 and older.These rates are based on evidence presented to the committee from clinical trials with over 38,000 total participants.Both vaccines wane in effectiveness over time.Zostavax diminishes in effectiveness by 15% to 25% after the first year and shows no significant protection by the ninth year, according to research presented to the committee.Shingrix remained at or above 85% effectiveness up to four years after vaccination; longer-term effectiveness is unknown.Committee considerations About 31% of the US population age 60 and older -- about 20 million people -- has been vaccinated with Zostavax, which is considered high uptake for an adult vaccine, according to the CDC.More than one committee member suggested that familiarity with shingles -- and the serious pain it can cause -- accounts for this unusually high rate of acceptance.There are an estimated 1 million cases of shingles in the nation each year, according to the CDC.Deliberating before the vote, the committee examined the cost-effectiveness of the two vaccines by estimating the total price of each vaccine and the costs when people become ill and compared the relative economic impacts.The committee also considered possible challenges to giving adults two shots of a vaccine instead of only one.Real world data on other two-dose vaccines suggest that some people do not get both doses.With little fuss, the majority of the 15-member committee voted both to recommend Shingrix and revaccination with it.The pre-vote debate became lively, though, when considering whether to prefer Shingrix over Zostavax for the prevention of shingles and related complications."It's not so much a matter of not preferring (Shingrix); it's a matter of not preferring this vaccine at this particular moment in time," said Cynthia Pellegrini, the solo consumer representative on the committee.Though eight members voted in favor of preferring Shingrix, Pellegrini and six others voted against the motion.She would rather the committee "wait a year or two and get a little bit more data about the real-world uptake implications of this vaccine," she said.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Pellegrini admitted that Shringrix has been studied "very extensively" for almost a decade.Though the clinical studies included a large number of participants, she noted that participation rates among ethnic minorities were "quite low."Different population groups, then, might have bad reactions to the vaccine not yet seen by the scientists, she said.Though outvoted on the preference issue, she voted in favor of recommending Shingrix for everyone over 50 and revaccination for those who had received Zostavax.
CDC recommends booster shot for mumps outbreaks:::::(CNN) The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Wednesday to recommend the use of a third "booster" shot of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine during outbreaks of the mumps.Dr. Manisha Patel, a medical officer at the CDC, said a person who received a third dose of the MMR vaccine would have increased protection against mumps compared with someone who had received only two doses.A study at the University of Iowa "demonstrated the effectiveness of the third dose," Patel said.Other data showed that no serious adverse events were reported among more than 14,000 people who had received a third dose during a mumps outbreak.Any of the study participants' side effects were mild, such as a stomachache.An increasing number of outbreaks in recent years prompted the CDC to debate whether a third dose of the vaccine should be recommended, Patel explained.Between January 2016 and June 2017, there have been 150 mumps outbreaks with 9,200 total infections, half of them in university settings."We're actually still hearing reports of outbreaks, and it's unclear at what time at what point these will end," Patel said.The new recommendation "provides a tool for health departments and providers to protect those persons at increased risk during an outbreak."Before the official recommendation, a third dose has been given during outbreaks on a case-by-case basis.For instance, Syracuse University Health Services has offered students a third dose during its ongoing mumps outbreak; as of Monday, there have been 27 confirmed and 48 probable cases of mumps on campus.Mumps typically begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite lasting a few days.Most people will then see salivary glands swell, causing puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw.Third dose recommendation The MMR vaccine is 88% effective when two doses have been given.In people who receive just one shot, the vaccine is less effective.Infectious disease specialist Dr. William Schaffner said the effectiveness of the vaccine "begins to wane slowly over 10 or 15 years."However, people who have been vaccinated "still have partial protection," said Schaffner, who is also a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical School.If you do get the mumps, you will get a milder case than if you had never been vaccinated, he explained.Most recent outbreaks have occurred among vaccinated people, according to Patel.Just before the CDC made its recommendation Wednesday, an advisory committee reviewed data from recent outbreaks, including the number of vaccinated people who became infected.In its deliberations, the panel assessed the impact of a third dose in decreasing the size and duration of outbreaks.The CDC currently recommends that children get their first dose when they are 12 to 15 months old and a second dose at 4 to 6 years.Outbreaks of mumps tend to occur in areas where there is crowding and close contact, according to Patel.Campuses are a typical site for outbreaks because of the sharing of saliva: by coughing, sneezing, kissing and sharing utensils, lipstick or cigarettes.Possible complications The incubation period for mumps ranges from 12 days to 25; symptoms last at least two and usually more than 10 days.Mumps can occasionally cause complications, especially in adults.These include deafness and inflammation of the brain, ovaries, breast tissue or testicles.Since it is caused by a virus, mumps will not respond to antibiotics.Doctors generally recommend bed rest and over-the-counter pain relievers.Most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks, according to the CDC.Before the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, the CDC received reports of 186,000 cases each year.The actual number of cases was probably much higher but not always reported since most doctors considered the mumps a typical childhood disease.Since the development of the vaccine, cases have decreased by more than 99% in the United States.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Each year, the number of mumps cases fluctuates within a range of a couple hundred to a couple thousand, according to Patel.In 2016, the United States experienced the highest number of mumps cases in a decade: more than 6,000, according to CDC preliminary reports.The number of cases is high this year, too.As of October 7, the CDC has received reports of 4,667 total mumps infections in 47 states and the District of Columbia for the year.The third booster shot should be helpful to students at Syracuse University and other places where infections are being passed from person to person."It's one way to help curtail an outbreak," Schaffner said."Although it's not a magic potion."

124 dead, nearly 1,200 infected with plague in Madagascar:::::(CNN) A plague outbreak in Madagascar has infected 1,192 people since August, with 124 deaths, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and Madagascar's National Bureau of Risk Management and Disaster reported on Monday.The majority of cases, 67%, were the pneumonic form of the disease, which can spread from person to person.Plague is caused by infection with the bacterium Yersinia pestis and is typically spread through the bite of infected fleas, frequently carried by rats, causing bubonic plague.Symptoms include painful, swollen lymph nodes, called bubos, as well as fever, chills and coughing.Pneumonic plague is more virulent or damaging and is an advanced form characterized by a severe lung infection that can be transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets such as through coughing or sneezing, for example.The incubation period is short, and an infected person may die within 12 to 24 hours.Both forms can be treated with antibiotics, making early detection a priority.Of Madagascar's 114 districts, 40 have reported cases of pneumonic plague and less than 30% of people who have had contact with cases can be traced, according to the UN office.Those who've been in contact might need treatment themselves and may pose further risk of spreading the infection.Cases have been reported in at least 10 cities, including the the larger, more populated, cities of Antananarivo and Toamasina.People stand back as a council worker sprays disinfectant during the clean-up of the market of Anosibe in the Anosibe district, one of the most unsalubrious districts of Antananarivo.But 780 individuals have been cured of their infection since August 1 and six of the affected districts have not reported new cases for 15 days, the UN report states.Despite the increase in numbers, the trend has been relatively stable, a World Health Organization representative told CNN.Dr. Charlotte Ndiaye, WHO representative in Madagascar, added that about half the deaths are occurring in the community, not health centers, according to government figures, which demonstrates that more work needs to be done to help people understand that treatment is available, and they need to go to health services as quickly as possible.Plague is endemic to Madagascar, with an estimated 400 cases reported there every year, mostly the bubonic variety, but the current outbreak has affected more areas and started earlier than usual.It's also unusual for large urban areas to be affected, as they have been this year, the WHO previously told CNN.The current outbreak began after the death of a man in the central highlands of the country -- a plague-endemic area -- after which the Ministry of Public Health began investigating and tracing his contacts, according to the WHO.The epidemic has garnered national and international control efforts.Eight health centers have been designated by WHO to manage plague cases and alleviate the burden on hospitals and health clinics.Last week the International Federation of Red Cross also announced the deployment of a treatment center in the country.The federation's Secretary General Elhadj As Sy called for global support and launched an emergency appeal for around $5.5 million last week.WHO has also provided the medications to treat up to 5,000 people and protect 100,000 people who may have been in contact with infected individuals.Both organizations have trained and mobilized thousands of volunteers.Protocols are also being proposed for safe burial practices to ensure maximum safety and protection from infection.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Public schools are closed and the government has forbidden public gatherings, according to the Red Cross.The risk of further spread nationally remains very high, WHO stated in its most recent situation report , and risk of regional spread is moderate due to neighboring islands and southern and east African countries.Samples from patients in Seychelles suspected to be ill with pneumonic plague tested negative, the WHO reported Tuesday."The risk of international spread is low, because generally, people with plague are too sick to travel," Ndiaye told CNN in a previous report.She explained WHO is working closely with Madagascar's airport authorities to ensure control measures -- such as temperature checks and medical teams -- are in place at airports and ports to prevent the spread of infection outside the country.
Drug company founder charged with pushing powerful opioid:::::U.S. prosecutors leveled charges Thursday against the billionaire founder of an opioid medication maker that has faced increasing scrutiny from authorities across the country over allegations of pushing prescriptions of powerful painkillers amid a drug epidemic that is claiming thousands of lives each year.The fraud and racketeering case against Insys Therapeutics founder John Kapoor came the same day President Donald Trump declared the opioid crisis a nationwide public health emergency.The case naming Kapoor follows indictments against the company's former CEO and other executives and managers on allegations that they provided kickbacks to doctors to prescribe a potent opioid called Subsys.In the new indictment, Kapoor, 74, of Phoenix, and the other defendants are accused of offering bribes to doctors to write large numbers of prescriptions for the fentanyl-based pain medication that is meant only for cancer patients with severe pain.Most of the people who received prescriptions did not have cancer.It also alleges that they conspired to mislead and defraud insurance providers who were reluctant to approve payment for the drug when it was prescribed for patients without cancer.U.S. prosecutors in Boston brought the case as they vowed to go after problem opioid makers similar to how they target "cartels or a street-level drug dealer.""In the midst of a nationwide opioid epidemic that has reached crisis proportions, Mr. Kapoor and his company stand accused of bribing doctors to overprescribe a potent opioid and committing fraud on insurance companies solely for profit," said Acting U.S. Attorney William D. Weinreb in Boston.A judge set bail at $1 million for Kapoor, saying he must wear electronic monitoring and surrender his passports.Kapoor, who was arrested earlier Thursday, entered court in basketball shorts, tennis shoes and a T-shirt, his long, gray hair disheveled."He is not guilty of these charges, he intends to fight it vigorously," defense attorney Brian T. Kelly said outside court.Kelly is a high-profile Boston lawyer and former federal prosecutor who successfully tried imprisoned gangster James "Whitey" Bugler.Kapoor came to the U.S. from India to get his Ph.D. in medicinal chemistry from the University of Buffalo, where the pharmacy school is named for him and his wife to honor their longtime philanthropy.Kapoor, whose worth Forbes estimated at $1.75 billion, also founded a company that operates seven restaurants including the Japanese eatery Roka Aker in Scottsdale.In Massachusetts, former Insys CEO Michael L. Babich and five other former executives and managers are set to go to trial in October 2018 and have pleaded not guilty.The latest indictment brings new charges against Babich and others.Several former Insys employees and health care providers have pleaded guilty to felony charges around the country, including in Alabama and Connecticut.A Rhode Island doctor pleaded guilty Wednesday to accepting kickbacks in return for prescribing the highly addictive fentanyl spray.A spokesman for Arizona-based Insys said this week that the company is under new management and has replaced nearly all its original sales staff.It says it takes responsibility for the actions of its former employees."We have taken necessary and appropriate steps to prevent past mistakes from happening in the future, and are committed to conducting business according to high ethical standards and the interests of patients," the company said in a statement Wednesday."We also continue to work with relevant authorities to resolve issues related to the misdeeds of former employees."Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri said evidence from a congressional probe she launched this year suggested that Insys had "gotten away with fines that amounted to a slap on the wrist for actions that helped fuel a nationwide epidemic that's claimed hundreds of thousands of American lives."Kapoor was named the drugmaker's president and CEO in November 2015 after Babich resigned without explanation.Federal authorities apparently have been investigating the company for some time.In late 2013, Insys said it received a subpoena from the Department of Health and Human Services asking for documents tied to the commercialization of Subsys.Nearly a year later, it received a subpoena from U.S. prosecutors in Boston for documents connected with sales and marketing practices for the drug.In addition to the criminal charges, states have been suing Insys over its marketing practices.Meanwhile, the company has been active in politics, donating $500,000 last year to an Arizona campaign to defeat a ballot measure to legalize marijuana.The company's stock price has taken a big tumble in recent months amid the legal issues.Insys stock plunged more than 20 percent Thursday.Associated Press writers Jacques Billeaud in Phoenix and Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey contributed to this report.
AP Exclusive: Doctors clash over euthanasia for mentally ill:::::After struggling with mental illness for years, Cornelia Geerts was so desperate to die that she asked her psychiatrist to kill her.Her sister worried that Geerts' judgment was compromised.The 59-year-old was taking more than 20 pills a day, including antidepressants, an opioid, a tranquilizer, and two medicines often used to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.But about a year later, on October 7, 2014, Geerts received a lethal dose of drugs from her doctor."I know it was Cornelia's wish, but I said to the psychiatrist that it was a shame that someone in treatment for years could just be brought to the other side with a simple injection," said her sister, Adriana Geerts, who believes society should try harder to accommodate the mentally ill. Cases like Geerts' reveal how difficult it can be to navigate the boundary between individual freedom and protecting vulnerable patients when it comes to euthanasia.According to confidential documents obtained by the Associated Press, such cases have fueled a clash between leading euthanasia practitioners that suggests doctors may have failed to meet certain legal requirements in some euthanasia cases although there is no implication that patients were killed improperly.Aside from Belgium, euthanasia is also legal in Canada, Colombia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.Only Belgium and the Netherlands allow it for people with mental illness.In most cases, euthanasia is performed on people with a fatal illness like cancer who have only weeks to live.Euthanasia is not permitted in the U.S., but six states and Washington D.C. allow assisted suicide, where doctors provide people with a deadly dose of medication.People must be terminally ill and the procedure is forbidden for psychological suffering."I always regret that we couldn't do something else," said Dr. Lieve Thienpont, one of the psychiatrists who signed off on Geerts' death."At the same time, I'm part of the relief for the patient."Like many in Belgium, Thienpont believes that when modern medicine can't relieve pain, euthanasia when doctors actively kill patients should be an option.But Thienpont appears more inclined than most to approve euthanasia, some colleagues say.According to figures that she has published, some doctors believe Thienpont and colleagues at her clinic may have been responsible for up to 40 percent of euthanasia deaths among psychiatric patients in Belgium from 2007 to 2011.Of the approximately 2,000 euthanasia deaths every year, about 40 are psychiatric patients.The way she manages her euthanasia requests led to a rift earlier this year with Dr. Wim Distelmans, chairman of Belgium's euthanasia review commission.Internal correspondence provided to the AP show Distelmans and his fellow practitioners said they were being used as a rubber stamp to approve patients referred by Thienpont.Belgium requires that people seeking euthanasia for psychiatric reasons get an independent consultation from at least two other doctors.The doctors don't have to agree; the law only says that the objective assessments must be sought."We found several times that you had already made promises to patients that were referred to us," Distelmans and colleagues wrote, complaining that such "promises" undermined their own attempts to engage with patients and determine if euthanasia was justifiable."We want to distance ourselves from this way of working," Distelmans wrote, adding they would no longer accept patients from Thienpont.Thienpont said the letter raised problems only about how patients were referred, not how she and colleagues were practicing euthanasia.She also blamed the patients for not describing events accurately."These patients are very desperate, stressed," she said."They say things that are not always correct."Some experts said the split between Thienpont and Distelmans raises alarms about euthanasia in Belgium, especially since the dispute has not been publicly disclosed by the commission overseeing it."That suggests some cases of euthanasia have proceeded that have not met the statutory, legal requirements," said Penney Lewis, co-director of the Centre of Medical Law and Ethics at King's College London."The idea that this is happening behind closed doors is very worrying."Distelmans did not respond to repeated requests for an interview.Mental health experts say balancing the finality of euthanasia with the transient nature of many psychiatric illnesses is extraordinarily difficult."I'm convinced that in Belgium, people have died where there were still treatment options and where there was still a chance for years and even decades of (quality) life," said Dr. Joris Vandenberghe, a psychiatrist at the University of Leuven, who is working on new euthanasia guidance for the Flemish Psychiatric Association.Some patients, though, say that euthanasia can save lives.Amy De Schutter, who endured years of failed treatment at psychiatric institutions, spent months deliberating the best way to kill herself.She had already picked the day of her suicide, but one month before her intended death last year, she was approved for euthanasia."It felt like 10,000 kilos was just (lifted)," De Schutter said.Being cleared to legally die at home was comforting enough that De Schutter didn't set an immediate date for euthanasia.But for some bereaved relatives, the loss of their loved one is compounded by a belief that doctors should have focused on keeping patients alive."I think if the doctors had tried to help (my sister) more or proposed other things, she might have felt there was another solution," said Adriana Geerts, who accompanied her sister to the euthanasia clinic despite her own misgivings."I wish there had been another way," Geerts said.

epidemic."She said she has been participating in meetings and listening sessions.She acknowledged the audience, which included parents whose children died and people who have struggled with addiction.The first lady says: "We are here today because of your courage."1 p.m. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says her reaction to President Donald Trump's declaration of an opioids emergency is: "Show me the money."The California Democrat told reporters Thursday that Trump has proposed cuts in programs aimed at opioids abuse like Medicaid.She says everyone agrees Congress must pay attention to the problem, but adds that the president's statements are "words without the money."Trump was planning an afternoon speech to announce his action.White House officials said Trump's

some advocates worry even that won't make enough difference.
Walgreens to offer drug naloxone, which can reverse opioid overdoses:::::In more than 8,000 pharmacies across the U.S., anyone will now be able to walk in and buy the most successful emergency overdose treatment available.Interested in Opioid Epidemic?Add Opioid Epidemic as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Opioid Epidemic news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The Walgreens chain will carry a form of naloxone, a drug that can quickly reverse opioid overdoses, the company announced Tuesday.Known commercially as Narcan, the drug is administered through a nasal spray and is an FDA-approved form of naxolone.Drew Angerer/Getty Images This is an incredibly safe and effective medication, ABC News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton said today on Good Morning America.Weve been using it in the hospital for decades, usually with a needle, intravenous or in a muscle.Narcan works to counteract respiratory depression, in which a large dose of opioid stops the bodys signals to continue breathing.Overdoses from prescription painkillers, heroin and its derivatives cause this frequent cause of overdose death.AmerisourceBergen, a pharmaceutical wholesaler, has distributed Narcan demonstration devices for free to Walgreens pharmacists so they can instruct patients on how to administer the medication, Walgreens said in a statement.Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The drug will be available to patients and caregivers without a prescription in 45 states.Walgreens said it is "eager and willing" to work with more states to make naloxone easier to obtain.As a pharmacy we are committed to making Narcan more accessible in the communities we serve, the statement added.Ashton spoke about the risks and benefits of making Narcan so widely available.I think the risk here," she said, "is that people could say, Will this give people a false sense of security and have them use opioids more if they know that they can use this immediate antidote?But the benefits of making Narcan available on a wider basis, Ashton said, are incredibly important.This drug saves lives," she said."Think of this maybe as defibrillator, EpiPen, another piece of lifesaving medical equipment that probably is going to be pretty widespread now.The announcement that Walgreens will carry naloxone comes as experts agree the opioid epidemic has become a critical emergency on a national scale.Tom Kelley/Getty Images In Connecticut, the Milford School District is making Narcan available in all of its 14 public schools, including eight elementary schools, a district spokeswoman told ABC News.President Donald Trump has called the opioid crisis a "national emergency" and said he will officially declare it as such.Two months after his inauguration, he signed an Executive Order launching a commission to explore ways to curb opioid abuse and overdoses, led by New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie.The number of overdose deaths involving opioids has quadrupled since 1999, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC).The agency reported that 91 Americans die every day from an opioid overdoses.Ashton said the move by Walgreens shows the U.S. is in a "critical and unstable condition" battling the opioid crisis."We have to tackle this at the prescriber level, at the dispensing level and at the user level, and thats what this is," she said.
New guidelines to help prevent peanut allergies Video:::::Transcript for New guidelines to help prevent peanut allergies ???Time for the download.The soaring statistics on peanut allergies, researchers from the American college of allergy, asthma and immunology found that peanut allergies in American kids increase 21% in the last 7 years.Here's with what you need is Dr. Tania Elliott, chief medical officer at ehe.Tania, happy to have you.What is going on that we're seeing this huge rise in peanuts?We were discussing in the break I don't think cave men were allergic to peanuts, why now.Parents were told not to into inthose deuce them to kids until they're over 2 then the immune system is exposed to something brand-new, it says, oh, ply gosh, this is something foreign and develops an allergic response.We should introduce peanuts early and then we would avoid the problem.A stud DI was done with kids that were at high risk for developing peanut allergies so half of them were introduced to it very early on then the other half of it were introduced in the delayed response at 2 and up.The kids introduced to it after the age of 2, 17% of them developed peanut allergies.The ones introduced early on only 2%.What do the guidelines say.They support early introduction of peanut into the diet.With Halloween coming up a time when a lot worry about peanut allergies what can we do around Halloween?Yeah, so Halloween could be scary for kids with peanut allergies.Really important to read labels.I say when in doubt, throw it out.And always carry your epipen with you at all time.Dr. Tania Elliott with really useful advice.You may have saved some lives this morning.Great to meet you.Thanks for coming on.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

he and his belief itself shifts biology that intelligence giving us life it is degrees Koehler and world.Symptoms are brilliantly intelligent and waking.Doesn't matter how long even six you can he'll always remember that in never forget it.We are here with the director that documentary Kelly needing course the talk about.How you came up with the idea to do this.Documentary what took you on that journey all the things just start with at the beginning attack how did you even decide that you wouldn't do this.It just all of all the people the documentary had empowered me in my life.You know a different phases of my life and I think that.You know I didn't go on.Healing journey with.A diagnosis a lot of people ask me when you sick without a motivated you do this but actually.I just average and I would hear read a book by one of these experts.About what's possible with the human body your our how our mind.Scientifically.You know affects the chemistry of our body our thoughts emotions or beliefs.I thought oh my gosh everybody needs to know this has its own powering.We we are victims.You know our jeans at the genetics says that we are lifestyle choices and our beliefs and our motions actually.In form what genes are expressed so.I just thought it was so much empowering information at a time when so many people are suffering.Like.Almost 50% that the country is dealing with a chronic illness and I thought that the information it's the time is mounted just.Make people aware of what the human body is capable and how we can participate in the healing will.When you talk about here and I think that's sort you know new world thinking aching and like a little hippie Dick be what's the response been.And and talk a little bit about sort of how you do make this Warner.Opened for every once and a understand.Wrecked yes.It yet he might be perceived as being Lulu and new AG but I really you know a lot of people in the film are actual.Scientific researchers so Bruce Lipton Kelly turner.David Hamilton is organic chemists that used to work for the pharmaceutical industries so.A lot of this is science fact and I wanna to.Present.A balance.You know kind of case for the mind body connection and and and show the scientific research behind how our thoughts affect the chemistry of our body you know stress.It's kind of a good example.The way we perceive life and that's you know whether it's emotional Strasser.Or toxins and chemical stress all of that has you know and detrimental affect on our body.So.I it tried to make it a blend you know the science behind spears it's.What's the benefit in having people take away away when he think you want people to remember one name walkway seeing.Couple different things it's meant to.Give like.Inspired people to take their health back into their hands and not be a victim of the diagnosis.To look at your condition in these symptoms as a conversation.Feedback from your body saying that something is out of balance and if you want to Healy need to get to the root cause you don't want to just take a pill to silence a symptom.And this is not a anti western medicine documentary it's actually saying you know western medicine were so grateful to have what.Amazing technology and advancements in west medicine and drugs and surgery.But we should really.You know.Use those in an acute illness and in emergencies.And to get us over the hump you know take a pill to get you through the pain and tell you can.Find out what the root causes a you can you know.Figure out what's it is to regain balance as they did everything in collaboration together not just.Western medicine not just eastern Madison correct an eastern medicine it's these.Ancient wisdom that's you know been applied and successful for.Thousands of years when it's using herbs there.You know food or energy medicine or sound healing all of these modalities have been around an effective for thousands of years.So act you know we are energy where were made by operational you know.Everything is made up vanity so.You know.User western medicine go to your doctor get the diagnosis.But then you know don't fall prey to a prognosis don't let a doctor tell you what's possible for you here.Life and healing based on.Statistics because everyone is unique.And actor gonna take a western course of treatment support at and enhance it by you know doing mental emotional and here to work those happen.Scientists shown us.You know benefits under buys well seems like common sense kind things to think about it and but most people out there you know we're just kind of hypnotized to believe that you know.Our bodies are failing us and we just have to you know.But there's there's ways that we can boost immune system through positive thoughts and healing emotional trauma island and also expect that you mentioned the science behind this idea of a whenever you thinking your brain actually had some sort of reaction in your body.What it what is considered when you think something you have it as something else happens negatively positively what.Connection her act and they do they show some research in the film.Wouldn't they let that be to heart and HRT monitor their when people are meditating they're measuring and there their heart rate and that.They show that when your writing your mind getting to that he's a place like you're releasing.You know all sorts of healing chemical toxin Towson to open in all of these positive chemical also can meditation.Also through when you're feeling gratitude.And loved it measured but that's also releasing pots of healing chemicals on the other side.They've found that if you're feeling frustration jealousy rage they can measure that you're releasing stress hormones in July cortisol adrenaline.Northern on all of these things and that suppresses your immune system.The more stressed we are which you know the perception of life.One thing's gonna stress someone out that doesn't stress and others not to talk.Perception interpretation.That is sending signals through your nervous system to your cells.To turn on and off jeans and also release either harm.All our helpful.To basically think path.I have signed up like the more positive you can think the better.It is but that scenes so super and you know and like.But you know we talk in the film it's.They.Judges spends as talks about you when you get a diagnosis you've healed the year.Or sadness.And so you can think positively all you want Michael that the best thing.But if you're feeling fear.You know it's not gonna that the positive thinking knock and it translate that here's an.Eat the thing that's putting in the stress and when you're in the stress reaction when you're in the sympathetic nervous system.You're mean system's not working now.So.You're either in Reston repair or in fighter flight so.The problem is a lot of people are stressed all the time and and I just make people aware of how that.Is affecting your immune systems so when you need to heal you really need to act.Look at the stresses in life you know need to do all of these things to help your body.Get into the person that services them in Reston repairman.So

Study sheds light on youth football head hits Video:::::Transcript for Study sheds light on youth football head hits alert now.It's actually a very troubling new report on youth football and details the force of those hits which players -- which players are most at risk.The game may be pee-wee, but the hits can be major.And this morning, a new study released overnight is warning just how dangerously hard those impacts can be in youth football.When this study focuses on is where that exposure to head impact occurs.Reporter: Researchers at Virginia tech followed 45 youth football players ages 9 to 12 attaching sensors though their helmets to measure how much force is hitting them.Hits considered high magnitude are ones that strike with 40 times the force of gravity or more.Researchers found that of the more than 7,500 hits youth players in the study experienced, 8% of them were high magnitude and found that those most dangerous hits were most likely experienced by players in positions like quarterback, running back and linebacker and that players also experienced greater high magnitude head impacts while playing in an actual game as opposed to practices.Understanding head impact exposures is an important part in reducing the incidence of concussion so if we identify high-risk situation we can make recommendations that maybe that shouldn't be part of youth football.Reporter: 44 million kids play youth sports in the U.S. With concussions for those under 18 hitting as high as 1.9 million.Then senior quarterback Brett Kramer falling victim to that staggering statistic.My head was ringing.Reporter: Researchers say they hope the study brings a better understanding of what causes concussions in kids to help prevent injury and to eliminate certain drills and plays that increase risk to young players.Well, there's still a lot to learn.This study was small.We only looked at two teams and every team is different so you need a study youth football across the U.S. To understand where these impacts are coming from.Reporter: Again, just to give everyone an example, in that report we talked about helmet sensors measuring a hit at 40g or 40 types the force of graph T the author said in the study that force of impact is equal to the hardest amount of force someone can take from a car crash and still be able to walk away without any physical injuries but it's so alarming and as you heard more studies need to happen.Whoo.Got to be careful.Okay.Amy, thanks very much.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
Opioid epidemic shares chilling similarities with the past:::::While declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency Thursday, President Donald Trump said: "Nobody has seen anything like what's going on now."He was right, and he was wrong.Yes, this is the most widespread and deadly drug crisis in the nation's history.But there has been a long string of other such epidemics, each sharing chilling similarities with today's unfolding tragedy.There was an outbreak after the Civil War when soldiers and others became addicted to a new pharmaceutical called morphine, one of the first of many man-made opioids.There was another in the early 1900s after a different drug was developed to help "cure" morphine addiction.It was called heroin.Cocaine was also developed by drugmakers and sold to help morphine addiction.It cleared nasal passages, too, and became the official remedy of the Hay Fever Association.In 1910, President William H. Taft told Congress that cocaine was the most serious drug problem the nation had ever faced.Over the next century, abuse outbreaks of cocaine, heroin, and other drugs like methamphetamine, marketed as a diet drug, would emerge and then fall back."There are one or two or three wolves ahead of the pack that seem to be the most pressing threat, their jaws closest to you," said David Courtwright, a University of North Florida historian who has written books on U.S. drug epidemics."But there's always a pack.The history is that the lead wolves keep shifting."Trump vowed in his recent remarks "we will free our nation from the terrible affliction of drug abuse."But the grim reality is that these drugs never disappear completely once they've emerged.The good news, though, is that drug epidemics do fade considerably usually because reduced supply and demand eventually diminish the number of new addictions, experts say.And that history offers some hope for the future.THE 1800s: BETTER AND MORE DANGEROUS MEDICINES Most U.S. drug epidemics over the past two centuries were sparked by pharmaceutical companies and physicians pushing products that gradually proved to be addictive and dangerous.In the 1800s the drug was often opium, usually sold as a liquid in products like laudanum, and given to patients for pain or trouble sleeping.Mary Todd Lincoln, President Lincoln's wife, took it for headaches and became addicted.The drug was also used to get high."Opium fiends" smoked it in opium dens like those in San Francisco's Chinatown.Rev.Frederick Masters, a 19th century Methodist missionary, described opium dens in that city as dark, fumy basements "sepulcher-like in their silence save for the sputtering of opium pipes or the heavy breathing of their sleeping victims."The young nation's drug problem grew because of morphine, a painkiller derived from opium through a chemical process that was perfected by E. Merck & Company of Germany.It made battlefield injuries more bearable for Civil War soldiers, but so many veterans got hooked that morphine addiction was sometimes called "the army disease."It would get worse.Cocaine and heroin were soon developed in part to help morphine addiction.Merck introduced cocaine, which became a prime ingredient in a variety of over-the-counter tonics for sinus problems and other ailments.Because of its energizing effects, beverage makers put it in their wines and sodas and laborers in the South sniffed it to get through grueling work shifts.Bayer, another German pharmaceutical company, began marketing heroin in the 1890s.It often came in pill form, without prescription, and was used to treat the flu and respiratory ailments.But it came to be sniffed and later injected by those looking for a more intense high or a substitute for other drugs, whether it was morphine in 1905 or opioid pain pills like Vicodin in 2015.THE EARLY 1900S: FROM CURE TO CURSE In the early 1900s cocaine shifted from a consumer fad into reviled epidemic, as physicians began documenting addiction problems and police chiefs linked recreational cocaine use to prostitution and violent crime.It led to the first national effort to contain a drug epidemic: In 1914, Congress passed the Harrison Act, which said cocaine and heroin could be sold only as a prescription medicine, not in over-the-counter remedies or in consumer products.Historians believe a growing stigma attached to cocaine use was the main reason the epidemic declined, but they say enforcement of the Harrison Act and its impact on prices also was important.Cocaine and heroin got much more expensive when they were driven underground.Drugs were still abused in the later years in pockets of society cocaine use was rampant in Hollywood in the 1920s, for example.But economics and politics helped prevent large-scale epidemics for a time.The Great Depression meant few had the disposable income for an illicit drug habit, and World War II decimated the supply of drugs from overseas."There's no customs patrol more efficient than a U-boat," said Courtwright, the University of North Florida historian.MID- 20TH CENTURY: THE FIRST WAR ON DRUGS Alcohol and cigarettes were and remain the nation's primary addictions.Both kill far more people than drugs.But since the middle of the century, there's been wave after wave of other drug abuse outbreaks.Amphetamines, developed in the 1930s, took off in the 1950s.Marketed by drug companies and promoted by doctors, they were used for weight loss, anxiety and depression.Methamphetamine, developed by the Burroughs Wellcome drug company, was often prescribed as a diet pill and abused by those attracted by the surge of energy it produced.Users who injected it were known as "speed freaks.""The speed freak is, in many ways, an outcast in a society of outcasts.He is regarded as a fool by heroin addicts, as insane and violent by those using psychedelics and marijuana, and a 'bust' by non-drug using hustlers," wrote Dr. Roger Smith, a criminologist who studied drug use in San Francisco in the late 1960s.Greater regulation of the drugs in 1970, along with the stigma attached to speed freaks, caused the drugs to recede as others became more widely used.In the 1960s and 1970s, heroin use surged, prompted in part by Vietnam War soldiers who were exposed to it while fighting overseas.Unlike the doctor-driven previous drug epidemics, this one victimized poor inner-city neighborhoods most.In 1970 and 1971, in New York City, more adolescents, many of them black and Puerto Rican, died of heroin-related incidents than any other cause.There was little compassion then for heroin addicts, recalled John de Miranda, a longtime addiction professional who worked with homeless men in Boston's South End in the early 1970s."We basically cared for the men nobody else wanted to deal with," he said.President Richard Nixon's 1971 "war on drugs" declaration kicked off a long period of attacking the drug problem with beefed up law enforcement and tougher sentences for users and dealers.The approach did cut down foreign shipments of heroin and marijuana, but those successes were temporary and many historians argue Nixon's war ultimately was a losing effort.LATE 20TH CENTURY: COCAINE ON HIGH Heroin use faded in the late '70s, but cocaine was on its way back, first in powder form and then becoming an epidemic of crack in the 1980s when a supply glut prompted dealers to sell hardened cocaine rocks that sold for $5 to $10 on the street.Many young thrill-seekers, wary of heroin and needles, thought crack was less dangerous because it was smoked like marijuana.Like the heroin surge before it, crack was seen as tied to urban blight and violent crime.This triggered a new drug war, including the "this is your brain on drugs" TV spots that showed frying eggs, and harsh jail sentences for the sale and possession of crack that were far more severe than the penalties for regular cocaine.The crack epidemic died out in the 1990s, tailing off at roughly the same time both in cities that aggressively arrested people and cities that didn't.Experts said the police crackdown contributed, but more important was society's growing repulsion to the drugs.Families and communities were shattered by crack-related murders and arrests.The drug's users came to be regarded as disgraceful "crackheads."Even risk-taking kids, looking for new highs, started to avoid crack.TODAY'S OPIOID EPIDEMIC In 1900, when cocaine and heroin were legal and popular, there were 250,000 Americans with a drug addiction, according to one historical estimate.That was about 1 in 300 Americans.The estimate today is 1 in 133, and the drugs are deadlier than ever."In all my years I've worked in the substance abuse field, I've never had so many patients die," said Joan Hartman, vice president of behavioral health services for Illinois-based Chestnut Health Systems, who has been working in treatment for three decades.There were fewer than 3,000 overdose deaths in 1970, when a heroin epidemic was raging in U.S. cities.There were fewer than 5,000 recorded in 1988, around the height of the crack epidemic.More than 64,000 Americans died from drug overdoses last year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.This epidemic started around 1995, kicked off by a drug called OxyContin, which like heroin and morphine before it, was meant to be a safer and more effective opioid.OxyContin and competitor drugs were designed to release the medication slowly over long periods of time, making them and supposedly safe and effective enough to use for months to treat chronic pain.But patients found themselves hooked and wanting more, and drug abusers found they could crush the tablets and snort or inject them, delivering the drug to the bloodstream much more quickly.Aggressive marketing and distribution pushed hundreds of millions of pills into communities.Then more and more addicts turned to cheaper alternatives, bought illegally, like heroin and fentanyl, an opioid medication developed to treat intense, end-of-life pain in cancer patients that is 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine."It's a very complex epidemic" that is nowhere close to being over, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's principal deputy director, in an interview earlier this year.LESSONS OF THE PAST What has worked for previous epidemics?The supply is often reduced by a combination of regulations, law enforcement and economics.And historians say that demand slows when drug users became so outcast that even those looking for a risky thrill or a way to escape began to stay away.Past epidemics have also shown what doesn't work.Many experts, including some in law enforcement, say that arresting users and dealers does not seem to slow epidemics."We cannot arrest our way out of the heroin and opioid addiction crisis," said Brian Moran, Virginia's secretary of public safety and homeland security, speaking at a federal hearing in July.But while health experts want to urge people to shun drugs to reduce the number of new addictions, they say ostracizing the people already suffering from addiction does little to help them.It may even impede attempts to get people into treatment, Hartman said.Health officials are fighting the current epidemic on three fronts: Preventing overdose deaths, helping people recover from addiction, and preventing new addictions.There appears to be some success on the first front.The number of new addictions may be receding.A recent federal report noted a downward trend in "opioid misuse" in adults younger than 50.Prescription rates are falling, though they remain far higher than years ago.And according to a closely watched University of Michigan study of adolescents, use of the opioids OxyContin and Vicodin has been low and falling for several years.In 2016, heroin use was the lowest in the survey's 41-year history."I suspect we may be past the peak (of the epidemic), at least in terms of initiation," said Jonathan Caulkins, a drug policy scholar at Carnegie Mellon University.The other two fronts preventing deaths and treating addiction are not so promising, despite more attention and money flowing to programs.Deaths are still rising, and University of Pittsburgh researchers estimate as many as 300,000 will die from overdoses over the next five years."Honestly, we're at a point where the horses are out of the barn after the gate has closed," said Dan Werb, an expert at the University of California, San Diego."I'm not optimistic about the capacity of our classic approaches to rein this in."
Prosecutors: US conspiracy came amid slow sales of opioid:::::A new mouth spray that delivered the powerful painkiller fentanyl to end-stage cancer patients wasn't selling as well as anticipated.So drug company executives moved quickly to make its production worthwhile.U.S. court records in the case against an immigrant billionaire who is one of Arizona's wealthiest men describe the daunting market challenges that Insys Therapeutics founder John N. Kapoor and fellow executives faced after launching the opioid medication Subsys in 2012.The highly addictive drug was going to cost a cancer patient up to thousands of dollars a month to control intolerable levels of pain.It could only be prescribed by a medical practitioner registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration, and it was among several cancer pain medicines already available.Five years later, Subsys is at the heart of the case against Insys Therapeutics executives, including Kapoor, 74, of Phoenix, who is charged with leading a nationwide conspiracy to bribe doctors and pharmacists to widely prescribe the potent painkiller to people who didn't need it.Defense attorney Brian T. Kelly, a high-profile Boston lawyer, has said Kapoor is not guilty.It comes amid an opioid epidemic that claims thousands of lives each year and led President Donald Trump to declare a nationwide public health emergency.The case is just the latest example of how profits have become more important than health for many U.S. pharmaceutical firms, New Jersey-based health care analyst Steve Brozak said Friday.The aggressive market tactics that federal prosecutors described at Insys have become acceptable, said Brozak of WWB Securities, a health care research firm that tracks companies in the sector."The only reason (Kapoor) was put in handcuffs and did the perp walk is because the marketing involved an opioid," he said."This is an example of a greater addiction, not to opioids, but to big sales.The opioid crisis is the logical extension of the earnings demand."To make Subsys more profitable, Insys executives turned to aggressive marketing tactics, such as bribes and kickbacks that included "speaker fees and honoraria for marketing events, food and entertainment" for doctors and pharmacists who prescribed the drug, according to an updated federal fraud and racketeering indictment in the ongoing case.The new charges were filed this week in Massachusetts.In exchange, the practitioners are accused of writing large numbers of prescriptions for patients, most of whom were not diagnosed with cancer.Prosecutors say the scam stretched across the U.S., involving pharmacies and pain management clinics and practitioners from Saginaw, Michigan, to southwest Florida and Laredo, Texas.Federal prosecutors in Boston first brought the case against six Insys executives and managers, including former CEO Michael L. Babich, who are set to go to trial next year and have pleaded not guilty.The updated indictment unsealed this week brings new charges against them and alleges Kapoor and the others provided kickbacks to doctors and conspired to defraud insurance providers.The court records describe events that encouraged sales representatives to push practitioners to prescribe ever higher doses of the fentanyl spray.A video at one event purportedly showed company employees dancing, rapping and singing with a life-size bottle of the highest dosage of the spray, suggesting that increased amounts were "not a problem!"To get paid back by insurance companies that didn't want to fund the drug for non-cancer patients, the company established a "reimbursement center" that used employees to suggest they were calling on behalf of a doctor and the patient in question had cancer even if that wasn't true, the indictment says.Kapoor founded Insys Therapeutics in 1990.Its stock price has tumbled amid the legal trouble in recent months, but the company said this week that it is under new management and has assumed responsibility for its former employees' actions.The drug is question, fentanyl, is useful for managing pain for people with end-stage cancers, said Dr. Karen Sibert, an associate clinical professor with UCLA Health's Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine.But opioids are dangerous when used incorrectly and without medical supervision because they can cause a person to stop breathing, she said."If you have extreme pain from end-stage cancer, the risk from stopping breathing is an acceptable risk," she said."But it's not if you are a young person with back pain."Kapoor emigrated from India decades ago and earned a Ph.D. in medicinal chemistry from the University of Buffalo in New York, where the pharmacy school is named for him and his wife to honor their philanthropy.In addition to Insys Therapeutics, which went public in 2013, Kapoor founded Illinois-based Akorn Pharmaceuticals.He also has a company that operates seven restaurants.Forbes said several years ago that Kapoor was worth $2.4 billion.That has fallen amid his company's legal woes, but the magazine still listed Kapoor's worth at $1.75 billion on Friday.A judge set bail for Kapoor at $1 million and said he must wear electronic monitoring and surrender his passports.
The Latest: Analyst sees profit motive in opioid case:::::The Latest on the arrest of a drug company founder on conspiracy charges related to a prescription opioid cancer drug (all times local): 5:12 p.m. Health care analyst Steve Brozak says this week's arrest of an Arizona drug company founder in a fraud and racketeering case is the latest example of how profits have become more important than health for many U.S. pharmaceutical firms.Brozak says the aggressive marketing that federal prosecutors described at Insys Therapeutics of Chandler, Arizona has become acceptable a trend he does not welcome.He is a New Jersey-based analyst with WWB Securities, a health care research firm that tracks companies in the sector.Brozak said Friday he believes that Insys founder John Kapoor was arrested only because the drug involved in the marketing effort was an opioid, in this case a mouth spray that delivers the highly addictive fentanyl to end-stage cancer patients.12:13 a.m.The drug company founder charged with leading a nationwide conspiracy to bribe doctors and pharmacists to widely prescribe an opioid cancer drug for people who didn't need it came to the U.S. for postgraduate studies and for a time was listed among Arizona's richest billionaires.Forbes several years ago listed John N. Kapoor, the founder of Insys Therapeutics, as having a worth of $2.4 billion.That worth has fallen amid indictments of numerous fellow Insys executives.But Forbes still listed Kapoor's worth at $1.75 billion on Thursday as he went to U.S. federal court in the fraud and racketeering case.Kapoor and some of his colleagues were charged with pushing prescriptions for the addictive drug the same day President Donald Trump declared the opioid crisis a nationwide public health emergency.
Ky. advocates ask Trump official for more opioid resources:::::Advocates and doctors in opioid-ravaged Kentucky urged President Donald Trump's acting chief health official to spend more money on fighting the drug epidemic one day after he signed an order declaring the crisis a national public health emergency.Acting Health and Human Services Secretary Eric Hargan toured a clinic in Lexington, Kentucky, on Friday that specializes in treating pregnant women and their babies addicted to opioid-based drugs like heroin and prescription painkillers.Kentucky has one of the highest rates of babies born addicted to opioids, with 110 cases reported each month in 2015.Hargan met privately with patients and advocates before taking a tour of the facility and speaking with two reporters."A lot of what I heard in the room is we need resources, we need money," said Alex Elswick, founder of a nonprofit that connects people to recovery resources who participated in the meeting.Hargan also heard from health care providers worried about the potential loss of services that came to Kentucky with the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.Although Congress last year authorized spending $1 billion over two years on state initiatives to fight the opioid crisis, the Trump administration's public health declaration does not include more spending.Instead, it lets the government redirect resources to help out rural areas.For example, the declaration seeks to let doctors treat more patients remotely, a critical service for rural areas that have few health care providers.Agatha Critchfield, an obstetrician-gynecologist who oversees a drug treatment program for pregnant women at the University of Kentucky's hospital system, says some patients drive more than three hours for appointments.But it's unclear how or when Trump's declaration will let doctors prescribe medication, like buprenorphine, remotely without a face-to-face visit.The medicine helps people addicted to opioids with the painful withdrawal symptoms that come with quitting the drug, but doctors have been banned from prescribing it unless they meet with a patient in person.Asked if the declaration will lift those restrictions, Hargan said the Drug Enforcement Administration would have to weigh in along with state health officials."Prescribing decisions ... are really in the hands of the state and local authorities," Hargan said."We don't regulate the practice of medicine at the federal level."The federal government, however, specifically the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which is part of HHS, does regulate the prescribing of buprenorphine.Doctors must get a waiver from the federal agency to prescribe the drug, which is a narcotic.Hargan said he came to Kentucky because it has been one of the states most affected by the opioid crisis.Last year, Kentucky had more than 1,400 drug overdose deaths, a 39 percent increase from three years ago.He praised Kentucky officials and advocates for working together to come up with "innovative, collaborative solutions."And he said it was encouraging to meet patients who were working to overcome their addiction, saying it put "a human face on the crisis.""You put those two things together and you can find messages and treatment and ways of dealing with it that I think can be applied nationally," Hargan said.Critchfield said one of the biggest things to help Kentucky was the expansion of the Medicaid program under former President Barack Obama's health care law, which the Trump administration is trying to eliminate.She said the vast majority of patients the program treats are on Medicaid."Whatever your feelings are about it, substance abuse services got better," Critchfield said."So from my perspective as a substance abuse provider for pregnant and early parenting women, they had improved access to medication-assisted therapy.And so, certainly, I have concerns about that going away."Hargan said substance abuse treatments were expanded with Medicaid, but said "going forward, I mean, you have to look to see what Congress does with the law itself."AP Medical Writer Carla K. Johnson contributed reporting from Chicago.

Trump administration proposes health law benefit changes:::::The Trump administration on Friday proposed new health insurance regulations that could affect basic benefits required by the Affordable Care Act, but not for a couple of years.Loosening "Obamacare" benefit requirements was a major sticking point for congressional Republicans in thus-far fruitless efforts to repeal the law.The complex new plan from the administration would give states a potential path to easing some requirements.Starting in 2019, states could select from coverage levels in another state, which could be less generous.Ten broad categories of services required by the health law would still have to be covered, but the fine print could change.Issued late in the day, the 365-page plan also proposes other changes to the inner workings of the health insurance markets created under the Obama-era law.The marketplaces offer subsidized private plans to people who don't have access to job-based coverage.The changes proposed by the Trump administration cover areas from consumers' eligibility for subsidies to how insurers are reimbursed.It could take days for consumer groups, insurers, benefits experts and others to assess the potential impact of the proposal.Among the biggest uncertainties is whether the proposed changes would appeal to state officials, who generally try to protect standards established on their home turf.The basic benefits that could be affected include: Outpatient, inpatient and emergency care Prescription drugs and labs Preventive care Pregnancy, maternity and newborn care Mental health and substance abuse Rehabilitation Children's services, including vision and dental While those categories are established by law and can't be changed in a regulation, the fine print can make a big difference.For example, insurers can cover certain drugs, but not others, for a given medical condition.Expensive treatments for complicated chronic illnesses can be subject to limits on the number of visits the plan will cover.The Trump administration's proposal also called for changes to small business health insurance markets created by the ACA.
Judge dismayed by Flint's failure to follow water order:::::A judge on Friday said the Flint City Council again has failed to come up with a long-term water source and may be pushing the troubled community toward bankruptcy.In a sweeping decision, U.S. District Judge David Lawson said the council's proposed two-year extension with the Great Lakes Water Authority is not the long-term plan that he had ordered last week.He also rejected a request for more time so the council could get an analysis from a consultant.Flint council members were elected to "govern by acting in the interest of the common good," the judge said."That has not happened over the past year and now time, which is of the essence, is in short supply."The immediate impact of the judge's decision isn't clear.Flint is recovering from a lead contamination crisis caused by improper water treatment when it was using the Flint River during an 18-month period in 2014 and 2015.The state of Michigan sued Flint earlier this year, seeking to force the city to sign a 30-year deal with Great Lakes Water, which stepped in after the lead disaster was declared.Mayor Karen Weaver agrees with the state, but the council hasn't acted.Her administration warns that Flint could end up in bankruptcy.Lawson said that "may be accurate."The 30-year deal would have relieved the city of bond debt to a different water agency and supplied residents with "safe water at predictable rates," he said.A lawyer representing the council didn't immediately return an email seeking comment.Lawson invited the state to file a request to enforce his previous order.Follow Ed White at http://twitter.com/edwhiteap
Trump calls for liberation from 'scourge' of drug addiction:::::In ringing and personal terms, President Donald Trump has pledged that "we will overcome addiction in America," declaring opioid abuse a national public health emergency and announcing new steps to combat what he described as the worst drug crisis in U.S. history.Trump's declaration, which will be effective for 90 days and can be renewed, will allow the government to redirect resources in various ways and to expand access to medical services in rural areas.But it won't bring new dollars to fight a scourge that kills nearly 100 people a day."As Americans we cannot allow this to continue," Trump said in a speech Thursday at the White House, where he bemoaned an epidemic he said had spared no segment of society, affecting rural areas and cities, rich and poor and both the elderly and newborns."It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction," he said."We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic."Deaths have surged from opioids, which include some prescribed painkillers, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, often sold on the nation's streets.Administration officials said they also would urge Congress, during end-of-the year budget negotiations, to add new cash to a public health emergency fund that Congress hasn't replenished for years and contains just $57,000.White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Friday suggested $45 billion might be a "good number" for added funding.That's the same amount as Republicans had suggested in one of their failed "Obamacare" replacement bills.But critics said Thursday's words weren't enough."How can you say it's an emergency if we're not going to put a new nickel in it?"said Dr. Joseph Parks, medical director of the nonprofit National Council for Behavioral Health, which advocates for addiction treatment providers."As far as moving the money around," he added, "that's like robbing Peter to pay Paul."Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi said, "Show me the money."Trump's audience Thursday included parents who have lost children to drug overdoses, people who have struggled with addiction, first responders and lawmakers.Trump also spoke personally about his own family's experience with addiction: His older brother, Fred Jr., died after struggling with alcoholism.It's the reason the president does not drink.Trump described his brother as a "great guy, best looking guy," with a personality "much better than mine.""But he had a problem, he had a problem with alcohol," the president said."I learned because of Fred."Trump said he hoped a massive advertising campaign, which sounded reminiscent of the 1980s "Just Say No" campaign, might have a similar impact."If we can teach young people, and people generally, not to start, it's really, really easy not to take 'em," he said.It's a path taken by previous presidents, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W.Bush, all of whom tried to rally the nation to confront drug abuse but fell short of solving the problem.Some people have become hooked on opioids after being prescribed pain killers by doctors after injuries or surgery.As a presidential candidate, Trump had pledged to make fighting addiction a priority.Once in office, Trump assembled a commission, led by Gov.Chris Christie of New Jersey, to study the problem.The commission's interim report argued an emergency declaration would free additional money and resources, but some in Trump's administration disagreed."What the president did today was historic and it is an extraordinary beginning set of steps to dealing with this problem," Christie told reporters at the White House after the speech.Some also faulted the White House for not issuing a wider emergency declaration to deal with the crisis.As a result of Trump's declaration, officials will be able to expand access to telemedicine services, including substance abuse treatment for people living in rural and remote areas.Officials will also be able to more easily deploy state and federal workers, secure Department of Labor grants for the unemployed, and shift funding for HIV and AIDs programs to provide more substance abuse treatment for people already eligible for those programs.Trump said his administration would also be working to reduce regulatory barriers, such as one that bars Medicaid from paying for addiction treatment in residential rehab facilities larger than 16 beds.Trump said one specific prescription opioid, which he described as "truly evil," would be withdrawn immediately from the market.White House spokesman Hogan Gildey later said he was referring to the painkiller Opana ER.That drug was pulled from the market in July at the Food and Drug Administration's request following a 2015 outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C in southern Indiana linked to sharing needles to inject the pills.Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Trump's effort falls far short of what is needed and will divert staff and resources from other vital public health initiatives."Families in Connecticut suffering from the opioid epidemic deserve better than half measures and empty rhetoric offered seemingly as an afterthought," he said in a statement.He argued, "An emergency of this magnitude must be met with sustained, robust funding and comprehensive treatment programs."Trump tempered expectations even as he projected hope."Our current addiction crisis, and especially the epidemic of opioid deaths, will get worse before it gets better.But get better it will," he said.AP Medical Writer Carla K. Johnson reported from Chicago.Associated Press writers Dake Kang in Cleveland and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Lauran Neergaard and Catherine Lucey in Washington contributed to this report.
The Latest: White House suggests $45B in opioid fight:::::The Latest on the U.S. policy on the opioid epidemic (all times local): 3:20 p.m.The White House is suggesting that $45 billion might be a good number for Congress to add to the fight against opioid addiction.Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked Friday how much money the president would like to see Congress add to a nearly-bankrupt public health emergency to address the crisis.She's noting one version of the "Obamacare" replacement bill that died in Congress included $45 billion to fight opioid abuse.Sanders she she's "not going to negotiate" from the podium, but says: "We do feel like that $45 billion would have been a good number."White House officials have said they plan to work with Congress to lock down a number as part of the end-of-year budget negotiations.Sanders says she hopes "there will be a lot of bipartisan support to put behind the opioid crisis."7:30 a.m. New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie is defending President Donald Trump's push to combat opioid abuse, saying the president "gave compassion yesterday and hope" to families struggling with the epidemic.Christie says in an interview on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" that "Congress is serious" about the scourge and billions of dollars will need to be spent to address the problem.Critics say Trump's declaration of opioid abuse a national public health emergency doesn't go far enough.The emergency will be effective for 90 days and Christie says it would be renewed "over and over again."The governor says he expects the administration to waive federal rules that will help more people access treatment under Medicaid.4:15 a.m. President Donald Trump is calling for Americans to liberate their communities from the scourge of drug addiction as he declares opioid abuse a national public health emergency.Trump on Thursday announced new steps to combat deaths from opioids such as prescribed painkillers and heroin.The declaration allows the government to redirect resources in various ways and to expand access to medical services in rural areas.But it won't bring new dollars to fight a scourge that kills nearly 100 people a day.Administration officials say they will urge Congress, during end-of-the year budget negotiations, to add new cash to a public health emergency fund.Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut says Trump's effort falls far short of what's needed and will divert staff and resources from other public health initiatives.
NHS Airbnb-style scheme 'not ruled out' by minister:::::The idea of NHS hospital patients recuperating in Airbnb-style accommodation has not been ruled out, health minister Philip Dunne has said.Southend Hospital had been linked to a trial where hospital patients could be discharged to people's spare rooms.The hospital distanced itself from the idea following criticism by politicians and health groups.But Mr Dunne told BBC Radio 5 live he "wouldn't immediately reject it" as "one's got to trial different things".The pilot scheme, proposed in Essex, would have seen some 30 hospital patients staying in local residents' spare rooms instead of in hospital while they waited to be discharged.The idea followed warnings about delays in discharges from UK hospitals.As part of the trial, healthcare start-up CareRooms said it would recruit "hosts" whose properties had spare rooms or annexes with a private bathroom.Southend Hospital later said the pilot would not be supported until certain criteria had been met.'New care models' However, when asked by the BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaar if the idea deserved a look, health minister MP Mr Dunne said: "Well, I wouldn't rule it out."This is not national policy, anything innovative needs to be very carefully scrutinised and assessed before we proceed with it."But I wouldn't, just as an immediate knee jerk, say that new models of care in the community are necessarily wrong."Image copyright PA Image caption The idea followed warnings about delays in discharges from UK hospitals Mr Dunne added that the idea had involved "people who may have had minor procedures who need a bit of help".It could also include B&B owners who were already medically trained and could offer accommodation, he said.But Tom Abell, deputy chief executive of Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said: "While we welcome and encourage new ideas and innovation, there is no intention and there never has been for the hospital to support this pilot at this time."A 'sticking plaster' The idea first emerged last week, when it sparked widespread debate.Labour's shadow health minister Justin Madders said the scheme would be a "sticking plaster" for wider NHS issues, while shadow social care minister Barbara Keeley warned there were "clear safety risks".Ex-Labour minister Lord Clark warned that "vulnerable patients" would be allocated to homes where the host had no "medical expertise".However, Dr Harry Thirkettle, co-founder of CareRooms, said the idea could help patients who either live alone and do not have support leave hospital sooner.He said that some people may find the scheme preferable to staying in hospital.An NHS England spokesman said it was "good to hear innovative ideas from NHS staff", but the idea was "a long way from being implemented" and would need to be very "carefully assessed" before being tested.
10 things to know about sleep as the clocks go back:::::Image copyright Getty Images People across the UK will wake up having gained an hour's sleep on Sunday morning, as the clocks go back heralding darker evenings and shorter days.But how much do we know about sleep and its impact on our lives, from our health and mood, to how long we'll live?1.We're told to get our eight hours We often hear that we should all be getting eight hours' sleep a night.Organisations from the NHS to the US National Sleep Foundation recommend it.But where does this advice come from?Studies carried out around the world, looking at how often diseases occur in different groups of people across a population, have come to the same conclusion: both short sleepers and long sleepers are more likely to have a range of diseases, and to live shorter lives.But it's hard to tell whether it is short sleep that is causing disease or whether it is a symptom of a less healthy lifestyle.Short sleepers are generally defined as those who regularly get less than six hours' sleep and long sleepers generally more than nine or 10 hours' a night.Pre-puberty, children are recommended to get as much as 11 hours' sleep a night, however, and up to 18 hours a day for newborn babies.Teenagers should sleep for up to 10 hours a night.Shane O'Mara, professor of experimental brain research at Trinity College Dublin, says that, while it's difficult to tell whether poor sleep is a cause or a symptom of poor health, these relationships feed off each other.For example, people who are less fit exercise less, which leads people to sleep badly, become exhausted and less likely to exercise, and so on.We do know that chronic sleep deprivation - that is, under-sleeping by an hour or two a night over a period of time - has been linked time and again by scientists to poor health outcomes: you don't have to go for days without sleep to suffer these negative effects.2.What happens in your body when you don't sleep enough?Poor sleep has been linked to a whole range of disorders.A review of 153 studies with a total of more than five million participants found short sleep was significantly associated with diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease and obesity.Studies have shown that depriving people of enough sleep for only a few nights in a row can be enough to put healthy adults into a pre-diabetic state.These moderate levels of sleep deprivation damaged their bodies' ability to control blood glucose levels.Vaccines are less effective when we are sleep deprived, and sleep deprivation suppresses our immune system making us more prone to infection.One study found participants who had fewer than seven hours of sleep were almost three times more likely to develop a cold than those who slept for seven hours or more.People who don't sleep enough also appear to produce too much of the hormone ghrelin, associated with feeling hungry, and not enough of the hormone leptin, associated with feeling full, which may contribute to their risk of obesity.There are also links to brain function and even in the long term to dementia.Prof O'Mara explains that toxic debris builds up in your brain during the course of the day and waste is drained from the body during sleep.If you don't sleep enough, you end up in a mildly concussed state, he says.The impact of sleeping too much is less understood, but we do know it is linked to poorer health including a higher risk of cognitive decline in older adults.3.We need different types of sleep to repair ourselves After we fall asleep we go through cycles of "sleep stages", each cycle lasting between 60 and 100 minutes.Each stage plays a different role in the many processes that happen in our body during sleep.The first stage in each cycle is a drowsy, relaxed state between being awake and sleeping - breathing slows, muscles relax, the heart rate drops.The second stage is a slightly deeper sleep - you may feel awake and this means that, on many nights, you may be asleep and not know it.Stage three is deep sleep.It is very hard to wake up during this period because it is when there is the lowest amount of activity in your body.Stages two and three together are known as slow wave sleep which is usually dreamless.After deep sleep we go back to stage two for a few minutes, and then enter dream sleep, also called REM (rapid eye movement).As the name suggests, this is when dreaming happens.In a full sleep cycle a person goes through all the stages of sleep from one to three, then back down to two briefly, before entering REM sleep.Later cycles have longer periods of REM, so cutting sleep short has a disproportionately large effect on REM.4.Shift workers who have disturbed sleep get sick more often Shift work has been associated with a host of health problems.Researchers have found shift workers who get too little sleep at the wrong time of day may be increasing their risk of diabetes and obesity.Shift workers are significantly more likely to report "fair or bad" general health according to a 2013 NHS study, which also found people in this group were a lot more likely to have a "limiting longstanding illness" than those who don't work shifts.People who work shifts are significantly more likely to take time off sick, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.There is a far bigger gap for non-manual workers than manual workers - lack of sleep seems to have a bigger impact on those doing more sedentary jobs.5.And many of us are feeling more sleep deprived than ever To judge from media reports, you'd think we were in the grip of a sleeplessness epidemic.But are we really all more sleep deprived than before?A big piece of research looking at data from 15 countries found a very mixed picture.Six showed decreased sleep duration, seven increased sleep duration and two countries had mixed results.Lots of a evidence suggests the amount we sleep hasn't changed that much in recent generations.But if you ask people how sleep deprived they think they are, a different picture emerges.So why do so many people report feeling tired?It may be that this problem is concentrated in certain groups, making the trend harder to pick up on a population-wide level.Sleep problems vary considerably by age and gender, according to one study of 2,000 British adults.It found women at almost every age have more difficulty getting enough sleep than men.The sexes are more or less level at adolescence but women begin to feel significantly more sleep deprived than men during the years where they may have young children, while work may become more demanding.The gap then shrinks again later in life.Caffeine and alcohol both affect sleep duration and quality.And later nights and more social activities mean some of us are getting less rest, despite having the same number of hours of sleep, according to Prof Derk-Jan Dijk, of the University of Surrey's sleep research centre.Some people may also sleep too little during the week and catch up at the weekend, bringing the average up but leaving those people feeling sleep deprived.For example, adolescents are particularly at risk of becoming sleep deprived, according to Prof Dijk.6.But we didn't necessarily always sleep this way Aside from a few outliers - Margaret Thatcher could apparently get by on only four hours a night - people tend to go to bed in the late evening for around seven or eight hours.But this wasn't necessarily always the norm according to Roger Ekirch, a history professor at Virginia Tech in the USA.He published a paper in 2001 drawn from 16 years of research.His subsequent book, At Day's Close, contained a wealth of historical evidence suggesting that hundreds of years ago, humans in many parts of the world slept in two distinct chunks.Dr Ekirch uncovered more than 2,000 pieces of evidence in diaries, court records and literature which suggest people used to have a first sleep beginning shortly after dusk, followed by a waking period of a couple of hours, then a second sleep.He thinks this means the body has a natural preference for segmented sleep.Not all scientists agree.Other researchers have found hunter-gatherer communities in the modern world who sleep in one block despite not having electric lighting.This suggests sleeping in two blocks is not necessarily our default.According to Dr Ekirch the shift from biphasal to monophasal sleep happened in the 19th Century because domestic lighting pushed bedtimes later with no corresponding change in rising time, improved lighting changed the human body clock, and the industrial revolution put a greater emphasis on productivity and efficiency.7.Phones are keeping teenagers awake Sleep experts say teenagers need up to 10 hours sleep a night, but almost half don't get this much according to the NHS.Bedrooms are supposed to be a place of rest but are increasingly filled with distractions like laptops and mobile phones, making it harder for young people to nod off.We have more different types of entertainment on offer than ever, making the temptation to stay awake greater.The blue light emitted by electronic devices makes us feel less sleepy.And the activity itself - be it talking to friends or watching TV - stimulates our brain when it should be winding down.Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference recommend a nightly "digital detox", putting mobile devices away for 90 minutes before lights out.Last year the two organisations commissioned a poll which found a high proportion of young people check their phones after going to bed.8.Testing for sleep disorders is on the up More people are turning up at their doctors complaining of problems sleeping.Analysing data collected by NHS England, the BBC found in June that the number of sleeping disorder tests had increased every year over the past decade.There are a number of factors, but the biggest is probably the rise in obesity, according to Dr Guy Leschziner, a consultant neurologist at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital's Sleep Disorders Centre.The most common and fastest-growing complaint he sees is obstructive sleep apnoea - where the airway collapses and people stop breathing in their sleep - and this is strongly related to weight.The media has also played a role because people are more likely to go to their GPs having read an article or searched for their symptoms online, he says.The recommended treatment for insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy, and doctors are increasingly aware that they shouldn't be prescribing sleeping pills.But many still do because it's difficult to access non-drug based treatments, particularly outside big cities.9.Are other countries doing it differently?One study looked at sleep habits in 20 industrialised countries.It found variations of up to an hour in the time people went to bed and woke up, but overall sleep duration was fairly constant across countries.Generally, if a population on average went to bed later, they woke up later too, although not in every case.Researchers have concluded that social influences - hours worked, timing of school, leisure habits - play a far bigger role than the natural cycle of light and dark.In Norway, where the period of lightness each day varies through the year from zero to 24 hours, sleep duration throughout the year only varies on average by about half an hour.Both in countries like the UK, where dusk and dawn times vary considerably across the seasons, and in countries closer to the Equator where dusk and dawn times vary minimally, sleep duration remains constant through the year.But what about the impact of artificial light?A study of three communities who had no access to electricity, in Tanzania, Namibia and Bolivia, found the average sleep duration was 7.7 hours - in step with industrialised countries.So sleep duration seems remarkably consistent throughout the world - it's the time we all go to bed and wake up that varies slightly.These pre-industrialised communities did not fall asleep as soon as it got dark, but around three hours after sunset and generally woke before sunrise.Most studies in this area suggest that artificial light delays sleep time but does not necessarily decrease overall sleep duration.10.Morning larks, night owls?There have always been morning people and evening people.We even have genetic evidence that backs this up.But the introduction of artificial light appears to have exacerbated this effect, particularly for people who prefer to stay up late.If you are already inclined towards being a night owl, artificial light will make you stay up even later.About 30% of us tend towards being morning people and 30% towards being evening people, with the other 40% of us somewhere in the middle - although marginally more people prefer early rising to late nights.We do have some control over our body clocks, however.Those who are naturally late to bed and late to rise can try reducing their exposure to light in the evenings and making sure they get more light exposure in the daytime.A team of researchers took a group of volunteers camping in Colorado, where they had no access to artificial light.Only 48 hours was enough to shift the campers' body clocks forward by almost two hours.Levels of melatonin, the hormone that tells our body to prepare for sleep, began rising earlier in the volunteers - their bodies were preparing for sleep much closer to sunset.
Marriage may protect against dementia:::::Image copyright Getty Images Marriage and having close friends may help protect against dementia, according to Loughborough University researchers.The study, published in Journals of Gerontology, followed 6,677 adults for just under seven years.The quality of a person's social circle appeared more important than the overall size, the research team said.The Alzheimer's Society said it was essential to help patients to maintain "meaningful social connections".None of the participants had dementia at the start of the trial, but 220 were diagnosed during it.The research group compared the traits of those who did and did not develop dementia to find clues as to how social lives affect risk.One finding was that when it comes to friends, it's quality, not quantity, that counts.Prof Eef Hogervorst said: "You can be surrounded by people, but it is the number of close relationships that is associated with a reduced risk for dementia... it's not about the quantity."She thinks having close friends acts as a "buffer" against stress, which is linked to poor health.Nine factors that contribute to dementia risk Mid-life hearing loss - responsible for 9% of the risk Failing to complete secondary education - 8% Smoking - 5% Failing to seek early treatment for depression - 4% Physical inactivity - 3% Social isolation - 2% High blood pressure - 2% Obesity - 1% Type 2 diabetes - 1% These risk factors - which are described as potentially modifiable - add up to 35%.The other 65% of dementia risk is thought to be potentially non-modifiable.The study also suggested that single people had twice the risk of developing dementia during the study than those who were married.Dr Doug Brown, director of research at the Alzheimer's Society, said: "This amounts to about one extra diagnosis in each 100 unmarried people."As the study only follows people over time it cannot prove cause and effect.Dementia is known to start in the brain decades before it is diagnosed and some of these early changes may affect people's ability to socialise.Either way, Dr Brown said loneliness was a real issue in dementia.He said: "If people are not properly supported, dementia can be an incredibly isolating experience."It is essential people with dementia are supported to maintain meaningful social connections and continue living their life as they want."
NHS 'could have prevented' WannaCry ransomware attack:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption WannaCry was the biggest cyber-attack that has affected the NHS to date NHS trusts were left vulnerable in a major ransomware attack in May because cyber-security recommendations were not followed, a government report has said.More than a third of trusts in England were disrupted by the WannaCry ransomware, according to the National Audit Office (NAO).At least 6,900 NHS appointments were cancelled as a result of the attack.NHS England said no patient data had been compromised or stolen and praised the staff response.The NAO chief said the Department of Health and the NHS must now "get their act together".WannaCry, which spread to more than 150 countries in a worldwide ransomware outbreak beginning on 12 May, was the biggest cyber-attack to have hit the NHS to date.The malware encrypted data on infected computers and demanded a ransom roughly equivalent to 230 ($300).The NAO report said there was no evidence that any NHS organisation paid the ransom - but the financial cost of the incident remained unknown.An assessment of 88 out of 236 trusts by NHS Digital before the attack found that none passed the required cyber-security standards.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption As a result of disruption caused by WannaCry, patients were turned away from appointments The report said NHS trusts had not acted on critical alerts from NHS Digital and a warning from the Department of Health and the Cabinet Office in 2014 to patch or migrate away from vulnerable older software.The Department of Health also lacked important information, the report said."Before 12 May 2017, the department had no formal mechanism for assessing whether NHS organisations had complied with its advice and guidance."Organisations could also have better managed their computers' firewalls - but in many cases they did not, it said.NHS organisations have not reported any cases of harm to patients or of their data being stolen as a result of WannaCry.NHS England has identified 6,912 appointments - including operations - that were cancelled as a direct result of the ransomware.But it estimated that about 19,000 appointments in total may have been affected.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware?Cases included at least 139 people potentially with cancer, who had urgent referrals cancelled.It is not known: how many GP appointments were cancelled how many ambulances and individuals were diverted from five accident and emergency departments unable to treat some patients how many trusts or GPs experienced delays in information, such as test results The NAO credits the widely reported work of cyber-security researcher Marcus Hutchins, who accidentally helped to stop the spread of WannaCry.His "kill switch" involved registering a domain name linked to the malware, which deactivated the program's ability to spread automatically.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption LISTEN: How 'Malware Tech' became an 'accidental hero' Home Office Minister Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government was "as sure as possible" that North Korea was behind the attack."This attack, we believe quite strongly that it came from a foreign state," he said."It is widely believed in the community and across a number of countries that North Korea [took on] this role".Speaking on the same programme, former chairman of NHS Digital, Kingsley Manning, said that a failure to upgrade old computer systems at a local level within the NHS had contributed to the rapid spread of the malware.He said: "The problem with cyber security for the NHS is [that] it has a particular vulnerability...It's very interconnected so if you get an attack in one place it tends to spread."Mr Manning blamed a lack of time and resources but also "frankly a lack of focus, a lack of taking it seriously" for individual NHS organisations' failure to keep up with cyber-security improvements."This was an extremely unsophisticated attack," he added.The NAO said the NHS "has accepted that there are lessons to learn" from WannaCry and will now develop a response plan.It will also ensure that critical cyber-security updates - such as applying software patches - are carried out by IT staff, the NAO said.WannaCry was "a relatively unsophisticated attack and could have been prevented by the NHS following basic IT security best practice," said Sir Amyas Morse, comptroller and auditor-general of the NAO."There are more sophisticated cyber-threats out there than WannaCry so the Department and the NHS need to get their act together to ensure the NHS is better protected against future attacks."Keith McNeil, NHS chief clinical information officer for health and care, said: "As the NAO report makes clear, no harm was caused to patients and there were no incidents of patient data being compromised or stolen."Tried and tested emergency plans were activated quickly and our hard-working NHS staff went the extra mile to provide patient care, keeping the impact on NHS services and patients to a minimum."Image copyright EPA Analysis - by Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent For many executives, a serious cyber-attack is now very high on their list of risks to their organisations and a priority for disaster planning.So what is most shocking in this report is the lack of planning at a local level in the NHS for such an event.To be fair, the Department of Health had developed a plan - it was just that it had not been properly communicated or tested in the NHS trusts.When disaster struck, nobody seemed to know who was in charge or what to do.Of course, all of this could have been avoided if security patches had been applied to protect the Windows 7 systems common throughout the NHS.Once again, there had been warnings sent out by NHS Digital, but many trusts failed to act upon them - though in that they were no different from many organisations around the world that were also hit.In one way, the NHS was lucky - if, instead of a Friday in May, the attack had taken place on a Monday in winter, with a week's appointments affected, the damage would have been far worse.Cyber-security experts will tell you that dealing with attacks like these is mostly a management rather than a technology problem.And in this case the NHS proved itself incapable of managing a speedy and effective response to its first major cyber-security crisis.
Heart surgery survival chances 'better in the afternoon':::::Image copyright Getty Images Open heart surgery appears to be safer in the afternoon because of the body's internal clock, scientists have said.The body clock - or circadian rhythm - is the reason we want to sleep at night, but it also drives huge changes in the way our bodies work.The research, published in the Lancet, suggests the heart is stronger and better able to withstand surgery in the afternoon than the morning.And it says the difference is not down to surgeons being tired in the morning.Doctors need to stop the heart to perform operations including heart valve replacements.This puts the organ under stress as the flow of oxygen to the heart tissue is reduced.The doctors and researchers looked for complications including heart attacks, heart failure or death after surgery.They found: 54 out of 298 morning patients had adverse events 28 out of 298 afternoon patients had adverse events Afternoon patients had around half the risk of complications One major event would be avoided for every 11 patients operated on in the afternoon One of those involved in the research, Prof Bart Staels, from the Institut Pasteur de Lille, told the BBC News website: "We don't want to frighten people from having surgery - it's life saving."He also said it would be impossible for hospitals to conduct surgery only after lunch.But Prof Staels added: "If we can identify patients at highest risk, they will definitely benefit from being pushed into the afternoon and that would be reasonable."Obesity and type 2 diabetes have been shown to increase the risk of complications after surgery.Heart health is already known to fluctuate over the course of a day.The risk of a heart attack or stroke is highest first thing in the morning, while the heart and lungs work at their peak in the afternoon.Dr John O'Neill, from the UK Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology, said: "Scientifically it is not hugely surprising, because just like every other cell in the body, heart cells have circadian rhythms that orchestrate their activity."Our cardiovascular system has the greatest output around mid/late-afternoon, which explains why professional athletes usually record their best performances around this time."Other possible explanations for the findings included surgeons being tired in the morning or their own body clock affecting their surgical skill, particularly if they are not "morning people".But Prof Staels said the researchers had gone to great lengths to show that the difference in survival rates was not down to the surgeons.The French team also experimented on cardiac tissue samples from patients and showed they beat more readily in the afternoon.And an analysis of the DNA in the samples found 287 genes whose activity showed a circadian rhythm - waxing and waning during the day.They then moved into mice and used experimental drugs to alter the activity of one of those genes and seemed to be able to reduce the risk of death.Prof Staels said: "We believe we have identified a potential way to circumvent the disturbing observation that operations in the morning lead to more complications."However, that will require more research to confirm.The researchers are also investigating whether circadian rhythms have an impact on survival in other types of surgery.Dr Mike Knapton, from the British Heart Foundation, said: "Thousands of people now have open heart surgery in the UK.If this finding can be replicated in other hospitals this could be helpful to surgeons planning their operating list, for non-urgent heart surgery.Follow James on Twitter.
Young people 'not receiving mental health care they need':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Alice says a lack of services affected her recovery Young people are facing long waiting times and unequal access to mental health services, a review by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) has said.The commissioner said this could be "putting young people's lives at risk".The review found nearly 40% of specialist child and adolescent services in England needed improvement.Alice Gibbs, who was diagnosed with anorexia at the age of 12, said a lack of access to specialised services had had a long-term effect on her recovery.She waited six months to see a mental health professional."Knowing that we had to wait for that help and things were only getting worse was scary," she says.She received treatment in Leicester for several years, but it was later recommended that she get specialist treatment.At the time, the nearest specialist unit for eating disorders was in London."It's a complete postcode lottery," she says."I was 16 years old, and apart from being really physically unwell, I was mentally unwell.I didn't want to be away from my family."Fragmented support system The CQC's Dr Paul Lelliott said the "system's complexity and fragmentation must be overcome"."There are many people out there working to make sure that children and young people who experience mental health issues are offered caring support.Their dedication is to be celebrated."However, we must also address those times when a child or young person feels let down or not listened to and make sure the same level of support is available."While the report could not specify exactly how long young people were waiting, an investigation by the BBC's World at One programme using Freedom of Information requests found children were waiting up to 22 months to see a mental health professional.Of the nine trusts that replied, the worst was Cambridgeshire & Peterborough, which had an average wait of 16 weeks in 2016-2017.Dr Andrew Molodynski from the British Medical Association said: "Gaining access to necessary specialist care remains a serious concern in places.It is a need the government must address as a priority."The review's findings echo issues raised by NHS England in its Five Year Forward View for Mental Health, published in February.Problems identified included long waiting times, inequalities in access to services and a lack of support while young people were waiting for care.NHS England's head of mental health Claire Murdoch said after "years of underinvestment" there has been a 15% increase in spending on young people's mental health services in the past year, "far outstripping the overall rise in mental health spending"."Without a doubt, after years of drought, the NHS' mental health funding taps have now been turned on."'It defined my teenage life' Alice Gibbs made the hard decision to stay in Leicester for non-specialist treatment.Now 22, she says she's a lot better.But she is still receiving mental health care and thinks this may not have been the case if she had received better, more specialised care as a teenager."I'm lucky because I have had all of that support but it's frustrating to think that realistically it could be a lot better than this," she says.Alice says she has learned how to manage her eating disorder "rather than fix it"."With eating disorders, it feels like it's defining you.And it definitely has with me - it defined all of my teenage life."Have you had difficulties accessing mental health care or been affected by the issues raised in this story?Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk with your stories.Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.You can also contact us in the following ways:
Indian surgeons separate twins joined at the head:::::Image copyright AIIMS Image caption The twin boys were separated after 16 hours of surgery Surgeons in the Indian capital, Delhi, have separated twin boys who were conjoined at the tops of their heads.Two-year-old Jaga and Kalia underwent 16 hours of surgery, and are now in the intensive care unit, doctors said.A team of 30 doctors carried out the surgery - the first of its kind in India - at a state-run hospital.The boys were born with shared blood vessels and brain tissues, a very rare condition that occurs once in about three million births.The director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Randeep Guleria, told the Press Trust of India that the "next 18 days would be extremely critical to ascertain the success of the surgery".The twins, hailing from a village in eastern Orissa state, were joined at the head - a condition known as craniopagus.Even before the operation they had defeated the odds; craniopagus occurs in one in three million births, and 50% of those affected die within 24 hours, doctors say.Image copyright AIIMS Image caption Doctors say the condition of the boys remains critical Image copyright AIIMS Image caption The twins before the surgery to separate them "Both the children have other health issues as well.While Jaga has heart issues, Kalia has kidney problems," neurosurgeon A K Mahapatra said."Though initially Jaga was healthier, now his condition has deteriorated.Kalia is better," he added.Doctors said the most challenging job after the separation was to "provide a skin cover on both sides of the brain for the children as the surgery had left large holes on their heads"."If the twins make it, the next step will be reconstructing their skulls," plastic surgeon Maneesh Singhal said.The first surgery was performed on 28 August when the doctors created a bypass to separate the shared veins that return blood to the heart from the brain.
Women in Scotland allowed abortion pill at home:::::Image caption Misoprostol is sold under the brand name Cytotec among others Women in Scotland are the first in the UK to be allowed to take the abortion pill at home.Scotland's Chief Medical Officer has written to all health boards to say the drug misoprostol can be taken by women outside of a clinical setting.The change brings Scotland in line with other countries such as Sweden and France.The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) has been lobbying to change the law in the UK for years.Two tablets There were 12,063 terminations of pregnancy in Scotland in 2016 and almost three-quarters (73.5%) were carried out at less than nine weeks gestation.The vast majority of these early terminations (89.4%) were medical rather than surgical procedures.The medical treatment involves taking two different medicines.The first tablet, called Mifepristone, blocks the action of the hormone progesterone, which is needed to maintain the pregnancy.The second tablet, called Misoprostol, can be given on the same day, or 24, 48 or 72 hours apart.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The tablet will be given out at a clinic but can be taken at home Not all women are suitable for a medical abortion, although they may still be suitable for a surgical abortion.The change in Scotland would mean the second tablet Misoprostol - would be administered in a clinical setting but could be taken by women at home.Within an hour of taking misoprostol women often experience heavy bleeding - usually on the way home from the clinic.This is a particular concern for women in Scotland who often have to travel long distances to access abortion and maternity services.The Scottish government said it was making the changes under existing abortion powers.Public Health Minister Aileen Campbell said: "Abortion can be an emotive subject - however I am proud this government is working hard to ensure women are always able to access clinically safe services."Scotland is now the only part of the UK to offer women the opportunity to take misoprostol at home when this is clinically appropriate, a decision that allows women to be in control of their treatment and as comfortable as possible during this procedure."Privacy of home Ann Furedi, chief executive of the BPAS, welcomed the decision.She said: "This will spare women not only the difficulties associated with having to make more than one clinic visit - childcare, transport, time off work - but it will also spare women from the risk of symptoms on their way home, having taken the medication in a clinic.""It is simply perverse that a woman arriving at a BPAS clinic in England and Wales with an incomplete miscarriage can be given the medication to take in the comfort and privacy of her own home, while a woman seeking an abortion must take that same medication on site."We hope that the government will follow Scotland's lead and roll out this important policy change across the rest of Great Britain."However, John Deighan, chief executive of the Society for the protection of Unborn Children (SPUC) Scotland, said the change would mark "a return to the days of back street abortions with no medical oversight".He added: "The reality is that this will have many vulnerable women who may be desperate about the situation they are in, pushed towards what is seen as the easy option of being handed some drugs and sent home to stop being a problem for society."
Superbug 'sleuthing' finds secret outbreaks:::::Image copyright Getty Images A feat of "genomic sleuthing" has uncovered 173 secret outbreaks of the superbug MRSA, a study shows.They were found in the east of England over the course of just one year, according to the details published in Science Translational Medicine.The researchers say their approach could transform the way we tackle MRSA and other superbugs.Detecting outbreaks that are happening under our noses should cut the number of people infected.MRSA - or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus - is a bacterial infection that is resistant to a number of widely-used antibiotics - is a bacterial infection that is resistant to a number of widely-used antibiotics It can cause life-threatening infections if the bug breaches the skin, such as through a surgical wound Detective work Hospitals in the UK have become very good at catching outbreaks of MRSA, especially when they happen in the same place at the same time - such as in one hospital ward.But MRSA also spreads outside of hospitals, in people's homes, in care homes; and patients and staff also move around from place to place.Doctors will see the individual cases, but cannot always spot the bigger picture and catch the outbreak.Prof Sharon Peacock, one of the researchers, told the BBC: "Patients move around wards very quickly and you don't always spot the links Sherlock Holmes might detect, but the genomics does it for you."The team at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute sequenced the genetic code of every single MRSA sample that came through three hospitals and 75 GP surgeries.They then pieced together the clues in a feat of genetic genealogy.By looking at the genetic code, the researchers could work out which samples were closely related and therefore part of the same outbreak.Surprise They found 173, ranging from outbreaks affecting two patients up to 44."I was surprised by how many we detected," Prof Peacock said.She added: "This could reverse the way we do infection control to be much more targeted, efficient and effective."This strategy cannot prevent an outbreak from occurring, but it can nip it in the bud.It is possible to get rid of MRSA, which mostly lives up the nose or on skin, using creams and antiseptic baths.A smaller scale version of this study managed to track down the carrier of MRSA and bring an outbreak in a baby unit to an end.Huge advances in DNA sequencing mean the whole genome of a bacterium can be worked out in a day for around 120.The researchers are about to start a trial investigating the cost-effectiveness of introducing genomic detective-work into the NHS.Dr Jonathan Pearce, the head of infections and immunity at the UK's Medical Research Council, said: "This study sheds light on MRSA transmission within and between hospitals and the community, which could help strengthen infection prevention and control measures."Follow James on Twitter.
'Depression lost me my job': How mental health costs up to 300,000 jobs a year:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption James Tringham, who has bipolar disorder, explains that being at work has a "normalising effect" Hayley Smith says her manager encouraged her to apply for other jobs when she told her she had depression.The news about her illness spread across the office."It was horrible - I felt really exposed," she says.After a few anxious, unhappy months, she left.Hayley is one of up to 300,000 people with mental health problems who leave their jobs each year, a report says.The report by mental health experts also says poor mental health costs the UK economy up to 99bn each year.Paul Farmer, co-author of the Thriving At Work report, said mental health was a taboo subject in many workplaces.Mr Farmer, who is chief executive of mental health charity Mind, said: "Opportunities are missed to prevent poor mental health and ensure that employees who may be struggling get the support they need."In many instances, employers simply don't understand the crucial role they can play, or know where to go for advice and support."The review makes 40 recommendations for how to support employees to remain at work, including creating an online wellbeing portal and using digital technology to support workers in the gig economy.Companies are also being encouraged to include a section on employee mental health in their annual reports.Currently only 11% of companies do this, the report said.Prime Minister Theresa May, who commissioned the report, said it showed "we need to take action".The civil service has agreed to take on the report's recommendations.Image copyright Hayley Smith Image caption Hayley Smith lost her job when she told her employer about her depression One employer the report praised is the insurer, Aviva.James Tringham, who has worked for the company for seven years, said it helped him get his life back on track after suffering with bipolar disorder."In 2009, I'd reached crisis point with my mental health, and I gave up my career as a solicitor," he says."I was unable to work for over a year - the prospect of returning to work was just so frightening and not something that I could imagine."Eventually he got a job in the insurer's contact centre."They gave me a way back into employment and I have worked my way back up."Aviva have been brilliant in supporting me to manage my mental health at work, and have given me my confidence back."There's an understanding, which means little things like adjusting my workload when I'm feeling on the low side can really help.And the staff - both officially and unofficially - form a great support network."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Footballer Aaron Lennon returned to training after receiving mental health support The review says employers should: Create a mental health at work plan Build mental health awareness by making information and support accessible Encourage open conversations Provide good working conditions and ensure employees have a healthy work-life balance Promote effective people management, with line managers holding regular conversations about health and well-being with their staff Routinely monitor employee mental health The review said that people with long-term mental health problems were leaving jobs at twice the rate of colleagues with no such issues, although it did say that some people may be counted twice - if they left one job, returned to work elsewhere after a break but were then unable to continue in their new post.The report also pointed out the cost to employers, estimating they were losing 42bn each year because of staff suffering from mental health problems.Mrs May said: "It is only by making this an everyday concern for everyone that we change the way we see mental illness, so that striving to improve your mental health - whether at work or at home - is seen as just as positive as improving our physical well-being."What is mental health?For Hayley Smith, support from her employer could have made her chronic depression more bearable.After leaving her job, she started her own company.Five years on, she now employs others."In the long term, it's given me awareness of mental health," she says."And the awareness to make sure I was never going to make people feel the way I was made to feel."
Patients face 'distressing readmissions':::::Image copyright Siri Stafford The number of patients in England being readmitted to hospital within 30 days of discharge has risen by nearly a quarter in the last four years, a watchdog has said.Figures compiled by Healthwatch suggest one in five of these potentially distressing readmissions happen 48 hours after being sent home.The watchdog warns patients may be being rushed out early.NHS England says it is impossible to know the reasons for the readmissions.An emergency readmission occurs when a patient needs to go back into hospital unexpectedly for further treatment, within 30 days of having been discharged.Readmissions in such a short space of time raise concerns about patients being discharged unsafely, and about the pressure on hospitals to free up beds.Search for a health trust or postcode Search for your nearest health trusts Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Browse the full list Go Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker, click or tap here.Healthwatch was prompted to look at the issue as none of the official national NHS bodies collects data on readmissions.It asked hospital trusts to provide information under the Freedom of Information Act.There were some differences in the way the data was collected, but it received comparable data from 72 hospital trusts, just over half the total in England.The results showed: In 2016/17 there were 529,318 emergency readmissions reported by 84 hospital trusts The number of emergency readmissions had risen by 23% over the past four years to 457,880 One in five of the readmissions were with 48 hours of discharge There was a 29% rise in people being readmitted within 24 hours The rise in the readmission rate outstrips the overall rise in hospital admissions, which stands at 9% over the period.In total, there were 16.5 million admissions last year, suggesting that close to one in 20 patients in hospital may be a readmission.Healthwatch speculated there could be a number of reasons for this, including patients being rushed out too soon or when there is insufficient support in the community to care for them.Hospitals are under pressure to bring down the number of delays in freeing up hospital beds because of rising waiting lists for operations and increasing delays in A&E.Imelda Redmond from Healthwatch England said the analysis "raises some big questions": "With health and care services being expected to each free up 1,250 beds through reducing delayed discharges, it is vital that these services also watch what is happening to the people being sent home from hospital."It's clear that health and care leaders need to take a closer look at why people are returning to hospital so quickly."But an NHS England spokesperson said: "Current data makes it impossible to distinguish between genuinely unforeseeable emergency readmissions and readmissions that would not be surprising to clinicians."We agree that it would be useful for NHS Digital to look these data more routinely - and will be asking them to consider doing so."Nigel Edwards of Nuffield Trust said it's a sign of the pressure the NHS is under, and called for improved national data to better analyse emergency readmissions.
Scottish government crackdown on unhealthy food offers:::::Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Ministers have targeted "bold" measures to make a "real, lasting difference" to Scotland's health The promotion of food and drink high in fat, sugar and salt is to be restricted in Scotland, ministers have confirmed.The Scottish government plans the move as part of its new diet and obesity strategy to help people lose weight.Ministers also want to see the broadcast of TV adverts for unhealthy food banned before the 21:00 watershed.TV chef Jamie Oliver, a prominent campaigner for healthier eating, described it as "trailblazing" and urged the UK government to follow suit.He said: "This is an amazing step towards making sure the healthiest choice is the easiest choice - for everyone."Today, Scotland has set an example to the rest of the world.It has picked up the baton that Westminster dropped last year.So, now the ball is back in the UK government's court."We need to ensure everyone in Britain has a chance to raise their children in a healthy environment."Public health minister Aileen Campbell said obesity "significantly increases" the risk of developing conditions like diabetes, heart disease and depression.Ms Campbell launched a consultation on the plans at Tynecastle Stadium in Edinburgh, where she met participants in the Football Fans in Training programme.She later told MSPs that the government was putting forward "bold" measures which would "make a real, lasting difference to the country's health".These include plans to restrict price promotions on food and drink high in fat, sugar and salt in areas around visitor attractions and on routes to schools, and 40m of investment to deliver almost 100,000 "supported weight management interventions" for people with or at risk of type two diabetes.Ms Campbell also said that if the UK government did not commit to banning TV adverts for unhealthy food before the 21:00 watershed, the Scottish government would ask for powers to be devolved so it could do so itself.Image caption Aileen Campbell launched the consultation on the obesity strategy at Tynecastle Stadium in Edinburgh The SNP MSP said: "Simply put, it's harming the people of Scotland.It also puts pressure on the NHS, other public services and our economy."That is why we need commitment and action from everyone across all sectors and at all levels including government, citizens, the public sector and businesses right across the country."Health and retail organisations broadly welcomed the consultation, alongside opposition parties.Cancer Research UK said it was "great to see a range of bold proposals" in the strategy, saying that Scotland has been "in the grip of an obesity epidemic for far too long".The British Medical Association Scotland said "ambitious" action was needed "across every part of society in Scotland if we are to successfully reduce levels of obesity in future years".The Scottish Grocers Federation said "clamping down on promotions" was "too blunt an instrument to really impact on consumer behaviour", but welcomed the consultation and said the key role retailers had to play would be reflected in their response.Scottish Conservative health spokesman Miles Briggs said efforts to tackle obesity "could not come soon enough", stressing the need to work across parties and portfolios to do so.Scottish Labour MSP Colin Smyth said the "obesity crisis is the single biggest public health challenge facing Scotland today", and said "bold, radical action is very much needed".The consultation on the diet and obesity strategy will run until the end of January 2018.
Southend Hospital backs off 'Airbnb beds' plan:::::Image caption Southend Hospital has distanced itself from a pilot scheme were hospital patients could be discharged to recuperate in people's spare rooms A hospital has backed down over plans for patients to recuperate in people's homes as part of an Airbnb-style trial.Southend Hospital in Essex said it has "no intention... to support the pilot at this time".The trial by healthcare start-up CareRooms involves 30 hospital patients staying in local residents' spare rooms while waiting to be discharged.It had been criticised by politicians and health groups as a "ridiculous" idea.Labour's Shadow Health Minister Justin Madders said the scheme would be a "sticking plaster" for wider issues in the care sector.'Never compromise safety' The hospital had previously said "only preliminary discussions" had been held, but has since clarified the pilot would not be supported until certain criteria had been met.Deputy chief executive of Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Tom Abell, said: "While we welcome and encourage new ideas and innovation, there is no intention and there never has been for the hospital to support this pilot at this time."We will never compromise the safety and quality of care for patients and we will not support this pilot until the necessary safeguarding and quality arrangements are in place and there has been full engagement and discussion with our local communities on the proposal."Earlier, CareRooms said it would recruit "hosts" whose properties had spare rooms or annexes with a private bathroom to create "secure care spaces for patients who are waiting to be discharged".The hosts - who would earn up to a maximum of 1,000 per month - would not need any previous care experience but would need to go through security checks to be approved for the scheme.
Scotland's health 'is not improving', auditors warn:::::Image copyright Science Photo Library Scotland's health "is not improving" as the NHS faces "significant challenges", Audit Scotland has warned.The watchdog's annual report lists concerns over missed targets, longer waiting times, "stalled" improvements and growing pressure on budgets.Scottish Labour has renewed its calls for Health Secretary Shona Robison to quit in light of the report.Ms Robison insisted that "significant" improvements have been made, while stressing that there is "no quick fix".The report was the focus of much of Thursday's weekly session of questions to the first minister at Holyrood, with Nicola Sturgeon acknowledging "big challenges" for the health service.But she insisted that "against many measures" the Scottish NHS was performing better than elsewhere in the UK.The Scottish government published its "blueprint" for the future of the NHS in December 2016, aiming to treat people closer to home rather than in hospital.'Significant challenges' Audit Scotland's latest annual report stated that there was a "general consensus in Scotland that healthcare cannot continue to be provided in the same way", but concluded that "more progress needs to be made if transformational change is to happen".It found that existing challenges like "increasing costs, growing demand, and the continuing pressures on public finances" had continued to "intensify" in 2016-17.The public spending watchdog said there had been progress, but warned that "fundamental" areas still needed to be addressed."Significant concerns" flagged up in the report include: A 99% increase in the number of people waiting more than 12 weeks for an outpatient appointment - "more people are waiting longer to be seen" "The majority of key national performance targets were not met in 2016-17" General practice faces "significant challenges", including recruiting and retaining GPs and "low morale" There is a "lack of financial flexibility" for health boards and a "lack of long-term planning" The overall health of Scots "continues to be poor and significant health inequalities remain" Life expectancy is "lower than in most European countries" and improvements have "stalled" Drug-related deaths have "increased significantly" with the rate "now the highest in the EU" "There are warning signs that maintaining the quality of care is becoming increasingly difficult" Image copyright Thinkstock At 12.9bn, health funding now accounts for 43% of the overall Scottish government budget.Despite an increase in the NHS budget, rising operating costs have meant health boards had to make "unprecedented" savings of almost 390m in order to break even.And while the budget for 2017-18 saw an increase in cash terms, there was actually a decrease of 0.1% in real terms from the prior year.The Audit Scotland report concluded that simply adding more funding was "no longer sufficient" to achieve the "step change" needed across the system.It said that budgeting on a year-by-year basis is "hindering development of longer-term plans for moving more care out of hospital", and said a clearer long-term financial framework was "critical".'Positive impact' However, the report did state that there is a "positive basis on which to build" for Scotland's NHS.It noted that Scotland has had "a consistent overall policy direction in health for many years" and there was "broad consensus" on goals.It said that staff "remain committed to providing high-quality care", while levels of overall patient satisfaction "continue to be high" and the Scottish public "hold the NHS in high regard".And it noted that early signs are that changes in the way services are planned and delivered are "beginning to have a positive impact", such as a reduction in delayed discharges.Image caption Caroline Gardner said there was "no simple solution" Auditor General Caroline Gardner said there was "widespread agreement" that healthcare "must be delivered differently if it is to withstand growing pressure on services".She said: "There is no simple solution, but these fundamental areas must be addressed if reform is to deliver the scale of transformation that's needed across the NHS."Involving staff, the public and bodies across the public sector will also be crucial for success."At Holyrood, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson accused First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of trying to sweep concerns about the health services under the carpet.She said the Scottish government was "struggling to do the basics", adding: "The SNP set their own targets to make things better but they've improved in only one in the last five years."We know there's no long term plan even though one was promised for the start of this year, that GPs are being underfunded and that we spent 171 million hiring in agency staff to plug the gaps."'Big challenges' Labour's interim leader Alex Rowley said problems with the health service were "spiralling out of control".He acknowledged that reform of the NHS was not easy, but said the government was "not doing enough and is not moving fast enough".In response, Ms Sturgeon said there were "big challenges" for the NHS - but said these existed "in every health service across the developed world".She said: "In meeting these challenges in Scotland, and they are big challenges, I think against many measures we are seeing the NHS in Scotland perform better than the NHS in any other part of the UK - and that's because of the actions we're taking."Image caption Health Secretary Shona Robison said there was "simply no quick fix" for the challenges facing the health service Labour also said the report showed that it was "time for Shona Robison to go as health secretary".Ms Robison insisted there were some "encouraging" elements to the report, highlighting high patient satisfaction and "innovative work being done".She said there had been "significant improvements in Scotland's health system" under the SNP, "driven by our clear vision for the future for the NHS", citing increased staff levels and "record investment".The Dundee MSP said: "We have long been realistic about the challenges for the NHS and the need for change."We're working to develop a medium term financial framework, within the context of the budget settlement that the Scottish government receives.This will be to outline the broad direction for the NHS and care services to meet the changing needs of the people of Scotland, including shifting the balance of care towards community health services."It's important to stress however that improving the nation's health for the long term requires more than acute care - there's simply no quick fix."She said the government had introduced a range of long term measures designed to make Scots healthier "Ultimately, our work across government will ensure the people of Scotland can continue to look forward to a healthier future," she said.
Warning over NHS Wales Brexit 'catastrophe':::::Image copyright Niyazz/Getty Images Any Brexit which means leaving the single market could be catastrophic for the NHS and particularly devastating in Wales, a health academic has warned.Nick Fahy, a health policy senior researcher at the University of Oxford said a hard or no deal Brexit could leave patients "at immediate risk".He also warned if EU staff left the UK, London could "suck in" Welsh NHS staff.The Welsh Conservatives said a key aim in talks was to ensure healthcare delivery "remains seamless".Mr Fahy outlined issues ranging from potential risks to the NHS budget, workforce shortages and uncertainty over future arrangements for research and medicines."It's going to be very hard, I don't think we should be under any illusions about that - and that's why what kind of Brexit we have really matters," he said.He is the co-author of a report in The Lancet which looks at potential consequences for the NHS from different Brexit scenarios."If we have a soft Brexit - where we remain pretty well integrated within the single market, where we continue to have an ability for EU doctors and nurses to come and work here and feel confident about their future in the country, then I think the impact can be managed and be relatively minor," he said.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nick Fahy said a hard Brexit or 'no deal' could have a devastating impact on NHS Wales "If we have a hard or no deal Brexit, I think the impact risks being catastrophic."He said it posed a "substantial and real threat to healthcare"."We haven't got slack in the NHS; we're not coming at this from a position of strength, but from a position where each winter we breathe a sigh of relief that we managed to make it through without the NHS collapsing and that doesn't give us a situation of reserves we can draw on."Mr Fahy is a specialist adviser to the Commons health committee and has worked for both the Department of Health and European Commission.He said the UK has an "unusually high dependency" on workers from abroad.Although the picture is different in Wales - only 2% of the NHS workforce is from the EU - it could be vulnerable to workers moving elsewhere if EU workers left the south east and London.Mr Fahy said hospitals in London would have to offer more money and the risk is that in the medium term, this will "suck in" health professionals from Wales.Carol Shillabeer, chief executive of Powys health board, said there were already significant recruitment issues and it could be a particular problem for the social care sector, which was "hugely reliant" on EU workers."If we reel forward, what could happen without that workforce, we start to think about sustainability of the social care sector, particularly residential homes, the availability of surgeons; you start to see the workforce eroded even further."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hospital doctor Florin Capatana and nurse Florin Burluc, both from Romania, are asked about uncertainty Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: "Key among the aims in our negotiations with EU partners is to ensure that the delivery of healthcare remains seamless, and that the rights of UK and EU nationals can be guaranteed."Further to this, it is vitally important that the pharmaceutical industry maintains the confidence to continue investing in Wales, and that the regulatory environment is conducive to patients across the UK's four constituent nations having access to the latest medicines."Of course, when we end our relationship with the EU, additional monetary resources will become available for future governments to invest in our hard-pressed NHS services."The Welsh Government paid tribute to NHS workers from the EU and said Brexit posed a number of challenges."We want EU nationals currently working in the NHS in Wales, or those who wish to come here to work, to feel welcome," said a spokesperson."Despite record numbers of frontline NHS staff working in Wales, some professions and speciality fields still face recruitment challenges.Health boards, along with our support, are working to address these challenges."
'Incredible' editing of life's building blocks:::::Image copyright Getty Images Scientists have demonstrated an "incredibly powerful" ability to manipulate the building blocks of life in two separate studies.One altered the order of atoms in DNA to rewrite the human genetic code and the instructions for life.The other edited RNA, which is a chemical cousin of DNA and unlocks the information in the genetic code.The studies - which could eventually treat diseases - have been described as clever, important and exciting.Cystic fibrosis, inherited blindness and other diseases caused by a single typo in the genetic code could ultimately be prevented or treated with such approaches.Both studies were performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.Base editing The first, published in the journal Nature, developed tools called base editors.DNA is built out of the four bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).If a single one of them is in the wrong place, it can cause disease.Base editors alter the molecular structure of one base to convert it into another.Researchers can now manipulate the four bases.And the team used base editing to correct an inherited disease that leads to dangerously high levels of iron in the blood.Prof David Liu of the Broad Institute said: "We are hard at work trying to translate base editing technology into human therapeutics."However, he admits there are still issues around safety and implementation: "Having a machine that can make the change you want to make is only the start.You still need to do all this other work, but having the machine really helps."RNA The second study, published in the journal Science, focused on RNA, another of the molecules essential for life.DNA is the master copy of the genetic code, but in order for a cell to use the genetic instructions, it must first create an RNA copy.It is like going to a library where you cannot read any of the books, but can only use photocopies.The researchers used their RNA approach to correct an inherited form of anaemia in human cells.Feng Zhang - also of the Broad Institute - said: "The ability to correct disease-causing mutations is one of the primary goals of genome editing."This new ability to edit RNA opens up more potential opportunities to... treat many diseases, in almost any kind of cell."All of the experiments were on human cells growing in the laboratory.Dr Helen O'Neill, from UCL, said: "This is an exciting week for genetic research."These papers highlight the fast pace of the field and the continuous improvements being made in genome editing, bringing it closer and closer to the clinic."Scientific advances in genetic engineering are taking place at an incredible pace.And the same technologies work on plants, animals and micro-organisms too, posing questions for areas like agriculture.Dr Sarah Chan, a bioethicist at the University of Edinburgh, said we can no longer pretend the technology is too dangerous to contemplate.She told the BBC: "We can't hide any more."The science is moving fast in the sense it is becoming less risky, more certain, more precise and more effective."It is absolutely past time for us to engage more widely with publics on the issue of gene editing."Follow James on Twitter.

Viking trade in red squirrels may have spread leprosy:::::Image copyright Graeme Hunter Image caption The Vikings traded in red squirrel pelts and meat and the animals were sometimes kept as pets Red squirrels traded by Vikings could have brought leprosy to pre-medieval England, according to archaeologists.Research has revealed that a pre-Norman skull found in Hoxne in Suffolk has a leprosy strain closely related to a type known to affect squirrels.The strain has also been found in Medieval Scandinavian skeletons.Cambridge University's Sarah Inskip said contact with the "highly-prized squirrel pelt and meat" traded by Vikings could have spread the disease.Image copyright Sarah Inskip Image caption Hoxne woman's nasal spine was destroyed by the disease and damage to the skull suggests she would have had extensive facial lesions Radiocarbon dating revealed the woman's skull, which is held at Diss Museum in Norfolk, dates to between 885 and 1015 AD.It has the same strain of leprosy as that identified in skeletal remains found in Medieval Denmark and Sweden.The research, which has been published in the Journal of Medical Microbiology, cites a recent study demonstrating leprosy infection in red squirrels in Brownsea Island in Dorset.DNA sequencing of the Mycobacterium Leprae strain found in the modern animals showed it was closed related to that found in the Hoxne skull.The strain is found in nine-banded armadillos and has caused some human cases of leprosy in Florida.Image copyright Peter Trimming/Flickr Image caption Leprosy affects squirrels in much the same way as humans - with lesions on muzzles, paws and ears Dr Inskip said: "That [leprosy] may also come from squirrels is an interesting idea."King's Lynn and Yarmouth in Norfolk were "significant ports for fur imports" from Denmark and Sweden at this time, she added.The animals were also sometimes kept as pets.The leprosy strain has previously been found in the skeleton of a man from Great Chesterford near Cambridge, dating from 415 to 545 AD, suggesting it had persisted for hundreds of years in south east England.Dr Inskip said: "This new evidence, coupled with the prevalence of leper hospitals in East Anglia from the 11th Century onwards, adds weight to the idea the disease was endemic in this region earlier than other parts of the country."
Daydreaming brain network used in autopilot:::::Image copyright Getty Images The part of the brain associated with daydreaming also allows us to perform tasks on autopilot, a study has found.A collection of brain regions known as the "default mode network" (DMN) is active when we are daydreaming or thinking about the past or future.Cambridge University researchers found it also allows us to switch to autopilot once we are familiar with a task, such as driving a familiar route.There is even hope the findings can help people with mental illness.Previous research has found the DMN is more active during states of rest, and that it can behave abnormally in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).But researchers have remained unclear about its exact role.Switching to manual For the current study, 28 volunteers were asked to match a target card, such as the two of clubs, with one of four cards shown.They had to work out if the cards were supposed to be matched on colour, number or shape through trial and error.Their brain activity was monitored throughout using a scanner.While they were learning the rule, known as the acquisition stage, a part of the brain known as the dorsal attention network was more active.It has been associated with processing information that demands attention.Once they knew the rule and were applying it, the DMN was more active.They were particularly good at the task if their DMN activity was associated with activity in the hippocampus, the part of the brain associated with memory.Lead author Deniz Vatansever says the DMN allows us to predict what is going to happen and reduce our need to think."It is essentially like an autopilot that helps us make fast decisions when we know what the rules of the environment are."So, for example, when you're driving to work in the morning along a familiar route, the default mode network will be active, enabling us to perform our task without having to invest lots of time and energy into every decision."When the environment changes, and no longer conforms to our expectations, Dr Vatansever said our brain enters a "manual mode" that overrides the automatic system, or DMN activity.The researchers hope their findings will help those with mental health disorders - such as addiction, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder who can have automatic thought patterns that drive repeated, unpleasant behaviour.
Why is it so difficult to discover new antibiotics?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sources being checked for new antibiotics include the blood of Komodo dragons Over-reliance on and misuse of antibiotics has led to warnings of a future without effective medicines.Why is it so difficult for scientists to discover new drugs?It's a tale of scientific discovery taught the world over: the serendipitous find of a mould that revolutionised modern medicine.Almost 90 years ago, Alexander Fleming returned from holiday to find Penicillium on Petri dishes left in his basement laboratory at St Mary's Hospital in London.By the 1950s, the golden age of antibiotic discovery, an array of new medicines was being found.Today, scientists are searching for a new breakthrough, testing microbes in sources as diverse as soil, caves and Komodo dragon blood, as well as developing new, lab-made synthetic drugs.Yet despite these remarkable advances, we are running out of effective antibiotics - the drugs that fight infection and are essential for everything from organ transplants to the treatment of food poisoning.Deadly bacteria resistant to penicillin, or the more than 100 different antibiotics since developed, are already killing 700,000 people every year.Unchecked, the global toll could rise to 10 million a year by 2050.If the problem is so serious, why, in this age of incredible medical and scientific endeavour and advance, is it so difficult to get the new antibiotics the world so desperately needs?Racing the superbugs The answer lies partly in scientific challenge and partly in the broken economy of research and development work.Perhaps the less well known part of Fleming's story is the long period of research and collaboration which followed, before, in the 1940s, Penicillium became the world's first antibiotic.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alexander Fleming in his laboratory at St Mary's Hospital Or that Fleming himself cautioned from the earliest days that bacteria could become resistant to drugs.As a patient, antibiotics can seem such a simple treatment for infection, but the pills have a complex relationship with the very bacteria they are designed to destroy.All microorganisms evolve and those that develop defences against antibiotics will survive, while the defenceless will be killed.The more antibiotics we use, the faster the process of bacteria developing resistance becomes.The result of misuse and overuse, in human and animal health, is a continual race to stay ahead of the superbugs.Surprising sources for antibiotics being investigated Years of testing It's easy to find chemicals that kill bacteria.The challenge is that it's much more difficult to discover and develop substances that are not also toxic to humans.The path from discovery to clinically approved medicine is necessarily long and the failure rate is high.The process starts with basic research to identify organisms which produce antibiotic substances.Thousands of possibilities will be screened - a process which in itself can take years.Scientists look at different chemicals, combinations of chemicals and ways to weaken bacteria.Some might try to attack the cell wall; others interfere with the way the bacterial cell functions, or with its metabolism.When a candidate is found this must be tested on known infectious bacteria.Then, if the results are promising, it will be tested for its possible toxicity to humans and must be produced at scale.Only then can the years of clinical trials begin.In total it takes around 10 to 20 years from discovery to medicine.The overuse of antibiotics A fifth of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary, Public Health England says Coughs or bronchitis may take three weeks to clear on their own, but antibiotics reduce that by just one to two days, it says An estimated 5,000 people die in England each year as a result of drug-resistant infections Worldwide, if unaddressed, drug-resistant infections could kill more people than cancer by 2050 Animals consume a large proportion of antibiotics - as much as 80% in the US No new discoveries Of course, with complexity and uncertainty comes cost.This is where the broken economy comes into play.Antibiotics are not only complex to develop, the most innovative new products also cannot be sold freely.Instead, they must be put on the shelf in reserve for serious cases - as is the case with colistin, the "drug of last resort".This doesn't present an appealing investment opportunity, and over the past 30 years pharmaceutical companies have significantly decreased their work developing new antibacterial therapies.No new classes of antibiotics have been invented for decades.In fact, all the antibiotics brought to the market in the past 30 years have been variations on existing drugs discovered by 1984.Most worryingly, it was as long ago as 1962 that the last new class of antibiotics to treat those infected by the most resistant gram-negative superbugs was discovered.These include multi drug-resistant bacteria which can cause severe and often deadly bloodstream infections and pneumonia.They pose a particular threat in hospitals, nursing homes and for patients treated with devices such as ventilators and catheters.Other priorities include increasingly drug-resistant bacteria that cause more common diseases such as gonorrhoea and food poisoning caused by salmonella.In recent years, as awareness of drug-resistant infections has increased and politicians have taken heed of the warnings long given by doctors and scientists, the public and private sectors have begun to work together to find solutions.As of May 2017, a total of 51 antibiotics were in the clinical pipeline - around a third targeting priority pathogens, 12 families of bacteria seen as posing the greatest threat to human health.But only a small number are innovative products - those not based on existing classes of antibiotics.Not just luck New drugs are vital but they are only part of the solution.We also need to explore the potential for vaccines to protect against infection in the first place.Image copyright Getty Images And better, more accurate diagnosis of infections could help doctors know as quickly as possible the best and most appropriate treatments.We also need a better understanding of where drug-resistant infections are spreading, not just in people, but also in animals and the environment.Improving hygiene in hospitals, clinics and communities across the world would help stop infection taking hold in the first place.If we are to succeed in getting and staying ahead of superbugs we cannot rely on Fleming's luck in 1928.More needs to be done to ensure industry and governments work together to test promising treatments and bring them to market.Perhaps most importantly of all, we must give this miraculous and marvellous medicine the respect it deserves.Antibiotics, old and new, are a valuable resource, to be used only when necessary for protecting and improving health.About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.Tim Jinks is head of drug-resistant infections at the Wellcome Trust, which describes itself as a global charitable foundation working to improve health for everyone.The Wellcome Trust is supporting antibiotic discovery through its US partnership, CARB-X.In the past year it has announced funding for 18 projects targeting the most urgent drug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, including eight potential new classes of antibiotics.Edited by Duncan Walker
Share of European Union staff leaving NHS rises following Brexit:::::Image copyright sturti Image caption Experts say England does not yet produce enough home-grown staff for the NHS to meet requirements without workers from abroad The proportion of EU nationals leaving jobs in the NHS is rising, while the share of those joining is shrinking.The BBC analysed NHS Digital figures, which showed the trend in England over the past two-and-a-half years.Health experts say the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June 2016 was behind the trend.The Department of Health says new language requirements for EU nurses may have played a part.The analysis comes days after the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said the health system was "straining at the seams" and faced a "precarious" future, highlighting staff shortages and rising vacancy rates.What do the figures show?In the last full year before the referendum - 2015 - there were 7,535 EU nationals who left NHS Trusts, making up 5.6% of workers of all nationalities leaving their jobs.The following year, EU nationals accounted for 6.6% of all leavers, and in the first six months of this year, they made up 7.4%.The pattern was repeated in 80 NHS Trusts out of 240 across England.The proportion of EU staff joining fell over the same period.In 2015 EU nationals made up 10% of new joiners.In the first six months of 2017, they accounted for 8.2%.That trend was reflected in 62 trusts.Danny Mortimer, co-convenor of the Cavendish Coalition, which represents health and social care organisations, said: "This analysis starts to confirm anecdotal stories we are hearing from our members, especially in the South East."Our members don't feel able to recruit in big numbers."There are practical challenges like the exchange rate [between the pound and the euro] is weak - and the number of people choosing to leave is increasing."The trend was more pronounced when focussing solely on nurses.In the year before the vote, EU nurses made up 7.6% of all the nurses leaving nationally, rising to 11.5% in the first six months of 2017.Almost one in five nurses, 6,299 out of 34,595, joining the NHS in 2015 came from other EU member states.In the first six months of 2017 this had fallen to just one in 10 newly-recruited nurses.One source told the BBC of at least one NHS trust that had abandoned a recruitment fair on the continent due to poor response rates.The General Medical Council surveyed more than 2,000 doctors from the European Economic Area (EEA) in February and of the 60% who said they were thinking of leaving the UK at some point in the future, nine in 10 said the UK's decision to leave the EU was a factor in their considerations.Janet Davies, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: "A nurse who trained in Lyon or Lisbon is as much a part of the NHS family as one trained in London.But sadly, it is no surprise that so many are leaving - few can live with the uncertainty."During the Brexit negotiations, [Prime Minister] Theresa May must reassure nurses from around Europe that they are needed and welcome in the NHS.It would not survive without their contribution."Overall, the NHS says there are around 3,200 more EU nationals working in the NHS than at the time of the referendum, as the size of the health service continues to grow.Over the same period, there has been a slight reduction of 162 nurses, which it suggests may be down to the Nursing and Midwifery Council introducing new language requirements in January 2016, making it more difficult to be eligible for employment.But our analysis shows the growth is slowing.The year-on-year percentage increase in the EU workforce dropped from 16.8% in 2015 to 2.7% in the first six months of 2017.Experts say England does not yet produce enough home-grown staff for the NHS to meet staffing requirements without workers from abroad, although the government wants to make the country "self-sufficient" in training doctors and create thousands more nursing training places to boost the domestic workforce.The Commons Health Select Committee previously began to take evidence on the implications of Brexit but postponed its inquiry when the snap General Election was called for June 2017.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had told the committee the government had stopped short of publishing its own analysis because "the publication of what might be called the worst-case scenario could itself have an impact on negotiations".Dr Andrew Dearden, the treasurer of the British Medical Association, said: "We know that Brexit has already had a huge impact on the morale of EU NHS staff working here.Our own research has shown us that more than four in ten EU NHS staff are considering leaving the UK following the EU referendum result."A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: "There are 3,193 more EU nationals working in the NHS than at the time of the referendum we have been absolutely clear that these staff play a vital role in the NHS and want to see their excellent work continue long after the UK leaves the EU."However, we recognise the NHS also needs more home-grown staff, so we'll be training an extra 1,500 doctors and 10,000 nurses, midwives and allied health professionals a year by 2020 to ensure the NHS has the workforce it needs both now and in the future."Image copyright Reuters Image caption Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has promised more training places for home-grown doctors and nurses Across the UK In Wales, the proportion of EU nationals leaving the NHS was 2.5% the year before the referendum, rising to 3.5% in 2015-16 when the vote took place.It has since returned to 3%.Neither NHS Scotland or The Department of Health in Northern Ireland records the nationality of leavers and joiners.More about this story The Shared Data Hub makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.For more information on methodology, click here.For the full dataset, click here.The figures do not include data for GPs and practice staff or Clinical Commissioning Groups, and concern headcount rather than full-time equivalent posts.
Mental health: 10 charts on the scale of the problem:::::Image copyright Other At any one time, a sixth of the population in England aged 16 to 64 have a mental health problem, according to statistics body NHS Digital.Whether it is family or friends, neighbours or work colleagues, the chances are we all know someone who is affected.And bearing in mind the figure leaves out less common conditions and is a snapshot in time, you could easily argue it is even more prevalent than that.Indeed many do.With Prime Minister Theresa May expected to announce plans to improve care next week, these 10 charts show the extent of the challenge.1.Problems are on the increase It seems to be getting more common - or at least among those with severe symptoms.While the proportion of people affected does not appear to have risen in the past few years, if you go back a little further there has certainly been a steady increase.Evidence from the NHS Digital study in England shows the rise has been driven by an increase in women with illness.Why is this?Undoubtedly some of it is down to people being more willing to report and admit mental health problems.Experts point to the way self-harm in particular is recognised in a way it was not 20 or 30 years ago.But it is also clear 21st Century life is taking its toll on some people.Economic uncertainty, social media, the influence of the media and rising expectations of what life should be like have all been suggested as possible causes.2.Women are now more likely to be affected Women are now much more likely to have a common mental illness.One in five report they have, compared with one in eight men in England.If you include only those with severe symptoms, the difference is less acute, but still apparent.Young people are particularly susceptible.A number of theories have been put forward for this.The economic uncertainty of the past decade has particularly affected the young, making it harder to get on the career ladder.And psychiatrists and mental health campaigners are increasingly raising questions about whether social media increases peer-group pressure and online bullying.Whatever the reason, the one thing experts are agreed on is that the figures are shocking.3.But men are more likely to take their own lives Mental health problems prompt thousands of people to take their own lives.In fact there are about 6,000 suicides in the UK each year and it's the biggest killer of men up to the age of 49.Men account for three-quarters of the total figure.The best overall measure is the number of suicides per 100,000 people.That's because, with a rising population, the absolute figure is almost bound to go up.Since the 1980s, the trend is down.There's quite a big national variation, with England having the lowest suicide rate and Northern Ireland the highest.Scotland and Wales have similar rates and are in the middle.4.Mental health problems tend to start early As already mentioned, mental health problems are particularly common in the young in the UK.In fact, most mental health problems develop in childhood or when a person is a young adult.Three-quarters of problems are established by the age of 24.It is why there is such an emphasis at the moment on addressing childhood mental illness.In 2015, the government promised funding for child and adolescent mental health services would increase.5.Mental health services are the poor relation when it comes to funding Extra money has also been earmarked for adult services in England.Together with the investment in children's services it means by 2020-21 1.28bn more should be spent in real terms than was in 2015-16.Ministers say the money will be used to put mental health services in A&E, more crisis teams in the community and a focus on helping new mothers, with one in five reporting problems in the first year after the birth of their baby.But an analysis last year by the King's Fund health think tank found 40% of mental health trusts in England had actually seen their budgets cut in 2015-16.The government is adamant things will change.They have to.While 23% of NHS activity is taken up by mental illness, mental health trusts have been receiving only about 11% of funding in recent years.Extra investment is being made in the other parts of the UK.Wales and Scotland have both recently unveiled new plans.But like England, mental health remains the poor cousin compared to the spending on physical ailments.6.A nation of pill-poppers?The promise of investment has also been accompanied by a desire to reshape services - and particularly how quickly we can access them.The government established the first set of waiting time targets for the NHS in England in 2016.They mean the health service should be providing access to talking therapies within 18 weeks and treatment for those experiencing their first episode of psychosis within two weeks for at least half of people.Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland all have their own targets too.But drugs are still the most common form of treatment.The number of medicines dispensed for anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic attacks has more than doubled in the past 10 years.An increase in the numbers of people getting antidepressants is clearly a factor.But so too is the fact prescribing patterns have changed.Doctors are much more likely to keep people on drugs for longer with evidence suggesting it is a more effective way of treating patients.But as common as antidepressants are, the fact remains the majority of people with mental illness report they are not getting help.Only one in three of those polled said they were receiving treatment, according to NHS Digital.7.More and more people are being detained With the high rates of non-treatment in mind, it perhaps should not come as a surprise that there is an upwards trend in England in the number of people being detained under the Mental Health Act.Campaigners say patients in crisis are given just enough treatment to stabilise them before being sent home too early to ease pressure on beds.What happens then?They suffer another crisis and are detained again.So some people spend years being detained over and over again without ever getting well.8.A long way from home The pressure on the system also manifests itself in long journeys for treatment.Last year a major report looked at the issue and pointed to thousands of people being sent more than 30 miles for services like acute care, psychiatric intensive care or rehabilitation.In some rural areas, of course, travelling long distances is not that uncommon for all sorts of care.But that's not the point, said the report.Far too many people in towns and cities, where services should be easier to access, are affected, and the situation was "unacceptable".Everyone knows it's a problem.Nobody likes it, and it can be massively disruptive for patients and their families.Yet an awful lot of sufferers of mental ill health travel a long, long way to get treatment.And, according to the British Medical Association, things are getting worse not better.In fact, it says, there's been a "startling rise" in the number of patients being sent out of area for treatment, a rise of nearly 40% between 2014-15 and 2016-17 to 5,876 adults.One patient they found had been sent from Somerset to the Highlands, a journey of 587 miles.9.It's not all bad news...The use of police cells for people in mental health crisis has attracted huge disquiet, not least among officers themselves.In a rare public statement of concern from a senior police chief, Devon and Cornwall Assistant Chief Constable Paul Netherton tweeted "#unacceptable" when a 16-year-old girl was held for two days in a cell in 2015 because no beds were available.That caused quite a stir among officers, patients and distraught families who felt that police cells were the last place someone in a health crisis should be held.But now the use of police cells is down - at least in England and Wales, though figures in Scotland suggest it may have gone up.In England and Wales it has fallen by more than half from 4,500 in 2014-15 to just over 2,000 in 2015-16, according to the National Police Chiefs' Council.The NPCC also says the downward change is even bigger for under 18s to just 43 cases in 2015-16.10.It's Time to Change But perhaps the most promising development in terms of mental health is the changing attitude towards mental illness.A public campaign called Time to Change was launched in 2009 by leading charities Mind and Rethink.It has been supported by the lottery and government along the way - and seems to be working.Latest results from the National Attitudes to Mental Illness Survey, released in May, showed people's willingness to work, live with and live nearby someone with a mental health problem has been improving in England.Campaigners have described the progress as wonderful but warn against complacency.Despite the improvements, nearly nine in 10 people who have had mental health problems report they have suffered stigma and discrimination.For all the positives, there's a long way to go, it seems.
Resignation syndrome: Sweden's mystery illness:::::For nearly two decades Sweden has been battling a mysterious illness.Called Resignation Syndrome, it affects only the children of asylum-seekers, who withdraw completely, ceasing to walk or talk, or open their eyes.Eventually they recover.But why does this only seem to occur in Sweden?When her father picks her up from her wheelchair, nine-year-old Sophie is lifeless.In contrast, her hair is thick and shiny - like a healthy child's.But Sophie's eyes are closed.And under her tracksuit bottoms she wears a nappy.A transparent feeding tube runs into Sophie's nose - this is how she has been nourished for the past 20 months.Sophie and her family are asylum seekers from the former USSR.They arrived in December 2015 and live in accommodation allocated to refugees in a small town in central Sweden."Her blood pressure is quite normal," says Dr Elisabeth Hultcrantz, a volunteer with Doctors of the World."But she has a high pulse rate, so maybe she's reacting to so many people coming to visit her today."Hultcrantz tests Sophie's reflexes.Everything works normally.But the child does not stir.An ENT surgeon before she retired, Hultcrantz is worried because Sophie does not ever open her mouth.This could be dangerous, because if there were a problem with her feeding tube, Sophie could choke.Image caption Elisabeth Hultcrantz: Children disconnect the conscious part of their brain So how could a child who loved to dance become so deeply inert?"When I explain to the parents what has happened, I tell them the world has been so terrible that Sophie has gone into herself and disconnected the conscious part of her brain," says Hultcrantz.The health professionals who treat these children agree that trauma is what has caused them to withdraw from the world.The children who are most vulnerable are those who have witnessed extreme violence - often against their parents - or whose families have fled a deeply insecure environment.To our knowledge, no cases have been established outside of Sweden Karl Sallin, Paediatrician Sophie's parents have a terrifying story of extortion and persecution by a local mafia.In September 2015 their car was stopped by men in police uniform."We were dragged out.Sophie was in the car so she witnessed me and her mother being roughly beaten," remembers Sophie's father.The men let Sophie's mother go - she grabbed her daughter and ran.But Sophie's father did not escape."They took me away and then I don't remember anything," he says.Sophie's mother took her to a friend's home.The little girl was very upset.She cried, shouted "Please go and find my dad!", and beat the wall with her feet.Three days later, her father made contact, and from then on the family remained on the move, hiding in friends' homes until they left for Sweden three months later.On arrival, they were held for hours by Swedish police.Then, quite quickly, Sophie deteriorated."After a couple of days, I noticed she wasn't playing as much as she used to with her sister," says Sophie's mother, who is expecting a new baby next month.Soon afterwards, the family was informed they could not stay in Sweden.Sophie heard everything in that meeting with the Migration Board, and it was at this point that she stopped speaking and eating.Resignation Syndrome was first reported in Sweden in the late 1990s.More than 400 cases were reported in the two years from 2003-2005.As more Swedes began to worry about the consequences of immigration, these "apathetic children", as they were known, became a huge political issue.There were reports the children were faking it, and that parents were poisoning their offspring to secure residence.None of those stories were proven.Over the last decade, the number of children reported to be suffering from Resignation Syndrome has decreased.Sweden's National Board of Health recently stated there were 169 cases in 2015 and 2016.It remains the case that children from particular geographical and ethnic groups are the most vulnerable: those from the former USSR, the Balkans, Roma children, and most recently the Yazidi.Only a tiny number have been unaccompanied migrants, none have been African, and very few have been Asian.Unlike Sophie, the children affected have often been living in Sweden for years, speak the language and are well-adjusted to their new, Nordic lives.Numerous conditions resembling Resignation Syndrome have been reported before - among Nazi concentration camp inmates, for example.In the UK, a similar condition - Pervasive Refusal Syndrome - was identified in children in the early 1990s, but there have been only a tiny handful of cases, and none of them among asylum seekers."To our knowledge, no cases have been established outside of Sweden," writes Dr Karl Sallin, a paediatrician at the Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, part of Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm.Find out more Image caption Sophie's mother, sister and father Listen to Sweden's Child Migrant Mystery on Assignment, on the BBC World Service For transmission times or to catch up online, click here So how can an illness respect national boundaries?There is no definitive answer to that question, says Sallin, who is researching Resignation Syndrome for his PhD.I can't make her better, because as doctors we don't decide if these children can stay in Sweden or not Lars Dagson, Sophie's paediatrician "The most plausible explanation is that there are some sort of socio-cultural factors that are necessary in order for this condition to develop.A certain way of reacting or responding to traumatic events seems to be legitimised in a certain context."So somehow - and we do not know the mechanism for this, and why it should happen in Sweden - the kind of symptoms displayed by the children are culturally sanctioned: this is a way the children are allowed to express their trauma.If that is the case, it raises an interesting question: could Resignation Syndrome be contagious?"That is sort of implicit in the model.That if you provide the right sort of nourishment for those kinds of behaviours in a society, you will also see more cases," says Sallin."If you look at the very first case in 1998 in the north of Sweden, as soon as that case was reported, there were other cases emerging in the same area.And there have also been cases of siblings where first one develops it and then the other.But it should be noted that researchers who proposed that model of disease, they are not certain that there needs to be direct contact between cases.It's a topic for research."Here Sallin hits on the main obstacle to understanding Resignation Syndrome - the lack of research into it.No-one has done follow-up on what happens to these children, but we do know that they survive.For Sophie's parents, that is hard to believe.They have seen no change in their daughter in 20 months.Their days are punctuated by Sophie's regime - exercises to stop her muscles wasting, attempts to engage her with music and cartoons, walks outside in a wheelchair, feeding and changing."You need to harden your heart with these cases," says Sophie's paediatrician, Dr Lars Dagson, who has seen her regularly throughout her illness."I can only keep her alive.I can't make her better, because as doctors we don't decide if these children can stay in Sweden or not."Image caption Annica Carlshamre: This sickness has to do with trauma, not asylum Dagson shares the view commonly held among doctors treating children with Resignation Syndrome, that recovery depends on them feeling secure and that it is a permanent residence permit that kick-starts that process."In some way the child will have to sense that there's hope, something to live for That's the only way I can explain why having the right to stay would, in all the cases I've seen so far, change the situation."Until recently, families with a sick child were allowed to stay.But the arrival of some 300,000 migrants in the last three years has led to a change of heart.Last year, a new temporary law came into force that limits all asylum seekers' chances of being granted permanent residence.Applicants are granted either a three-year or 13-month visa.Sophie's family have the latter, and it expires in March next year."What happens afterwards?The real issue hasn't been dealt with - it's limbo," says Dagson.He doubts Sophie will recover in 13 months."I can't say it's not possible, but it all depends how the parents sense this - are we going to stay after these 13 months?If they're not sure about that, they cannot give Sophie the sense that everything is OK." But evidence from the town of Skara in the south of Sweden suggests that there is a way of curing children with Resignation Syndrome even if the family doesn't receive permanent residence."From our point of view, this particular sickness has to do with former trauma, not asylum," says Annica Carlshamre, a senior social worker for Gryning Health, a company that runs Solsidan, a home for all kinds of troubled children.When children witness violence or threats against a parent, their most significant connection in the world is ripped apart, the carers at Solsidan believe."Then the child understands - my mother can't take care of me," Carlshamre explains."And they give up hope, because they know they are totally dependent on the parent.When that happens, to where or what can the child turn?"We have an expectation that they want to live, and all their abilities are still there Clara Ogren, Solsidan That family connection must be re-built, but first the child must begin to recover, so Solsidan's first step is to separate the children from their parents."We keep the family informed about their progress, but we don't let them talk because the child must depend on our staff.Once we have separated the child, it takes only a few days, until we see the first signs that, yes, she's still there" All conversations about the migration process are banned in front of the child.The children get up every day.They have day clothes and night clothes, and experienced staff like Clara Ogren, help them colour or draw by holding their hands to grip a pencil."We play for them until they can play on their own.And we goof around a lot and dance and listen to music.We want to bring all their senses to life.So we might take a little bit of Coca Cola, and put it in their mouth so they taste something sweet.Even if they are tube-fed, we put them in the kitchen so they smell food," she says."We have an expectation that they want to live, and all their abilities are still there, but they just forgot or lost the sense of using them.This work takes a lot of energy because we have to live for the children until they start to live on their own."The longest time it took for a child to recover was six months.Often the children will have no contact with their parents until they are able to talk to them on the phone.Of the 35 children Calshamre has met over the years, one of them got permission to stay in Sweden while still at Solsidan.The others recovered before their asylum status was assured.A book - The Way Back - has recently been published about Solsidan, but its work is not well-known.Could this kind of treatment help Sophie?Twenty months is a very long time for a child of her age to be disengaged from the world.What do her parents think will aid her recovery?"Maybe the new baby when it comes will help," says Sophie's father.Sophie's mother can only repeat what she has heard from the doctor."In order for Sophie to wake up, the doctor says she and her family should feel safe."Their biggest fear is that they will be deported back to where they came from, and that the men who drove them out will find them."They promised they will kill us.There is nothing more devastating that can happen."In order to protect the family's identity, Sophie's name has been changed Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.
Why opioids are such an American problem:::::Image copyright Getty Images When it comes to taking opioids, the United States has the dubious honour of leading the world.For every one million Americans, almost 50,000 doses of opioids are taken every day.That's four times the rate in the UK.There are often good reasons for taking opioids.Cancer patients use them for pain relief, as do patients recovering from surgery (codeine and morphine are opioids, for example).But take too many and you have a problem.And America certainly has a problem.In two years, the town of Kermit in West Virginia received almost nine million opioid pills, according to a congressional committee.Just 400 people live in Kermit.Nationally, opioids killed more than 33,000 people in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.That figure includes deaths from heroin, an illegal opioid.But almost half involved a prescription opioid - that is, a painkiller available from a pharmacy with a note from a doctor.So why does America - more than any country in the world - have an opioid problem?There is more than one cause.But these are some of the most important.American doctors prescribe - a lot Unlike most European countries, the US does not have universal healthcare paid for by taxes.Instead, Americans must get their own insurance - usually via an employer or the government."Most insurance, especially for poor people, won't pay for anything but a pill," says Professor Judith Feinberg from the West Virginia University School of Medicine."Say you have a patient that's 45 years old.They have lower back pain, you examine them, they have a muscle spasm."Really the best thing is physical therapy, but no one will pay for that.So doctors get very ready to pull out the prescription pad."Even if the insurance covers physical therapy, you probably need prior authorisation (from the insurer) - which is a lot of time and paperwork."The CDC says opioid prescriptions have fallen by 18% from their peak in 2010.But the total is still three times higher than in 1999.'I saw this drug on TV' The US and New Zealand are the only countries that allow prescription drugs to be advertised on television.According to the research firm Kantar, spending on advertising by pharmaceutical companies in the US reached $6.4 billion in 2016 - a rise of 64% since 2012.None of the 10 most-advertised brands in 2016 was an opioid.But mass-marketing of drugs has an effect, says Professor Feinberg."As a clinician, people will come and say 'I saw this on TV - can you give me this drug'."Sometimes they were so confused, they were already on the drug - they were using the brand name, where I used the generic name."In 2015, the American Medical Association called for a ban on adverts for prescription drugs.It didn't happen.Three months later, the extent of America's opioid culture was seen at half-time of the Superbowl - the country's most expensive advertising slot.A 60-second ad was devoted to opioid-induced constipation.The advert - paid for by AstraZeneca - advised sufferers to visit their doctor and "ask about prescription treatment options".President Obama's chief of staff was not impressed.Gifts to doctors In the US, it is common for drug companies to court doctors, in an effort to promote their products."When you're a doctor in the US, these detailing people (salespeople) come in from the industry," says Professor Keith Humphreys from Stanford University."They are invariably smooth, friendly, attractive, sharply dressed, adorable, they're giving out gifts to everybody.They host dinners, they sponsor conferences, they sponsor junkets."That is going to affect prescribing."For the past four years, the US government has published the amounts paid by drug and device companies to doctors and teaching hospitals.The total in 2016 was more than $8bn.More than 630,000 physicians had payment records.For example, Purdue Pharma - which makes OxyContin, a popular opioid painkiller - made almost 80,000 transactions in 2016, worth more than $7m in total.In 2016, a study looked at the link between doctors, the free meals they received from drug companies, and the medication they prescribed.The study found receiving free meals was "associated with an increased rate of prescribing the promoted brand-name medication".Pharmaceutical companies say their reps are merely sharing information with doctors.But Professor Humphreys says there is a "corrupting" influence."We need a pharma industry, it's not that it's wrong," he says."But you can't let the fox guard the hen house."I would create completely clear blue water between the people that manufacture drugs and all the training and operation of the healthcare system."Pharmaceutical companies also spend money on health care workers and organisations in other countries.In the UK in 2016, companies gave 116m ($153m) to health workers and organisations for non-research and development in 2016.But, although the UK figure is 7% higher than in 2015, it is less than 2% of the amount paid in the US.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The grandparents' burden: 'We don't resent the kids - but life's hard' Poor training Dr Richard Frank is professor of health economics at Harvard Business School, and served in the Health Department from 2009 to 2016, during President Obama's administration.He thinks medical training in the US has not been good enough."Physicians have received almost no training in pain management," he says."Until recently they have been under some pretty important misconceptions about how addictive various products are."He adds: "A couple of years ago I testified before congress when I was in government.One of the representatives, before going into congress, was a thoracic surgeon."He noted that he had gotten almost no training in pain management - and what he had learned came entirely from the nursing staff he worked with."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The heroin-ravaged city in West Virginia fighting back against drug companies Dr Frank says medical training isn't the only reason for America's opioid problem."There's plenty of blame to go round," he says.But his criticism is echoed by Professor Judith Feinberg."Doctors didn't learn anything about addiction at medical school," she says."That is now changing, but everyone who's a doctor already, didn't learn anything.I learned about opioid drugs in the part of pharmacology where we learned about anaesthesia."Probably the whole topic of anaesthesia-like drugs was two hours.People don't have much knowledge about opioids.There was no curriculum that includes addiction."Bad science?In 1980, Dr Hershel Jick wrote a short letter to the New England Journal of Medicine.It said that "despite widespread use of narcotic drugs in hospitals, the development of addiction is rare in medical patients with no history of addiction".The claim has been debunked, and the letter now carries an online warning note.But Dr Jick's letter had a big impact.This year, Canadian researchers said the letter had been cited 600 times - usually to claim opioids weren't addictive.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption "We're going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money on the opioid crisis" In the late 1990s the Veterans Health Administration - which runs healthcare for military veterans - pushed for pain to be recognised as the "fifth vital sign".This gave pain equal status with blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature.Then in 2001, the Joint Commission - which certifies almost 21,000 US health organisations and programmes - established standards for pain assessment and treatment.In 2016, the JC released a statement that claimed that "everyone is looking for someone to blame" for the opioid problem.It insisted that its 2001 standards did not "require the use of drugs to manage a patient's pain".But Professor Feinberg says the VHA and JC's moves meant doctors were under pressure to prescribe strong painkillers - such as opioids - when they may not have been necessary."By the time you reach middle age, it's a rare person who doesn't ache somewhere," she says.She adds that - in a country where patients rate their doctors, and low ratings can affect doctors' earnings - the score can be influenced by whether patients receive opioids.A culture of medication Some Americans, says Professor Keith Humphreys from Stanford University, believe that life is "fixable"."I'm 51," he says."If I go to an American doctor and say 'Hey -

Abortion stories: From a 'sense of relief' to a 'broken heart':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Karen shares her thoughts about abortion One in three women will have an abortion in their lifetime, yet it is rarely talked about.For some, making the decision can be traumatic and have a long-lasting effect.For others, it is an empowering, life-changing choice.You have been sharing your experiences of abortion with us 50 years after the 1967 Abortion Act was passed.'I felt relieved, buoyant and really happy' Louise in London: "When I was 23 I found out I was pregnant.I have never regretted having an abortion.It helped cement my views on not wanting children."At first I put my lack of period down to stress.It felt like I had really bad PMT.Then one day at work I had to lie on the floor because I was so tired.I wondered what was wrong with me, and then the penny dropped."I took a pregnancy test in my lunch hour.As soon as I saw the positive result I remember violently shaking.I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time."A colleague who'd been trying to get pregnant was beaming when I told her.When I said it wasn't a good thing for me, she was wonderful.She just gave me a hug."My partner left me to deal with everything on my own.We never had a proper conversation about the abortion.My closest friends were supportive."My GP was matter-of-fact about it.I had two phone interviews with nurses before I went ahead.At no point did they ask me if I thought I was doing the right thing.I was certain.The procedure was excruciatingly painful because I chose not to have an anaesthetic, but it was brief."When I left, the stress I'd been feeling in the run-up to the procedure was gone.I felt relieved, buoyant and really happy."'Abortion changed our lives' Jess is 24 and had an abortion last year.She said she really wants to be a mum one day, but it wasn't the right time for her to have a baby.Bronwen also had an abortion as a young woman in the 1970s.She said it was "a horrible situation" but after the procedure she felt a "huge sense of relief".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bronwen and Jess have had abortions, 40 years apart 'It broke my heart' Beth (not her real name) lives in England: "I was 17 when I got pregnant and I had an abortion in February."I'm pregnant again now and this time I'm going to keep it and I'm excited about it."It was one Christmas, everyone was drinking and I just kept being sick.I thought it was because we were drinking but someone joked that I was pregnant and then I found out I was."My boyfriend didn't really say anything about it and let me make the decision about what to do.My mum was very relaxed and calm and said I should do what I wanted to do."But a lot of people kept telling me that I was too young and not ready to have a baby.I felt very pressured into having an abortion.It broke my heart."I had a breakdown soon afterwards because I was so upset.I felt I'd made the wrong decision but I couldn't do anything about it."My doctor gave me medication and counselling.I have already had depression and anxiety but this just made it worse."Now that I'm pregnant again, my mum and my boyfriend think I should make up my own mind."My baby is due in April and I'm really looking forward to it."'There needs to be education that abortion is OK' Harriet in South West England: "It was a bad experience but you learn from these things."I was 20 when I had an abortion."When I see my friends' kids or nephews I think that I could have had a three-month-old of my own now."When I first found out I was pregnant I was happy and very protective - I thought this is my baby and no one can take it away."My best friend's mum offered to help me and said that I was part of their family but I wanted my own family to say something like that."I didn't have much choice.My dad said it was up to me but he couldn't support me financially.It was true, he was just being honest.I felt it was selfish for me to have a child.A child should have the best upbringing possible."The father didn't want anything to do with it.I feel angry at him for putting me in the position he did.It was like I was forced into a corner and not able to have this baby because I couldn't afford it."It was very upsetting waking up from the anaesthetic.I was over three months so had to have a surgical procedure.It was awful.I woke up wanting to know what had happened to my body, but also not wanting to know."I was crying all the time and now I feel this is what I've done to my first child."The NHS gave me lots of support and lots of time to reconsider.There needs to be education that abortion is OK and it's a woman's choice but there also has to be more support."There is so much stigma attached to it."Advice and information about abortion Marie Stopes UK Life British Pregnancy Advisory Service Brook Sexual health charity FPA Produced by Annie Flury and Sherie Ryder

Reality Check: How much could NHS recover from foreign patients?:::::The claim: The NHS could recover between 200m and 500m annually from foreign patients if a system of charging them in advance for non-emergency care worked perfectly.Reality Check verdict: The NHS recovered 358m in 2016-17 and 500m is the government's target for 2017-18.The NHS may struggle to meet that target, but it is not unreasonable to suggest that amount could be recouped by a perfect system.NHS hospitals in England now have to charge patients from overseas up front for non-emergency care if they are not entitled to free treatment.Dr Mark Porter, from the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 5 live in February 2017 that the amount that could be recovered if the charging system worked perfectly was between 200m and 500m a year.He went on to say that was not very much money in the context of NHS spending and deficits, bearing in mind that the NHS budget in England was 116.4bn in 2015-16.A report - based on 2013 figures - estimates that treating all visitors and migrants in England (not only in hospitals) costs the NHS about 2bn, although it warns there is considerable uncertainty about that figure.That includes treating tourists who become ill while on holiday and longer-term migrants who have paid surcharges on their visas to be entitled to NHS care.Not all of that 2bn could be recovered.Treatment in A&E, for example, is free for everyone up to the point when a patient is either admitted to hospital or given an outpatient appointment.The government does recoup some of the 2bn, although not as much as it would like.It has a target to recoup 500m of the cost of treating overseas visitors by 2017-18.It has made considerable progress towards that goal, increasing the amount recouped from 97m in 2013-14 to 358m in 2016-17.A big proportion of that increase, 210m of it, has come from a health surcharge that must be paid by most students and temporary migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) applying for visas to come to the UK for more than six months.Missing the target Patients from inside the EEA with EHIC cards are generally treated free, with the government applying to their home countries to cover the cost.Those from elsewhere in the world who are not covered by the health surcharge will be charged for the cost of their treatment.Trusts are now allowed to charge 150% of the cost of treatment to patients from outside the EEA.The NHS has not been particularly good at recouping the costs in the past because trusts have not been good at identifying which patients should be charged for their treatment and it is difficult to collect money from patients living outside the EEA once they have returned home.The authorities have also not been particularly good at recouping the costs of treating people from EEA countries.This report from the National Audit Office from October 2016 said that on current trends the NHS would not manage to recover 500m a year by 2017-18, although that was before the announcement of the change to the rules so that non-urgent care must be paid for upfront.The NAO estimated that trusts only manage to recover about half of the amount they invoiced overseas patients.The Department of Health estimated that in 2012-13 the potentially recoverable amount was 367m, but it excluded from that figure the estimated cost of between 100m and 300m for a combination of people who had travelled to England purely to receive urgent treatment and regular visitors who are described as "taking advantage" of the system by registering for GP services and other NHS services to which they are not entitled.All of these figures are estimates.Looking at the bottom end of the range, 200m is too low a figure as it is considerably less than is currently being collected.At the top end, 500m is the government's target - it is not unreasonable to suggest that amount could be collected by a perfect system.This article was originally published on 6 February 2017 and updated on 23 October 2017 with the 2016-17 figures for the amount recouped.Dr Mark Porter ended his term as chair of the BMA in June 2017.Find other Reality Checks here
Chris Kirkland: Former England goalkeeper on dealing with his anxiety:::::Media playback is not supported on this device 'I was in a very dark dark place' - Chris Kirkland on anxiety & depression "I used to think, 'How can you do that to your family?How can you leave them?'After what I have gone through, I can see how it leads to that road and it is scary."Chris Kirkland realised the ambitions of thousands of youngsters by playing in the Premier League and representing his country.But, after leaving Wigan Athletic in 2012, the former Coventry City and Liverpool goalkeeper started to struggle with crippling anxiety.Five years after his battle with depression began, Kirkland, now 36, tells BBC Sport how it affected him and his family.'They lost their husband and dad' Kirkland spent 17 seasons playing professional football, before announcing he was taking time away from the game in August 2016, shortly after joining Bury.The 6ft 6in goalkeeper is a husband to wife Leeona and father to daughter Lucy.It had gone too far.The four years, looking back now, I can't really remember a lot about it.It was just...I wasn't there for Lucy or Leeona.They lost their husband and their dad for four years, which hurts now, really hurts now.That's why I knew I had to do something because I didn't want my daughter growing up without a dad.Me and Leeona have been together for 18 years, she is a wonderful wife and mother.She is the perfect role model and luckily our daughter has taken after her mum.She is great.I knew I had to do something.The way I was going, I was worried where it was going to lead to.My wife was a rock.Until a couple of years ago, she didn't really know the extent of it.I was ashamed, not so much ashamed, but your mind takes over yourself.You are not thinking rationally.You are not really thinking.You are just in a dark cloud.Everything just goes by you.You are dismissive of everything.You don't want to go out.You try to stay in.I even stopped walking the dog, which I have always done.I just felt as though everyone was looking at me when I was out.I just wanted to stay in the house, lock the door, shut the gate and not let anyone in.I put my phone on silent.I didn't call people back.I didn't reply to texts.Normal life just wasn't there anymore for me.I was in this different place and it is not a nice place to be.'A vicious circle' Kirkland, who won his sole England cap in 2006, started his career at Coventry City, before earning a move to Liverpool and then Wigan Athletic, where he played more than 100 times for the Latics.In 2012, however, the goalkeeper signed for Championship side Sheffield Wednesday.It was after that move Kirkland says his anxiety began to take hold.I never wanted to leave Wigan.I loved it there, loved the club.It is local to me as well.I started to struggle with anxiety when I was travelling over to Sheffield Wednesday.I have always been a home person.My family lived in Leicester, Leeona's family lived in Scotland.We have always been together.When I was away from the house I started to panic and started to struggle.Andy Rhodes, the goalkeeping coach at Sheffield Wednesday, if it wasn't for him I would have walked a long time ago.I was playing, which made it a little bit easier because for 90 minutes I managed to put it to one side.Looking back now, it was hard to do it, but you just do.You get through it.I really started struggling during those three years.In the end, I had to leave.I was going to sign again.I was going to sign for another year.They wanted me to stay.I was in my training kit.I was in the gym.I was ready to go upstairs and start the first day of pre-season and just thought 'I can't do it any more'.I didn't tell them.I just told them I needed to be closer to home.I think Andy Rhodes knew, but the club were just a little bit unsure.They told me to take my time and to give it a couple of weeks.I just knew it was the right thing to do.I just wanted to get home at that point.I just wanted to be in the house and shut the door.That is unfortunately the way it went.I didn't want to do anything.I wanted to shut myself off.My head was just...I couldn't think straight.I couldn't wait to get to sleep at night to have a little bit of clear mind.But when I woke up in the morning, it all started again.It was just a vicious circle.'It all escalated - you are not thinking rationally' Kirkland spent six years at Wigan between 2006 and 2012 The night before I started thinking 'I have to be up at this time, I have to travel over, what if there is traffic, what if this and that, what if something comes up after training and we all have to go somewhere and I can't get home.If I leave after a certain time I will hit the traffic and it could take me how long to get home'.Then obviously staying over before matches, which I tried to limit as much as I could.But getting home on Fridays, everyone knows the traffic on Fridays is a nightmare.It all escalated.But you are not thinking straight.You are not being rational.Everything is blown up.It sounds silly but everything is blown up out of proportion because you are not thinking rationally.You just start overthinking everything.Worrying about everything - 'when am I going to get a day off so I can get home'.Sheffield Wednesday were unbelievable.They came up with a routine.Without Andy Rhodes I would have walked - I did initially.I signed at the back end of the 2012 season, so I had all June before pre-season.I went back pre-season and I was going to walk.I rang Andy and said I had to sort one or two things out at home.I told them I had a family issue.But then I went back and they bent over backwards for me.I am glad they did because I had a fantastic three years there, playing wise, apart from what was going on off the pitch.'How far was I from where Gary Speed was?'In November 2011, shortly before Kirkland started his own battle with depression, former Wales midfielder Gary Speed was found dead at his home at the age of 42.The way I was, I was in a bad, bad place.I started thinking how far was I from where Gary Speed was?How was he feeling?I never attempted anything, it never got to that.The most I can say is it probably got to the point where I couldn't wait to get to sleep and I didn't want to wake up in the morning because it all started again.But I don't think that means I wanted to do anything.It just means when I was asleep that was the only time... Getting to sleep was a problem but when I got to sleep you are dozing away.But waking up was not good.So when did Kirkland begin to realise he had to do something about his anxiety?It was when we lost a dear friend of the family, Callum.We had been on holiday with them before.We went to America.It was about 2012.The families were close knit.He had a blood clot on his leg and it all progressed from there.We lost him.I was driving up to York to say a final goodbye and he died when I was on the way up.I never got chance to say goodbye to him, which was hard.I didn't realise just how good a friend he was until he was gone.But it was too late.Seeing the way his family struggled with losing him made me wake up and realise that I didn't want my daughter and my wife to have to go through that.'I rang one night crying my eyes out on the bed' Kirkland turned down an offer to stay at Sheffield Wednesday after three years with the club After a spell at Preston, Kirkland joined Bury in June 2016 on a one-year contract.Things came to a head when the club were away in Portugal for pre-season.I just had to get home.My wife had a hospital appointment.It was nothing serious, I didn't need to be there, but we used it as an excuse to get me home.I just rang one night crying my eyes out on the bed where we were staying saying 'I need to get home'.The manager Dave Flitcroft and Bury were brilliant.The club were fantastic.They gave me a couple of weeks.I wanted to give it a go so I went back.After the third day, I have said it, we were in a little five-a-side and I just wasn't there.I wasn't bothered.I didn't even try, I was that low.I went in and said I need a break, I need to get away.I need help.'I can see light now' That is when I met Simon Barker at the PFA and he put me in touch with Micky Bennett, the PFA's head of player welfare, and it all started from there.Now things are good.It is still an ongoing process but I can see light now.You have got to speak, you have got to talk.Whether it is to the PFA or someone at your club.We are here to try and get more people into clubs to help players.But you have to talk.There are a lot of players, that is why we are doing it.I am sure there is a lot we don't know about as well.It is not just sportspeople, it is people in general.You have got to talk because we have seen what can happen unfortunately, with people taking their own lives.I have seen how it leads to that.Before, 10 or 15 years ago, I used to think 'how can you do that to your family?How can you leave them?'After what I have gone through, I can see how it leads to that road and it is scary.'Once I started talking things seemed a lot clearer' It's ok to talk, don't be ashamed, don't be embarrassed.You'll always get some people who mock you but those people are cowards and should be ashamed of themselves.Make sure you talk.Once I started talking things seemed a lot clearer and there are people there who will help you.I think football realised they have a massive problem on their hands.Enough wasn't being done before, no.The PFA have admitted that.But now they are putting measures in place to make sure the help is there for players.They know they have a big, big problem in the game and they're doing their best now to sort it out.Having seen the positive reaction Kirkland has had to his own story, does he wish he had spoken out sooner?Absolutely, yes.But you are not thinking straight, your mind is not your own.It needed that something to click in.But until it does click in, you are not functioning right at all.You are not living.
Check NHS cancer, A&E and operations targets in your area:::::The NHS is under unprecedented pressure.Rising numbers of patients need hospital care - whether in an accident and emergency department, for cancer treatment or for planned operations and care, such as knee and hip replacements.For each there are strict targets local services are expected to meet across the UK.But what are the chances of being seen in time where you live?Use our interactive tracker to find out.Sorry, your browser is unable to display this content.Please upgrade to a more recent browser.Search for a health trust or postcode Search for your nearest health trusts Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Browse the full list Go Rather search by typing?Back to search Inspection rating: 1.A&E Target hit Target not hit 2.Cancer care Target hit Target not hit 3.Planned ops & care Target hit Target not hit Figures are assessed against targets before rounding Other Trusts When was the target last hit?Other Trusts When was the target last hit?Other Trusts When was the target last hit?If you can't see the tracker, click or tap here.Waits for cancer care, A&E and ops worsen How the NHS Tracker works This guide uses the latest published data on performance against three key NHS waiting-time measures: A&E treatment cancer care planned operations and care, such as knee and hip replacements This data is currently published either monthly or quarterly depending on where you live in the UK, and there are differences between how the targets are measured in each part of the UK.See below for data sources.The A&E target The way the A&E target is measured is almost identical.In each case services across the UK are given four hours in which to treat and discharge or admit or transfer a patient.They are all expected to do that in 95% of cases, although ultimately Scotland wants it services to get to 98% once 95% is achieved.There are also slight differences in the way the start time is measured.The cancer target There are similarities in the way cancer care is measured.Each expects patients to be treated within 62 days of an urgent referral.In Scotland this can be following a GP or A&E referral or following a screening test.Elsewhere it is broken down individually by referral route.So for the rest of the UK the BBC has chosen GP referral as the area to focus on as this is the most common route.Again the thresholds services are expected to achieve vary.The planned operations and care target The one that varies the most is for planned hospital care, which is also known as non-emergency treatment.In England, Wales and Scotland the target measures the point at which you get a referral from your GP to the point when your treatment starts - in effect the whole patient journey.In Scotland and England services have 18 weeks, in Wales it is 26 weeks.Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland there are a range of targets for different parts of the patient journey.The BBC has chosen the last part, from when the decision is taken to admit the patient for treatment to when that treatment starts.It therefore does not include the tests and appointments that follow a GP referral, which can take weeks or even months.Services in Northern Ireland have 13 weeks to achieve this target.The thresholds vary too.None is expected to achieve these goals 100% of the time.In Northern Ireland services have to achieve the target in 55% of cases, whereas in Wales it is 95%, in England 92%, and in Scotland 90%.How local is defined In England data is provided down to individual hospital trust level, some of these run more than one hospital.The BBC has excluded specialist trusts for cancer, children's care, women's services and orthopaedic treatment and instead focused on the 135 general hospital trusts - what most people would consider their local service.Elsewhere performance is broken down to health board level, known as health and care trusts in Northern Ireland.They are in charge of services for a region or large city and often run more than one hospital.We have chosen these boards because while some data is provided down to individual hospital level it is not done across all three targets.How far back performance is tracked The BBC has tracked back performance to the point at which the latest target was set or to when the records allow.When a target has been missed for five years, we have just labelled it as that.When targets have been hit more recently, we have provided the month they were last hit.There are only two targets where it has not been possible to go back five years: in Scotland for A&E as the target threshold was reduced from 98% to 95% in October 2014 in Northern Ireland for planned operations and care because its 13-week target threshold of 55% was set only in April 2016 The full list of dates from which the performance of local services is available are: For England: A&E: June 2010 Cancer: January 2009 Planned operations: April 2012 For Northern Ireland: A&E: April 2008 Cancer: April 2009 Planned operations: April-June 2016 For Scotland: A&E: October 2014 Cancer: January 2012 Planned operations: January 2011 For Wales: A&E: October 2009 Cancer: October-December 2009 Planned operations: September 2011 Research by the BBC data team, Ransome Mpini, John Walton, Christine Jeavans, Nick Triggle and William Dahlgreen.Design by Sumi Senthinathan.Development by Chris Ashton, Evisa Terziu, Becky Rush and Alvin Ourrad.Data sources
'I spent my savings rather than wait for the NHS':::::Hospital services are facing mounting pressure.Staff shortages, rising demand and a squeeze on budgets mean waiting times are rising in many places.And while the health service still sees most patients quickly - whether they turn up at an accident and emergency unit, need cancer treatment or have to have an operation - growing numbers are having to wait longer than they should.So what is it like for those caught up in the system?'I waited so long I gave up and spent most of my life savings' Image copyright Supplied Image caption Christine Moon, pictured here with her partner, Geoff, waited for months for a coronary bypass on the NHS Christine Moon, 66, was on holiday in Bali in 2015 when she started feeling chest pains.When she returned to her home in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, she went to see her GP and ended up in hospital having all number of tests on heart."Eventually, they said, 'I'm very sorry, but we've decided you have a 90% block in your coronary artery,'" she told BBC News.This was in August last year.She then waited until November to see a consultant, who said she needed a coronary bypass but there would be an additional 18-week wait.So, 18 weeks later, she rang the hospital."I was told they were way behind and they had absolutely no idea where I was on the waiting list," Ms Moon told BBC News."No-one at the hospital could tell me when I was likely to have my operation."Every week, patients in more critical need of a bypass were being referred to the hospital, effectively bumping her further down the queue, she said."I couldn't do any housework, I couldn't do stuff that I normally did.My symptoms were getting worse, but I wasn't going to have a heart attack."In April this year, 32 weeks after being diagnosed, she gave up on waiting and paid 16,000 to have the operation privately."I had to think long and hard about it, but it was really hanging over me," Ms Moon told the BBC."I was more and more depressed, and just not able to get an answer out of anyone."Having the operation had given her "bags of energy" and her life back, she said.But, she is angry and has spent much of her savings.Ms Moon told the BBC: "Eighteen weeks seems to be this magic number they come out with that is just lies."Would I still be on a waiting list if I had not gone privately?I may well have been."Search for a health trust or postcode Search for your nearest health trusts Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Browse the full list Go Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker, click or tap here.'Doctors want something they can fix in 10 minutes' Image copyright Supplied Image caption Holly has had many complex health conditions since she was a child Holly Wilson was nine years old when she started seeing doctors on a regular basis.She had a condition where her white blood cells infiltrated her bowel, causing inflammation and pain.Since then, the 22 year-old, from Chichester, has been in and out of hospital."The list is endless," she said, of the number of medical conditions that cause her day-to-day pain.Her entire body is affected, including her connective tissue, joints and gut, and once she had a cyst on her ovary "the size of a grapefruit"."At one point, I was in hospital 30 times in a year," Ms Wilson told the BBC."There are a lot of problems - I'm very, very complicated.I'm always known as the difficult, complex patient."She has noticed waiting times increase, and recently had to wait more than 10 hours for a medical slip to give to her employer to allow her to return to work.Her most recent medical issue is a fast heart rate and palpitations.Doctors are trying to diagnose what is causing it, but it can take up to 18 months between being referred for tests and getting the results."The long wait for this diagnosis - it's a lot of not really knowing, which makes it stressful," Ms Wilson told the BBC."Doctors want something they can fix in 10 minutes.""They're trying to see so many people in such a short amount of time."But Ms Wilson's three folders of medical history do not make this easy."Doctors look at all these notes, and they're just too much for one person to take them in," she said."I don't feel the notes are being read or paid attention to as much as they should be."Ms Wilson doesn't want to "bash the NHS"."They have done a lot for me.Without them I wouldn't be alive," she said."It's just frustrating as I have been in and out of hospital since I was very small and I have noticed the change."'My wait was so long I launched a formal complaint' Image copyright Supplied Image caption Andy Goble waited almost a year for an operation that would fuse his talonavicular joint Andy Goble, 48, had painful arthritis in his feet.He had one foot operated on and then, a couple of years later, in August 2016, doctors said they needed to operate on the other."The idea of the operation is to fuse two bones in the foot to stop them grinding together and stop the pain," he told the BBC.The condition means he struggles to walk any great distance and lives in continual pain.Even though he works from his home, in Southend-on-Sea, the condition has affected his work as a web designer."I am self-employed and find it impossible to work all day," he said."I am also unable to drive much of a distance if I need to visit clients."This is starting to cause me financial problems."The father of two has also had to take painkillers, which tire him out.He waited an "absolute age" to receive a date for the operation, which was then cancelled a week later.And in May, after many phone calls, he decided to launch a formal complaint."Then, all of a sudden, everyone jumps and gets involved," Mr Goble told the BBC.The hospital had "bent over backwards" to get the surgery done, he said, scheduling operations "at weird and wonderful times", with his taking place on a Sunday morning 15 weeks ago.He can now walk again, but his foot remains very painful as it recovers."Because it's not life threatening - it's just pain-relief surgery - you come bottom of the list," he said."It's always the lowest priority.""There is knock-on pain to other joints, such as the knee, hip and back.So, while you're waiting, the condition gets worse and affects your life more and more."'I waited almost six weeks for an urgent appointment when I had late-stage cancer' It was February 2014 when Susan Down, now 65, first thought something was wrong."It was quite sinister what I found, the lump," she told the BBC."I'd had it for quite a few weeks, and it was getting worse."She saw a GP, who gave her creams for piles.A couple of weeks later, when things hadn't improved, the GP gave her a referral for an emergency appointment.Despite it being deemed urgent, her local hospital wasn't as quick to respond as she had expected."I was quite anxious.I kept calling the hospital," Ms Down told the BBC.Five and a half weeks later, she got an appointment."Then they were running around like headless chickens," she said, giving her six different tests over the next fortnight.Her daughters and partner went with her to the appointment.She was told she had stage-four anal cancer and that her tumour was 2.5cm (1in)."It hadn't metastasised, but it was very big and pushing it's way to the front," Ms Down told the BBC."If it had gotten right through to the front, I would've been poisoned."Her diagnosis caused her to retire from her job, as a support worker for adults with learning disabilities.It took a couple of months before she was fitted with a stoma, and then she had to wait a couple more months before she could get radiotherapy."The doctor said, 'Lets get on with it or else you will die,'" Ms Down told the BBC.The radiotherapy machine at her local hospital was not appropriate for her so she had to be treated in a specialist hospital in Hertfordshire, a two-hour drive from her home in Kent.She had six weeks of radiotherapy followed by two weeks of chemotherapy."At first they couldn't say it had shrunk, because it was so big," Ms Down told the BBC."But after a few months they said it as going in the right direction."Looking back I think, That was awful.'"Now, Ms Down spends half her week looking after her one-year-old granddaughter, Charlotte.She appears to be clear of cancer, but has long-term problems from the treatment.

Chimpanzees among 33 breeds selected for special protection:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Species like Chimpanzees seeing large reductions in numbers, there are now 50% less than three generations ago A UN-backed wildlife conference held in the Philippines has voted for additional protections for a list of 33 endangered species including chimpanzees, leopards and giraffes.Whale sharks, the world's largest fish, were also included on the list.The six-day long Convention of Migratory Species (CMS) concluded on Saturday, demanding better protections for species that cross country borders.The group's executive secretary said "everybody has to pitch in" to efforts."It has helped to convey the message that the future of migratory wildlife is integral to our own future and that we all have the responsibility to act," Bradney Chamber said.Governments also made commitments to cooperate on reducing the negative impacts of marine debris, noise pollution and climate change on migratory species.Image copyright AFP/GETTY Image caption Visitors can swim with whale sharks in the Philippines as part of an eco-tourism initiative More than 1,000 delegates from 129 countries debated species' protection at the 12th conference of its kind, backed by the United Nations Environment Programme.China is still not part of the delegation, but organisers said the country had made some advances on animal protection, such as committing to shut-down the ivory trade and banning the serving of endangered species, such as shark fin soup, at government events.Hosts the Philippines lobbied for the inclusion of whale sharks, which have become a tourist attraction for the nation.Three other shark breeds were also included in the list.Ten species of vultures were also singled out for special protection, alongside well-known African mammals deemed to be in danger.Giraffes are on decline on the continent, with only 90,000 thought to be left in the wild.Lesser-known species were also singled out for protection - including the Gobi Bear found in the Gobi desert in Mongolia and China.Organisers said only 45 of them remain in the wild.
Artificial intelligence smart enough to fool Captcha security check:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Computer scientists have developed AI algorithms smart enough to crack Captcha tests Computer scientists have developed artificial intelligence that can outsmart the Captcha website security check system.Captcha challenges people to prove they are human by recognising combinations of letters and numbers that machines would struggle to complete correctly.Researchers developed an algorithm that imitates how the human brain responds to these visual clues.The neural network could identify letters and numbers from their shapes.The research, conducted by Vicarious - a Californian artificial intelligence firm funded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg - is published in the journal Science.What is Captcha?The Captcha test, which means the "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart", was developed in the late 1990s to prevent people from using automated bots to set up fake accounts on websites.When logging into a website, users prove that they are human by solving visual puzzles, which requires identifying letters, digits, symbols or objects that have been distorted or animated in some way.Computers usually struggle to pass such tests, and Google says that its reCaptcha test is so complicated that even humans can only solve it 87% of the time.However, researchers from Vicarious claim that their computer algorithm can pick out distorted letters and digits from images.Neural networks To get computers to recognise images, computer scientists usually use neural networks, which are large networks of computers trained to solve complex problems.A neural network contains hundreds of layers, inspired by the human brain, and each layer examines a different part of the problem.Eventually, the answer from all the layers is combined together to produce one final result.However, neural networks have to be painstakingly trained using thousands of images that have been pre-labelled by humans, which makes it a very arduous task.The team from Vicarious developed Recursive Cortical Network (RCN), a software which mimics actual processes in the human brain while requiring less computing power than a neural network.The human brain has the ability to identify objects even if they are obscured by other objects, by recognising shapes and textures.Vicarious has been developing algorithms for RCN that aim to identify objects by analysing pixels in an image to see if they match the outline of an object.Captcha attacks In 2013, Vicarious announced that it had cracked text-based Captcha tests used by Google, Yahoo, PayPal and Captcha.com with a 90% accuracy.Since then, Captcha designers have made their tests more difficult to beat, but the researchers said in their new paper that the software was now able to pass Google's reCaptcha test 66.6% of the time.The RCN software was also able to solve reCaptacha tests from Captcha generator BotDetect at a 64.4% success rate, Yahoo Captchas at a 57.4% success rate and PayPal at a 57.1% success rate.Image copyright Vicarious / Science Image caption The computer algorithm could crack modern Captcha tests with success rates of more than 50% "We're not seeing attacks on Captcha at the moment, but within three or four months, whatever the researchers have developed will become mainstream, so Captcha's days are numbered," Simon Edwards, a cyber-security architect for data cyber-security firm Trend Micro Europe, told the BBC."The very nature of big data analysis and machine learning is that if you give it enough data to play with, it will eventually work out most things."Mr Edwards said that typically within two months of security flaws being discovered, have-a-go hackers will start attacking every publicly-visible web server they can find, and so it is likely that Captcha tests on websites will soon be under siege."The technology has been around for a long time - there needs to be a better version of Captcha," he said."In my mind, the best form of authentication is two-factor.It's the only real way of getting around these problems."
Dinosaur sported 'bandit mask':::::Image copyright Robert Nicholls Image caption Artwork: Sinosauropteryx probably lived in open environments, under constant threat of predation A dinosaur from China sported a "bandit mask" pattern in the feathers on its face, scientists have said.Researchers came to their conclusion after studying three well-preserved fossil specimens of the extinct creature, called Sinosauropteryx.They were able to discern the dinosaur's colour patterns, showing that it had a banded tail and "counter-shading" - where animals are dark on top and lighter on their underside.The study appears in Current Biology.The bandit mask pattern is seen in numerous animals today, from mammals - such as raccoons and badgers - to birds, such as the nuthatch."This is the first time it's been seen in a dinosaur and, to my knowledge, any extinct animal that shows colour bands," co-author Fiann Smithwick, from Bristol University, told BBC News.Masked avengers?There are a variety of ideas about why animals carry the bandit mask pattern.And the reasons might differ between individual species."In raccoons and badgers, it's an advertisement of the fact that they're aggressive," said Dr Smithwick, adding: "If you're a predator and you mess with them, they're going to fight back.""We think that's probably unlikely in Sinosauropteryx because there's no real anatomical evidence that it could have defended itself well.It's a small dinosaur and quite gracile (lightly built)."It would probably have been fast-moving, but in terms of a physical deterrent that you'd need to back up a signal like that, it doesn't really have one.Image caption One of the specimens used in the study He added: "If you have a non-honest signal like that, you're generally found out pretty quickly in evolutionary terms."Instead, the team thinks the bandit mask served a similar function to the one seen in modern birds - which makes sense given the evolutionary relationship between the two groups.Scientists think one reason birds have it is to reduce glare from light reflected on feathers around the eye.This might be particularly important in environments where there's lots of direct sunlight."The analogy is athletes who paint a dark stripe under their eyes... it's really beneficial for increasing your visual acuity," said Dr Smithwick.But they might also camouflage the eyes, making them harder for predators to spot.Photo inspection Sinosauropteryx is known to have lived between 133 and 120 million years ago in north-eastern China.It was a small feathered dinosaur characterised by a long tail and short arms.The longest specimen is about a metre (three-and-a-half feet) in length."One of these fossils was looked at about seven years ago, by a team that found pigment preserved in the feathers - this was in the form of melanin.This was a particular type of melanin that's known to give 'ginger' or 'rusty-brown' colours in living animals," he explained.Only pigmented feathers were preserved by fossilisation.So parts of the dinosaur's body where they were not found were presumed to be white in life.Co-author Dr Jakob Vinther, also from Bristol University, travelled to China to take very high-resolution photos of the specimens.Some of these were normally lit, but others were taken using cross-polarising filters on the light and the camera.Image copyright Fiann Smithwick Image caption Artwork: The dinosaur had the longest tail of any known theropod dinosaur relative to its body length These filters reduce the glare that comes off the fossil under artificial light, allowing the scientists to see in detail where the dark-pigmented areas were."It essentially allowed us to map out the distribution of the light and dark plumage," said Dr Smithwick.In addition to the bandit mask, the researchers identified counter-shading on the body and a banded tail.These patterns can tell scientists lots about the animal, its behaviour, and habitat.Counter-shading is a common form of camouflage present in modern animals.It balances out the natural patterns of light and shade cast by sunlight, making the creature appear flatter against the background.The particular way that the dinosaur was counter-shaded suggests Sinosauropteryx lived in open habitats, rather than dense forest.Sinosauropteryx could not have held the long tail in a perfectly horizontal position for long periods, which may explain why it's banded rather than counter-shaded.Follow Paul on Twitter.
Call to conserve 'crucial' rare Wales spider species:::::Image copyright NRW Image caption Sand running spiders are found in only three places in Wales Action is needed to conserve Wales' rare spider species, including those which only live underground, a review has found.Some of the 500 species of spiders that live in Wales are found almost nowhere else in the world, according to Natural Resources Wales (NRW).They include cave spiders found in two places in south Wales and sand running spiders on beaches and sand dunes.NRW said spiders were "crucial" to the environment.The review, conducted by NRW in conjunction with the British Arachnological Society, found there were 654 different species of spider in the UK - with almost 500 found in Wales.Of those, 18 species were critically endangered, with 84 species being endangered or vulnerable in Britain.They include: The sand running spider, which is a master of camouflage, found at three locations in Wales, including sand dunes at Morfa Harlech in Gwynedd The cave dwelling spider, found at only two locations in south Wales, which spends its entire life underground The fen raft spider, found at Pant y Sais National Nature Reserve and Crymlyn Bog, Swansea - it is one of Britain's largest spiders, with females measuring 13-22mm and males 10-16mm Rhodri Dafydd, senior reserve manager for NRW, said of the sand running spider: "They're a fantastic looking thing.They're one of the most camouflaged spiders we've got, it looks exactly like a piece of sand so we have our work cut out looking for it."Lots of spiders build webs to catch their prey, the sand running spider runs after its prey.It's one of the hunting spiders."These sand dunes we've got in Wales now are some of the key habitats for them.They require open sandy conditions where they can actively, visually hunt their prey.They get rarer as the habitats get rarer."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Senior reserves manager for Morfa Harlech, Rhodri Dafydd said sand running spiders are 'very rare' Speaking about looking for the spiders, Richard Gallon from the British Arachnological Society said: "On a basic level you're on your hands and knees grubbing around through vegetation looking for them, but there are more technical means as well - we've got a vacuum sampler."It essentially sucks spiders up out of the vegetation so there's no damage to the habitat and you can sort through the spiders alive and then let them go afterwards."Michael Howe, invertebrate ecologist for NRW, said: "Great Britain boasts a huge variety of species of spider."Spiders are crucial to the environment and this assessment highlights the need to take action to prevent further extinctions of our rarest species."
Bloodhound supersonic carries out first public runs:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Bloodhound car is tested ahead of its 1,000mph record attempt The Bloodhound Super Sonic Car has conducted its first public runs.Using just the thrust of its jet engine, the vehicle raced to 210mph (340km/h) down the runway at Newquay Airport in southwest England.Ultimately, Bloodhound will be fitted with a rocket motor as well so that it can go 1,000mph (1,610km/h).That will not happen for two to three years, but the Newquay tests have given the team confidence that the car can achieve its designed performance.Driven by RAF Wing Commander Andy Green, Bloodhound SSC made two trips down Newquay's 1.7-mile (2.7km) runway.Image copyright Getty Images Climb inside Andy Green's cockpit More than 3,000 VIPs and supporters club members were in attendance to see the Eurofighter EJ200 jet engine take the vehicle from a standing start to 200mph in about eight seconds.As well as the ear-splitting noise, the crowd was treated to the bright glare of the engine on reheat."We did two back-to-back 200mph runs in a five-tonne car.It felt like about eight seconds, which was what we were expecting," Wing Commander Green said on stepping out of the cockpit."It was a real hard work-out for the brakes.Probably up to somewhere close to a thousand degrees, the front brakes were smoking furiously after the second run.They just started to flicker with flame - very sort of Formula One, but in a proper high-speed car.And that was exactly what we were hoping for," he told BBC News.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bloodhound: Numbers of the beast These "slow-speed" trials are really at the limit of what can be done here in the UK.To go faster, Bloodhound will have to head abroad.Next year, it hopes to be on Hakskeen Pan in Northern Cape, South Africa.This dried-out lake bed is super-flat and extends for 12 miles (19km), providing ample space to get up to some very high speeds and then slow and stop safely.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bloodhound still awaits its rocket motor which will go in the hole below the jet engine Testing in Newquay these past few weeks makes the team believe the car can attain 650mph (1,050km/h) with just the EJ200.That is not enough to break the world land speed record (763mph/1,227km/h), but it would take the vehicle into a performance region where engineers would learn a lot more about its capabilities.At over 400mph, the wheels can no longer turn as fast as the car moves and act more like the rudders on a boat.And at 650mph, some of the airflows over Bloodhound's body would approach the sound barrier.This is all knowledge needed to go 800mph in 2019, and then up to 1,000mph in 2020 - when the rocket technology becomes available.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Meet Ron Ayers.the 85-year-old aerodynamicist behind the Bloodhound car This is currently being developed by the Norwegian aerospace and defence company Nammo.The Scandinavian firm expects to have two versions available for Bloodhound.The first - a so-called monopropellant motor - should provide sufficient additional thrust to set a new land speed record.The second - what is termed a hybrid motor - will be even more powerful and will be incorporated into Bloodhound following some aerodynamic upgrades to its rear end."The total thrust we think we need is about 20 tonnes.So that's a thrust-to-weight ratio of about two-and-a-half.The car when we're breaking records will weigh about eight tonnes," said Bloodhound technical director, Mark Chapman.One other significant change to the car by then could be the introduction of a major electric component.The rocket will need oxidiser pushed through it and at the moment the motor destined to drive the pump is a V8 from a Jaguar sports car.But such have been the advances in batteries and capacitors in recent years, the team now thinks these technologies could take over the role of the internal combustion engine.The swap might also give more flexibility to engineers as they look to redistribute weight around the car as it targets higher and higher speeds.Image copyright Getty Images Two more days of public running lie ahead.One is on Saturday, for which a few tickets remain.The other is on Monday, organised with Cornwall County Council and aimed at local secondary schools.Education is a primary motivation for the Bloodhound project - to inspire children in their study of STEM subjects.Jess Herbert is a product of this initiative.She won an apprenticeship with Rolls-Royce after Bloodhound got her interested in engineering, and even acts now as one of the project's education ambassadors."The outreach team - they go out to schools and do workshops and presentations," she explained."Recently at Rolls-Royce, we ran a 'bring your daughter to work day', where we built rocket-powered cars inspired by Bloodhound.And it was incredible;

Ancient skull 'oldest tsunami victim':::::Image copyright ARTHUR DURBAND Image caption The skull is thought to be about 6,000 years old An ancient human skull discovered in Papua New Guinea is likely to have belonged to the world's oldest-known tsunami victim, scientists say.The skull was discovered in 1929 near the town of Aitape and incorrectly attributed to the Homo erectus species, an ancestor of modern humans.However, scientists now say the area was once a coastal lagoon that was hit by a tsunami about 6,000 years ago.They believe the skull belonged to a person who died in the tsunami.The discovery came after the international team compared sediments from the area with soil from a nearby region hit by a devastating tsunami in 1998."While the bones had been well studied, little attention had previously been paid to the sediments where they were unearthed," said first author Prof James Goff, from the University of New South Wales.The "geographical similarities" in the sediments showed that humans had experienced tsunamis in the area for thousands of years, he said."We conclude that this person who died there so long ago is probably the oldest-known tsunami victim in the world," said Prof Goff.Image copyright Ethan Cochrane Image caption The discovery was made near the town of Aitape, in Papua New Guinea The scientists said it was also possible that the person had died and been buried just before the tsunami happened.The research involved studying the grain size and composition of the sediments.Among them were microscopic organisms from the ocean, similar to ones found after the 1998 tsunami which killed more than 2,000 people.The team also performed radiocarbon dating, a method used to accurately determine the age of artefacts.Researchers said the findings, published in the journal PLOS One, raise questions about whether other archaeological discoveries in coastal areas should be re-evaluated.
'Incredible' editing of life's building blocks:::::Image copyright Getty Images Scientists have demonstrated an "incredibly powerful" ability to manipulate the building blocks of life in two separate studies.One altered the order of atoms in DNA to rewrite the human genetic code and the instructions for life.The other edited RNA, which is a chemical cousin of DNA and unlocks the information in the genetic code.The studies - which could eventually treat diseases - have been described as clever, important and exciting.Cystic fibrosis, inherited blindness and other diseases caused by a single typo in the genetic code could ultimately be prevented or treated with such approaches.Both studies were performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.Base editing The first, published in the journal Nature, developed tools called base editors.DNA is built out of the four bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).If a single one of them is in the wrong place, it can cause disease.Base editors alter the molecular structure of one base to convert it into another.Researchers can now manipulate the four bases.And the team used base editing to correct an inherited disease that leads to dangerously high levels of iron in the blood.Prof David Liu of the Broad Institute said: "We are hard at work trying to translate base editing technology into human therapeutics."However, he admits there are still issues around safety and implementation: "Having a machine that can make the change you want to make is only the start.You still need to do all this other work, but having the machine really helps."RNA The second study, published in the journal Science, focused on RNA, another of the molecules essential for life.DNA is the master copy of the genetic code, but in order for a cell to use the genetic instructions, it must first create an RNA copy.It is like going to a library where you cannot read any of the books, but can only use photocopies.The researchers used their RNA approach to correct an inherited form of anaemia in human cells.Feng Zhang - also of the Broad Institute - said: "The ability to correct disease-causing mutations is one of the primary goals of genome editing."This new ability to edit RNA opens up more potential opportunities to... treat many diseases, in almost any kind of cell."All of the experiments were on human cells growing in the laboratory.Dr Helen O'Neill, from UCL, said: "This is an exciting week for genetic research."These papers highlight the fast pace of the field and the continuous improvements being made in genome editing, bringing it closer and closer to the clinic."Scientific advances in genetic engineering are taking place at an incredible pace.And the same technologies work on plants, animals and micro-organisms too, posing questions for areas like agriculture.Dr Sarah Chan, a bioethicist at the University of Edinburgh, said we can no longer pretend the technology is too dangerous to contemplate.She told the BBC: "We can't hide any more."The science is moving fast in the sense it is becoming less risky, more certain, more precise and more effective."It is absolutely past time for us to engage more widely with publics on the issue of gene editing."Follow James on Twitter.
Wildlife colonises man-made rockpools:::::Image copyright Aberystwyth University Image caption The little holes trap the water when the sea retreats Mini rock pools are being created by scientists trying to protect sea life from the boom in manmade sea defences.Aberystwyth University researchers have drilled holes the size of a family baked bean can into a breakwater made of smooth granite blocks.The blocks had attracted few intertidal creatures.But the new holes were swiftly colonised by fish, anemones and important reef-building honeycomb worms.The scientists hope that the thousands of miles of manmade sea walls under construction to hold back sea levels will incorporate wildlife-friendly features like this.They have also designed an experimental form of concrete, dubbed Reefcrete.The hope is that this material will attract creatures to colonise sea walls.Conventional sea walls are often inhospitable for sea life because they are smooth; they don't trap water at low tide (unlike a normal rocky shore).They are often also too alkaline.Image copyright Aberystwyth University Image caption Drilling artificial rockpools A simple idea The Reefcrete is made with less cement than usual.It is held together by hemp fibres which act in a similar way to steel re-enforcing bars in buildings.Tests so far have shown that Reefcrete encourages more seaweed to grow than regular sea walls.The seaweed provides a home for a greater variety of animals.Research is continuing to see how the hemp fibres stand up to the test of time.Another form of Reefcrete uses waste shells from a local seafood shelling factory.Discarded shell are classed as waste and must be disposed of in landfill or burned.The scientific team suggests they could be incorporated into sea walls as a binding material instead.The shells would create a rougher surface more suitable for sea life.Image copyright Aberystwyth University Image caption The rockpool project was initiated by PhD student Ally Evans Whilst the Reefcrete tests continue, the clear success story so far has been the holes in the rocks - a project begun three-and-a-half years ago by a PhD student, Ally Evans.She told BBC News: "I'm really happy with the outcomes of this research.It shows that even simple things like drilling holes in boulders can make a difference for marine life."Her supervisor, Dr Pippa Moore, added: "There is a real global issue of governments creating sea defences, sea walls and other coastal infrastructure that are less good for wildlife than the nature they are replacing."We wanted to see if you changed the complexity and increased the number of habitats on this boulder whether that would increase the number of plants and animals that could survive on it."It's definitely worked.What happens is that these rocks are covered at high tide and the little holes trap the water when the sea retreats.It's incredibly simple - and innovative."Just by creating an area where water is retained you can make it more like a rocky shore and less like an artificial structure."Dr Moore has been discussing the findings with the firm proposing the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon scheme."We don't just do this for science's sake," she said."We want to implement this in structures that are being built.We've been talking to companies - and the idea seems to be catching on."Image copyright Aberystwyth University Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin
BBC wrong to not challenge climate sceptic Lord Lawson:::::Image copyright Dan Kitwood Image caption Former Chancellor Lord Lawson's claims on climate change were made on BBC Radio 4's Today programme The BBC should have challenged the views of climate sceptic Lord Lawson in an interview in August, the complaints unit for the corporation has ruled.The ex-chancellor claimed in an interview with the Today programme that "official figures" showed average world temperatures had "slightly declined".This view, shown to be false by the Met Office, was not challenged on air.The BBC admitted it had breached its "guidelines on accuracy and impartiality".Conservative peer Lord Lawson's appearance on Radio 4's flagship Today programme sparked a number of complaints from listeners.He had been invited on to discuss the latest film on climate change by former US Vice President Al Gore.During the interview, Lord Lawson said "official figures" showed that "during this past 10 years, if anything... average world temperature has slightly declined".He also claimed the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had confirmed there had not been an increase in extreme weather events for the last 10 years.Dr Peter Stott, of the Met Office, came on the programme the following day to confirm that Lord Lawson's statistics, which he did not cite at the time, were incorrect.Dr Stott also said the IPCC has clearly indicated an increase in extreme weather events across the globe were linked to human use of fossil fuels.The Global Warming Policy Foundation, a campaign group chaired by Lord Lawson, later confirmed his statistics were "erroneous".The BBC's media editor Amol Rajan said the Today programme had a remit to offer dissenting opinions, aimed at challenging lazy thinking and consensus views.But he said the BBC's complaints department ruled that a lack of scrutiny of Lord Lawson's claims meant the interview fell short of editorial standards.It ruled that the peer's statements "were, at the least, contestable and should have been challenged".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Lord Lawson's claims about climate change are "simply not true", says the Met Office's Peter Stott A paper by Skeptical Science claims that 97% of scientists across the globe believe climate change is caused by humans.In 2014 the BBC Trust stated the corporation has "a duty to reflect the weight of scientific agreement but it should also reflect the existence of critical views appropriately".
Paul Weitz: Skylab and shuttle astronaut dies aged 85:::::Image copyright NASA US astronaut Paul Weitz, who helped save a Nasa space station after it was damaged during launch, has died aged 85.Mr Weitz, who died at a retirement home in Flagstaff, Arizona, also served as the first commander of the space shuttle Challenger.He was a naval aviator before joining Nasa in 1966.He was the pilot on the first mission to Skylab, the US space station which orbited Earth from 1973 to 1979.The orbiting laboratory had been launched without crew on 14 May 1973.But a shield to protect the station from collisions with small meteorites had torn loose during lift-off.Image copyright NASA Image caption Skylab was America's first and only space station Image copyright NASA Image caption A replacement sunshield for Skylab is sewn together in Houston Image copyright NASA Image caption Weitz mans the control and display console of the Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM) on Skylab in 1973 The shield also protected Skylab against extremes of temperature, and without it, the station began to overheat.Mr Weitz and his fellow crew members Pete Conrad and Joseph Kerwin were supposed to launch on 15 May.But Nasa delayed the flight so that the crew could practice repairs on the ground.The astronauts eventually launched on 25 May and approached Skylab in their Apollo command module.Positioning their spacecraft near a jammed solar panel on Skylab, Weitz opened the Apollo module's airlock and extended a 3m (10ft)-long pole designed to free the component.'Dicey times' He tugged hard at the solar panel, while Joe Kerwin held him by the ankles."We thought maybe we'd just break it loose.So we got down near the end of the solar array and I got a hold of it with the shepherd's crook," Mr Weitz said in an interview with Nasa in 2000."But what we really hadn't thought about was, in heaving on it, trying to break the thing free, what I was doing, in effect, I was pulling the command module... in toward [Skylab].""Also, surprising in a totally weightless environment, I was moving [Skylab] some, too, because we could see its thrusters firing to maintain its attitude...So it made for some dicey times."It was clear that the array wasn't going to budge, so the astronauts went back inside the command module.Flying Challenger Image copyright NASA Image caption The crew of STS-6, the first Challenger shuttle flight, pose for a photo.Commander Paul Weitz is seated second from the left Image copyright NASA Image caption The astronauts deployed a satellite from Challenger and carried out a spacewalk during the five-day mission After several failed attempts to dock with the command module, the astronauts finally entered Skylab and successfully deployed a replacement sunshade to lower temperatures inside the lab.Weitz's second flight was in April 1983 as the first commander of the space shuttle Challenger.He was then at the relatively advanced age (in those days) of 51.During their five-day mission, the four crew members successfully deployed a satellite from Challenger and carried out a spacewalk.Just three years later, the shuttle was destroyed in an accident on lift-off which killed all seven astronauts on board.If the Apollo programme had not been cancelled in the early seventies, Mr Weitz might have flown to the Moon - possibly on Apollo 20.Paul J Weitz was born on 25 July 1932 in Erie, Pennsylvania.Follow Paul Rincon on Twitter.
Astrolabe: Shipwreck find 'earliest navigation tool':::::Image copyright Philip Koch Image caption The instrument was once used by mariners to measure the altitude of the Sun during their voyages An artefact excavated from a shipwreck off the coast of Oman has been found to be the oldest known example of a type of navigational tool.Marine archaeologists say the object is an astrolabe, an instrument once used by mariners to measure the altitude of the Sun during their voyages.It is believed to date from between 1495 and 1500.The item was recovered from a Portuguese explorer which sank during a storm in the Indian Ocean in 1503.The boat was called the Esmeralda and was part of a fleet led by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, the first person to sail directly from Europe to India.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Divers uncover 500-year-old Vasco da Gama fleet treasure David Mearns, from Blue Water Recovery, who led the excavation and is the author of The Shipwreck Hunter, told the BBC: "It's a great privilege to find something so rare, something so historically important, something that will be studied by the archaeological community and fills in a gap."The astrolabe was discovered by Mr Mearns in 2014, and was one of nearly 3,000 artefacts recovered during a series of dives.The bronze disc measures 17.5cm in diameter and is less than 2mm thick."It was like nothing else we had seen and I immediately knew it was something very important because you could see it had these two emblems on it," said Mr Mearns."One I recognised immediately as a Portuguese coat of arms... and another which we later discovered was the personal emblem of Don Manuel I, the King of Portugal at the time."The excavation team believed the object was an astrolabe, but they could not see any navigational markings on it.However, a later analysis uncovered its hidden details.Laser scanning work carried out by scientists at the University of Warwick revealed etches around the edge of the disc, each separated by five degrees.Image caption The University of Warwick used laser scans to uncover etches on the astrolabe, which helped navigators work out the height of the sun This would have allowed mariners to measure the height of the sun above the horizon at noon to determine their location so they could find their way on the high seas.Mariners' astrolabes are relatively rare, and this is only the 108th to be confirmed catalogued.It is also the earliest known example by several decades.Mr Mearns said: "We know it had to have been made before 1502, because that's when the ship left Lisbon and Dom Manuel didn't become King until 1495, and this astrolabe wouldn't have carried the emblem of the King unless he was King."I believe it's probably fair to say it dates roughly to between 1495 to 1500.Exactly what year we don't know - but it is in that narrow period."He added: "It rolls back this history by at least 30 years - it adds to evolution, it adds to the history, and hopefully astrolabes from this period can be found."Follow Rebecca Morelle on Twitter.
More acidic oceans 'will affect all sea life':::::Image copyright JAGO-TEAM/GEOMAR Image caption Cold water corals should be more resilient All sea life will be affected because carbon dioxide emissions from modern society are making the oceans more acidic, a major new report will say.The eight-year study from more than 250 scientists finds that infant sea creatures will be especially harmed.This means the number of baby cod growing to adulthood could fall to a quarter or even a 12th of today's numbers, the researchers suggest.The assessment comes from the BIOACID project, which is led from Germany.A brochure summarising the main outcomes will be presented to climate negotiators at their annual meeting, which this year is taking place in Bonn in November.The Biological Impacts of Ocean Acidification report authors say some creatures may benefit directly from the chemical changes - but even these could still be adversely affected indirectly by shifts in the whole food web.What is more, the research shows that changes through acidification will be made worse by climate change, pollution, coastal development, over-fishing and agricultural fertilisers.Ocean acidification is happening because as CO2 from fossil fuels dissolves in seawater, it produces carbonic acid and this lowers the pH of the water.Image copyright Maike Nicolai/GEOMAR Image caption Mesocosms ("giant test tubes") allow scientists to study acidification effects on real-world organisms Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the average pH of global ocean surface waters have fallen from pH 8.2 to 8.1.This represents an increase in acidity of about 26%.The study's lead author is Prof Ulf Riebesell from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel.He is a world authority on the topic and has typically communicated cautiously about the effects of acidification.He told BBC News: "Acidification affects marine life across all groups, although to different degrees."Warm-water corals are generally more sensitive than cold-water corals.Clams and snails are more sensitive than crustaceans."And we found that early life stages are generally more affected than adult organisms."But even if an organism isn't directly harmed by acidification it may be affected indirectly through changes in its habitat or changes in the food web."At the end of the day, these changes will affect the many services the ocean provides to us."On the agenda Since 2009, scientists working under the BIOACID programme have studied how marine creatures are affected by acidification during different life stages; how these reactions reverberate through the marine food web; and whether the challenges can be mitigated by evolutionary adaptation.Some research was done in the lab but other studies were conducted in the North Sea, the Baltic, the Arctic, and Papua New Guinea.A synthesis of more than 350 publications on the effects of ocean acidification - which will be given to climate delegates at next month's summit - reveals that almost half of the marine animal species tested reacted negatively to already moderate increases in seawater CO2 concentrations.Early life stages were affected in Atlantic cod, blue mussels, starfish, sea urchins and sea butterflies.But an experiment with barnacles showed they were not sensitive to acidification.And some plants - like algae which use carbon for photosynthesis - may even benefit.Image copyright MAREK MIS/SPL Image caption Organisms that use calcium carbonate to build their bodies will likely struggle Dr Carol Turley, an ocean acidification expert from Plymouth Marine Labs in the UK described the BIOACID research as enormously important.She told BBC News: "It's contributed enormous insights into the impacts that acidification can have on a wide range of marine organisms from microbes to fish."It's also explored how in combination with ocean warming and other stressors it might play out at the ecosystem level and affect human society."On the lead-up to the UN climate change negotiations in Bonn this November it is clear that the ocean and its ecosystems should not be ignored."The conference is being held in Germany but it is being chaired by Fiji, which wants delegates to give due prominence to the effects of CO2 on the ocean.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin
Ichthyosaur fossil discovered for first time in India:::::Image copyright Courtesy G Prasad Image caption This is the first time an ichthyosaur fossil has been discovered in India Scientists in India have discovered a 152 million-year-old fossil of an ichthyosaur - an extinct marine reptile - in the western state of Gujarat.This is the first time an ichthyosaur fossil has been discovered in India.The fossil was found inside rocks from the Mesozoic Era, which ran between 252 and 66 million years ago, in the Kutch desert.Prof Guntupalli VR Prasad, who led the study, said the 5.5m (18ft) specimen was almost complete.Only parts of the skull and tail bones were found to be missing.The findings have been published in the Plos One science journal."This is a remarkable discovery not only because it is the first Jurassic ichthyosaur record from India, but also it throws light on the evolution and diversity of ichthyosaurs in the Indo-Madagascan region and India's biological connectivity with other continents in the Jurassic," Mr Prasad said.The team, which comprised scientists from India and Germany, believes the newly discovered specimen can be identified with Ophthalmosauridae, a family of ichthyosaurs that lived in the oceans between 165 and 90 million years ago.Ichthyosaurs Image copyright James McKay Often misidentified as "swimming dinosaurs", they first appeared in the early Triassic period (251 million to 199 million years ago) The name means fish-lizard, although the creature has been classified as a reptile since the mid-19th Century Its length ranged from 1m to 14m - although the average length was 2m to 3m The creature was noted for its sharp, robust teeth.Ichthyosaurs became extinct around 90 million years ago.Source: Encyclopaedia of Paleontology.A statement from the team said the identification of the new specimen may further throw light on whether there was any marine connection between India and South America about 150 million years ago.An examination of the teeth of the fossil suggests that it was a top-tier predator in its ecosystem, it added.
Paris accord: US and Syria alone as Nicaragua signs:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Nicaragua has been described as a "renewable energy paradise" Nicaragua has signed the Paris climate agreement, meaning that the US and Syria are the only two countries not to be giving the accord their support.The deal unites the world's nations in tackling climate change.Nicaragua refused to sign it last year, arguing that it did not go far enough to tackle the problem.In June President Donald Trump said the US would withdraw from the deal, but the rules of the agreement state that this cannot be done until 2020.The president said it was part of his "solemn duty to protect America" and he would seek a new deal that would not disadvantage US businesses.Scientists point out that work to implement the Paris accord must be stepped up if it is to have any chance of success.The agreement commits the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels and "endeavour to limit" them even more, to 1.5C.Image copyright AFP Image caption Highly sought-after Nicaraguan coffee is thought to be particularly susceptible to changes in weather patterns Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega indicated last week that he would sign the accord."It is time for Nicaragua to sign the Paris Agreement," Mr Ortega said on the official July 19 website."Scientists from more developed countries, scientists working at Nasa, European scientists, everyone agrees that we must stop the process that is leading to the destruction of the planet," he said.Mr Ortega's government had previously argued that the accord did not put sufficient onus on wealthy countries to tackle climate change and was not ambitious enough in its objectives.Nicaragua has no oil and vigorously pursues green energy policies - more than 50% of its electricity is produced by geothermic, wind, solar, biomass and wave power.It is a country that is believed to be especially at risk from climate change.Image copyright AFP Image caption Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega wants tough action to combat global warming The World Bank described the central American country as "a renewable energy paradise" in 2013.President Trump has argued that the Paris agreement would hobble, disadvantage and impoverish the US, to the benefit of other nations.He claimed in June that the accord would cost the US 6.5 million jobs and $3tn (2.2tn) in lost GDP - while rival economies like China and India were treated more favourably.However, the US more recently has hinted that it may shift its position on withdrawing from the deal.Historically, the US, Europe, and China account for almost half of the world's carbon emissions.Syria is thought not to have signed the deal because it has been preoccupied by its civil war.
Alarm over decline in flying insects:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Losses of rare insects are well documented, but there is little research on insects as a whole It's known as the windscreen phenomenon.When you stop your car after a drive, there seem to be far fewer squashed insects than there used to be.Scientists have long suspected that insects are in dramatic decline, but new evidence confirms this.Research at more than 60 protected areas in Germany suggests flying insects have declined by more than 75% over almost 30 years.And the causes are unknown."This confirms what everybody's been having as a gut feeling - the windscreen phenomenon where you squash fewer bugs as the decades go by," said Caspar Hallmann of Radboud University in The Netherlands."This is the first study that looked into the total biomass of flying insects and it confirms our worries.''The study is based on measurements of the biomass of all insects trapped at 63 nature protection areas in Germany over 27 years since 1989.The data includes thousands of different insects, such as bees, butterflies and moths.Scientists say the dramatic decline was seen regardless of habitat, land use and the weather, leaving them at a loss to explain what was behind it.They stressed the importance of adopting measures known to be beneficial for insects, including strips of flowers around farmland and minimising the effects of intensive agriculture.And they said there was an urgent need to uncover the causes and extent of the decline in all airborne insects."We don't know exactly what the causes are,'' said Hans de Kroon, also of Radboud University, who supervised the research.''This study shows how important it is to have good monitoring programmes and we need more research right now to look into those causes - so, that has really high priority.''The finding was even more worrying given that it was happening in nature reserves, which are meant to protect insects and other living species, the researchers said.''In the modern agricultural landscape, for insects it's a hostile environment, it's a desert, if not worse,'' said Dr de Kroon.''And the decline there has been well documented.The big surprise is that it is also happening in adjacent nature reserves.''Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Insects provide vital services like pollination The loss of insects has far-reaching consequences for entire ecosystems.Insects provide a food source for many birds, amphibians, bats and reptiles, while plants rely on insects for pollination.The decline is more severe than found in previous studies.A survey of insects at four sites in the UK between 1973 and 2002 found losses at one of the four sites only.Dr Lynn Dicks, from the University of East Anglia, UK, who is not connected with the study, said the paper provides new evidence for "an alarming decline" that many entomologists have suspected for some time."If total flying insect biomass is genuinely declining at this rate (around 6% per year), it is extremely concerning," she said."Flying insects have really important ecological functions, for which their numbers matter a lot."The research is published in the journal Plos One.Follow Helen on Twitter.
A brief history of the Earth's CO2:::::Image copyright Getty Images Climate change has been described as one of the biggest problems faced by humankind.Carbon dioxide is is the primary driver of global warming.Prof Joanna Haigh from Imperial College London explains why this gas has played a crucial role in shaping the Earth's climate.Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been present in the atmosphere since the Earth condensed from a ball of hot gases following its formation from the explosion of a huge star about five billion years ago.At that time the atmosphere was mainly composed of nitrogen, CO2 and water vapour, which seeped through cracks in the solid surface.A very similar composition emerges from volcanic eruptions today.As the planet cooled further some of the water vapour condensed out to form oceans and they dissolved a portion of the CO2 but it was still present in the atmosphere in large amounts.Tomorrow's World What is climate change?The first life forms to evolve on Earth were microbes which could survive in this primordial atmosphere but about 2.5 billion years ago, plants developed the ability to photosynthesise, creating glucose and oxygen from CO2 and water in the presence of light from the Sun.This had a transformative impact on the atmosphere: as life developed, CO2 was consumed so that by around 20 million years ago its concentration was down to below 300 molecules in every one million molecules of air (or 300 parts per million - ppm).Image copyright SPL Image caption Artwork: As life developed on Earth, carbon dioxide levels plummeted Life on Earth has evolved under these conditions - note that humans did not appear until about 200,000 years ago - and atmospheric CO2 has not exceed that concentration until the industrial revolution brought with it massive emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels: coal and oil.CO2 plays an important role in climate because it is one of the atmospheric "greenhouse" gases (GHGs) which keep the Earth's surface about 33 degrees warmer than the -18C temperature it would be at were they not present.They do this by being fairly transparent to the Sun's rays, allowing them through to warm the surface, but then absorbing the radiant heat that the surface emits, so trapping it and enhancing the warming.In the present climate the most effective GHGs are water vapour, which is responsible for about two-thirds of the total warming, and CO2 which accounts for about one quarter.Other gases, including methane, make up the remainder.The atmospheric concentration of water vapour is less than 1% and, with CO2 making up only a few molecules in every ten thousand of air, it may be surprising that they can have such a significant impact on the surface temperature.They are able to do this, however, because the structure of their molecules makes them especially effective at absorbing heat radiation while the major atmospheric gases, nitrogen and oxygen, are essentially transparent to it.Image copyright NOAA Image caption This air sampling station at Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii recorded CO2 levels going past 400ppm The greenhouse effect means that as the atmospheric loading of GHGs increases the surface temperature of the Earth warms.The overall increase in global temperature of about 1C over the past 150 years is almost entirely due to the human activities that have increasing amounts of atmospheric GHGs.Most significantly, the concentration of CO2 has been rising exponentially (at a rate of about 0.17% per year) since the industrial revolution, due mainly to the combustion of fossil fuels but also to large-scale tropical deforestation which depletes the climate system's capacity for photosynthesis.In 2015, it passed 400ppm, more than 40% higher than its pre-industrial value of 280ppm and a level that has not existed on Earth for several million years.While the basic science of how GHGs warm the Earth is very well understood, there are complications.The climate system responds in various ways which both enhance and ameliorate the effects of these gases.For example, a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapour (before it condenses out in clouds or rain) and because water vapour is a GHG, this increases the temperature rise.Another example: as the oceans warm they are less able to hold CO2 so release it, again with the result the initial warming is enhanced.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Volcanoes can eject small particles into the upper part of the atmosphere The global temperature record over the past century does not show the same smooth increase presented by CO2 measurements because the climate is influenced by other factors than GHGs, arising from both natural and human sources.Some particles released into the atmosphere by industrial activities reflect sunshine back to space, tending to cool the planet.Similarly, large volcanic eruptions can eject small particles into the higher atmosphere, where they remain for up to about two years reducing the sunlight reaching the surface, and temporary dips in global temperature have indeed been measured following major volcanic events.Changes in the energy emitted by the Sun also affect surface temperature, though measurements of the solar output show this effect to be small on human timescales.Another important consideration in interpreting global temperatures is that the climate is inherently complex.Energy moves between the atmosphere and oceans in natural fluctuations - an example being El Nio events.This means that we cannot expect an immediate direct relationship between any influencing factor and surface temperature.All these factors complicate the picture.Nevertheless, it is indisputable that the global temperature rise over the past century is a result of human-produced GHGs, mainly CO2.While, until the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration has not exceeded the 280ppm value that last occurred several million years ago, it has gone through periods when it was considerably lower.Notably, during the ice ages which have occurred roughly every 100,000 years over at least the past half million, drops in global temperature of perhaps 5C have been accompanied by reductions in CO2 concentration to less than 200ppm.The ice ages, and associated warmer interglacial periods, are brought about by changes in the Earth's orbit around the Sun which take place on these long timescales.The cooling in response to a decline in solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface results in a greater uptake of CO2 by the oceans and so further cooling due to a weakened greenhouse effect.This is an entirely natural phenomenon and it is worth noting that such amplification of temperature fluctuations will occur in response to any initiating factor regardless of its source and including human-produced greenhouse gases.The effects of increasing CO2 are not limited to an increase in air temperature.As the oceans warm they are expanding so producing a rise in sea level, this being exacerbated by the melting of some of the ice present on land near the poles and in glaciers.The warmer atmosphere holds more water vapour resulting in increased occurrences of heavy rainfall and flooding while changes in weather patterns are intensifying droughts in other regions.If human emissions of GHGs into the atmosphere continue unabated then the global temperature will continue to rise and the associated weather impacts become ever more severe.The UN climate conference in Paris in December 2015, at which 195 nations unanimously agreed on an aim to restrict the temperature rise to less than 2C, or preferably 1.5C, above the pre-industrial "baseline" was an extraordinary political achievement.To achieve this, however, will require a complete cessation of global CO2 emissions by the second half of this century and, while the world considers how this might be achieved, the crossing of the 400ppm mark in CO2 concentration has been matched by a global warming of 1C.

I'm 48.And I think I left it such a long time because I kind of lost faith in a lot of the work we see as photojournalists.You lose faith in humanity to some extent."Stirton, who collected his award at a gala dinner at London's Natural History Museum, believes this particular piece of butchery was probably carried out by local people, but working to order.The usual practice is to sell the animal's two horns to a middleman.This individual then smuggles the merchandise out of South Africa, most probably through Mozambique, to China or Vietnam.In those Asian countries rhino horn has a street value higher than gold or cocaine.The trade is driven by the misguided belief that horn - the same material as toenails - can cure everything from cancer to kidney stones.Brent Stirton told BBC News: "For me to win this, for the jury to acknowledge this kind of picture - it's illustrative that we are living in a different time now, that this is a real issue.The sixth age of extinction is a reality and rhinos are just one of many species that we are losing at a hugely accelerated rate and I am grateful that the jury would choose this image because it gives this issue another platform."Image copyright Daniel Nelson/WPY Image caption Danil Nelson is named Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year for this gorilla scene Lewis Blackwell, the chair of judges for WPY, said the rhino image had had a searing impact on his panel: "People may be disgusted, they may be horrified - but it draws you in and you want to know more, you want to know the story behind it.And you can't escape it; it confronts you with what's going on in the world."The rather more peaceful image of a young western lowland gorilla feeding on breadfruit is the subject of the Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year winning entry.This was taken by Danil Nelson from the Netherlands, who entered the picture in the 15-17-years-old category.The gorilla is about nine years old and is called Caco by the trackers who took the young Dutchman to see the ape in Odzala National Park in the Republic of Congo.Western lowland gorillas are critically endangered.Their numbers are being denuded by illegal hunting for bushmeat, disease (notably the Ebola virus), and habitat loss (to mines and oilpalm plantations).Danil, who is now 18, said he first became aware of WPY when he was six."It inspired me immediately, and since then my passions in life have revolved around wildlife, photography and conservation."Some of the other WPY category winners Image copyright Peter Delaney/WPY This image is called Contemplation, taken by Peter Delaney (Ireland/South Africa).It wins the Animal Portraits category.It shows a resting chimpanzee on the forest floor in Uganda's Kibale National Park.Peter is from County Wicklow but WPY inspired him to move to Africa to pursue his photography career.Image copyright Justin Gilligan/WPY Crab surprise is the title of this picture from Justin Gilligan (Australia).It claimed the Invertebrates category.It shows an octopus choosing a meal in a field of giant spider crabs in Mercury Passage off the east coast of Tasmania.Image copyright Tony Wu/WPY Tony Wu (US) calls this The giant gathering.It is the Behaviour: Mammals winner.Tony is a specialist in photographing sperm whales.This huge gathering was captured off Sri Lanka's northeast coast.Very rarely have such scenes been witnessed by cameras.Image copyright Laurent Ballesta/WPY This unusual photo is titled The ice monster.Laurent Ballesta (France) captured the scene in waters off East Antarctica, close to the French Dumont d'Urville scientific base.It shows the underside of an iceberg.It's actually a mosaic of many images stitched together.It won the Earth's Environments category.Image copyright Feelsion Palm-oil survivors is the work of Bertie Gekoski (UK/USA) - the winner of the Wildlife Photojournalist: Single image award.It is taken in eastern Sabah, on the island of Borneo.Three generations of Bornean elephants are seen moving across an oil-palm plantation being cleared for replanting.The palm oil industry has reduced and fragmented the animals' habitat.When the animals stray into plantations they often get shot or poisoned, says Bertie.Image copyright Ekaterina Bee/WPY The grip of the gulls, taken by Ekaterina Bee from Italy.Ekaterina is the winner in the 10 years and under category.She got these herring gulls to play for her camera by throwing some bread for them.Ekaterina is just five-and-a-half years old.WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions of its type in world photography.Started in 1964 by what has since become BBC Wildlife Magazine, it has grown in scale and this year accepted 48,000 entries from 92 countries.The current competition is organised by London's Natural History Museum.An exhibition of the best images opens at the South Kensington institution on Friday.Next year's competition starts taking entries from Monday.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos
'Big, bad wolf' image flawed - scientists:::::Image copyright Rooobert Bayer Image caption Wolves are good at working together to get food rewards New research casts doubt on the idea that dogs are naturally more tolerant and friendly than wolves.In tests of cooperation skills, wolves outperformed their domesticated relatives.Scientists say the findings challenge assumptions about how dogs were tamed from wolves and came to live alongside humans.Previous evidence has suggested that the domestication process may have given dogs a more tolerant temperament."We still have very much this idea of the big, bad wolf and the cuddly pooch on your sofa," Dr Sarah Marshall-Pescini, who led the research, told BBC News."But, I think the simplest message is that the story is not quite as clear as that."Social bonds Wolves are highly social animals.They live in close-knit family groups, raise puppies together and hunt in groups.This sort of behaviour is not seen in modern dogs, despite the idea that domestication selected for dogs that were more tolerant and friendly, both of each other, and humans.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Wolves lavish care on their young To test whether cooperation comes naturally to wolves and dogs, scientists carried out a classic behaviour experiment.Known as the rope-pulling test, it involves two animals simultaneously pulling on a rope to pull a tray towards them to get food.The animals are rewarded with a chunk of raw meat only if they pull the rope together.The scientists found that dogs succeeded at only two of 472 attempts.Wolves, however, managed the task 100 times during 416 attempts.Dr Marshall-Pescini of the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna said wolves "did pretty well" at the task, performing on a par with chimpanzees."[Wolves] are incredibly cooperative with each other and they form very strong social bonds," she said.Dogs almost never worked together on the rope task, possibly because they wished to avoid conflict.The experiment took place at the Wolf Science Center in Vienna, Austria, where wolves and dogs are raised from puppies in the same environment.This gives an insight into the natural behaviour of both animals, away from the influence of humans.Piece of the puzzle Dr Krishna Veeramah of Stony Brook University in New York, who is not connected with the study, said wolves are the only big carnivore that has been domesticated.''It is possible that their social behaviour was key to this process, and thus studies like this help piece together more of the puzzle,'' he explained.The story of how dogs came to be tamed from wolves is complex and hotly debated.Some time around 30,000 years ago, wolves moved to the edges of human camps to scavenge for leftovers.The long process of domestication began to alter the behaviour and genes of wolves and they eventually evolved into the dogs that we know today.New story for domestication of dogs Why dogs are friendly - it's genetic Dogs and wolves are similar in physical appearance, although they have different instincts and temperament.The research, reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), suggests there is more to learn about the effects of domestication.Follow Helen on Twitter.
Bloodhound Diary: Jet engine's stamp of approval:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bloodhound's jet was designed to work in a fighter, not in a car A British team is developing a car that will be capable of reaching 1,000mph (1,610km/h).Powered by a rocket bolted to a Eurofighter-Typhoon jet engine, the vehicle will first mount an assault on the world land speed record (763mph; 1,228km/h).Bloodhound should start running on Hakskeen Pan in Northern Cape, South Africa, in 2019.Bloodhound roared into life right on cue.Several months ago, we committed to getting the car to Newquay Airport at the end of September, to start our "slow speed" (200 mph) UK runway tests.Exactly as planned, at 17:20 local on 28 September, the car's EJ200 jet engine fired up for the first time.Starting the jet engine on schedule is not the half of it, though.Here's the huge surprise.We got FULL REHEAT!You can see a clip of the car's massive power at the top of this page.Image copyright BLOODHOUND SSC Image caption Turns out the intake is big enough after all Reaching full power was completely unexpected, even by the Rolls-Royce team who came down to support our engine tests.The static tie-down engine tests were designed to "characterise" the jet intake.The intake is sized to provide the jet engine with just the right amount of air - at 850 mph.When the car is stationary, or travelling very slowly (anything less than 100mph is "very slow"), there is no "ram effect" from the airflow, and the intake is too small to feed the jet engine with as much air as it would like.As a result, we were pretty certain that the jet would be power-limited, probably quite severely, at slow speeds."Characterising" the intake was all about finding out just how much the engine would be limited.When I pushed the throttle pedal down to its first detent, trying to select "max dry" power (full engine rpm), we were all expecting the engine to struggle and stop short.I couldn't quite believe my eyes when the cockpit instruments showed full dry power.Hardly daring to hope, I pushed the throttle through the detent to select minimum reheat and sure enough, it lit with no problem at all.Maximum reheat?Yes, that worked too.Image copyright BLOODHOUND SSC Image caption Holding it still After shutting the car down, I climbed out to discuss the results with the rest of the team.We've spent years discussing the effects of the expected power limits.How would it affect our runway testing?What speed can we reach in the UK?How will it affect acceleration during record runs in South Africa?We were so concerned about the possible limitations that we even designed the air intake with the option to fit "auxiliary intakes" if necessary.If you look closely at the sides of the car, just behind the intake mouth, you'll see two large square hatches, where we can fit additional intake doors if required.These are now redundant, which is great news.One thing I can't describe to you is what full reheat sounded like outside the car, because I don't know.In the cockpit, I can see the engine instruments showing the power setting, and I can feel the car straining against its 10-tonne-rated steel tie-down cables, but I can't feel or hear the reheat at all.Outside the car it's a different matter.Image copyright BLOODHOUND SSC Image caption Full power - cockpit view After the reheat runs, I asked Mark Elvin what it was like for the rest of the team.Mark is our senior mechanical designer, with a background in both F1 and aerospace, so he's worked with some pretty impressive technology in the past.Even he was struggling to find words for the shattering power of the EJ200.After collecting his thoughts for a moment, he said: "It was just astonishing.Simply astonishing."Now that we've completed the static testing, we need to do some dynamic testing of the car - wheels, brakes, steering, etc - as we prepare for our first big public runs on 26th and 28 October (there are still a few tickets left if you want to come and join us!).With this much power available, I have to confess to being both excited about the amazing performance on offer and a little nervous about controlling it.Image copyright BLOODHOUND SSC Image caption Technology stamps This car is going to be seriously fast and I've got to learn to drive it in a small handful of tests, before our first big (and public) runs.While we're getting the team and the car ready for our big show at the end of October, interest is growing everywhere.A couple of weeks ago I was in the Isle of Man, for a Bloodhound day with the local schools, organised by Swagelok.While the company is a huge multinational, the Isle of Man factory is very proud of its contribution to Bloodhound, as this is where some of the key components of our rocket system were designed and built.As you can imagine, the island's school kids were hugely excited to hear all about the world's fastest car.The Isle of Man post office has joined in the excitement, producing a commemorative set of Bloodhound stamps (joining other countries around the world who have celebrated the Land Speed Record with a set of stamps - did you know that Guinea-Bissau in West Africa has also produced some?No, me neither).One of the Isle of Man stamps is just a plain black silhouette of the Car, which looks a little boring until you rub it - after a few seconds, the thermochromic ink warms up and changes colour, revealing a cutaway diagram of the car.I've never seen a stamp with technology built into it - buy one and try it!Image copyright BLOODHOUND SSC Image caption A global Adventure It's not just youngsters in the Isle of Man that are getting excited.I was amazed to find out this month that a school in rural Zambia has been studying Bloodhound and making their own rocket cars.Our "Engineering Adventure" really is becoming a global event.Bloodhound's long-term aim is to create an "adventure" that will inspire a generation.It's a fact of life that we will only be able to measure our success after we've finished, but it's looking good so far.It's been a great few weeks getting Bloodhound ready to run.Keep watching the Bloodhound website, it won't be long before we're streaming live video and data from the most sophisticated Land Speed Record car ever made.

Stonehenge builders 'ate food from Scotland':::::Image copyright English Heritage/PA The "army of builders" of Stonehenge ate animals brought from as far away as the north east of Scotland, according to a new exhibition at the famous Neolithic site in Wiltshire.Analysis of pig and cattle teeth has revealed some of the animals were from as far as 500 miles away.The "Feast!Food at Stonehenge" exhibition includes the skull of an aurochs, an extinct species of cattle.It is aimed at allowing visitors to explore diet from 4,500 years ago.Image copyright English Heritage/PA English Heritage historian Susan Greany said: "Our exhibition explores the important role feasts and food played at Stonehenge."Raising the ancient stones was an incredible feat but so too was feeding the army of builders."Our exhibition reveals just how this was done."The displays reveal research and stories from a "feeding Stonehenge" project, which has been exploring the lives of the people who lived at the nearby settlement of Durrington Walls.The researchers say thousands of discarded animal bones and teeth excavated at Durrington Walls suggest it was not a typical village but a site of major feasting and ceremony.
Viking trade in red squirrels may have spread leprosy:::::Image copyright Graeme Hunter Image caption The Vikings traded in red squirrel pelts and meat and the animals were sometimes kept as pets Red squirrels traded by Vikings could have brought leprosy to pre-medieval England, according to archaeologists.Research has revealed that a pre-Norman skull found in Hoxne in Suffolk has a leprosy strain closely related to a type known to affect squirrels.The strain has also been found in Medieval Scandinavian skeletons.Cambridge University's Sarah Inskip said contact with the "highly-prized squirrel pelt and meat" traded by Vikings could have spread the disease.Image copyright Sarah Inskip Image caption Hoxne woman's nasal spine was destroyed by the disease and damage to the skull suggests she would have had extensive facial lesions Radiocarbon dating revealed the woman's skull, which is held at Diss Museum in Norfolk, dates to between 885 and 1015 AD.It has the same strain of leprosy as that identified in skeletal remains found in Medieval Denmark and Sweden.The research, which has been published in the Journal of Medical Microbiology, cites a recent study demonstrating leprosy infection in red squirrels in Brownsea Island in Dorset.DNA sequencing of the Mycobacterium Leprae strain found in the modern animals showed it was closed related to that found in the Hoxne skull.The strain is found in nine-banded armadillos and has caused some human cases of leprosy in Florida.Image copyright Peter Trimming/Flickr Image caption Leprosy affects squirrels in much the same way as humans - with lesions on muzzles, paws and ears Dr Inskip said: "That [leprosy] may also come from squirrels is an interesting idea."King's Lynn and Yarmouth in Norfolk were "significant ports for fur imports" from Denmark and Sweden at this time, she added.The animals were also sometimes kept as pets.The leprosy strain has previously been found in the skeleton of a man from Great Chesterford near Cambridge, dating from 415 to 545 AD, suggesting it had persisted for hundreds of years in south east England.Dr Inskip said: "This new evidence, coupled with the prevalence of leper hospitals in East Anglia from the 11th Century onwards, adds weight to the idea the disease was endemic in this region earlier than other parts of the country."
Blue Planet II: The secrets behind the BBC One series:::::Earlier this week, it was reported that some of the close-up shots in Blue Planet II, which returns on Sunday, were filmed in a lab, rather than in the wild.The Guardian said some crucial footage could only have been captured on film in "controlled laboratory conditions".Attenborough defended the use of these shots, saying they are "not in anyway misleading", and makers say the series was overwhelmingly shot on location.It's not the first time this issue has come up - back in 2011, a Frozen Planet programme, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, used some film footage of polar bear cubs in a Dutch animal park.Image copyright BBC NHU Image caption Sir David Attenborough defends use of clips shot in labs One segment of Blue Planet II includes close-up lab footage of coral bleaching, which producers said could only be filmed with lights and specialised cameras.We spoke to executive producer James Honeyborne about how much is filmed in the wild and the techniques involved in capturing those critical moments.How much of Blue Planet II is filmed in studios or other artificial environments?The overwhelming majority of Blue Planet II has been filmed in the wild.Blue Planet II is a natural history series, led by the latest scientific discoveries and we've collaborated with hundreds of scientists around the world's oceans.When working in the field, studying the smaller marine creatures, scientists sometimes set-up marine labs.We've been lucky enough to access these for our 'macro' filming, to bring the full wonder and detail of marine life to our audience.Image copyright BBC NHU Which scenes were these labs used for?In the episode Coasts, we filmed rock pools with a marine lab in Vancouver.To film in the wild would have been too disruptive for the wildlife, and it would have been impossible to film close-ups of this magical world, so we worked with scientists to accurately recreate a rock pool in the controlled conditions of the lab.In the episode Deep, by collaborating with scientists based on a number of research vessels who were sampling the deep sea, we were able to film portraits of creatures such as fangtooth, that would otherwise be impossible to see.Filming took place at sea in pitch-black, refrigerated filming chambers on board the ships.Image copyright BBC NHU Image caption The fangtooth has the largest teeth relative to body size for any fish in the entire ocean.And in the episode Green Seas, the underground burrow of a zebra mantis was recreated by scientists and film makers, to reveal the full story of the mantis shrimp's behaviour.What kind of techniques are used?Macro-filming is done on location - on board boats, or by the coast.We have made short films for those who are interested, and because as you'll see, it's still a real challenge for the filmmakers!You can check out the Making Of... films on the programme page for those who wish to delve deeper into the filming techniques.Why is this necessary?To compile a full portrait of the oceans, we need to tell the amazing story of tiny creatures, as well as the big ones.Sometimes we have to film in controlled conditions to protect the welfare of the animals.In others instances, it's to protect the safety of the scientists and crew.Image copyright BBC NHU Image caption A Blue Planet producer uses a multi-directional hydrophone to record the sounds of the reef Are those techniques flagged up to viewers?The vast majority of our audience prefer for us not to 'break the spell' in the commentary, so we don't explain how we achieved shots during the film itself.And we only have time for one making-of sequence at the end of each episode.We try to choose the one which was the most challenging to achieve, or the one in which the story of the crew's endeavours is most likely to engage the audience.But online, we share in-depth insight into all of our filming techniques, through 'making of' films, blogs, interviews and Q&As.That way we can maintain the trusting relationship with our audience that we enjoy.If not flagged up, are viewers being misled?Absolutely not.On every episode we have a minimum of half a dozen scientific advisors who help us ensure that what we show is true to nature.That's the point of it all.To represent nature the best we can.Blue Planet II returns to BBC One from Sunday.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
How science transformed the world in 100 years:::::Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Discovering the structure of DNA was a "big moment" in science In an essay for the BBC, Nobel Prize-winner and Royal Society President Sir Venki Ramakrishnan contemplates the nature of scientific discovery - how it has transformed our worldview in a short space of time, and why we need to be just as watchful today about the uses of research as we've ever been.If we could miraculously transport even the smartest people from around 1900 to today's world, they would be simply astonished at how we now understand things that had puzzled humans for centuries.Just over a hundred years ago, people had no idea how we inherit and pass on traits or how a single cell could grow into an organism.They didn't know that atoms themselves had structure - the word itself means indivisible.They didn't know that matter has very strange properties that defy common sense.Or why there is gravity.And they had no idea how things began, whether it was life on earth or the universe itself.BBC Tomorrow's World These days because of fundamental discoveries we can answer or at least begin to answer those mysteries.That has transformed the way we see the world and often our everyday lives.Much of what we take for granted today is a result of an interplay of fundamental science and technology, with each driving the other forward.Image copyright Royal Society Image caption Modern inventions often rely on discoveries that are a few hundred years old, says Venki Ramakrishnan Almost every modern invention has one or often many fundamental discoveries that make it possible.Sometimes, these fundamental discoveries were hundreds of years old.Neither jet engines nor rockets would be possible without a knowledge of Newton's laws of motion.There are big moments in science, like the discovery of the structure of DNA that shift our perspectives.But even that discovery was a milestone that built on work by Darwin and Mendel and presaged today's biotechnology where the entire DNA of a human being - the human genome - has been sequenced.Global change calculator Image copyright MARK GARLICK/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Which groundbreaking discovery was uncovered in your life time?Find out with the Tomorrow's World Global Change Calculator.That in turn has given us the ability to figure out how things go wrong in genetic diseases and potentially how to fix them.Scientists were recently able to modify the genes of a young girl to cure her cancer.We are no longer a complete black box, although our complexity is such that we are only just beginning to understand how our genes regulate the body and how they interact with our environment.Image copyright SPL Image caption We were able to work out that the Universe began with a Big Bang from a single point Genetic technologies are likely to present society with some big questions about how we see ourselves and what we want to use our greater understanding and capability for.That is also true of the Big Bang theory of how the Universe came into existence.A hundred years ago mysteries such as how the Universe came to exist were, for many, firmly in the realms of faith.Spurred on by the observation that the Universe is not constant, but galaxies are always expanding away from each other, we were able to work out that the Universe began with a Big Bang from a single point.This knowledge gives us insight into perhaps what is the biggest question of all - where did everything come from?That insight makes our small blue dot seem increasingly small, yet our quest for knowledge of what is out there shows no signs of an inferiority complex.Image copyright NASA Image caption Advances in space exploration have made us more inquisitive about the great unknown From the Apollo missions to the Cassini probe, the Hubble telescope to the search for gravitational waves and exoplanets - all of those breakthroughs seem to be making us more inquisitive about space.Today, much of how we see the world is through an electronic screen.Computers in all their many guises are sources of knowledge, but they are also increasingly how we present ourselves to the rest of the world, and how we interact with others.Even a ubiquitous object like a smartphone depends on many fundamental discoveries.Its powerful computer depends on integrated chips made up of transistors, whose discovery depended on an understanding of quantum mechanics.The GPS in a smart phone depends on correcting the time from satellites using both the special and general theories of relativity - theories that people once thought would have no practical value.I wonder how many understand all the discoveries that make the little box work.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Machines that learn have led to the first driverless cars Computers are also driving developments that will continue to challenge our view of the world.Machines that learn are already among us and are changing the world in which we live.They offer great potential in areas including healthcare and improving other public services, and may soon result in driverless cars and very sophisticated robots, but we need to make conscious decisions about how we want smart machines to allow humanity to flourish.Discoveries themselves are morally neutral, but the use we make of them are not.One discovery that shifted our view of the world in two distinctly divergent directions was nuclear fission.Its discovery led to the development of the most destructive weapons known.Some argue that the fear of destruction has been a powerful motivator for peace, but this is hardly a stable solution as can be seen with today's situation with North Korea.On the other hand, nuclear fission also promised a reliable source of energy that was once optimistically predicted to be 'too cheap to meter'.Image copyright AFP Image caption The fear of destruction may have acted as a deterrent once, but may not be a stable situation Science is the pursuit of knowledge about ourselves and the world around us.That pursuit of knowledge has also shaped the way we view the world, as has the application of the knowledge.It has transformed our lives, generally for the better.We live nearly twice as long today as our ancestors did in 1900 and the quality of our lives is far better than it was then.But the uses of science and technology are not shaped by science and scientists alone.They depend on an interplay of cultural, economic and political factors.Science is a triumph of human knowledge and we can all share in its excitement.At the same time, understanding its many uses can help us be engaged in decisions that affect us all.
The place spacecraft go to die:::::Image copyright china manned space engineering Image caption China's Tiangong I spacecraft is expected to fall to Earth soon China's Tiangong-1 space station is currently out of control and expected to fall back to Earth next year.But not in the remote place where many other spacecraft end their days.Explorers and adventurers often look for new places to conquer now that the highest peaks have been climbed, the poles reached and vast oceans and deserts crossed.Some of these new places are called the poles of inaccessibility.Two of them are particularly interesting.One is called the continental pole of inaccessibility - it's the place on Earth furthest from the ocean.There is some debate as to its exact position but it's considered by many to be near the so-called Dzungarian Gate - a mountain pass between China and Central Asia.The equivalent point in the ocean - the place furthest away from land - lies in the South Pacific some 2,700km (1,680 miles) south of the Pitcairn Islands - somewhere in the no-man's land, or rather no-man's-sea, between Australia, New Zealand and South America.This oceanic pole of inaccessibility is not only of interest to explorers, satellite operators are interested in it as well.That's because most of the satellites placed in orbit around the Earth will eventually come down, but where?Smaller satellites will burn up but pieces of the larger ones will survive to reach the Earth's surface.To avoid crashing on a populated area they are brought down near the point of oceanic inaccessibility.Scattered over an area of approximately 1,500 sq km (580 sq miles) on the ocean floor of this region is a graveyard of satellites.At last count there were more than 260 of them, mostly Russian.The wreckage of the Mir space station lies there.It was launched in 1986 and was visited by many teams of cosmonauts and international visitors.With a mass of 120 tonnes it was never going to burn up in the atmosphere, so it was ditched in the region in 2001 and was seen by some fishermen as a fragmenting mass of glowing debris racing across the sky.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A computer-simulated image of Mir's descent and break-up as it entered the Earth's atmosphere in 2001 Many times a year the supply module that goes to the International Space Station burns up in this region incinerating the station's waste.No one is in any danger because of this controlled re-entry into our atmosphere.The region is not fished because oceanic currents avoid the area and do not bring nutrients to it, making marine life scarce.One future visitor to this desolate place will be the International Space Station.Current plans are for it to be decommissioned in the next decade and it will have to be carefully brought down in the oceanic pole of inaccessibility.With a mass of 450 tonnes - four times that of the Mir space station - it will make a spectacular sight.Sometimes however, it's not possible to bring a satellite or space station down in the South Pacific if ground controllers have lost contact with it.Image copyright NASA Image caption The Earth is surrounded by thousands of pieces of space junk (dots not to scale) Such a thing happened with the 36-tonne Salyut 7 space station in 1991 which came down in South America or the American Skylab that struck Australia in 1979.No one on the ground was injured, or indeed as far as we know, ever has been by a piece of falling spacecraft debris.We will face that problem again next year.Between January and April the Chinese Tiangong-1 will come back to Earth.It was launched in 2011 as China's first space station.The following year it was visited by China's first female astronaut, Liu Yang.Tiangong-1's orbit is decaying as it heads towards re-entry.But Chinese engineers have lost control of it and cannot fire its thrusters to bring it down in the South Pacific.Instead it will come down somewhere between 42.8 degrees north and south.That's between the latitude of northern Spain and southern Australia, and we won't be able to be more precise than that until just a few hours before it burns up.Tiangong-1 is one space station that probably won't join its companions in the remote South Pacific.Dr David Whitehouse was the BBC's science correspondent from 1988 until 2006, and is a former science editor at the BBC News website.
Can we make fashion greener?:::::Image copyright MIGUEL MEDINA Image caption For big labels, Milan's Fall fashion week is a major event in the calendar We continue to buy new clothes at an incredible rate.How can manufacturers reduce fashion's environmental footprint?According to the Valuing Our Clothes report analysing the contents of British wardrobes by the Waste Resources Action Programme (WRAP), we purchased 1,130,000 tonnes of new clothing last year in the UK.Meanwhile, an estimated 30bn worth of our clothing hangs about gathering dust because we simply don't have time to wear it all or don't really like what we're buying.This is the epoch of "fast fashion" - a rapid production system that promises quick turnaround of trends and low prices, with a supply chain that snakes through some of the lowest wage economies on Earth.Fast fashion brands dominate not just high streets, but our wardrobes and represent the three trillion dollar global fashion industry's greatest success story.But at what cost?The environmental footprint of today's fashion industry is extraordinary, making it one of the top five most polluting industries on earth, alongside the petrochemical industry.Many fashion industry insiders are seriously worried, not necessarily because they fret over greenhouse gases caused by the supply chain, but because there is now so much over-supply of fashion that it's becoming difficult to have a successful season - particularly as we now have 50 seasons rather than the traditional two of spring/summer and autumn/winter.Some commentators refer to today's relentless cycle as a "supermarket of style".Cause for optimism?But according to fashion theory, there are 101 steps to producing a garment from processes such as dyeing and finishing to pressing the garment ready for retail.If you're a pessimist that's 101 chances to introduce pollution, exploitation and planetary degradation.If however you're an optimist, that's 101 opportunities to take the impact out of fashion!So for a new episode of BBC Radio 4's Costing the Earth, I travelled to Milan Fashion week to meet some disruptors (and definitely optimists) who believe we are on the cusp of a green revolution that can turn the industry around.At the Green Carpet Fashion Awards Italia, that took place at the famous La Scala opera theatre during Milan Fashion Week it was difficult not to be blinded by the super star wattage pacing the deliberately "green" carpet (manufactured from old fishing nets and carpets).Image copyright Anne-Marie Bullock Image caption The Green Carpet Fashion Awards honour disruptors who try to reduce fashion's environmental footprint Image copyright Eco Age Image caption The awards were held in the magnificent La Scala opera house But among the stars - Gisele Bundchen, Naomi Campbell, Colin Firth, Giorgio Armani were all in attendance - were a number of eco innovation show stoppers.One model wore an eye catching dress made from apple leather and creating by emerging designer, Matje Benedetti who explained how waste apple pulp from the apple industry is mixed with polyurethane to develop the fibre.The inclusion of ecological innovative fibres at this level - awards on the night also went to Orange Fibre, a company spinning yarn from citrus waste - points to serious investment in revolutionary new materials.Silky skills Case and point is provided by New York biotech start-up Modern Meadows.Here biologists work alongside creative director, Suzanne Lee and fermentation engineers to bio-fabricate leather in the laboratory.This research and development promises a future where cows will not be required for a handbag and where fashion design intersects with biology.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some in the fashion industry are looking at other options for producing fabrics Meanwhile, Californian start up Bolt Threads has raised millions of dollars to bring its brewed spider silk to market (Stella McCartney has designed with the material) and fashion entrepreneur Miroslava Duma recently launched a $50 million fund and accelerator dedicated to bringing new sustainable fibres and fabrics to market.In many ways this fibre revolution is long overdue.The fashion industry, for all its claims of being cutting edge, is remarkably conservative when it comes to fabrics.Humanity is almost exclusive clothed in polyester and cotton fibres, both of which have shocking environmental profiles.This also means that the last significant innovation in materials was polyester, circa 1943!3D printing But what we're also seeing here are levels of and investment in disruptive technology and innovation that have previously been applied to the technology and transport sector, applied to fashion.This is potentially a game changer.However, we do still need to address the issue of our own over consumption, an area where we've made little headway.But there's innovation here too: designer Danit Peleg 3D prints her collections and thinks in the foreseeable future we will be able to effectively design out shopping for fashion by 3D printing to order.It's another innovation to get excited by and a disruption that could represent an enormous gift to the biosphere given the impact of our consumption.But I'd have to concede it's early days for all of this innovation.Image copyright Reuters Image caption The evening was attended by a host of stars of the fashion industry So amid such headline-grabbing, tech-fuelled disruption is there a more immediate, human, low-tech answer right in front of us?Psychologist Professor Carolyn Mair has observed that we're inclined to keep stuff circulating in our wardrobe to which we've attached a strong personal narrative.Mair told me about her favourite example: "a pair of lucky pants".Many people secretly own a pair to which they attach talismanic significance and they have huge longevity!Behaviours like these can turn fashion green.WRAP research shows that extending the life of clothes by an extra nine months of active use, in the UK, reduces the carbon, water and waste impacts of that garment by around 20-30%.Standby then for a wardrobe future where you'll be able to access cutting edge bio-fabricated novel material that's been 3D printed in a pair of very lucky pants.That's what I call fashion forward.Costing the Earth is available now and on BBC Radio 4 on Thursday 11th Oct at 9pm
How do you build the next-generation internet?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Scientists are now developing an ultra-fast quantum internet that will be partly based on light Imagine super-fast computers that can solve problems much quicker than machines today.These "quantum computers" are being developed in laboratories around the world.But scientists have already taken the next step, and are thinking about a light-based quantum internet that will have to be just as fast.It's not easy to develop technology for a device that hasn't technically been invented yet, but quantum communications is an attractive field of research because the technology will enable us to send messages that are much more secure.There are several problems that will need to be solved in order to make a quantum internet possible: Getting quantum computers to talk to each other Making communications secure from hacking Transmitting messages over long distances without losing parts of the message; and Routing messages across a quantum network What is a quantum computer?A quantum computer is a machine that is able to crack very tough computation problems with incredible speed - beyond that of today's "classical" computers.In conventional computers, the unit of information is called a "bit" and can have a value of either 1 or 0.But its equivalent in a quantum system - the qubit (quantum bit) - can be both 1 and 0 at the same time.This phenomenon opens the door for multiple calculations to be performed simultaneously.However, qubits need to be synchronised using a quantum effect known as entanglement, which Albert Einstein termed "spooky action at a distance".There are four types of quantum computers currently being developed, which use: Light particles Trapped ions Superconducting qubits Nitrogen vacancy centres in diamonds Quantum computers will enable a multitude of useful applications, such as being able to model many variations of a chemical reaction to discover new medications; developing new imaging technologies for healthcare to better detect problems in the body; or to speed up how we design batteries, new materials and flexible electronics.Pooling computing power Quantum computers might be more powerful than classical computers, but some applications will require even more computing power than one quantum computer can provide on its own.If you can get quantum devices to talk to each other, then you could connect several quantum computers together and pool their power to form one huge quantum computer.However, since there are four different types of quantum computers being built today, they won't be all be able to talk to each other without some help.Some scientists favour a quantum internet based entirely on light particles (photons), while others believe that it would be easier to make quantum networks where light interacts with matter."Light is better for communications, but matter qubits are better for processing," Joseph Fitzsimons, a principal investigator at the National University of Singapore's Centre of Quantum Technologies tells the BBC."You need both to make the network work to establish error correction of the signal, but it can be difficult to make them interact."It is very expensive and difficult to store all information in photons, Mr Fitzsimons says, because photons can't see each other and pass straight by, rather than bouncing off each other.Instead, he believes it would be easier to use light for communications, while storing information using electrons or atoms (in matter).Quantum encryption Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Quantum encryption will make communications much more secure One of the key applications of the quantum internet will be quantum key distribution (QKD), whereby a secret key is generated using a pair of entangled photons, and is then used to encrypt information in a way that is impossible for a quantum computer to crack.This technology already exists, and was first demonstrated in space by a team of researchers from the National University of Singapore and the University of Strathclyde, UK, in December 2015.But it's not just the encryption that we will need to build in order to secure our information in the quantum future.Scientists are also working on "blind quantum computer protocols", because they allow the user to hide anything they want on a computer."You can write something, send it to a remote computer and the person who owns the computer can't tell anything about it at all except how long it took to run and how much memory it used," says Mr Fitzsimons."This is important because there likely won't be many quantum computers when they first appear, so people will want to remotely run programs on them, the way we do today in the cloud."There are two different approaches to building quantum networks - a land-based network and a space-based network.Both methods work well for sending regular bits of data across the internet today, but if we want to send data as qubits in the future, it is much more complicated.To send particles of light (photons), we can use fibre optic cables in the ground.However, the light signal deteriorates over long distances (a phenomenon known as "decoherence"), because fibre optics cables sometimes absorb photons.It is possible to get around this by building "repeater stations" every 50km.These would essentially be miniature quantum laboratories that would try to repair the signal before sending it on to the next node in the network.But this system would come with its own complexities.Land or space?Image copyright Johannes Handsteiner / AW Image caption Artwork: a ground station beams a message contained in a light signal up to the Micius satellite Then there are space-based networks.Let's say you want to send a message from the UK to a friend in Australia.The light signal is beamed up from a ground station in the UK, to a satellite with a light source mounted on it.The satellite sends the light signal to another satellite, which then beams the signal down to a ground station in Australia, and then the message can be transmitted over a ground-based quantum network or classical internet network to the other party."Because there's no air between the satellites, there's nothing to degrade the signal," says Dr Jamie Vicary, a senior research fellow at Oxford University's department of computer science and a member of the Networked Quantum Information Technologies Hub (NQIT)."If we want to have a really global-scale quantum internet, it looks like a space-based solution is the only way that will work, but it's the most expensive."Quantum teleportation via space has been conducted successfully, and scientists are currently vying to demonstrate longer and longer distances.Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences generated headlines in June when they succeeded in teleporting entangled photons between two towns in China located 1,200km apart.They used a specially developed quantum satellite called Micius.The same Chinese scientists recently topped their own record on 29 September, by demonstrating the world's first intercontinental video call protected by a quantum key with researchers at the Austrian Academy of Sciences - over a distance of 7,700km.The call lasted for 20 minutes and the parties were able to exchange encrypted pictures of the Micius satellite and Austrian physicist Erwin Schrdinger.Rupert Ursin, senior group leader at the Austrian Academy of Sciences' Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information believes the quantum internet will need land-based and space-based networks to operate in parallel."In the cities, we need a fibre network, but long haul connections will be covered by satellite links," he explains.How does quantum key distribution work?Image copyright AW Image caption The video call between Austrian and Chinese scientists on 29 September 2017 To understand how QKD works, let's go back to the video call made between the Austrian and Chinese scientists.The Micius satellite used its light source to establish optical links with the ground stations in Austria and the ground stations in China.It was then able to generate a quantum key.The great thing about quantum encryption is you can detect whether someone has tried to intercept the message before it got to you, and how many people tried to access it.Micius was able to tell that the encryption was secure and no one was eavesdropping on the video call.It then gave the go ahead to encrypt the data using the secret key and transmit it over a public internet channel.Routing messages Multiple groups of scientists are developing land-based networks by working on the technologies for quantum repeater stations, which are located every 50km, connected by fibre optic cables.These repeater stations, also known as "quantum network nodes", will need to perform several actions in order to route, or direct, messages around the network.First, each node needs to repair and boost the signal that was damaged from the previous 50km stretch of the network.Imagine that you're using an old fax machine to send a one-page document to someone else, and each time you send the page, a different part of the message is missing, and the other party has to piece the message together from all the failed attempts.This is similar to how a single message may have to be sent between different nodes on a quantum network.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fibre optic cables will be used for land-based quantum networks There will be many people on the network, all trying to talk to each other.So the node, or repeater station, will also have to figure out how to distribute its available computing power in order to piece together all the messages being sent.It will also have to send messages between the quantum internet and the classical internet.The University of Delft is building a quantum network using nitrogen vacancies in diamonds, and it has so far shown the ability to store and distribute the links needed for quantum communications over quite large distances.The University of Oxford and the University of Maryland are both currently building quantum computers that work in a similar way to a network.Their quantum computers consist of trapped ion nodes that have been networked together to talk to each other.The bigger the computer you want, the more nodes you have to add, but this type of quantum computer only transmits data over a short distance."We want to make them small so they can be well-protected from decoherence, but if they're small then they can't hold many qubits," says Dr Vicary."If we connect the nodes up in a network, then we can still have a quantum computer without being limited by the number of qubits, while still protecting the nodes."Quantum memory The repeater station will also need to have a quantum memory chip.The nodes create "links", which consist of entangled pairs of light particles.These entangled pairs are prepared in advance.While the node calculates the route across the network that the message will need to take, it needs to store the entangled pair of photons somewhere safe, so a quantum memory chip is needed.It has to be able to store the photons for as long as possible.Image copyright Stuart Hay, ANU Image caption Dr Rose Ahlefeldt and associate professor Matthew Sellars operate a high-resolution dye laser to study rare earth crystals at ANU Researchers from the Australian National University (ANU) have developed a telecom-compatible quantum memory chip using an erbium-doped crystal.This device is able to store light in the right colour and it is able to do so for longer than one second, which is 10,000 times longer than all other attempts so far."The biggest challenge is now to demonstrate a quantum memory with a large data storage capacity," associate professor Matthew Sellars, program manager in the Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology (CQC2T) at ANU tells the BBC."It will be the memory's storage capacity that will limit the data transmission rate through the network."I think it will take about five years before the technology [for the quantum internet] is practical."
Sputnik: How the Soviet Union spun the satellite launch:::::Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Space exploration began with Sputnik's successful launch on 4 October, 1957 The launch of Sputnik, the first man-made satellite, 60 years ago kicked off the space race between the Soviet Union and America.The satellite was a success not just in terms of scientific advancement but in terms of providing a propaganda opportunity for the socialist state.Early reports detailed a wealth of technical information about the launch of the "Earth satellite", such was the general interest in it.'Like a flashing spark' One news correspondent described seeing the satellite appear "like a flashing spark over the horizon" and the Communist Party's main newspaper, Pravda, wrote that "all the world heard the announcement of the launching of the artificial moon".But reports by the state news agency Tass also mentioned its orbital velocity of about 8km a second, the fact that it was travelling at up to 900km above the surface of the earth, and that Sputnik was making one complete revolution in an hour and 35 minutes.Image caption Sputnik was just 58cm in diameter and weighed 84kg Russian media also detailed the frequencies and wavelengths on which Sputnik was emitting regular beeps, saying its transmitters were powerful enough for amateur radio operators to be able to receive them.Later, radio broadcasts to America touted the fact that the Soviet magazine Radio was offering "special prizes" for radio hams who submitted reports of the signals.Special broadcasts listed the places and times the satellite was expected to pass over.Image copyright BBC Monitoring Image caption BBC Monitoring, a unit of the World Service, recorded Soviet broadcasts about Sputnik's movements The day after its launch, Tass and Russian radio reported world reaction to it, noting how major media outlets like AFP, the Daily Mail and the BBC had reported it and how "some US radio stations interrupted their programmes in order to broadcast the satellite's signals".'Victory for the Soviet order' On Soviet radio, various scientists, such as jet propulsion expert Professor Kirill Stanyukovich, called it "a great victory not only for Soviet science but also for the Soviet order"."I think that the very fact that this has been achieved in our socialist country must not be regarded as mere chance," another academic told listeners."That we are not as rich as America is no secret to us.Why then has it happened that we have been capable of solving these most advanced and difficult scientific and technical problems ahead of Americans?"Several digs at America made their way into reports."For 40 years they closed their eyes to the enormous successes of Soviet industry and agriculture," one radio broadcast said."Now the most reactionary personalities in the USA are trying to raise some doubts about the tremendous value and great significance of this new success of Soviet science."BBC Monitoring, a unit of the World Service which monitored Soviet broadcasts at the time, notes that "Leading officials were quoted by Tass as showing reluctance to accept the news; and Moscow radio told the home audience on the 7th that the United States Information Agency had adopted a policy of minimising the military and scientific significance of the achievement.US scientists, on the other hand, were given as expressing pleased congratulations."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Komsomolskaya Pravda described Sputnik as "the victory of Soviet power" Influence in a different space Today, the name Sputnik is also associated with an international news agency, which has a presence on the web and radio, and is one of the main media outlets through which Russia influences global opinion.Sputnik tends to seek audiences on the political margins - whether it's supporters of the Front National in France, or the Democrat Bernie Sanders in the US.Its political stances include the idea that NATO is a menace to world peace, criticism of what it sees as US hegemony, and the general decadence of Western democracies and their institutions, especially in the face of the challenges posed by Islamist terrorism and migration into Europe.Sputnik is still potent force for Russian influence, just in a different sort of space now.See also: The team that tracked Sputnik - and the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.You can follow BBC Monitoring on Twitter and Facebook.
How the search for a 'death ray' led to radar:::::Image copyright Getty Images You can trace the extent of our reliance on air travel to many inventions.The jet engine, perhaps, or the aeroplane itself.But sometimes inventions need other inventions to unlock their full potential.For the aviation industry, that story starts with the invention of the death ray, or at least an attempt to design a death ray, back in 1935.Officials in the British Air Ministry were worried about falling behind Nazi Germany in the technological arms race.The death ray idea intrigued them: they had been offering a 1,000 prize for anyone who could zap a sheep at a hundred paces.So far, nobody had claimed it.But should they fund more active research?Was a death ray even possible?Image copyright Sasha Image caption Harry Grindell Matthews claimed to have invented a death ray in 1923, but couldn't persuade the British government to buy it Unofficially, they sounded out Robert Watson Watt, of the Radio Research Station.And he posed an abstract maths question to his colleague Skip Wilkins."Suppose, just suppose," said Watson Watt to Wilkins, "that you had eight pints of water, 1km [3,000ft] above the ground."And suppose that water was at 98F [37C], and you wanted to heat it to 105F."How much radio frequency power would you require, from a distance of 5km?"Opportunity Skip Wilkins was no fool.He knew that eight pints was the amount of blood in an adult human, 98F was normal body temperature and 105F was warm enough to kill you, or at least make you pass out, which - if you're behind the controls of an aeroplane - amounts to much the same thing.So Wilkins and Watson Watt understood each other, and they quickly agreed the death ray was hopeless: it would take too much power.But they also saw an opportunity.Clearly, the ministry had some cash to spend on research.Perhaps Watson Watt and Wilkins could propose some alternative way for them to spend it?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Robert Watson Watt played a key role in developing radar technology Wilkins pondered.It might be possible, he suggested, to transmit radio waves and detect - from the echoes - the location of oncoming aircraft long before they could be seen.Watson Watt dashed off a memo to the Air Ministry's newly formed Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence.Would they be interested in pursuing such an idea?They would indeed.What Skip Wilkins was describing became known as radar.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.As Robert Buderi describes in his book The Invention That Changed the World, the Germans, the Japanese and the Americans all independently started work on it too.Spectacular breakthrough But by 1940, it was the British who had made a spectacular breakthrough: the resonant cavity magnetron, a radar transmitter far more powerful than its predecessors.Pounded by Nazi bombers, Britain's factories would struggle to put the device into production.But America's factories could.For months, British leaders plotted to use the magnetron as a bargaining chip for American secrets in other fields.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Prime Minister Winston Churchill decided Britain should share its radar research with the US Then Winston Churchill took power, and decided that desperate times called for desperate measures.Nerve-wracking journey Britain would simply tell the Americans what they had, and ask for help.So in August 1940, a Welsh physicist named Eddie Bowen endured a nerve-wracking journey with a black metal chest containing a dozen prototype magnetrons.First, he took a black cab across London: the cabbie refused to let the clunky metal chest inside, so Bowen had to hope it wouldn't fall off the roof rack.Then, he took a long train ride to Liverpool, sharing a compartment with a mysterious, sharply dressed, military-looking man who spent the entire journey ignoring the young scientist and silently reading a newspaper.Then, he took a ship across the Atlantic.What if it were hit by a German U-boat?The Nazis couldn't be allowed to recover the magnetrons; two holes were drilled in the crate to make sure it would sink if the boat did.But the boat didn't.Image copyright MIT Museum Image caption MIT's Radiation Laboratory went on to spawn 10 Nobel laureates The magnetron stunned the Americans.Their research was years off the pace.President Roosevelt approved funds for a new laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - uniquely, for the American War effort, administered not by the military but a civilian agency.Industry got involved: the very best American academics were headhunted to join Bowen and his British colleagues.Patchy rollout By any measure, MIT's Radiation Laboratory - known as the Rad Lab - was a resounding success.It spawned 10 Nobel laureates.The radar it developed, detecting planes and submarines, helped to win the War.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Radar played a crucial role in helping Britain and her allies win World War Two But urgency in times of war can quickly be lost in times of peace.It seems obvious that civilian aviation would need radar too, given how quickly it was expanding.In 1945, at the War's end, US domestic airlines carried seven million passengers.By 1955, this figure had risen to 38 million.And the busier the skies, the more useful radar would be at preventing collisions.But rollout was slow and patchy.Some airports installed it; many didn't.In most airspace, planes weren't tracked at all.Pilots submitted their flight plans in advance, which should in theory ensure that no two planes were in the same place at the same time.But avoiding collisions ultimately came down to a four-word protocol: "see and be seen".Disastrous crash On 30 June 1956, two passenger flights departed Los Angeles Airport, three minutes apart: one was bound for Kansas City, one for Chicago.Their planned flight paths intersected above the Grand Canyon, but at different heights.Then thunderclouds developed.One plane's captain radioed to ask permission to fly above the storm.The air traffic controller cleared him to go to "1,000 on top" - 1,000ft above cloud cover.See and be seen.Nobody knows for sure what happened: planes then had no "black box" flight recorders, and there were no survivors.At just before 10:31, air traffic control heard a garbled radio transmission: "Pull up!We are going in..."

Bali volcano: What is it like waiting for an eruption?:::::Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Experts think Bali's Mount Agung could erupt for the first time since 1963 The lifespan of a volcano can be measured in millennia, and so waiting a few days for it to erupt may not sound too stressful.But for the tens of thousands of Balinese people forced from their homes, the "imminent" danger that they have been living with for more than a week feels very real.Ketut Seri says she has already lost track of time since arriving at one of the emergency shelters.Sat surrounded by thin plastic bags stuffed with her children's clothes, she says she can't help but worry about what she's left behind."I wish I had brought my cooking utensils," she tells me, a sign that she expects to be here for the long haul.Image caption More than 140,000 people like Ketut Seri and her family are in temporary shelters "I'm tired, I'm sad because I cannot work," she explains, "I cannot find any solution."Her children chase a football around the concrete hall they have been living in alongside another 100 evacuees.But Ketut's husband is absent after venturing back to their empty village to check on the animals.He is not the only one taking that risk.The fate of the cattle and chickens many had to leave behind in the hills weighs heavily on people's minds, and so some are crossing back and forth into the danger area every day to check on their well-being.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Surivivors of the 1963 eruption on the last time Mount Agung erupted According to the volcanologists monitoring Mount Agung, this situation could continue for weeks, maybe even months.An eruption may not even happen, they simply don't know.At the government observation base, senior seismologist Devy Kamil remains patient - despite the long queue of journalists who have been knocking on his door all week, hoping for some news."There are some examples where you have swarms of activity for as long as six years," he explains, "and it is not always ended by an eruption."Image caption Hundreds of tremors have been detected since August When lava last flowed from Mount Agung in 1963, the measuring instruments they use today were not in place, and so it is impossible to know the signature behaviour of that shows an eruption is coming.But while some here scrutinise every little piece of scientific data, others are waiting for spiritual signs.At the Goa Lawah Hindu temple, daily prayers continue at the site of a cave that many Balinese believe is connected to the volcano's energy.When I ask Iputi Juliad, one of the temple officials, what people are praying for, he says most just want good luck.He sees the wait for news from Mount Agung as part of a much longer process."There is a circle of life, a circle of sacrifice" he explains.Image copyright Reuters Image caption The majority of Balinese people practise a distinct type of Hinduism associated with the island When I ask if the seismic activity is seen as a sign that the gods are angry, he is very careful in his reply."It is not a punishment, not a punishment," Mr Juliad repeats, anxious to move on from a sensitive subject.Instead his focus is on the need to accept fate."Maybe an eruption, maybe not, nobody knows."The uncertainty is having an impact on everyone on Bali, even if they haven't been evacuated.The village of Rendang sits just outside the exclusion zone, and normally the market place would be bustling with the traders selling fruit, flowers and rice.Image caption Business at Rendang market has plummeted since the volcano warnings were issued But according to stallholder Ketut Astiningsih, most people have stopped coming and her income has taken a massive hit."No one is shopping.Before I could get 400,000 Rupiah ($30 USD) a day, now I can only earn 50,000 Rupiah ($3.7USD)" she explains.So far the economic consequences for Bali's tourism industry have not been so grave.At the hotels, the busloads of holidaymakers keep on coming, reassured it seems by the government's message that they will be kept well out of harm's way.Image copyright AFP Image caption Tourism at most resorts has not been affected Of course every tourist has heard or read about the volcano, and many have been contacted by worried relatives back home.But for most the only concern is whether an eruption would mean they could be marooned here.As he sipped a beer on the beach at Sanur, Mathew Hunter from Cairns in Australia seemed pretty relaxed by that prospect."I could definitely do with a few more weeks here," he chuckles, before adding that he is far more concerned about the fate of the tens of thousands of evacuees in emergency shelters.Like most people on Bali, he says he would like to see this waiting game with Mount Agung come to a swift but peaceful conclusion."I just hope it has a few little belly rumbles and then life goes on."
How you could help stop a flu pandemic:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hannah Fry needs your smartphone and your help to run the project We seem to be suffering from a global amnesia.Ask any passerby - as we did - What was the most catastrophic cause of death in the last 100 years?and you receive the usual suspects: WWII, perhaps WWI.There are also some less obvious replies: Chernobyl, the Boxing Day Tsunami, Hiroshima.Very, very rarely will anyone say Spanish Flu, and yet that particular pandemic killed up to 100 million people.There have been three others since then.Even more astonishing is that the UK Government considers another flu pandemic so dangerous to our society that it tops the list of the newly updated National Risk Register for Civil Emergencies.So its particularly timely that the BBC has just launched the BBC Pandemic App on the iOS App Store and Google Play.This free app is part of the biggest experiment of its kind, a citizen science experiment that aims to spread a virtual pandemic - an outbreak of a simulated infectious disease around the entire country.That may sound like an odd thing to want to do but, if successful, the BBC Pandemic could help save lives when not if the next lethal pandemic spreads across the world.With international air travel at over four billion flights last year alone, stopping a flu pandemic taking hold is pretty much impossible nowadays, but the BBC Pandemic App will help a team of mathematical epidemiologists from the University of Cambridge and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predict how a virus could spread across the UK and, crucially, test what might be done to slow it down.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Who knew flu could be such a big killer?The problem with pandemic flu viruses is that they emerge unannounced, unlike the seasonal flu we experience every winter.Seasonal flu can be deadly too and the warning signs from Australia show that this year could be a bad one, but at least we get a heads-up from our southern neighbours several months in advance.This gives the critical time necessary to get a vaccine tailor-made and manufactured in sufficient volume to vaccinate key workers and those most vulnerable.But, every now and again, the animal world creates a strain of the flu virus that humans have never seen before - we have little protection from our immune system, or enough time to make a vaccine before the virus has started to spread.The 2009 pandemic was commonly known as swine flu because the human virus contained genes from a pig flu virus.The devastating Spanish Flu pandemic was caused by a virus that seems to have emerged from birds.Planning for another pandemic is the best defence we have until vaccine technology manages to catch up.And thats where everyone in the UK can help, by downloading the BBC Pandemic App.Once downloaded, users will be asked basic questions like age and employment status.Then the app will track users approximate position every hour for just 24 hours - but the GPS will only be within the nearest square kilometre.Privacy as well as data protection is taken very seriously by the team.At the end of the 24 hours, there are a few questions about the kind of face-to-face contacts the users made in that time.And thats it.Simple but enough to provide real data the researchers can use to help predict the spread of a real outbreak.The challenge is they would like 10,000 UK-wide to download the app and join in.This has never been done before so anyone taking part will be participating in ground-breaking research.The results will be shown in the BBC Pandemic documentary on BBC Four next year, presented by UCL mathematician Dr Hannah Fry and emergency medic Dr Javid Abdelmoneim.To download the app go to the App Store or Google Play and search for BBC Pandemic.There's much more information on the BBC Pandemic webpage.And, for those people who don't have a smartphone, there will shortly be a questionnaire on the webpage so that everyone can join in.
Is the US solar industry about to tear itself apart?:::::Image copyright Getty Images The US solar industry has seen dramatic growth in the past few years, but a request for a rare trade action has led to a fierce fight over the future of the industry - and one that wouldn't exist without the presidency of Donald Trump.Phil Brodhagen runs a solar installation company in Colorado Springs, and his customers - local homeowners and businesses in a military-friendly town - love American-made products.Until they see the price."They want to go solar, but they do have a limit on how much they can spend."he says."They'd love an American product, but if they can't afford it, they'll either not get a system at all, or go for the cheaper one."Brodhagen is one of hundreds of business owners across the US paying very close attention to a case in front of the US International Trade Commission.And he's worried about the outcome."It will hurt this industry," he says."It's going to be me laying off people as well as everyone else."On Friday, the commission is expected to rule on whether imported solar products have seriously injured US solar product manufacturers, enough to impose higher tariffs on imports worldwide.The petition was brought by two solar manufacturers who are based in the US, but owned by overseas companies.Suniva and SolarWorld have argued their financial troubles - as well as a series of other US solar manufacturer bankruptcies - are due to a massive oversupply of solar cells and panels imported from overseas, primarily from Chinese companies.Image copyright Getty Images They point to dozens of US companies like theirs that have gone out of business since 2012."Quite simply, we need the commission's help to save solar manufacturing in the United States," Juergen Stein, chief executive of SolarWorld Americans told the commission in August.But SolarWorld and Suniva find themselves fiercely opposed by much of the solar industry in the US, including the largest trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).SEIA has argued increasing the prices of panels through tariffs will set back the solar industry for years, hurting companies that buy and install solar panels, or make solar-related products.The trade group estimates a loss of as many as 88,000 jobs, or a third of the current solar work force, if Suniva and SolarWorld's requests come to pass.The group accuses the two companies of using the rare trade action to save themselves, at the expense of the rest of the industry.What's at stake?For both sides, the immediate future of the fast-growing solar industry in America.Bret Sowers, a utility-scale solar farm developer, calls the trade case an "eminent threat" to his business.Projects like his are reliant on how low a price per watt cost they can offer utility firms.Their competition is not just other solar firms, but coal and wind, natural gas and nuclear energy.New solar capacity doubled between 2015 and 2016 and such large-scale projects drove more than half the growth.Image copyright Reuters Image caption An employee makes a final inspection on panels during a tour of an REC solar panel manufacturing plant in Singapore "We have close to $2bn in investment we've planned across the southeast," he says, based on prices continuing their downward trend.If he can't deliver the prices he expected, those solar farms won't be built."That's hundreds of construction jobs gone," he says, and layoffs at his company.Sowers is specifically frustrated because US plants at SolarWorld and Suniva were not building the larger, 72-cell panels at the kind of scale his projects need."The two dots don't really connect.They were making cars and I'm buying trucks - and now they're claiming the trucks are hurting the cars."James Marlow, who runs a similar Georgia company, is frustrated with the petition, even though he just finished a project with Suniva panels."They used to be the home town team," he says of the firm, originally spun out from Georgia Tech and headquartered in the state.In 2015, in an effort to expand, a Hong Kong-based energy firm purchased more than half the company, but Suniva filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, and weeks later, brought the trade petition.SolarWorld, whose parent company also filed for insolvency in Germany, joined the petition shortly thereafter.Marlow says he supports bringing back manufacturing to America, but thinks that means a whole set of policies to deal with what's a "drastically larger" issue."It's why most of our clothes are made in Asia and why this cell phone I'm talking to you on made in Asia - it's not just one action."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A stretch of road has been paved with solar PV (photovoltaic) panels in France.He attended the 15 August arguments in front of the trade commission on the case and said interest was intense.There were two overflow rooms for people to listen.An official told him they hadn't seen that many people come to hear a case since NAFTA.If the trade commission finds in favour of the manufacturers, it can make recommendations, but it is up to the president to decide.And President Trump is eager to impose tariffs, especially in an industry in which he could be seen to be tough on Chinese manufacturing.He reportedly has said "I want someone to bring me some tariffs" because "China is laughing at us".Image copyright Getty Images Once the trade commission makes its initial ruling, it will have several more weeks to make a recommendation to Trump.The president then can decide to take the recommendation or not.Solarworld had earlier successes with two requests for increased tariffs on Chinese manufacturers for similar unfair trade practice accusations.But that wasn't enough, says Tim Brightbill, a lawyer representing SolarWorld, because Chinese firms shifted production to other countries to get around the tariffs.He also claims the potential job loss numbers are overblown."These predictions were made before when SolarWorld brought actions against China, that somehow jobs would be lost.But the opposite happened," Brightbill says.The situation is especially odd considering both SolarWorld and Suniva are owned by parent companies that could be harmed by the tariff.Brightbill says "it just shows that SolarWorld is committed to manufacturing here," even if it involves putting a tariff on a German-produced panel.They may not be alone.While the US solar industry is holding its breath, foreign manufacturers are starting to think about setting up shop in the US, especially if the commission recommends a broad tariff.Both sides see the dispute as a turning point for the industry - and both think the president should be on their side."If the Trump administration wants to create jobs," James Marlow says."They should join with the solar industry."The question for President Trump will be - which part?
The lecture that changed biology:::::Image copyright Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Image caption Crick's lecture was said to have altered the logic of biology Sixty years ago this week, one of the greatest British scientists, Francis Crick, gave a lecture in London in which he accurately predicted how genes work, setting the course for the genetic revolution we are now living through.Here, evolutionary biologist Professor Matthew Cobb from Manchester University unpicks the predictions that set a new course for how we understand the very stuff we are made from.In one lecture, it has been said that Francis Crick "permanently altered the logic of biology".Only four years earlier, he and the young American Jim Watson had solved the double helix structure of DNA, using data gathered by Rosalind Franklin.Aged 41, Crick was still five years away from winning the Nobel Prize for this work, but he had a reputation as a powerful and profound thinker.He gave his lecture - "On protein synthesis" - at University College London for the Society for Experimental Biology.In it, Crick spoke about how genes do what they do.At the time, this subject was still very murky - some scientists were not even convinced that genes were made of DNA.But Crick delivered four predictions about genes - and their link to the proteins that build our bodies.In each of these ideas, he was right.Cracking the code Image copyright Science Photo Library Crick started with the main thing that genes do: they control the production of proteins.The problem Crick explored was that the DNA in a gene is simply a chemical code - a string of something called bases - A, C, T, G. Crick had to explain how the cell could get from this one-dimensional sequence of bases in DNA to the complex three-dimensional structures of proteins.Even more puzzling was the fact that proteins can fold themselves into nearly any shape.Crick's answer was simple: the order of bases in the gene - what he called "genetic information" - corresponded to the order of the amino acids that make up each protein, and nothing more.There was no structural information about the protein that was encoded in the gene, he claimed.He called this the sequence hypothesis.Somehow, the cell "read" the information in the gene and assembled the amino acids together like beads on a string.The resulting protein folded itself - spontaneously - into its final 3-D structure.We still cannot easily predict the structure of a protein from the order of its amino acids, but Crick's sequence hypothesis holds good.Central dogma To explain how exactly cells assemble proteins, Crick predicted there must be some small molecules - he called these "adaptors" - that could recognise each of the 20 different amino acids in the body, and would bring them to where they could be turned into a protein in the right order.As Crick gave his talk in London this molecule was being identified in an American laboratory.It is now called transfer RNA.It is the biological messenger that reads and "translates" the genetic code in the cell's protein-building factory.Image copyright Wellcome Library, London Image caption Crick drew a diagram to explain the flow of information from DNA to proteins The most controversial and influential part of the lecture though was what was called the central dogma.Crick explained that as proteins are synthesised, information is taken from the DNA molecule, first into an RNA molecule, and is then used to make a protein.Before the lecture, he drew a little diagram to explain what he meant.The arrows show what Crick called the flow of information going from DNA to RNA to protein.DNA and RNA could also copy themselves, so there are also arrows going from DNA to DNA and from RNA to RNA.Because the experimental data were not clear, Crick accepted that it might just be possible that DNA could directly lead to the production of proteins, so he drew an arrow there, too (this is not in fact the case).The most important point was that, as Crick put it, once the information had gone from DNA into a protein, it could not get back into your DNA.There was no biochemical route for a protein to change your DNA sequence.Crick thought it might be possible for information to go from RNA to DNA, and this later turned out to be the case, when it was discovered that some RNA viruses can get into our DNA.But the route from protein to DNA is impossible.This central dogma emphasises that our DNA sequence cannot be changed by our proteins, or by how they are changed by experience.Over the last 60 years this has proved to be correct.Despite the excitement about what is called epigenetics, which explains how genes can be turned on and off by the environment, this never leads to a change in our actual DNA sequence.Crick's dogma was absolutely right.Crick later cheerfully admitted that when he coined the phrase, he didn't know what a dogma was.What he really meant was that it was a basic assumption about how genes worked.Whatever its name, it still guides scientists today.Crick's final brilliant prediction was to suggest that in the future biologists would use sequence data to understand evolution, by comparing the sequences of different species.In 1957, when Crick was speaking, protein sequences were known from only five species, while DNA sequencing was science fiction and 20 years in the future.But this is exactly what happened, and we can now understand how organisms evolved in unprecedented detail, by comparing their sequences, just as Crick suggested.Crick's lecture, which was published the following year, continues to be read and cited by scientists all over the world.It is a monument of clear and penetrating thinking by one of the 20th century's greatest minds.In all his key predictions, Francis Crick was right, and he did indeed change the logic of biology.Professor Matthew Cobb is a zoologist, historian and author based at Manchester University
