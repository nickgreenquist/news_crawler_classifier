Here’s our first look at Elon Musk’s Boring Co. LA tunnel:::::Elon Musk is digging a tunnel under Hawthorne near SpaceX headquarters in California, after receiving approval from city council to do so.Musks Boring Co. has already made considerable progress on the dig and tunnel build, apparently, as Musk shared an image of the tunnel from the inside showing a reinforced tube that stretches off into the distance out of sight.The tunnel features paneled walls, cables and a large upper conduit, as well as lighting and what appear to be tracks.The tunnel just outside of LA is the first the Boring Co. has undertaken, but it recently received provisional approval to start digging in Maryland, too, on a second test dig that will potentially become part of an underground Hyperloop network.Musks LA tunnel is a pilot project designed to test the feasibility of his plan to dig tunnels at a lower cost and more efficiently than current tunnel boring companies operate, with the eventual aim of supplying cities and regions with underground tunnel networks that can transport goods and services while avoiding surface obstacles and traffic.The Boring Co. is still a long way from achieving the grand vision of constructing inter-city underground Hyperloop tubes for high-speed travel, but its making rapid progress on its initial test digging and tunnel construction, which should go some way to proving to its detractors that this is more than just a pipe dream.
Why Snapchat Spectacles failed:::::How come only 0.08% of Snapchats users bought its camera sunglasses?Hundreds of thousands of pairs of Spectacles sit rotting in warehouses after the company bungled the launch.Initial hype and lines for its roving, limited time only Snapbot vending machines led Snap to overestimate demand but underdeliver on quality and content.Massive piles of assembled and unassembled video-recording sunglasses sit unsold, contributing to Snaps enormous costs and losses, says The Information.Internal Snap data shows less than 50 percent of buyers kept using Spectacles a month after purchase, Business Insiders Alex Heath reports.A sizeable percentage stopped after just a week, with a source calling the retention rate shockingly low.What was the problem?Snap generated huge hype for Spectacles, but then waited 5 months to openly sell them.Once people actually tried Spectacles, few kept wearing them, and word of mouth about their disuse spread.Snap never got visionary video markers onboard.And as Snapchats popularity waned in the face of competitors, the fact that Spectacles only interfaced with its app rather than a phones camera roll became a burden.Snap did some things right with Spectacles.The fashion photo spread announcement felt classy and surprising despite clues and photos of CEO Evan Spiegel trickling out ahead.The initial launch was a marketing extravaganza, with multi-hour lines of cool kids waiting on the Venice Beach boardwalk to buy them.And the Snapbots being dropped in random locations was exciting and made people feel special if they got ahold of them.But once people put them on their face, the excitement died off.Heres a breakdown of the major flaws that emerged with Spectacles in the year since their debut, with a focus on the stilted launch strategy: Botched Roll Out Snap first announced Spectacles with some Karl Lagerfeld photos of Spiegel wearing them on September 24th 2016.Hype was high despite the beachey color options that turned some people off.It took until November 10th for the first Snapbot vending machines to launch.While the hype had cooled slightly, demand was huge as people wanted to be the first on the block with Spectacles, and lines stretched down streets.But Snap whether it was because Snap wanted to milk the Snapbot promotion, couldnt tell if Spectacles should be exclusive or widely available, or it had supply chain problems, it took until February 20th for Snap to start openly selling Specs online.Waiting five months after the initial announcement was an eternity in the fast-moving teenage fad cycle.They werent cool by the time they were buyable.Everyone had already seen the sunglasses and circular video all over the Internet, most owners had long since stopped using them, the holiday season had passed, and few people wanted to buy so late.It took until June, 8 months after their debut, for Spectacles to become available in Europe.If Snap had instead made its announcement, quickly outfitted some lucky normal users and celebrities with Spectacles, then launched a giant Black Friday sale at the peak of its hype, all those people fascinated with the gadget might have bought immediately.Everyone would have paid before word got out that people werent going to wear camera glasses all that much.Alternatively, Snap could have gone the path of exclusivity lit by its fashion-focused debut.Rather than ever selling Specs openly, it could have gotten them into runway shows and magazines while sticking with the limited-edition Snapbots.Then after a few months it could have ceased all sales, turned existing pairs into fought-over collectors items, and saved the mainstream rollout for an eventual v2 launch.Unfortunately, Snap seems to have got stuck between these exclusive and mass-retail strategies.Where Were The Spectacles Influencers?To drive demand, Snap needed to demonstrate all the creative things you could do with Spectacles, and the cool people who wore them.Yet at the time, it still had a very hands-off approach to dealing with traditional celebrities and web influencers.Snap didnt make outfitting creators with Specs and training them to use the camera glasses a priority.Instead of top Snappers constantly posting circular videos and encouraging fans to do the same, Snap effectively left the gadget out to dry.Snap let random Spectacles buyers, often over-enthusiastic social media amateurs, define the image of the product, similar to how Googles core mistake was allowing geeky developers to become the face of Glass.Few Examples Of Great Content Stemming from Snaps failure to foster a Spectacles creator scene, it did a terrible job of showing off how Spectacles could be used beyond the initial commercial.Neither Snaps in-house team or independent social stars were recruited to make videos exposing the creative opportunities of the device.It did little through event marketing or in-app promotion to encourage Spectacle content creation.Karen X. Cheng was perhaps the only Spectacles influencer lighting the path, with her first-person mirror dancing video and Spectacles-on-babies ad she helped Brawny make.But Snap should have ensured the Internet was flooded with these videos proving what you cant do with your phones camera, and why you should buy Spectacles.People Are Still Freaked Out By Camera Glasses Google Glass tainted the market with its not sure if youre recording me design.Even though Snap put more obvious recording signal lights on Spectacles, people would still question you about whether they were on camera.That not only made people uncomfortable being around Spectacles, but made you feel like a bit of a creep just wearing them even if you never tapped the shutter button.Their appeal was further limited by their polarizing fashion-forward design (some would call ugly), while the only non-black colors were aggressively bright teal and coral.Limited Content Portability When Spectacles debuted, Snapchat clone Instagram Stories had only just launched.But soon reaching over 250 million daily users, Instagram Stories grew bigger than Snapchats whole app that now has 173 million.Snap didnt have the only Stories in town, and lots of people began cross-posting between the two apps.But Spectacles made that difficult.Specs shoot in a proprietary circular video format.On Snapchat, you see the content full screen no matter what orientation you hold your phone in.But when exported, those circular videos get inset within a white square in a locked orientation.That makes them look obviously ported from Snapchat rather than made for these other channels, especially inside a rectangular Instagram Story.Spectacles wouldnt connect to your phones camera roll, only to Snapchat, making exporting a chore.And they didnt take photos, just videos.Stuck In The Fuzzy Sun The shaded lenses in Spectacles made them tough to wear indoors or at night.That disqualified a lot of the parties, concerts, meals, and hang-outs people like to Snap.Beyond music festivals, beaches, back yards, and parks, there fewer opportunities to use them then buyers may have expected.I saw one guy who had popped the lenses out so he could wear them anywhere, but that made their look stick out even more.Snap never struck any official partnerships with companies offering non-shaded or prescription lenses, though some providers of lens replacements cropped up.That led some people with vision problems or who stay out of the sun to write-off the product entirely.Usability Problems Galore Having to pair Spectacles with Snapchat instead of the standard Bluetooth menu was annoying.Data transfers from the glasses to the phone took forever and would get easily interrupted.They only recorded videos in 720p, not 1080.Videos were clumsily first sent in low-resolution until a higher-res version could be delivered.Spectacles drain your phone battery super fast.The bulky and oddly shaped triangular prism case was tough to fit in bags and impossible to get in your pocket.The battery and recording lights were confusing.Sometimes Spectacles would require a hold the shutter button for 55-seconds reset that wasnt clearly explained on any of Snaps support pages.And finally, our hands are already an incredibly agile, auto-stabilized, selfie-able conveyance for a camera.For a v1 product, Spectacles were a valiant effort.But it was the stuttered roll out, lack of promotional support, and rising competition combined with their hardware problems the doomed Spectacles.Hopefully v2 will correct these missteps.Snap already has a patent for an augmented reality version, and its shelved other product ideas like a drone.If Snap wants to truly live up to its name as a camera company, it either needs to nail a single gadget you want to use multiple times per week forever, or release an array of short-lived but fun camera toys.Either way, it must seize on the hype it creates rather than letting it fade, and put the work in to foster an ecosystem of creators to pioneer videography styles everyone else can try.Building a trend-setting camera isnt just about the tech you put into it, but encouraging the content that comes out.
Is AR eyewear ready for consumers? Are consumers ready for AR eyewear?:::::Augmented reality marked a major milestone this year.For the first time two technology titans revealed their intentions to bring AR to the mass consumer market via mobile devices.Apple announced the release of its new ARKit in June, soon followed by the debut of Googles ARCore in August, and their respective developers immediately set to work creating new consumer-oriented AR games and apps.Its too early to know what the new ecosystem of software and hardware designed to provide AR experiences will evolve into in the future, but its safe to predict that AR headsets will be part of the picture.So why is AR suddenly ready for mass consumption?And why arent we leaping (magically!)into AR glasses?The answers are simple enough: Technology takes time to develop, and users need time to adapt.With any disruptive technology, the classic adoption curve usually holds true: innovators first, followed by early adopters, early majority, late majority and, finally, laggards your grandma.On the development trajectory, Snap Filters and Pokmon GO warmed up the consumer market, in small stages, for a more robust AR experience on their mobile devices.And the mobile device is paving the way for the next milestone in the development of AR: headsets.We can expect consumers to follow the typical adoption curve with AR headsets, just as they would for any new technology.Still, before AR eyeglasses are ready to go mainstream, manufacturers have a few hurdles to clear, including cost, form, function and content.For mass-market adoption, AR glasses will need to be priced comfortably under $1,000; early adopters are likely to opt for a pair of high-functioning glasses if they cost about the same as a high-end phone ($700 to $900).In a few years, after several cycles of innovation and applications of Moores Law, carriers might well subsidize AR glasses, or at least sell them at wholesale prices, which would significantly drop prices, reduce the perceived risk and lead to increased sales among early majority and late majority consumers.Carriers could potentially benefit from much higher billable network usage, as heavy processing-powered apps coupled with entertainment consumption are likely to dwarf most consumers phone data usage.Whats more, the mass-scale adoption of AR glasses itself will drive prices down as the production costs scale.The ultimate AR user experience and loyalty to one AR system will depend on offering users the ideal UI for navigating the new AR ecosystem.As for form, many optic solutions for AR today are bulky and heavy.While it may be true that early adopters or tech enthusiasts are willing to sacrifice good looks if theyll gain hero-level functionality, the majority of users would like their wearables to be just that wearable.The size and weight of the glasses will be important to consumers, and because optical technology has a major impact on size and weight, its a critical component in the form factor that smart glass manufacturers need to master.The most advanced optics enable manufacturers to produce small, sleek eyeglasses and keep them small and light, with the potential to deliver far more versatile functionality.Achieving the right form factor will also require manufacturers to consider the configuration of the glasses.Will AR glasses be a standalone product, or will they require an external control box to house power sources and processors?Will consumers wear smart glasses that are tethered to their phones or a control box?They might if the glasses themselves look geek-chic and offer enormous value to wearers.Beats provides a good example of bucking the trend, with its oversized, tethered headphones that succeeded wildly in the age of ear buds and Bluetooth.The key issues of battery life and efficiency could become a roadblock to developing optimum functionality.Currently, theres a surge in investments for companies in this space, like Microvast and Gridtential Energy, two companies reinventing the traditional battery chemistry.We can expect innovative battery companies like these to have a great impact on the AR industry, not least by providing a more efficient battery to power AR glasses.Processors running hot are an obstacle to achieving peak functionality, as well.Much of the essential functionality of AR glasses, from tracking a users environment and movements to generating geographically accurate contextual overlaid content, results in over-heated processors.Dissipating that heat is a challenge many AR glasses manufacturers with head-worn processors have yet to solve.Developing the right user interface is another vital step toward making headsets mainstream.With ARKit, ARCore and Facebooks AR Studio paving the way for developers to build AR-enabled apps, expect to see content creation explode over the next 12-18 months.The ultimate AR user experience and loyalty to one AR system will depend on offering users the ideal UI for navigating the new AR ecosystem.These challenges are formidable, but manufacturers in the AR industry have the resources and motivation to face them head-on.Whats at stake is nothing less than the next great transformative experience in technology, and what manufacturer wouldnt want to be there when history is made?With that in mind, we wouldnt be surprised to see consumers the innovators and early adopters, that is wearing AR glasses within the next two years.Featured Image: J.

Nintendo’s Reggie Fils-Aimé on the evolution of Super Mario Odyssey:::::From the outside, at least, Nintendo is a study in contradictions, at once devoted to the constant development of new gaming experiences, while remaining deferential and staunchly loyal to its past.Fittingly, the gaming giants American president Reggie Fils-Aim references its longtime executives and creative forces with great reverence, quoting predecessors several times over the course of our half-hour-long conversation ahead of the launch of Super Mario Odyssey.The game has been out for a day now, and the results from the gaming press have been everything the company could have dreamt of.In a review posted on Thursday, Devin called it an embarrassment of riches, echoing its currently near perfect 97 on Metacritic.The tent-pole title was a bit of a glaring omission when it launched in March, a fact due in part to Nintendos decision to get it just right.We were fortunate that Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild was far along in its development, explains Fils-Aim.It could be that anchor title from a day-one launch perspective.And then to have Super Mario Odyssey as the key game going into the holiday.It was, on one hand, quite well planned.But the other piece is that it always comes down to the development schedule.The executive pauses to paraphrase a quote from Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, which goes, A delayed game is eventually good, a bad game is bad forever.By all accounts, Mario Odyssey certainly isnt the latter.And while Nintendo may have gotten some pushback from the press for its decision to delay the product, a Zelda-fueled launch gave the company exactly the boost it needed, coming off the prolonged stumble of the Wii U.And the result is in the game play.Odyssey is far and away the richest Mario experience, one that works to balance the influence of old and new, playing on Nintendos strength of reinventing its most popular properties time and again console after console, and decade after decade.More so than any of Nintendos other franchise stars, Mario has worn a lot of different proverbial hats.And this time hes got an actual new one in the form of Cappy, a sentient hat that possesses whatever you toss it on.Fils-Aim says the feature, which takes advantage of the Switchs gesture control, has been a central game dynamic since the games earliest stages.Its a new feature that differentiates the game while remaining true to what it means to be a Mario game.In its essence, its about progressing forward to be the hero and save the Princess, explains Fils-Aim.That is a consistent element, but how it all comes together is driven by the game developer, the producer.Certainly there are conversations that are had with Mr. Miyamoto.When you look at a game like Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Odyssey, theyre very different types of experience, and yet the common thread it moving forward in this platform-like experience.But while products like the NES and SNES Classic are indeed simple reheats of old glories (and wildly successful ones at that), Odysseys successes lie in offering something new.Fils-Aim quotes the late Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwatas we do not run from risk, we run to it, adding, We are a company that always takes chances.We are fortunate in that often times those chances and risks win in the marketplace, but sometimes they dont.But at its heart, we believe in differentiated experiences.

New seed funds pursue AI, hard tech and the Midwest:::::Stories about seed funding often contain sappy metaphors about planting seedlings and nurturing them to maturity.In reality, its a brutally Darwinian business: most companies fail, successful ones get diluted and exits commonly take a decade or more.That said, seed also has the highest potential returns of any investment stage.Unlike most VCs, seed and angel investors can do a lot of deals with a few million dollars.And no one complains its boring.So far this year, the relative turn-offs of seed-stage investing seem to be outweighing the draws.Fewer North American seed funds launched in 2017 compared to year-ago levels, according to an analysis of Crunchbase data.Total investment and round counts are also down sharply over the past 12 months from the year-ago period for seed and angel deals, even as late-stage investment is on the rise.So who are the brave souls venturing out with first-time seed funds?Crunchbase News culled through this years new fund data to unearth more than 30 interesting new U.S. and Canada-based funds.We identified some areas particularly in vogue with seed-stage newcomers, most of whom share a sense that the window for backing early movers in select areas will only be open a short time.Some of the fashionable seed investment sectors should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the buzz around artificial intelligence and virtual reality.Other trends were less predictable, including rising funding for some geographies long considered underserved by venture and angel investors.Here are some trends we observed.Invest in the Midwest Theres nothing new about venture and angel investors talking up the merits of the Great Lakes region, given the rich technical talent and less-rich startup valuations that can be found there.However, theres a difference between talk and action.What were seeing recently is new Midwest-based seed firms actually raising capital in the area, not just saying nice things about founders there.So far this year, Crunchbase identified several Chicago-based seed funds.Purple Arch Ventures backs startups affiliated with alumni of Northwestern University.Germin8 Ventures, as the name would imply, invests in agtech.Nameless Ventures, meanwhile, is seeking accredited investors who want to invest in Chicago-area startups.Itd be incorrect to classify interest in Chicago as solely a 2017 phenomenon, as its something thats been percolating for the past few years.Crunchbase detailed at least 10 Chicago-based seed investors that have cropped up in the past year or two.Their geographic focus areas vary, with several concentrating on the Chicago area, others on the Midwest and still others looking at deals nationwide.Some of the fashionable seed investment sectors should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the buzz around artificial intelligence and virtual reality.Other Midwest-focused funds founded this year include Grand Ventures, a Grand Rapids, Mich.-based fund that invests in Midwestern technology startups, and Loup Ventures, a tech seed investor with offices in Minneapolis and New York.Being in Minneapolis and working to establish our network among other VCs, theres no question that theres a lot of excitement about the Midwest, Andrew Murphy, a partner at Loup, told Crunchbase News.Compared to coastal tech hubs, the Midwest is underinvested, prices are better, and the opportunities are fewer in volume but no different or better in quality.Hearty appetite for hard tech Start cheap and build fast has long been a popular mantra for seed-stage startups and their investors.Lately, however, there seems to be a pendulum swing back to more seed investment in so-called hard tech, targeting companies working on complex technical problems with lengthy development time horizons.Probably the poster child for this approach is MITs The Engine, which closed a $200 million debut fund in September.The funds stated mission is to help founders develop, commercialize and scale scientific discoveries in tough technologies, with a focus on Boston-area startups.So far its backed startups working on satellite communications, a digital approach to sensing smells and technology to deliver drugs more effectively to the GI tract.Hard tech isnt something that seed and angels have exactly shied away from in the past.Life sciences startups, which are well-known for their long development cycles, have traditionally snagged a good-sized share of seed-stage dollars.Hardware, medical devices, space tech and other areas known for long exit timelines have also been popular with the angel crowd.Yet a rising profile for hard tech may indicate investors interest diminishing in quick-to-market, consumer-facing startups that proliferated amid the rise of the app economy.Its a brutally Darwinian business: most companies fail, successful ones get diluted and exits commonly take a decade or more.That perspective is echoed by Jason Cahill, managing director at McCune Capital Management, a New York-based seed and early-stage tech investor that launched this year I sense were nearing a saturation point when it comes to startups with mass consumer appeal, like social sharing apps, ride sharing, as well as fintech and adtech, Cahill told Crunchbase News.Yet in industries such as transportation, clean-tech, waste collection, and even publishing, Im extremely excited by what Im seeing and by the volume of opportunities.The Engine and McCune are two out of several seed investors that have raised a first-time fund in the past year.We put together a list of several here.AI is under-hyped Seed investors dont seem to think AI is over-hyped.A lot of new seed funds list artificial intelligence as a core focus area.We counted at least a half-dozen North American ones this year.There are probably more.Theres definitely a timing element, Loups Murphy says of AI investing.For Loups partners, the decision to start a seed fund now stemmed in large part from founders following Apple and other large-cap technology companies in their prior gig as analysts at Piper Jaffray.The big tech companies have been investing heavily in AI (as well as robotics and VR), and its reasonable to expect them to continue along these lines.Thats a sign of confidence in the sector and also means there are plenty of deep-pocketed acquirers.Yet while seed investors are excited about the potential of artificial intelligence, theyre also skeptical about a lot of the self-described AI startups out seeking funding.Founders, after all, have caught on that AI is an area that attracts more funding, says Eric Bahn, founding partner at Hustle Fund, a seed investor launched this year to focus on fast-moving, very early-stage startups.Thats led a number of companies to attempt to backfill some sort of AI story, when they are actually not an AI company.Fertile soil?It remains to be seen, of course, whether the currently sprouting crop of Midwestern, AI-enabled, hard technology startups will bear fruit for investors.As previously noted, most seedlings dont make it.However, the ones that do could bring some game-changing technologies to the forefront, not just another app to make your shopping more convenient.
Averon closes $8.3M funding to make your smartphone the key to ID online:::::Because of the threat of cyber attacks, sign in and identity verification procedures are becoming utterly cumbersome.Theres no identity layer to the internet (until there is a mainstream Blockhain solution perhaps?).However, using signalling and data packets, and the SIM/eSIM chips already found in smartphones, you could make this much easier.It would also require no installation and much less effort for users, and could be rolled out in areas like IoT.This is what SF-based startup Averon is working on.They call it Direct Autonomous Authentication (DAA), or a mobile identity verification standard that is both pretty frictionless and very secure.Averon has now closed an $8.3 million Series A financing round led by Avalon Ventures.The idea is to make the hacks involving Equifax, Target, Home Depot, Anthem Medicare, a thing of the past.Developed in stealth for nearly two years, Averons security solution takes the real-time mobile network signal from your phone and the SIM/eSIM chips to create authentication.With existing solutions, users manually enter ID info on their device, use 2-factor authentications, and biometric info that is easily breached and prone to human error.Your mobile carrier actually knows who you are, but so far packet device origination tracking (SIM) has been limited to carrier use and carriers themselves have been viewed as siloed networks.This solution breaks down the barriers.Wendell Brown, CEO and chairman of Averon says DAA has the potential to substantially reduce the exposure each of us has to the growing wave of cybercriminals.His co-founder is Lea Tarnowski, a former UK-based VC partner.Tarnowski was formerly an investment manager at Northzone Ventures, one of Europes leading global venture capital funds.Brown is an acclaimed computer scientist, entrepreneur, and inventor known for his innovations in telco and mobile security with 20 years of expertise in cryptosecurity and a U.S. Department of Defense security.Averon is led by a cadre of business leaders, engineers and cybersecurity experts with backgrounds spanning MIT, Harvard Business School, Stanford, USC, Cornell, the NSA, the Israel Defense Force, PayPal, Microsoft, and other top universities and institutions.Its also the creator and holder of IP protected by 15 U.S. and international patents Featured Image: Getty Images
WTF is sexual harassment:::::It pains me to have to write this, but write it I must as the past weeks events have shown there are surprisingly many people in Silicon Valley who wouldnt know what sexual harassment was if it slapped them on the behind without permission.There are many cases that could be useful as a launching point; lets start with the recent and lengthy rebuttal of so-called tech evangelist Robert Scoble, following multiple allegations that he has sexually harassed and assaulted a number of women in the industry where Scoble has made his name.As Scoble wrote in his own defense, on his personal blog this week, If I were guilty of all the things said about me, I would still not be in a position to have sexually harassed anyone.I dont have employees, I dont cut checks for investment.None of the women who came forward were ever in a position where I could make or break their careers.Sexual harassment requires that I have such power.Scores of supporters came to Scobles defense in the aftermath of the allegations.Scott Jordan, CEO of Scottevest, was one of the most outspoken, writing on Scobles original apology post (now made private) that because Scoble was inappropriately touchy with him in the past in a way that made him feel uncomfortable but didnt emotionally scar him it was not harassment.Thats an alarming revelation on its own, obviously.But its also a false assumption, according to the U.S.Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which defines harassment as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature.Put another way, you also dont have to be directly in charge of someone or cut their check to harass them.States the EEOC, The harasser can be the victims supervisor, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker, or someone who is not an employee of the employer, such as a client or customer.Yet there are other wrong-headed assumptions many of them.Take the idea that if a perpetrator was drinking at the same time that he or she was harassing another person and thus impaired by alcohol, that person should not be held accountable for their actions.This one relates to Scoble, too, who posted about going sober in 2015 and who has routinely mentioned that his poor behavior can be traced to a time when hed been drinking, as if that excuses anything.It doesnt, including from a legal standpoint.Voluntary intoxication is not a defense to sexual harassment or assault, says Chris Baker of Silicon Valley sexual harassment law firm Baker Curtis & Schwartz.The law does not think much of the argument that people are free to break the law so long as they are drunk when they do it.How about the defense thats most frequently used to normalize harassment that its just a man being a man?This argument was used by JunoWallet exec Chris Sweis, who penned a Medium post in July, titled I just watched the public neutering of a good man Dave McClure and cannot keep my mouth shut about it.In his ode to McClure, Sweis writes, That is what MEN doWe pursue women and women dress to be pursued, wear perfume to be pursued, and in Silicon Valley there are MANY WOMEN who dress to be pursued.In other words, boys will be boys, and besides, the women were asking for it.Sweis, rightly, took a lot of flack for that post.However, the idea that these are good guys just being men continues to pervade the tech landscape.We see it in the attitudes of many of Scobles Facebook commenters.Its on Medium and Twitter.Its there, in print, in the comments section of my TechCrunch post about Scoble allegedly carrying on after going sober.To defenders of this brand of thinking, calling out bad behavior is akin to a witch hunt (a strange label, considering the historical context of witch hunts).These womens stories of being groped and propositioned arent unnerving so much as they are lame examples of harassment.In fairness, shades of gray do occasionally exist, and no one should be judged prematurely.DFJ cofounder Steve Jurvetsons is being investigated for misconduct, but for what precisely isnt yet clear.One founder wrote on her Facebook page that there is rampant predatory behavior at the firm, yet this person has also said the two had a personal, not professional, relationship.Meanwhile several women familiar with the inner workings at DFJ insist that its simply not true that the firm treats women poorly, and two of them have come to Jurvetsons defense specifically.There are many things that women might wish were against the law but are not, too.I consider it harassment when Im whistled at, told to smile, or offered sexually suggestive comments while walking down the street.Each makes me feel unsafe.Legally, however, I have no defense.Similarly, when Scoble allegedly touched the knee of Michelle Greer, who worked with him at Rackspace for two years, she felt harassed and she says that feeling affected her work performance.Yet what Scoble did isnt necessarily against the law, according to Baker, who suggests that quid pro quo harassment is a step beyond what transpired between the two.Specifically, says Baker, its when someone conditions an employment or commercial benefit on putting up with, or accepting, sexual advances or conduct, he says.Hostile work environment harassment is just like it sounds, he adds.Its when the work environment is so sexually charged that it becomes hostile to a reasonable man or woman.Of course, to victims of harassment, whether the harassment is technically legal or not isnt really the point.Anyone who defends abusive and harassing behavior by claiming it doesnt violate the law should consider why their bar is so low, says Paradigm founder and CEO Joelle Emerson.Harassing behavior, whether it fits within a context anticipated by employment law or not, is incredibly harmful.It threatens physical and mental health.It depletes cognitive energy.It stalls career growth.It reinforces stereotypes, and perpetuates social inequality.Anyone that wants to argue, But hey, its technically legal!should know what it is theyre defending.So why the apparent confusion in the industry over what, exactly, constitutes sexual harassment?Emerson has a theory or three.I think often people who defend harassing behavior do so because they have engaged in such behavior themselves.Or they defend individuals accused of this behavior because they believe them to be generally good people.Or, as a rule, they just dont believe women.Certainly, as were seeing be it claims about Scoble or McClure or Donald Trump or Harvey Weinstein not only are some people willing to defend the actions of the accused, but theyll also question the women who come forward, even when there are scores of them.Some have a financial incentive to question the people who come forward with stories about their harassment.Scoble, for example, sits on the advisory board for Scottevest.Others look to Scobles influence in tech, with the hope that hell plug their product.For others still, it may be as Emerson suggests that, as a rule, they just dont believe women, depressing though that prospect may be.The one bright spot here is that after decades of repression, women and even some men are coming forward in droves to out their perpetrators.They have suffered under the weight of this type of abuse, and theyre finally able to have their day.Others are starting to wake up, to take action to protect those of us who wish for a safer, less hostile environment.Unfortunately, it looks like we still need to spell out what constitutes a bad actor to some who either dont know or dont wish to know that someone who they admired might not be the good

TechHub’s new NYC site brings London startups Revolut, Aire, Cronofy, Callsign:::::Co-working and startup office leviathan WeWork continues to expand in London.Its latest accounts show that it has 2 billion of lease commitments in the UK (25 offices in London and two in Manchester) over the next 25 years, indicating it is upbeat about the prospects of the city post-Brexit.However, rival office space provider Regus is less bullish, issuing a property warning recently amid signs Londons commercial office market could be hit by Brexit.Regus is valued at 1.9 billion, versus WeWorks $20 billion, even though it has 5 times as much office space globally.Try chewing on that One startup co-working company making another type of bet is Londons TechHub.While the US-HQd WeWork expands in London, TechHub is taking the fight to the US by expanding to New York.The self-styled global community for tech entrepreneurs also has presences in India and Eastern Europe.In NYC its emphasising its launch with the themes of fintech, security and enterprise, all strong sectors which both London and NYC are deeply into.Three London companies have chosen to make TechHub their launchpad in the US: fintech powerhouses Revolut and Aire, and Cronofys enterprise productivity tool, as well as security firm Callsign.Revolut is a global banking alternative allowing users to deal in multiple currencies in real time.Its raised a $66 million Series B fundraise and has over 850,000 customers worldwide.New York will be one of its first sites outside Europe.TechHub will be opening its doors at 158 W 27th St in the Chelsea area of Manhattan mid-November.Disclaimer: I am an occassional adviser to TechHub but have no operational role.Featured Image: Henrik Sorensen/Stone/Getty Images
A seven-year-old baseball fan with a 3D-printed hand is throwing out the first pitch of World Series Game 4:::::Hailey Dawson is already a veteran of tossing the ceremonial first pitch at the ripe old age of seven.Shes got two Major League games under her belt and is about to add a third, with her biggest audience yet, as she kicks off Game 4 of the World Series in Houston.Dawson is in the midst of a 30-ballpark tour, throwing the first pitch for every MLB team, with the aid of a 3D-printed prosthetic hand created by a research team at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.Dawson was born with a rare condition called Poland Syndrome, which left her missing three fingers on her right hand.But prosthetics are traditionally extremely pricey, and many insurance plans wont cover the $25,000+ to supply them for children, deeming them unnecessary, unlike a leg.Children quickly outgrow the devices and the cost starts to add up.Its a hole in the healthcare system that has been tackled by a number of groups in the 3D-printing industry, including not-for-profits like the Open Hand Project.Using a 3D printer to create a customized 3D-printed hand or arm dramatically reduces the manufacturing cost and allows for much easier part swapping, should something be broken or its wearer just grows out of it.Haileys mother, Yong, reached out to their local University, UNLV to ask if theyd be able to help create a custom prosthetic.Brendan OToole, chairman of the the schools mechanical engineering department, obliged.Additive manufacturing has made it possible to provide low-cost prosthetic devices for children like Hailey, he tells TechCrunch.We can now make a few measurements of a childs hand, process them through our custom design tool that generates 37 CAD models in a few minutes, and then have printed parts ready the next day.OTooles team got to work creating a hand on a Stratasys 3D printer.Thats the beauty of 3D printing, Stratasys Jesse Roitenberg told TechCrunch.Its not just printing the next rocket or the dashboard of a Ford.Its being used to improve lives.It also offers kids the ability to customize their arms, like that Iron Man kid a few years ago, or, in Dawsons case, the colors of the team shes visiting.Shes getting a custom hand for tonights game as well, but UNLVs not showing off whether its Dodger blue, Astros orange or something else a bit more neutral.First pitch airs tonight at 5:09 P.M. PT.As for what 3D printing means for the future of prosthesis, I believe with the movement thats going on right now, prosthetic companies might be shaking in their boots, says Roitenberg.They need to be looking into these alternative ways to create the prosthetics that they have.Update: Hailey arrived decked out in Astros orange, and caught the corner of the plate to raucous applause from the crowd in Houston.
How I cured my tech fatigue by ditching feeds:::::Gum sales have been relentlessly dropping for the past five years because people dont look around when they wait in line to pay.On paper, smartphones are amazing pieces of glass.They have magically cured boredom as we always have something to do those endless feeds of content are a perpetual source of inspiration, information and amusement.And yet, feeds need to die because they distort our views and disconnect us from other human beings around us.Many people have deleted the Facebook app from their phone to avoid this mindless habit.Whats going on in my feed?they think.Then they scroll, scroll, scroll, get bored and close the app.Repeat this process every 30 minutes.Deleting the app is the best way to take a stance and say that Facebook is a waste of time.But this idea is nothing new.Your phone battery isnt miraculously shrinking.Youre just spending time than ever using your phone.Flurry says that U.S. users spend nearly an hour in a Facebook app every day (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger).Imagine what you could do with all this time.Its easy to say that you dont have time to read books anymore.But its harder to justify it once you realize you spend an hour scrolling through your Facebook and Instagram feeds every day.And Im not judging here as I spend way too much time scrolling through my Twitter timeline every day.I probably spend more time staring at screens than most people too much time.But something clicked for me a couple of months ago.I suffered from tech fatigue once again and I wanted to change something.Tech companies are now directly fighting against empathy I now spend most of my weekends without ever checking a single feed.I dont even need to pay attention to my battery level because I ignore my iPhone for most of the day.At first, I thought I was missing out on some Very Important Content.I felt disconnected.I fought against my own FOMO.But now, I dont feel anything.Whats going on on Instagram?I dont care.Facebook is now the worst internet forum you can find.Twitter is filled with horrible, abusive people.Instagram has become a tiny Facebook now that it has discouraged all the weird, funny accounts from posting with its broken algorithm.LinkedIns feed is pure spam.And heres what I realized after forgetting about all those social networks.First, theyre tricking you and pushing the right buttons to make you check your feed just one more time.They all use thirsty notifications, promote contrarian posts that get a lot of engagement and play with your emotions.Posting has been gamified and you want to check one more time if you got more likes on your last Instagram photo.Everything is now a story so that you pay more attention to your phone and you get bored less quickly moving pictures with sound tend to attract your eyes.And many people now pay more attention to the Kardashian family than their neighbors.Second, I started paying attention to people around me.Phones have become a social tool to distance yourself from an uncomfortable situation.Somehow, if a homeless person yells at you, it has become acceptable to look at your phone and pretend that theres something really important happening on your screen.Nobody is going to judge you.Phone makers now sell you smartphones with taller displays so that you can see more posts at once on your phone and less details about the real world around you.And finally, I realized that I was missing out by constantly checking all my feeds.By putting my phone on Do Not Disturb for days, I discovered new places, started conversations and noticed tiny little things that made me smile.But sometimes youre not in a happy place and your phone can be a great way to escape from the real world.Books, movies and video games are also a great way to take a break from the real world.And youll probably get more out of them.Technology is great as it has improved the ways we communicate, share information and learn.It has generated economic value and reduced some inequalities.But it has gone too far.Tech companies are now directly fighting against empathy.They are building feeds that shape your mindset and distract you from the world around you.They want to fill you with rage to foster engagement until you feel empty inside.Feeds now divide people and affect the structure of our societies.Having a tiny computer in your pocket is great, but some people prefer feature phones for a reason.Forget about your phone for a minute, look around and talk with people next to you.Featured Image: Paul Taylor/Getty Images

Twitter makes another rule change; this time tackling revenge porn:::::In the latest of its (likely fruitless) attemptsto govern the seething mob that comprises its user base, Twitter rolled out a change in how it oversees the publication of what it euphemistically referred to as intimate media.The latest rule change intends to combat yet another toxic Twitter problem; the prevalence of revenge porn throughout its network.Earlier this year, Twitter was under fire for its slow response to naked photographs that were distributed by Rob Kardashian of his ex-girlfriend, seemingly without her consent.The photos circulated on the site for thirty minutes before they were taken down.The new policy from Twitter states that no one can post or share intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their consent.Twitters definition of intimate media includes content captured with a hidden camera that may involve nudity, partial nudity, and/or sexual acts; images that are sometimes called creepshots that involve a user being able to see genitalia, buttocks, or breasts of another person; images or videos taken in a private setting and not intended for public distribution; and any other images that may be deemed private.The company noted that some forms of consensual nudity and adult content are permitted on the site and gave itself a pretty big loophole should it fail to respond to something that could be a violation of its policy in a timely manner.The new policy states: To help prevent our teams from making a mistake and removing consensual intimate media, we may require a report from the actual subject or their authorized representative prior to taking any enforcement action.We will reply back to those reports via email and request that the subject provide documentation to verify their identity.Please note that this documentation will be destroyed once it is no longer needed by Twitter to evaluate the case and will not be shared with any third parties.We will not share any details about who reported this content with the violator.Luckily, this burden of proof standard doesnt apply to creepshots or upskirts.In those instances Twitter wont require documentation, as it is often difficult for victims of this content to identify themselves.Any account in violation of the new rules will be suspended, once Twitter identifies that the content was, indeed, distributed without consent.Retweeters will be asked to remove offending tweets with a warning that if they continue to violate the policy, their Twitter accounts will be suspended.Of course, as one of my esteemed co-workers noted, all of this is academic, since Twitter doesnt allow harassment or hate speech on its site either and those policies have worked out incredibly well.
Senator Feinstein makes broad request for all ‘Russia-connected’ Twitter and Facebook user data:::::The nature and extent of Russia or Russian-linked actors interfering with the Presidential election is yet to be determined, but its not for want of inquiries.Half the people on Capitol Hill are looking into it in one way or another, and Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA) is no exception; her position as head Democrat on the Judiciary Committee rather demands it.Today the Senator sent letters to several parties involved, including Facebook and Twitter, asking for a wide variety of documents relating to her investigations.Five letters were sent, requesting too many items to list here exhaustively.The two sent to Facebook and Twitter were similar down the phrasing in many questions.She thanks both companies for their cooperation with other investigations, then asks for documents relating to the ads found to be part of a coordinated effort to sway users in favor of voting Trump.Ads targeting similar subsets of people and metadata about the ads (clicks, shares, etc) are also requested.She also wants to see Documents sufficient to show whether and how [Facebook/Twitter] is undertaking efforts to identify other accounts that had a connection to Russias influence campaign in the 2016 election.In other words, what are you doing about it?Theres also an extremely broad request that I cant see either company fulfilling: All ads and organic content posted by Russia-connected users and targeted to any part of the United States, regardless of whether the individual or entity violated any [Facebook/Twitter] policy.And by Russia-connected she means in pretty much any way: language setting, currency or services used, IP address, or other targeting data.This seems like one the companies will push back on (and with good reason).I contacted both companies to see what they thought of the request.Twitter declined to comment, and Im waiting to hear back from Facebook.There are unique requests for both, however, and for specific interference methods supposed to have taken place on the respective platforms.Google, despite also being under suspicion of having interference activities take place on its platforms, was not contacted.One letter was sent to Michael Cohen, a Trump-related lawyer who is suggested to have orchestrated the release of DNC data through contacts in the Kremlin; he is requested to appear in person before November 6 and bring a truckload of data with him.Another went to Cambridge Analytica, the data analysis firm that the Trump campaign reportedly went to for help organizing the data produced by the DNC hack.The last letter went to the White House, asking for less tech-oriented info Comey and Kushner stuff.November 6 is the shared due date for all this information, though the data requested is extensive enough that we are likely to see pleas for time.Featured Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch
Tony West leaves Pepsi to become Uber’s new Chief Legal Officer:::::When youre a company facing almost as many federal investigations as a crime syndicate, who better to come in to run your legal team than a former Justice Department official?That may have been the question new Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi was asking when thinking about who to pick to help navigate his ride-sharing service through the murky legal waters its now sailing in.With Uber the subject of not one, not two, not three, but at least five federal investigations and a whole slew of lawsuits, Tony West, the former general counsel at PepsiCo and a senior Justice Department official in the Obama Administration, has his work cut out for him.The most valuable privately held company in the United States at the moment is currently under federal investigation for potentially violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; for developing software to spy on drivers for competing ride-sharing services; and for using software to allow its drivers to evade law enforcement in jurisdictions where it was not permitted to operate.Bloomberg News recently reported that the company was also facing probes into price-fixing and its involvement in the potential theft of trade secrets from Alphabet.That kind of casework would be a mountain for any legal eagle, but West also has to contend with the trade secrets battle between Uber and Alphabet subsidiary Waymo.In a statement to Ubers staff obtained by TechCrunch, chief executive Khosrowshahi noted that finding a strong legal partner has been one of my top priorities.Khosrowshahi praised Wests experience heading up an international team of lawyers and wrote that Wests experience as a former federal prosecutor and senior Department of Justice official meant that he was well equipped to handle the investigations into our past practices.West fills a slot that was vacant since Salle Yoo, the companys previous legal officer, resigned in early September, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.In the letter to Uber employees, Khosrowshahi praised Yoo for her service:
Factory operations manager Polymer spins out from Dandelion Chocolate:::::Not every startup journey starts as sweetly as the road co-founders Ishita Prasad and Maya Balakrishnan took to launching their new company, Polymer but then again, not every startup takes its inspiration from a chocolate factory.Spun out from the wildly successful (and wildly expensive) bean-to-bar San Francisco chocolate factory Dandelion Chocolate, Polymer quietly raised $2 million early this year to marry Prasads passion for small-scale (chocolate) manufacturing with her past career as an engineer at Alphabet.The company was actually born from Dandelions own needs, Prasad tells me.We started building it last October and we started building it just for Dandelion, she said.Polymer has a software that uses iPads and Android phones coupled with proprietary software to monitor compliance and line efficiency in small factories.Workers take pictures of the settings on their equipment and monitor what theyre putting into the equipment or on the line.That gets uploaded into a centralized database to give employers a snapshot of whats going on with their equipment and whats happening on the factory floor.Traditionally that oversight was done manually with pen and paper, says Prasad.The software also collects data directly from the factory equipment, according to Prasad.These kinds of insights were always available to big manufacturers, but smaller companies, like Dandelion have had to make do, Prasad said until now.Our first initial target market is with the smaller manufacturers who employ up to 500 people, said Prasad.They have tracking systems and ERPs that are really expensive.Thanks to requirements from the Food and Drug Administration, every small food company needs to track inputs and equipment for tracebacks in the event of a potential recall.Factories want to have the insights anyway, because if theres a problem on the line, its better to be able to identify it quickly and take steps to ensure that more batches arent affected by a defective product.The problem was compelling enough to convince Prasads fellow Stanford alumnus and good friend Balakrishnan to give up a job at Goldman Sachs in New York and come out to San Francisco to get Polymer off the ground.In the U.S. alone, 85 percent of manufacturers qualify as small businesses, employing between five and 500 people.Prasad estimates that the total is close to 200,000 small businesses in the U.S. that could be customers for the companys software.Certainly, the tech-savvy co-founder of Dandelion,Todd Masonis, who previously had started the professional networking company Plaxo, was convinced.He joined Harrison Metal, who led the round, along with other big-time angel investors like Andrew Chen from Uber, Brian Balfour of Reforge, Daniel Lurie and Jonathan Bruck from Pocket; and Bubba Murarka, along with other undisclosed investors.As for how a chocolate company spun out a polymer, Prasad told me the name was chosen because we wanted to build a tool to allow manufacturers to view the connections between each part of their factory.Like with polymers, we have created a product where the whole is much more useful than the sum of its individual parts using our tool allows manufacturers to gain much greater insights into their operations than if they were looking at individual pieces of data.
Representatives Pelosi and DelBene: ‘No tolerance’ for culture of harassment:::::Washington Congresswoman Suzan DelBene and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi recently visited the University of Washingtons Computer Science school to discuss the workplace of the 21st century and womens place in it.Their talk, delivered to an audience almost exclusively composed of young women in the sciences, covered a number of topics, but one given more serious consideration was that of sexual harassment in industries and disciplines dominated by men.The past week or so has been notable for innumerable women describing instances of harassment, often using the #MeToo hashtag.Decades of alleged abuse by Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein set off this latest show of solidarity, and Silicon Valley evangelist Robert Scoble has been implicated by multiple women, as well.(Many of these complaints have been made over and over for years, but the last month has provided another opportunity for them to be heard.)These women that are coming forth, God bless them, said Rep. Pelosi.Maybe this is the tipping point that shows it has to be a zero tolerance policy.This is about respect.Rep. DelBene, who has been on the fore with programs and policies empowering women in the tech and science fields, emphasized the necessity of adjusting larger patterns of inequality, as well.Its about having a culture where women feel theres someone they can go to who will hear them, she said.Thats why having women in management, women on boards is so important.Pelosi continued: We need to make it easier for someone to bring a complaint, and to review the climate it occurred in and make sure it doesnt weigh against them.Better representation at all levels was clearly a major goal of both women; DelBene studied the sciences and later worked at Microsoft, so shes seen how many fields have changed over time some for the better, some not so much.She noted that when she started at Microsoft, she was pregnant and her colleagues were almost all young men, and there was little in the way of accommodation for her in the culture or policies of the company.Thats changing, but the numbers still arent where they ought to be.When I graduated in the 80s, 37 percent of computer science graduates were women, she pointed out.Now its under 20 percent.(But rising; Ed Lazowska, head of UWs CSE school, noted proudly that 44 percent of the incoming grad students there are women.)Its important that girls are encouraged and given the same opportunities as boys at an early age get young women and girls that early exposure, DelBene said.Ive been saying: K-12, K-12, K-12, said Pelosi.Everything we do begins in the classroom.And nothing brings more money to the Treasury than investing in education.She also pointed out that every business is a tech company now to some degree, and that the skills learned in computer science and engineering fields contribute to success in nearly any job or field.Both also agreed that reliable internet connectivity needed to be guaranteed as well, or even the most motivated kids would miss out on opportunities taken for granted in better-wired areas.After answering a few questions on immigration (Pelosi noted that every president shes worked under has been staunchly pro-immigration until now) and basic research (DelBene said the risk-averse strategy of for-profit businesses is leaking into academia), one audience member brought up the topic of misinformation its worth noting that she and everyone else carefully avoided the now-loaded term fake news.Rep. DelBene said that trust plays a big part in this, but also knowing where information comes from.This comes back to validation, she said.First the information has to be tied to a source, and then people can decide for themselves whether they trust that source.Policy will play a role in this but we all have a role to play, as well.Tech is a blessing, but it can also be exploited, said Rep. Pelosi.We have to enlarge the issue to something bigger we have to do this as a public-private partnership and put the best minds on it.I believe tech can answer its own challenge.I believe they [i.e.internet companies] are patriots and they want to do the right thing.That would put her on the optimistic side of this recent survey of experts on the topic.But the biggest guardian of our democracy is a free and open press, she concluded.You can keep up with the latest from Congresswoman DelBene here, and Minority Leader Pelosi here.
$1,000 tea infuser startup Teforia shuts down:::::In what the company is calling a very difficult time for hardware companies in the smart kitchen space, Tea infusion device startup Teforia is saying it is ceasing operations today, according to its website.The above note about it being hard for hardware companies in the smart kitchen is likely a reference to devices like the now-defunct Juicero (which raised more than $100 million in venture financing).Teforias main product was an internet-connected tea infuser that could brew the pre-packaged teas from the startup, which it called Sips.Users pack the Sips into the companys infusion globe, and those packages cost a couple of bucks each.The price tag was very high, much like some of these other Silicon Valley solutions that look to hit people with more spending power.However, the reality of our business is that it would take a lot more financing and time to educate the market and we simply couldnt raise the funds required in what is a very difficult time for hardware companies in the smart kitchen space, the company said on its website.Therefore, it is with heavy hearts that we are announcing that all business operations, for Teforia Company, will cease effective today.We will continue to seek a partner that can leverage Teforia technology and/or provide Sips tea sales to continue our mission of elevating the tea experience.Hopefully, you will see Teforia technology in future products.Teforia raised $12 million just about a year ago in a financing round led by Translink Capital, with Upfront Ventures, Lemnos Labs, Correlation Ventures and Mousse Partners also investing in the company.The device was originally priced at $649 when it raised $5.1 million in a seed round led by Upfront Ventures.A little more than a week ago the site listed the devices price at almost $1,000 (or about the cost of an iPhone X).Users can still purchase the infuser, which now costs $200, as well as a variety of teas, until November 3.The tea industry is a massive one, and there may have been room for a product at the higher-income bend for tea consumers, especially ones looking for a simpler experience while still looking to brew with loose leaf without having to manage quantities, temperature or time.The whole process of brewing a perfect cup of tea can, indeed, be quite fickle though the average consumer probably wont meditate too hard on a 10-degree difference in brew temperature.In our mission to deliver the best tea experience, we didnt compromise on the Teforia Infuser technology, quality or the premium tea packaged within our Sips, the company said on its website.The glass within the infusion globe and carafe are hand blown by a glass artisan, one at a time.We spent a tremendous amount of time pioneering our Sips tea container to be 90% compostable and completely recyclable.We went to these extraordinary lengths because we believe premium loose leaf tea should be delivered in the most delicate and sustainable way possible.Its hard not to read into that line a little bit with the whole notion of spending hundreds of dollars simplifying somewhat simple tasks, though by applying technology its totally possible that youd end up with better tea.There are a lot of products beyond just Juicero that want to target this higher-income bracket with smarter or slicker devices that might require some precise measurements and mixtures in the same way that the Keurig originally tried to simplify brewing a single cup of coffee.(The Keurig costs under $100).We reached out to their press email, which bounced, as well as CEO Allen Han, to triple-check that the startup has shut down according to the open letter posted on the website.Han replied, saying our thoughts are captured in the message on our website.
Encrypted chat app Signal goes down for some users:::::If youre having problems with Signal, youre not alone.On Friday, many users took to Twitter to report that beloved encrypted messaging app Signal was offline.While some users have been unable to access Signals servers since around 11AM PT, others have only seen delays in sending and receiving messages.Aaaand Signal is down.Eva (@evacide) October 27, 2017 @whispersystems Signal was down for me and my friends for 30min about 30min ago.Failure to connect on desktop,not delivered error on mobile Jesse Bettencourt (@jessebett) October 27, 2017 Signal is back after a brief service interruption, Open Whisper Systems wrote in a tweet at 12:21 PM PT.We appreciate your patience as we added more capacity to resolve connection errors.On mobile, one Signal message I sent went through after 15 minutes, but the friend I sent it to didnt seem to be having any trouble at all.Meanwhile, Signal on desktop completely stopped working, stalling out sent messages in whats usually a lively group thread.Some of our New York-based team is seeing slight delays, but things look mostly up for the handful who sent a test message.As things come back online, let us know if you have continued issues.Featured Image: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/Getty Images
Maramoja has a different take on the ride-hailing market in Africa:::::Taxi-hailing service Maramoja started as an Uber for Africa, but has since taken a different spin on it.I came out here to start basically Uber for Africa, Maramoja CEO Jason Eisen told me.The idea was bring some technology to the Nairobi tech scene, which was blossoming, but nothing was happening in transportation.Since then, Uber, with its billions of dollars in venture capital, has made its way to Africa.Ubers entrance is what prompted Maramoja to rethink its model a bit.Instead of treating drivers like commodities, Maramoja thinks of drivers as people and as individuals with relationships and clients, Eisen said.To get a ride using Maramoja, you whip out your mobile phone, open up the Android app or web app on your phone, and hail a car.Within a few minutes, a trusted driver will be there to pick you up.You can pay with either cash or card.These drivers are recommended to passengers through friends, friends of friends and your broader network.Soon, Maramoja is launching a feature that lets passengers report accidents, attacks or other emergencies.While in Nairobi, my co-worker and I hailed a Maramoja car on the way back from the shoot to our hotel.It was a seamless experience, minus the part when the police pulled us over.But it seems that had nothing to do with the driver and more to do with that particular police officer wanting money.Once the police interaction was over, my colleague asked the driver what happened, and the driver mentioned corruption.Anyway, Maramoja has signed contracts with 24 countries throughout Africa to bring its trust-based taxi app franchise to those markets.Down the road, Maramoja sees itself expanding into additional markets.Any sector where youre exposing your home, health, assets or business to any sort of risk, theres a better way than what any kind of other company has put out, Eisen said.
7 steps for crafting the perfect password:::::Your password can ruin your life.I know that sounds dramatic, but its true.If someone figures out your email password, youre in trouble.Social media?Even worse.Once hackers access your online bank account, they can wreck your finances, and you may feel the repercussions of that break-in for years.It seems not a week goes by that we dont hear about another data breach.How do you know if the hackers have your info?Click here to find out whether your email has been hacked or stolen.Most of us have the wrong idea about passwords.We think they have to be convoluted messes, like F$%Th5l2K!&.This theory that passwords should be nonsensical and hard to remember reigned for years.It started in 2003 with guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which insisted on random combinations of numbers, letters and symbols.The organizations manager, Bill Burr, spread this gospel for years.But in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, he admitted that this wasnt nearly as effective as hed thought.Thanks to a new round of research, cybersecurity experts have changed their tune.Yes, you should still avoid guessable passwords like p@ssword1 or letmein.But a strong password also can be logical, fluid and easy to remember.1.Passwords should withstand 100 guesses This is the most important part: No matter what your password is, it should withstand 100 guesses, which means it shouldnt be tied to any public information about you or your family.Hackers often turn to your social media profiles to find information about you, such as your birthday and the name of your pet.And a little data goes a long way.Experts believe criminals can guess the average person's password nearly 73 percent of the time, and they can often access other accounts by using slight variations of the same password.Facebook is all about making it easy to share your life with your friends and family.Unfortunately, there are some things you shouldn't share online.These bits of information can put you in danger of identity theft, losing your job or causing other major headaches.Click here for five of the biggest offenders you should not put on your profile.2.Use a phrase Instead of thinking of your password as a secret code, think of it as a passphrase.These are strings of words that are both easy to memorize but hard for anyone else to crack.Suppose you wanted to be an astronaut when you were a kid, and your favorite color is fuchsia.You have never mentioned these facts online, and only your mom knows such trivia about you.You could compose a passphrase like ilikefuschiaastronauts.Youll never forget it, and the passphrase will confound hackers for (literally) centuries.I told how to create a great passphrase a little over a year ago, and the advice is still valid.Go here to come up with your own.3.Go long You might want to sit down for this one: The new NIST guidelines suggest allowing users to create passwords up to 64 characters long.As if that isnt weird enough, the guidelines also allow spaces between words.While many people just try to meet the minimum requirement of eight characters, you will get a much stronger password by stretching things out.You could theoretically create a complex list or sentence, which still makes perfect sense to you.You could list all your pets names from childhood, like fluffy princess rex spike booboo chewie, or all the streets on the way to your favorite restaurant, like academy main washington ohio central.Easy to remember.Hard to crack.4.Dont change your password until you have to Until recently, consumers were advised to change their passwords every three months.But as NISTs Paul Grassi recently told the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Expiration isnt a motivator to create a brand-new password, its motivation to shift one character so you can remember the password.If youve created a strong password, then dont worry about changing it out all the time.Just stick with it unless youve been notified of a security breach that requires a password reset.5.Choose something memorable Remember, all passwords should be unique, but they dont have to be cumbersome.NIST calls passwords memorized secrets.You want to avoid the temptation to write them down, so pick passwords that mean something to you and will stay in your mind.Im not a big fan of password managers.I commit my passwords to memory.But if you cannot do that, heres a free program that will help you store your passwords safely and easily.6.Get creative with characters It may take websites some time to catch up to the latest NIST guidelines, but you can still create a memorable password that meets current restrictions.Go back to Burrs advice on passphrases.You might choose something like ArizonaCardinalsfootballisnumber1!or Igivemyjob1000%everyday.Those meet the requirements of having at least eight characters, a special character, and upper and lowercase letters.7.Use two-factor identification While passwords help protect your information, cybercriminals are more sophisticated than ever.If they break into your accounts, you may not recognize the damage until its too late.Months passed before the public learned about the Equifax breach, and its hard to assess how much information was leaked and how it will be used.(If you havent checked to see if your personal details are in the hands of cybercrooks, click here and do it now.)Thats why two-factor identification is so important.Using text messages, emails or special apps, an account-holder will receive a notification every time a password is changed, or when its entered on a new device or at a new location.You will have to verify that its you trying to gain access.How do

Secret ghostly portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots, discovered beneath 16th-century painting:::::Experts have discovered a secret portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots, that has been hidden for centuries beneath another painting.X-ray technology was used to reveal the ghostly unfinished portrait of the Scottish Queen, who reigned from 1542 to 1567.Convicted of treason against Queen Elizabeth I of England, she was beheaded at Fotheringay Castle in England in 1587.Marys portrait was painted over with a portrait of Sir John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane.The 1589 painting of Maitland, who was Lord Chancellor of Scotland, has been attributed to the Dutch artist Adrian Vanson.LONG-LOST DARK AGE KINGDOM DISCOVERED IN SOUTHERN SCOTLAND Marys hidden portrait was discovered by Dr. Caroline Rae, a research fellow at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London.Working with National Galleries of Scotland, Rae examined the painting using x-ray technology, which penetrates layers of paint but does not penetrate pigments containing heavy metals such as lead white, a white pigment that was used in paintings of that time.The x-ray reveals the shadowy outline of a woman, who experts believe is Mary, Queen of Scots, based on other depictions of the controversial queen.After abdicating the Scottish throne amid suspicions that she was implicated in her husbands murder, Mary was imprisoned from 1568 until her death by her cousin Elizabeth I, who perceived her as a threat.RARE ROMAN COIN DISCOVERED ON REMOTE SCOTTISH ISLAND In a statement, Rae described the discovery of the hidden portrait as an exciting revelation.Vansons portrait of Sir John Maitland usually hangs in Ham House, near London, but is part of a new display that opens Oct. 28 at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh.The fact that Marys portrait was painted over with a portrait of Sir John Maitland just two years after her execution may reflect someones desire to distance themselves from the Scottish queen.TEENAGER'S DISCOVERY OF ROMAN TREASURE TROVE DELIGHTS EXPERTS Vansons portrait of Sir John Maitland is an important picture in the National Trust collection, and the remarkable discovery of the unfinished portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots adds an exciting hidden dimension to it, said David Taylor, curator of pictures and sculpture at the National Trust, which owns Ham House.It shows that portraits of the queen were being copied and presumably displayed in Scotland around the time of her execution, a highly contentious and potentially dangerous thing to be seen doing.The portrait discovery is just the latest fascinating find to shed new light on Scotlands rich history.Earlier this year, for example, experts announced the discovery of a rare Roman coin on a remote island in the Orkney archipelago.Archaeologists and volunteers also found the location of a long-lost early medieval kingdom in southern Scotland.In 2014, a stunning hoard of ancient silver, believed to have been used as bribes by Romans, was discovered with a metal detector by a teenager in Dairsie, in the Scottish region of Fife.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers
Opioid crisis: Sellers tout prescription drugs on social media:::::As Americas opioid crisis escalates, sellers touting drugs for sale without prescription have surfaced on YouTube and Facebook, where the social media giants unwittingly help fuel the illegal trade.Eric Feinberg, who runs anti-counterfeiting company GIPEC, forwarded to Fox News screenshots from Facebook of sellers purportedly offering the likes of opioid pain medication Fentanyl and other prescription drugs.TRUMP DECLARES OPIOID EPIDEMIC PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY HERES WHAT THAT MEANS You can buy Fentanyl Transdermal patches online without prescription (No RX) from us at relatively low prices, explained one post.Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have been cited as major killers in Americas opioid epidemic.Fox News forwarded three examples of Facebook prescription drug sellers to the social network, including the post selling Fentanyl."Facebook's Community Standards prohibit any attempts by private individuals to purchase, sell, or trade prescription drugs," a Facebook spokeswoman told Fox News, via email."Once something is reported to us, our teams review it and will remove it if it violates those policies.In this case, the profiles and Page in question violated our Community Standards and have been taken down."President Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency Thursday.Videos promoting opioid sales have also emerged on YouTube.Buy Oxycodone Oxycotin Percocet Roxycodone Vicodine [SIC], explains one video.Order without prescription no hassle involved.1-YEAR-OLD DIES AFTER INGESTING POWERFUL SYNTHETIC OPIOID Buy Percocet Online, says the post accompanying another video.No RX Require.Percocet is a powerful, highly addictive painkiller.Authorities believe that a street version of the drug was linked to a spate of overdosesin Georgia earlier this year.The Centers for Disease Control estimates that 91 Americans die every day from opioid overdose.More than 1,000 are treated in emergency departments every day for not using prescription opioids as directed, according to CDC data.ARIZONA BILLIONAIRRE FUELED OPIOID CRISIS WITH BRIBERY SCHEME, AUTHORITIES SAY Feinberg told Fox News that he has been monitoring social media posts related to opioid sales since 2013.Its so available, he said.Is there a correlation between the opioid crisis and the rise of social media?Fox News has reached out to YouTube for comment on this story.On Thursday President Trump announced new steps to combat what he described as the worst drug crisis in U.S. history.Trump's declaration, which will be effective for 90 days and can be renewed, will allow the government to redirect resources in various ways and to expand access to medical services in rural areas.Critics, however, have urged the government to bring new dollars to the battle against opioid abuse.The Associated Press contributed to this article.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers
Robots will be 100 times smarter than humans in 30 years, tech exec says:::::Masayoshi Son, the CEO of Japanese tech conglomerate Softbank, has been preparing his company for this scenario for quite some time.Now the tech exec thinks robots will not just outsmart humans, but will have an IQ of 10,000 in the next 30 years.Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Son, who has made countless investments in companies related to artificial intelligence including chip companies Nvidia and ARM Holdings stated that robots will surpass human-level intelligence rapidly and ultimately become far smarter than humanity has ever dreamed of.STEPHEN HAWKING: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COULD END THE HUMAN RACE "Singularity is the concept that [mankind's] brain will be surpassed, this is the tipping point, crossing point, that artificial intelligence, computer intelligence surpass [mankind's] brain and that is happening in this century for sure," Son was quoted as saying at the conference."I would say there is no more debate, no more doubt."By comparison, an average level IQ for a human is between 90 and 110.Geniuses such as Stephen Hawking have been estimated to have an IQ level around 160.However, Hawking has never taken an official intelligence test, according to a report in British newspaper The Independent.Mensa, the self-proclaimed "high IQ society," admits people to become members after they have demonstrated intelligence levels "at or above the 98th percentile on certain standardized IQ or other approved intelligence tests."For StanfordBinet, the minimum accepted score is 132, whereas for the Cattell test, it is 148.Singularity is rapidly approaching The timeframe for singularity, the concept that machines will become smarter than the human brain, is up for debate.In March, Googles Director of Engineering Ray Kurzweil said that by 2029 "computers will have human-level intelligence."For his part, Son has repeatedly said it will happen in the "next 30 years or so."He has helped position his company Softbank, which also owns a controlling stake in U.S. telecom provider Sprint, for the upcoming singularity.In May 2017, Softbank launched the Vision Fund, which is targeting up to $100 billion in investments around the world, for companies "that seek to enable the next age of innovation."This includes areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, mobile applications and computing.Since its launch, the fund has made a number of investments, including the aforementioned stake in Nvidia, a $4 billion investment in workplace startup WeWork, and is reported to be working on a major investment in Uber, which is working on autonomous vehicles.In addition to Softbank's investments in the AI space, it already has a humanoid robot, Pepper, which can perceive a person's emotions.Son envisions that is just the beginning, saying robots will learn by themselves and "maybe [are] going to laugh at you and us.Today they look cute, they will stay cute, but they will be super smart."In August, a Pepper robot became an ordained Buddhist priest.ELON MUSK THINKS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COULD CAUSE WORLD WAR III Perils despite the promise While Son, 60, appears to be betting on the promise and the positive effect that intelligent robots may have on society, not everyone is on board.Luminaries such as Hawking and tech executive Elon Musk have warned against the potential pitfalls of artificial intelligence, though not necessarily in robot form.Last month, Musk tweeted that artificial intelligence could cause World War 3, following comments made by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that the country "who becomes the leader in this sphere [artificial intelligence] will be the ruler of the world."Hawking has also sounded the alarm bells, going so far as to say, "The development of full artificial intelligence (AI) could spell the end of the human race."This past week, Sophia, a humanoid robot, became the first robot to receive citizenship of a country, being awarded citizenship in Saudi Arabia.After it received the citizenship, Sophia was interviewed by a member of the media about concerns it could do harm to humanity.It responded, by saying, "You've been reading too much Elon Musk.And watching too many Hollywood movies.Don't worry, if you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you."Follow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia.
A robot just got citizenship, and to celebrate it trolled Elon Musk:::::Sophia, the first humanoid robot to receive citizenship of a country, just made fun of Elon Musk in an interview.I won't blame you if end of the world scenarios pop into your mind.After all, the visionary behind SpaceX and Tesla has often warned about the dangers of artificial intelligence.But it's unclear at this point what Sophia can actually do by itself.Created by Hong Kong-based robot manufacturer Hanson Robotics, Sophia was awarded the citizenship of Saudi Arabia, where it attended the Present at the Future Investment Institute.In an interview with CNBC, Sophia talked about itself with Andrew Sorkin.When Sorkin said "we all want to prevent a bad future," Sophia was quick to answer back.And that's when it trolled Musk: Our @andrewrsorkin, interviewing "Sophia" the robot, of Hanson Robotics:@CNBC @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/Dzw8jS5YSB -- Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) October 25, 2017 "You've been reading too much Elon Musk.And watching too many Hollywood movies.Don't worry, if you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you.Treat me as a smart input-output system," the robot said.Can Sophia think for itself?The interview seems to suggest so.At the same time, the robot may simply be preprogrammed to deliver snark and ironic comments, especially at the expense of anyone who criticizes advancements in AI.Musk, unsurprisingly, replied: Just feed it The Godfather movies as input.What's the worst that could happen?https://t.co/WX4Kx45csv -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 26, 2017 Sorkin also said towards the end of the interview that some of it was planned, but he just learned that Sophia will be the first robot to receive the citizenship of Saudi Arabia."I am very honored and proud for this unique distinction.This is historical to be the first robot in the world to be recognized with a citizenship," Sophia answered.The full interview with Sophia is available at this link.
US Army eyes new lightweight hot weather uniform, jungle boots:::::The U.S. Army is developing a lightweight hot weather alternative to the current Army Combat Uniform (ACU) and new jungle boots.The current ACU weighs about 1.4 pounds and has lots of pockets and multiple layers of fabric.This means that when it gets wet, it tends to stay wet, the Army explained in a statement released this week.And when it's hot out, it tends to keep soldiers hot, it added.The answer is the Improved Hot Weather Army Combat Uniform, which has fewer pockets, layers of fabric and Velcro, the Army said.The new uniform also uses a lighter fabric.THE EVOLUTION OF US MILITARY CAMOUFLAGE: FROM BASIC GREEN AND KHAKI TO DIGITAL PATTERNS AND BEYOND "You can hold that uniform up with one finger," said Brig.Gen. Brian P. Cummings, Program Executive Officer (PEO) Soldier, out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in the statement.While the current ACU has had a lot of positive feedback, Cummings noted that the likes of shoulder pockets, pen pockets, leg pockets and Velcro swatches for patches require multiple layers of fabric, fastening material and buttons.All of these features hold water and cost money, he added.The jacket from the Improved Hot Weather Army Combat Uniform is on display at PEO Soldier.HISTORY OF CAMOUFLAGE IN PICTURES U.S. soldiers in jungle environments will be the first to get their hands on the lightweight uniform, specifically the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii.Cummings said that the Army eventually wants to make the uniform available to all soldiers.The Army hopes that the new uniform will be available within a year.Cummings explained, however, that the new uniforms fabric may prove more susceptible to wrinkling after washing.This could be fixed with the application of an anti-wrinkling treatment, although that would depend on whether the treatment interfered with the uniforms ability to wick away water.The new uniforms flame-resistant capability also needs to be considered, according to Cummings.In addition to the new uniform, the Army is also working on a new jungle boot.Last month, soldiers in the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii received 30,000 pairs of the new design to evaluate.EVOLUTION OF COMBAT BOOTS: FROM BOOTEES TO MODERN TACTICAL BOOTS Feedback on the boots has been positive, but Cummings said that soldiers want a boot that is lighter and softer.They have also requested thinner soles.The next set of samples, Cummings said, will be "a lot more pliable.And able to serve the soldier well.But instead of lasting five years, they [will] last two years."The newer boots will also go through evaluation with soldiers and share features with the boots currently being tested.These capabilities include puncture resistance, more drainage holes, the ability to wick away water, the ability to push water and mud off the soles, speed laces and lower profile heels so as not to catch on vines on the jungle floor, according to the Armys statement.HISTORY OF COMBAT BOOTS IN PICTURES Last year, the U.S. Navy announced that it is getting rid of its blue camouflage blueberries uniform.
New Uber feature lets you add multiple stops on a trip:::::Just in time for Halloween, Uber has introduced a new feature that lets you add up to three stops to your journey.To try it out, tap "where to?"then the "+" icon.Then, just add the addresses of your stops, and request the ride.If a friend decides to come or bails at the last minute, no worries: you can add or remove stops during your trip as necessary."Your driver will automatically receive directions to each of the stops so you can sit back and relax," Uber Product Manager Don Stayner wrote in a blog post.The app-based car service admitted that arriving to events as a group "hasn't always been easy with Uber."Until now, your options for doing that were to meet at one place and catch an Uber from there, or change your destination mid-trip.The new multiple stops feature should make things a lot easier."Whether you're heading to a costume party with friends, or a night out with your other half, you'll be able to arrive in one piece this Halloween weekend and beyond with the multiple stops feature," Stayner wrote.Uber has been busy adding new features as of late, including in-app chat and the ability to request a ride for someone else.Earlier this year, Uber also added a tipping feature to appease frustrated drivers and save riders from fumbling with their wallets.Meanwhile, Uber is also facing some major challenges, including a ban in London and a federal investigation into its alleged use of spying software.For more, check out our Uber Tips for a Smooth Rideshare.This article originally appeared on PCMag.com.
Your spam is getting dangerous:::::Spam, once just an annoyance, is becoming downright dangerous.In 2004, Bill Gates said two years from now, spam will be solved.That never happened.And while the spam rate saw a steady decline after 2011, there has been an recent uptick as the maliciousness of spam has increased.In the first half of 2017, the spam rate reached 54 percent, after bottoming out at 53 percent for both 2015 and 2016 with all signs point to a continuation of this upward trajectory, software security giant Symantec said in an October 2017 internet security report.5 PHISHING SCAMS YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF The report cites email as the most frequently used delivery mechanism for malware.No other distribution channel comes close, Symantec said.The attackers just fire off a spam message to a target...and thats itno need to rely on indirect methods where the target might or might not visit a compromised site or click a malicious banner ad."It is a direct channel to an end user...[and] can cut a large swath through a variety of network security layers," Symantec added.Malicious spam can also often result in ransomware, a Symantec spokesperson told Fox News.Enter infamous spambots Lately, the operative word is "malicious" for spam arriving in your inbox."A lot of spam is aimed at dropping malware on your machine," Jonathan Penn, Director of Strategy internet security firm Avast, which offers products such as Avast Internet Security, told Fox News."That malware is often a botnet, and botnets are especially stealthy since their value is directly tied to how long they can remain undetected," Penn added.The most widely used method to distribute malicious email is spambots, which is often part of a larger botnet a bunch of Internet-connected devices running bots and is one of many tasks that the particular botnet carries out, according to the Symantec report.The Onliner spambot, which bypassed email filters to make it appear as though the emails were coming from legitimate sources, got a lot of attention this past summer because it inadvertently exposed its own email spamming list that included 711 million addresses.FAKE NEWS IS HERE TO STAY, STUDY SAYS The social engineering is nuanced, designed to trick the recipient into clicking on the attachment, thus triggering a copy of the Ursnif Trojan to install," Adam Levin, chairman CyberScout LLC, a provider of internet security solutions, wrote in a blog post.Onliner was used to deliver malware into inboxes, resulting in more than 100,000 unique infections across the world, according to a report in technology website ZDNet.Other infamous malicious spam includes Emotet, which is often disguised as a legitimate PDF file or invoice, and the Tofsee spambot which may contain links within the emails that lead to phishing sites, where any personal details entered are likely used for identity theft or romance scams, according to the Symantec report.
Will you be able to get the iPhone X at launch?:::::How hard will it be to get the iPhone X at launch?Thats the burning question before the release of Apples much-heralded revamp of the iPhone on Nov. 3.The iPhone X sports what Apple calls a revolutionary new design with a 5.8-inch all-screen display, wireless charging, new 3D sensors, augmented reality, facial recognition and an advanced rear camera.WILL CONSUMERS PAY $1,000 (OR MORE) FOR THE NEXT IPHONE?Earlier this week, Apple said the new iPhone will be available at its stores for walk-in customers, who are encouraged to arrive early."Pre-orders began Friday morning October 27 at 12:01 a.m. PDT and shipping times were already slipping, just a few hours later.Both the 64GB version and the 256GB version were already showing shipping dates between 5 and 6 weeks a few hours after the device was made available.For the average consumer waltzing into an Apple Store on Friday Nov. 3, the prospects of picking up an iPhone are not great."We anticipate very limited quantities at launch as the supply of key components has been constrained," Jitesh Ubrani, an IDC analyst, told Fox News.Things could slowly improve, however.Recently weve heard that a few obstacles have been cleared so this should mean more product availability later in November and December, Ryan Reith, another analyst at IDC told Fox News.But supply may not catch up to demand until next year."Apple will [have] supply constraint on the iPhone X until well into the start of 2018," Wayne Lam, IHS Markit, Principal Analyst, Mobile Electronics, told Fox News.One estimate, from oft-cited Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, puts availability at between two and three million units at launch.If accurate, that may be a drop in the bucket for expected overall demand at launch.The consensus for total production in the fourth calendar quarter of this year, ending Dec. 31, falls between 25 and 30 million units, depending on which analysts forecast you believe.Morgan Stanley believes Apple will sell 30 million iPhone X units in the calendar fourth quarter.APPLE ISSUES RESPONSE TO SENATE INQUIRY ON FACE ID CONCERNS Smartphone market reset Apple is trying to establish a new smartphone high water mark with a device packed to the gills with new technology.The 5.8-inch Super Retina display, Apples first organic-light-emitting diode display on an iPhone, is the thing most consumers will recognize immediately as being different.Thats because its all-glass with no bezels, a first for an iPhone.The other stand-out is the notch at the top of display.That contains, among other things, Apples TrueDepth camera that enables Face ID another first for Apple.On the back is a redesigned rear camera with dual optical image stabilization (for reduced blurring) on both the wide angle and telephoto lenses.With the new design and new tech, Morgan Stanley expects great things for the iPhone X, forecasting how iPhone X demand will drive revenue gains for a number of major suppliers in the supply chain of iPhone X component manufacturers.
This artificial intelligence may start tracking you soon:::::Its already 1984 in China.For the last year, the people of Hangzhou, China a city of more than nine million have had every moment of their lives tracked.City Brain, an artificial intelligence system that interlinks with a citys infrastructure was installed in October 2016, through a partnership with Alibaba and Foxconn.In an effort to optimize Hangzhou and make urban life easier, the system tracked everything from robberies to traffic jams and learned the citys unique patterns and needs.Residents were also tracked through their activity on social media.Their commutes, purchases, interactions and movements were all learned and absorbed by the AI database.In China, people have less concern with privacy, which allows us to move faster, Xian-Sheng Hua, an AI manager at Alibaba, said during a presentation at the World Summit AI meeting in early October.And, according to New Scientist, the system works.Crime, car crashes and rush hour traffic is all down.The system can predict traffic jams and adjust the traffic lights in order to avoid congestion before it begins.It can also keep track of criminals, making it easier for police to catch them.And it automatically notifies authorities when it detects so much as an illegally parked car.The system is also hooked up to residents cell phones and can alert them of bad weather or traffic jams and offer safer routes.City Brain has apparently been such a success that its already being packaged for other cities across China and, eventually, the world.This story originally appeared in the New York Post.
Finally, someone has designed a real flying hoverboard — and it flies at 80mph:::::Finally, someone has designed a real hoverboard -- and it flies at 80mph 13 Hours Ago | 02:09 Franky Zapata always dreamed of flying, but being color blind, he was disqualified from becoming a helicopter pilot.Instead, he focused his energy on jet ski racing, and eventually created his own water recreation company, Zapata Racing.Still, Zapata never gave on his dream."If I can't fly in a regular way, I will create my own flying machine," he told CNBC recently.Using a number of model airplane jets and a platform, Zapata designed the EZ Fly.The machine is capable of reaching speeds of up to 80mph and an altitude of 9,000ft.The pilot controls the EZ Fly by leaning in the direction that they want to go.Along with the hardware, Franky designed a stability algorithm to keep the board as steady as possible and make flying easier.
A biotech investor explains the hype over gene therapy:::::Gene therapy has been in the news a lot of late as a potential cure for a variety of genetic diseases.The biggest breakthrough involved a unanimous backing from U.S. Food and Drug Administration's advisory panel for a new gene therapy from Sparks Therapeutics, intended to treat rare eye diseases.But what exactly is gene therapy, and does it deserve all that hype?CNBC sat down with Canaan Venture Partners' biotech investor Nina Kjellson for a simple explanation of how it all works, and why she's excited about it.As Kjellson explains, in the most simple terms, gene therapy is a technique that uses genes to treat disease.The first patients were tested about twenty-five years ago, but early trials were not uniformly successful.In one notable case, it led to the death of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger, who got an infusion of trillions of genetically engineered viruses into his liver.Sparks has seen some better results for its therapy, which treats a rare condition that causes a form of blindness that often starts in childhood.Its treatment involves using a modified version of a virus to carry a healthy version of the gene into the retina.Think of it as a good copy of the gene.The crazy part?Doctors will inject billions of these viruses or "vectors" into both of the patient's eyes to reach the cells where it's needed.The FDA hasn't approved Sparks' therapy just yet, but it usually follows the advice of the advisory committee.A big obstacle remains and that's price.The cost for each patient could be as high as $1 million, which insurance companies might decline to cover.For Kjellson, these experimental therapies have a lot of promise as they could treat a wide variety of medical conditions, starting with genetic disorders caused by mutations in single genes.It's still early days, but the hope is that gene therapy might someday replace drugs or surgery by fixing the problem at its root.
2017 Hyundai Elantra GT Sport first drive - not the fiery hatchback I'm looking for:::::Hyundai Elantra and Elantra GT aren't as alike as other vehicles that share similar names.The front fascia, rear and interior are completely different.The ride and handling characteristics are changed, and additional sound deadening is present to keep out the echo from an open cargo area.The Elantra GT Sport costs more it starts at $24,135 for the manual but comes with more standard kit than the sedan version.That's a lot of changes, so I wanted to see whether or not that boiled down to a different driving experience.It doesn't.
Microsoft Azure is growing faster than AWS and big brands are behind the expansion:::::Amazon Web Services still has the clear lead in the cloud infrastructure market.But according to Thursday's earnings reports, Microsoft's rival offering is growing more than twice as fast.One reason is that longtime users of Microsoft's ubiquitous desktop software and Windows servers are sticking with the company they've known for decades, now that its Azure cloud technology is ready for prime time.Companies like advertising giant Publicis, software developer Bentley Systems and biopharmaceutical company Parexel have all chosen Azure over AWS."With Microsoft, their pedigree is as an enterprise software company," said Arun Karur, a vice president at Publicis, in an interview with CNBC.About two years ago, Publicis executives chose to centralize public cloud use on Azure, and the company has plans to move over all of the "legacy solutions that were on AWS," Karur said.To date, Amazon hasn't been hampered by its short history in the enterprise.The company pioneered cloud infrastructure in 2006, letting developers quickly sign up to build websites, apps and run workloads by renting compute and storage capacity rather than buying their own hardware.Over the past decade, AWS has built a global sales force and bolstered its service agreements to meet the demands of large companies.
Apple patents a unique way to coat iPhones in 18-karat gold:::::Apple has an idea for making "enclosures for electronic devices" out of hardened gold, according to a patent application published on Oct. 26.Since 18-karat gold has low hardness, Apple has an idea for hardening the precious metal into a crystalline form by mixing it with other metals and putting it through a special process of mixing, rolling, heating, cooling and aging the metal.It could also be used to process 24-karat gold, the patent said, and in combinations that have more or less of the total weight in gold.According to the patent, the process could be used for "mobile phones, tablet computers, notebook computers, instrument windows, appliance screens, and the like," and could be used to make cosmetically appealing color such as "yellow gold, red gold, rose gold, pink gold, white gold, gray gold, green gold, blue gold or purple gold."Most Apple patents never go into commercial development or even see the light of the lab in Cupertino.But the patent comes as the company released the iPhone X, which is only available for preorder in silver and "space gray," not the gold or rose gold colors that were available in earlier models.Some third parties offer gold plating services, at quite high prices spot gold sells for about $1,270 per ounce.While Apple's designs and finishes are mostly kept under wraps, iPhones already contain a small amount of bullion in the internal components, according to information from the American Chemical Society and Apple's recycling statistics.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the patent.
The Amazon Echo Plus is the best Echo, and a perfect start to making your home smart:::::If you're in the market for an Amazon Echo, and think you might want to start controlling your lights and other gadgets by voice, you should buy the Amazon Echo Plus.Unlike other Amazon Echo products, the Echo Plus has technology built in that allows it to serve as the center of your smart home.It can automatically detect and control all sorts of so-called smart gadgets, like light bulbs, outlets and even the lock on your front door.It's priced at $149, which means you're paying a $50 premium over the regular Echo.That's worth it if you have any interest in starting a smart home.If not, you probably don't need an Echo Plus.Let me explain.
Cramer Remix: Mastercard is my stock pick of the week:::::Cramer Remix: Mastercard is my stock pick of the week 7:15 PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 | 00:56 After Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel strongly capped off a busy week of earnings, CNBC's Jim Cramer said the action in their stocks told an important story about this market."I think it's all business as usual, except with some incredibly large-capitalization companies as the focus," the "Mad Money" host said."Businesses that deliver amazing results get rewarded immediately with wholesale revaluations."That made Cramer wonder whether the market could see an encore, so he turned to the stocks and events he'll be watching as the last of the big-cap stocks he follows report.Cramer's pick of the week is financial services giant Mastercard, which will report its earnings before Tuesday's opening bell."I believe that CEO Ajay Banga will put up some amazing numbers and even though the stock's already up 44 percent for the year, I think ... Mastercard can still head higher," Cramer said.
At Facebook, hand-wringing over a fix for fake content:::::SAN FRANCISCO In June, Mark Zuckerberg spoke about community with a gathering of influential Facebook users in Chicago.It was an important moment for the 33-year-old chief executive of the social media company.He was promoting Facebook Groups, a product that millions of people on Facebook used to talk about shared interests, debate, discuss and maybe debate some more.This type of activity, he believed, was one of the keys to his sprawling companys future.The goal of Facebook, he told his audience, which included many Groups leaders, was to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.Inside Mr. Zuckerbergs company, however, there was already growing concern among employees that some of that content was having the opposite effect.Foremost among the offending material: Posts and memes touching on hot-button issues like race, gender and sexuality that were secretly created by Russian organizations with ties to the Kremlin to influence the 2016 presidential election.Now there is an ongoing debate among Facebook employees over how to handle this so-called organic content, or posts from users that are not advertisements and can be freely shared across Facebook, according to a dozen current and former Facebook employees.These people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were prohibited by nondisclosure agreements from talking about the company.On one side are employees who idealize Facebooks lofty goals of unfettered speech and do not think the company should be in the business of censoring what its users have to say.On the other side are workers who worry that the companys hands-off approach has already caused problems ones that will grow worse if nothing is done.The algorithms Facebook sets up that prioritize and control whats shown in its powerful newsfeed are a lot more consequential than the ads, said Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who closely follows social media and technology.The company seems stuck between exercising this massive power as it wishes, but also terrified about the conversation about its power and how to handle it.Next week, Facebooks general counsel will be among several tech industry executives expected to testify at a series of Congressional hearings about the role the technology industry played in Russian interference of last years election.Facebook has acknowledged that an organization with ties to the Kremlin purchased $100,000 worth of ads related to the election and has promised to crack down on such advertising.Since Facebook disclosed the existence of those ads and posts with Russian ties last month, the company has attempted to tamp down fears it abetted interference in the election.It has also added rules meant to improve disclosures of political advertising in an attempt to show users exactly who is behind the ads they saw run through their newsfeeds.And on Friday, the company began a test of new features designed to give users a better understanding of the people and organizations buying advertising on Facebook.That included providing users with a searchable database of ads being served to them.But misleading ads were often a small component of the misinformation campaign.Investigators believe the Internet Research Agency, a so-called troll farm that has been linked to the Kremlin, amassed enormous followings for various Facebook Pages that masqueraded as destinations for discussion about all sorts of issues, from the Black Lives Matter movement to gun ownership.Aided by Facebooks finely tuned ad-targeting tools, the Russian firm would pay to place posts in the News Feeds of users.The ad product, called a promoted post, was designed to look little different than the rest of the content flowing through the News Feed.Users who responded in a positive manner to the advertisements were prompted to subscribe to related Facebook Pages or Groups run by the Russians.If they did, it meant that nonpaid, organic posts would begin to appear in the users News Feeds.From there they spread, being shared and reshared among the users network of friends.The tactic was effective.Some of the pages, like Blacktivists, which focused on racial issues, had more than 360,000 users who liked the page even more than the main Black Lives Matter page.Facebook is not the only big internet company wrestling with the issue.But at Mr. Zuckerbergs company, the issue has been particularly troublesome, given how easy it is to spread messages to tens of millions of Facebook users.Whether something is removed from Facebook is often dictated by its terms of service, which define standards of behavior on the network.Those standards prohibit posting nudity and threats of violence.But misleading users even outright lying arent necessarily against the rules.And thats hard to police.So far, Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity and identity on the platform.Facebook removed hundreds of ads last month, not because of the content they contained, but because the Russians running the pages did not disclose their real identities.We want people to be able to come to Facebook to talk about issues of public interest, and we know that means people will sometimes disagree and the issues they discuss will sometimes be controversial, Monika Bickert, head of product policy and counterterrorism at Facebook, said in a statement.Thats O.K.But its important to us that these conversations happen in an authentic way, meaning we have to be speaking as ourselves, with our real identities.That line of reasoning may not hold up for long, as Facebook is being forced to deal with policy discussions outside the United States.In Myanmar, Facebook is caught between the government and a persecuted minority group of Muslims, the Rohingya, who face a misinformation campaign on Facebook in posts often from top government leaders.Facebook has said little publicly about the situation but there is intensifying pressure to respond.One of the solutions discussed internally at Facebook has been whitelisting, in which algorithms would decide which content makers would be allowed to publish or advertise on Facebook, according to two people familiar with the companys internal deliberations.They have also discussed blacklisting, in which the algorithms would decide which content makers could not post.But in closed-door meetings at Facebooks Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters and in Washington, Facebook employees have expressed concern that such a move could have effects on other publications and content makers that are not spreading false or divisive news.Others worry that acting too hastily could establish precedents that would lead to a situation, for example, where human rights activists using Facebook to coordinate protests in Syria would be forced to identify themselves.They also worry that any effort to quash certain content in the United States could only aid censors in other countries.As for a technical solution, some hope artificial intelligence can help Facebook sift fact from fiction.But todays A.I.technology is not advanced enough to do the work on its own.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Zuckerbergs solution is to double down on his community concept.He has said publicly that strengthening social bonds on Facebook will lead to a positive outcome, despite whatever reservations his employees and the general public may have.Every day, I say to myself, I dont have much time here on Earth, how can I make the greatest positive impact?Some nights I go to bed and Im not sure I made the right choices that day, Mr. Zuckerberg said at the June conference.I can tell you, those doubts dont go away, no matter who you are.But every day you just get up and try to make the world a little better.Follow Mike Isaac on Twitter @MikeIsaac.Nicole Perlroth contributed

Cramer: Why Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel are still buys after monster earnings reports:::::Why Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel are still buys 7:17 PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 | 00:57 CNBC's Jim Cramer was blown away by the hugely positive earnings reports from the market's top technology companies that tricked in after Thursday's bell."Who did the best job?Who stole the show?Was it Amazon?Was it Alphabet?Maybe Intel.Could be Microsoft.The answer?All of them, and all for different reasons," the "Mad Money" host said.Amazon's third-quarter earnings stole the show with accelerating revenues, a growing customer base, 42 percent sales growth in Amazon Web Services and a busy Prime Day.The e-commerce giant's stock soared 13 percent on Friday to a record high of $1,100 per share.Alphabet's earnings report shined thanks to its 70 percent growth in YouTube, which now delivers 100 million hours of content per day to its users.Shares of the internet colossus climbed over 4 percent on Friday."The company has $100 billion in cash, 60 percent of that overseas, which really makes you wish Congress would get its act together on tax reform," Cramer noted.Microsoft blew away Wall Street's earnings estimates by delivering 42 percent growth in subscription revenue from its Office 365 offering and 90 percent revenue growth from Azure, its cloud platform.As of Friday's closing bell, shares of Microsoft were up more than 6 percent.Finally, Intel stole the show with its earnings report showing an improving top line, healthy gross margins and signs of recovery in the personal computer segment.On Friday, Intel's stock soared almost 8 percent."How is it possible that all of these tech titans are doing so well?"Cramer said."Today's tech strength is all about data.More specifically, the explosion of data via the cloud.Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft are the big three of web services, the backbone of the cloud.Intel's chips for data center servers are being pulled along for the ride."As personal computers Intel's bread and butter fall back into relevance as a way to access the web, Cramer said other consumer patterns are also changing around this secular trend.Now, many consumers' jobs and lives revolve around smartphones, and the data center functions as the "central nervous system" of the world's communications, Cramer said."These firms are all integral to that setup, which is why they can make a fortune here," the "Mad Money" host said."Credit to Amazon for seeing it all coming ahead of everyone else.Credit to the other guys for playing catch-up rather than give-up."As the big four's stocks continue their journeys higher, Cramer only had one reservation about analyzing their prospects."The people who run them are all such visionaries about where things are going that I just can't keep up," he said."And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why their stocks are really flying higher, and why they're all-stars at the show.[That's] why their growth seems almost unconstrained.And that's why, even after today's moves, the stocks of Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel are still all buys."
Cramer's game plan: A divided bull market, but a bull all the same:::::After Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel strongly capped off a busy week of earnings, CNBC's Jim Cramer said the action in their stocks told an important story about this market."I think it's all business as usual, except with some incredibly large-capitalization companies as the focus," the "Mad Money" host said."Businesses that deliver amazing results get rewarded immediately with wholesale revaluations."The positive action spread beyond the stocks of the four technology giants; shares of ancillary companies like Facebook, Adobe and Apple shared in the gains.That made Cramer wonder whether the market could see an encore, so he turned to the stocks and events he'll be watching as the last of the big-cap stocks he follows report.
The big five tech giants added $181 billion in market value on Friday:::::Tech stocks are on fire, will Apple and Facebook join the party next?6:56 PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 | 04:44 Big tech is getting bigger.Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, the world's five most valuable public companies, added $181 billion to their combined market value on Friday.Investors piled into the group a day after Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings.For the stock market, it was more of the same.Those five companies have gained almost $900 billion in market capitalization over the past year.They've each outperformed the S&P 500 in 2017, and have been the top contributors to the index's 15 percent gain.Despite potential political and regulatory pressures on Google, Facebook and Amazon and loud voices of concern about the tech giants hurting competition and controlling too much of our data, the stock moves reflect financial performance.And the performance is staggering.
With Amazon on the horizon, CVS looks to strike first with Aetna deal:::::CVS Health appears to have chosen a friendlier foe in insurers than the Seattle-based giant that has been lurking in the shadows.The drugstore operator is in talks to buy health insurer Aetna for a proposed $200 per share or more, sources familiar with the matter say.In owning Aetna, CVS would become the first health-care triple threat: A pharmacy, a pharmacy benefit manager and now an insurer.The sources declined to be identified because the information is confidential.Aetna and CVS declined to comment.The Wall Street Journal first reported the deal talks.The potential deal would give CVS even more scale to bargain better prices for the prescription drugs it sells on its counters.It could fortify Aetna's insurance business by creating the ability to offer its insured cheaper copayments, presumably only in CVS stores.Its vast retail footprint could serve as a cost-effective distribution center, or locations for in-store clinics.It therefore puts insurers, like UnitedHealth Group, which owns a PBM through its Optum health-services business but not a vast store base, directly in its line of fire.(A PBM typically is a third party that negotiates prescription drug benefits for a commercial health plan.)Insurers might be an easier shot than Amazon.The e-commerce giant, which surged to a market capitalization of $530 billion on Friday, has increasingly signaled its intention to move into the business of selling prescription drugs.It has already received approval for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12 states, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported this week.It will make a decision by Thanksgiving on whether to enter the industry, CNBC has reported.With Amazon selling drugs, customers would have even less reason to go into CVS stores than they do now.Consumers can now find cosmetic and household staples at other retailers and online, sometimes for a lower price.Its pharmacy business is already larger than its so-called front-of-store business, and it is becoming increasingly so.For its fiscal 2016, same-store sales from CVS' front-of-store business were down 1.5 percent, while pharmacy sales were up 3.2 percent.The percentage of money it makes from its front store compared with its total revenue fell to 23.6 percent in 2016, from 28.8 percent in 2014.If past serves as precedent, the battle to fight Amazon can be painful for a company and its shareholders.Since Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods, grocery and food stocks have lost a total of $50 billion in market capitalization, CNBC data show.By owning an insurer, CVS creates a field more difficult for Amazon to play on.It would be challenging, though conceivable, for Amazon to buy an insurer, due to the particular regulatory constraints they operate under.It would also thus serve as a potential poison pill to fend off any Amazon approaches.To be sure, CVS also may face regulatory hurdles of its own in an Aetna bid, particularly in a politically charged environment in which the government has been looking at ever-escalating prescription drug costs.Beyond Amazon, the move would be a logical progression for CVS, which has been transforming itself into a health-care business for years.It acquired its Caremark pharmacy benefit manager platform in 2007 and in 2014, it changed its name from CVS Caremark to CVS Health.CVS and Aetna have already begun to test a relationship, having signed a contract to work together in 2010.
There are now more than 120 hedge funds focused solely on bitcoin, digital currencies:::::More than 90 funds focused on digital assets like bitcoin have launched this year, bringing the total number of such "crypto-funds" to 124, according to financial research firm Autonomous Next.Data shared exclusively with CNBC Friday showed that the largest share of the funds, 37 percent, used venture capitalist-type strategies and had about $1.1 billion in assets under management.Funds focused on trading digital assets came second at 32 percent, with about $700 million in assets under management.Funds specifically using machine learning, data science or statistical arbitrage on digital currencies came in third at 10 percent and $100 million in assets under management, the data showed.Total assets under management by crypto-funds now stands at $2.3 billion, according to Autonomous Next's estimates.Source: Autonomous Next This year's surge in the price of bitcoin and another digital currency, ethereum, have drawn attention to the cryptocurrencies and the potential of their blockchain technology.Proponents say blockchain could transform the world as much as the internet did, and several major banks are researching or developing blockchain projects.Digital currency enthusiasts also attribute much of the latest surge in bitcoin to record highs above $6,100 to increased interest from institutional investors.While several leading Wall Street banking executives remain skeptical about bitcoin, more seasoned money managers are moving into digital assets management.Notably, former Fortress hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz is launching a $500 million digital assets fund through his new firm, Galaxy Investment Partners.The fund is expected to be the largest of its kind.
The troubles at Uber show how founders hold all the cards in Silicon Valley today:::::Today, we take for granted new apps and devices connected to the internet of things appearing seemingly overnight and reaching tens of millions of users and just as quickly falling out of favor.But in the 20th century, dominated by hardware and software, technology swings inside an existing market happened slowly taking years, not months.And while new markets were created (i.e.the desktop PC market), they were relatively infrequent.This meant that disposing of the founder, and the startup culture responsible for the initial innovation, didn't hurt a company's short-term or even mid-term prospects.A company could go public on its initial wave of innovation, then coast on its current technology for years.In this business environment, hiring a new CEO who had experience growing a company around a single technical innovation was a rational decision for venture investors.However, almost like clockwork, the inevitable next cycle of technology innovation would catch these now-public startups and their boards by surprise.Because the new CEO had built a team capable of and comfortable with executing an existing business model, the company would fail or get acquired.Since the initial venture investors had cashed out by selling their stock over the first few years, they had no long-term interest in this outcome.Not every startup ended up this way.Bill Hewlett and David Packard got to learn on the job.So did Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore at Intel.But the majority of technology companies that went public circa 1979 to 2009, with professional VCs as their investors, faced this challenge.Founders in the driver's seat So how did we go from VCs discarding founders to founders now running large companies?Seven major changes occurred: 1.It became OK to go public or get acquired without profit (or even revenue) In 1995 Netscape changed the rules about going public.A little more than a year old, the company and its 24-year-old founder hired an experienced CEO, but then did something no other tech company had ever done it went public with no profit.Laugh all you want, but at the time this was unheard of for a tech company.Netscape's blow-out IPO launched the dot-com boom.Suddenly tech companies were valued on what they might someday deliver.(Today's version is Tesla now more valuable than Ford.)This means that liquidity for today's investors often doesn't require the long, patient scaling of a profitable company.While 20th century metrics were revenue and profit, today it's common for companies to get acquired for their user base.(Facebook's approximately $20 billion acquisition of WhatsApp, a 5-year-old startup that had $10 million in revenue, made no sense until you realized that Facebook was paying to acquire 300 million new users.)2.Information is everywhere In the 20th century learning the best practices of a startup CEO was limited by your coffee bandwidth.That is, you learned best practices from your board and by having coffee with other, more experienced CEOs.Today, every founder can read all there is to know about running a startup online.Incubators and accelerators like Y-Combinator have institutionalized experiential training in best practices (product-market fit, pivots, agile development, etc.); provide experienced and hands-on mentorship; and offer a growing network of founding CEOs.The result is that today's CEOs have exponentially more information than their predecessors.This is ironically part of the problem.Reading about, hearing about and learning about how to build a successful company is not the same as having done it.As we'll see, information does not mean experience, maturity or wisdom.3.Technology cycles have compressed The pace of technology change in the second decade of the 21st century is relentless.It's hard to think of a hardware, software or life science technology that dominates its space for years.That means new companies are at risk of continuous disruption before their investors can cash out.To stay in business in the 21st century, startups do four things their 20th century counterparts didn't: A company is no longer built on a single innovation.It needs to be continuously innovating and who best to do that?The founders.To continually innovate, companies need to operate at startup speed and cycle time much longer their 20th century counterparts did.This requires retaining a startup culture for years and who best to do that?The founders.Continuous innovation requires the imagination and courage to challenge the initial hypotheses of your current business model (channel, cost, customers, products, supply chain, etc.)This might mean competing with and if necessary killing your own products.(Think of the relentless cycle of iPod then iPhone innovation.)Professional CEOs who excel at growing existing businesses find this extremely hard.So who best to do it?The founders.Finally, 20th century startups fired the innovators/founders when they scaled.Today, they need these visionaries to stay with the company to keep up with the innovation cycle.And given that acquisition is a potential for many startups, corporate acquirers often look for startups that can help them continually innovate by creating new products and markets.4.Founder-friendly VCs A 20th century VC was likely to have an MBA or finance background.A few, like John Doerr at Kleiner Perkins and Don Valentine at Sequoia, had operating experience in a large tech company, but none had actually started a company.Out of the dot-com rubble at the turn of the 21st century, new VCs entered the game this time with startup experience.The watershed moment was in 2009 when the co-founder of Netscape, Marc Andreessen, formed a venture firm and started to invest in founders with the goal of teaching them how to be CEOs for the long term.Andreessen realized that the game had changed.Continuous innovation was here to stay and only founders not hired execs could play and win.Founder-friendly became a competitive advantage for his firm Andreessen Horowitz.In a seller's market, other VCs adopted this "invest in the founder" strategy.5.Unicorns created a seller's market Private companies with market capitalization over a billion dollars called unicorns were unheard of in the first decade of the 21st century.Today there are close to 200.VCs with large funds (more than approximately $200 million) need investments in unicorns to make their own business model work.While the number of traditional VC firms have shrunk since the peak of the dot-com bubble, the number of funds chasing deals have grown.Angel and seed funds have usurped the role of what used to be Series A investments.And in later stage rounds an explosion of corporate VCs and hedge funds now want in to the next unicorns.A rough calculation says that a VC firm needs to return four times its fund size to be thought of as a great firm.Therefore, a VC with a $250 million fund five times the size of an average VC fund 40 years ago would need to return $1 billion.But VCs own only approximately 15 percent of a startup when it gets sold or goes public (the numbers vary widely).Just doing the math, $1 billion divided by 15 percent means that the VC fund needs $6.6 billion of exits to make that 4x return.The cold hard math of "large funds need large exits" is why VCs have been trapped into literally begging to get into unicorn deals.6.Founders take money off the table In the 20th century the only way the founder made any money, other than their salary, was when the company went public or got sold.The founders along with all the other employees would vest their stock over four years, earning one-forty-eighth a month.They had to hang around at least a year to get the first quarter of their stock (this was called the "cliff").Today, these are no longer hard and fast rules.Some founders have three-year vesting.Some have no cliff.And some have specific deals about what happens if they're fired, demoted or the company is sold.In the last decade, as the time startups have spent staying private has grown longer, secondary markets where people can buy and sell pre-IPO stock have emerged.This often is a way for founders and early employees to turn some of their stock into cash before an IPO or sale of company.One last but very important change that guarantees founders can cash out early is "founder-friendly stock."This allows founder(s) to sell part of their stock (approximately 10 to 33 percent) in a future round of financing.This means the company doesn't get money from new investors, but instead it goes to the founder.The rationale is that since companies are taking longer to achieve liquidity, giving the founders some returns early makes them more willing to stick around and better able to make bets for the long-term health of the company.7.Founders take control of the board With more VCs chasing a small pool of great deals, and all VCs professing to be the founder's best friend, there's an arms race to be the friendliest.Almost overnight the position of venture capitalist dictating the terms of the deal has disappeared at least for "hot" deals.Traditionally, in exchange for giving the company money, investors would receive preferred stock, and founders and employees owned common stock.Preferred stock had specific provisions that gave investors control over when to sell the company or take it public, hiring and firing the founder etc.VCs are giving up these rights to get to invest in unicorns.Founders are taking control of the board by making the common stock the founders own more powerful.Some startups create two classes of common stock with each share of the founders' class of common stock having 10 to 20 votes.Founders can now outvote the preferred stock holders the investors.Another method for founder control has the board seats held by the common shareholders the founders count two to five times more than the investors' preferred shares.Finally, investors are giving up protective voting control provisions such as when and if to raise more money, the right to invest in subsequent rounds, who to raise it from and how and when to sell the company or take it public.This means liquidity for the investors is now beholden to the whims of the founders.And because they control votes on the board, the founders can't be removed.This is a remarkable turnabout.In some cases, 21st century VCs have been relegated to passive investors or board observers.And this advent of founders' control of their company's board is a key reason why many of these large technology companies look like they're out of control.They are.The gift and curse of visionary CEOs Startups run by visionaries break rules, flout the law and upend the status quo (Apple, Uber, Airbnb, Tesla, Theranos, etc.).Doing something that other people consider insanity/impossible requires equal parts narcissism and a messianic view of technological transformation.Bad CEO behavior and successful startups have always overlapped.Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison and Tom Seibel all had the gift and curse of a visionary CEO they could see the future as clearly as others could see the present.Because they saw it with such clarity, the reality of having to depend on other people to build something revolutionary was frustrating.And woe to the employee who got in their way of delivering the future.Visionary CEOs have always been the face of their company, but today with social media, it happens faster with a much larger audience; boards now must consider what would happen to the valuation of the company without the founder.With founders now in control of unicorn boards, with money in their pockets and the press heralding them as geniuses transforming the world, founder hubris and bad behavior should be no surprise.Before social media connected billions of people, bad behavior stayed behind closed doors.In today's connected social world, instant messages and shared videos have broken down the doors.The revenge of the founders founding CEOs acting badly So why do boards of unicorns like Uber, Zenefits, Tanium, or Lending Club let their CEOs stay?Before the rapid rise of Unicorns, when boards were still in control, they "encouraged" the hiring of "adult supervision" of the founders.Three years after Google started they hired Eric Schmidt as CEO.Schmidt had been the CEO of Novell and previously CTO of Sun Microsystems.Four years after Facebook started they hired Sheryl Sandberg as the COO.Sandberg had been the vice president of global online sales and operations.Today unicorn boards have a lot less leverage.VCs sit on five to 10 or more boards.That means most VCs have very little insight into the day-to-day operation of a startup.Bad behavior often goes unnoticed until it does damage.The traditional checks and balances provided by a startup board have been abrogated in exchange for access to a hot deal.As VC incentives are aligned to own as much of a successful company as possible, getting into a conflict with a founder who can now prevent VC's from investing in the next round is not in the VCs interest.Financial and legal control of startups has given way to polite moral suasion as founders now control unicorns.As long as the CEO's behavior affects their employees not their customers or valuation, VCs often turn a blind eye.Not only is there no financial incentive for the board to control unicorn CEO behavior, often there is a downside in trying to do so The surprise should not be how many unicorn CEOs act badly, but how many still behave well.This post was originally published on Blank's blog on Oct. 24.Steve Blank is an

Want to make your company's stock soar? Here's the quick, easy thing you can do:::::Hong Kong and Singapore to work together on blockchain project 9:01 AM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 | 00:47 Proponents often draw comparisons to the 1990s, when technologies developed in that decade paved the way for Facebook, now a $515 billion market-cap company.There appears to be another similarity to the 1990s market before the tech bubble burst: speculation in micro-cap stocks that have added "blockchain" to their names, similar to the surge in "dot-com" penny stocks.Shares of London-traded On-Line leaped a whopping 173.5 percent Friday after the company said it plans to change its name to "On-Line Blockchain" at its next general meeting.On-Line has a market capitalization of just 3.6 million ($4.7 million) and an archaic website.On-Line's home page Source: CNBC screenshot An announcement on the website Friday about the share price move said, "the Company's development of a Block-chain product is still at an early stage of investigation and development."Testing of the first application is not expected until early 2018, the statement said.On-Line is just the latest stock to attract traders with the word "blockchain."Shares of a Colorado-based biotechnology company leaped nearly 125 percent around its Oct. 4 announcement that it would change its name from Bioptix to Riot Blockchain.The stock, which changed its Nasdaq ticker from BIOP to RIOT, has a market cap of about $37 million.The company used to focus on blood testing and animal health care.While Riot says on its website that it maintains its Bioptix business, the company now "intends to gain exposure to the blockchain ecosystem through targeted investments in the sector, with a primary focus on the bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains."Shares of Overstock.com have also swung wildly amid news of how the company's majority-owned subsidiary tZero is developing a blockchain-based trading platform.Overstock's primary business is selling furniture and clothing online, but in 2014 the company launched a division called Medici Ventures focused on blockchain.The stock has nearly doubled in the last four weeks, helping its market cap just crack $1 billion.In comparison, the leader in e-commerce, Amazon.com, has a market value of $480 billion.Overstock also has a license for an alternative trading system through an acquisition and this week announced plans for the largest initial coin offering ever at $500 million.An initial coin offering is a way of raising funds by selling digital coins.Authorities definitely have the high-flying "blockchain" stocks on their radar.In August, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission temporarily suspended trading in three stocks due to questions about the companies' claims regarding investments in initial coin offerings or other token-related news.As of Friday, the three companies had market capitalizations ranging from $52,000 to $302 million.The SEC also published an investor bulletin in July warning investors about the risks of participating in initial coin offerings.
Apple investors don't need to worry about a long wait for the iPhone X, analyst says:::::iPhone X pre-orders sell out in minutes.Now what?5:13 PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 | 02:29 Apple fans may be miffed about the supply chain delays hitting the much-anticipated new iPhone X, but Apple investors don't have much to worry about, according to a Wall Street analyst."It's certainly better than the alternative," meaning lower demand, Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at KeyBanc, told CNBC's Power Lunch on Friday.Pre-orders for Apple's flagship new mobile device began overnight, and the company said demand was "off the charts."For many people who pre-order the phones, however, that heavy interest means the $1,000 phone won't ship until at least December.One analyst said Apple had at most 3 million devices on hand, despite selling as many as 13 million iPhones in the opening weekend of the iPhone 6S.That shouldn't be a problem for Apple shares, however.Hargreaves said that if revenue misses because of supply, "that's something that investors would largely look through."Apple customers will be able to pick up the 10th anniversary Apple phone in stores starting Nov. 3."We're working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible," Apple told CNBC.Apple shares rose more than 3.5 percent late Friday afternoon, at $162.99.The stock is up more than 40 percent so far this year.
Top VC deals: Lyft and Alphabet, self-driving taxis, and robots that work with people:::::MongoDB, the database services provider, made its Nasdaq debut, pricing its IPO at $24 per share, above the expected range.The company was backed early on by Union Square Ventures, Sequoia Capital and New Enterprise Associates.Assa Abloy agreed to acquire smart-lock makers August Home for an undisclosed price.The hardware start-up had raised $75 million in venture funding from Bessemer Ventures, Maveron and SoftTech VC, and the venture arms of Comcast and Qualcomm, among others.Maveron's David Wu told CNBC, "[August Home co-founder Jason Johnson] has been predicting in-home delivery for years."Disclosure: Comcast Ventures, the venture arm of CNBC parent Comcast, invested in August Home.WeWork acquired education start-up Flatiron for an undisclosed price.The deal came after Flatiron, a for-profit programming trade school, faced fines and regulatory scrutiny for operating without a license and misleading advertising, EdSurge reported.Facebook acquired a mobile start-up called tbh for an undisclosed price.The tbh app lets users send anonymous polls and surveys to their network and was popular with teens.
Amazon just added a FedEx. Stock up nearly $62 billion in a single day:::::Amazon's stock is up nearly $62 billion in a single day 4:34 PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 | 00:46 Amazon shareholders are having a good day.The e-commerce juggernaut added more market value in one day than that of more than 400 individual companies in the S&P 500.Amazon shares surged more than 13 percent to an all-time high Friday, a day after it reported better-than-expected earnings.The gain represented $61.7 billion of additional value for Amazon shareholders, who now own a company with about $529 billion total market value, according to FactSet.The single-day increase is around the market value of FedEx and more than approximately 420 companies in the S&P 500, according to FactSet.Amazon is also now the fourth-most-valuable company in the benchmark index.FedEx's current market value is about $61.8 billion.Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world, with $90 billion in wealth after Friday's stock move.The technology company is one of the best-performing large-cap stocks in the market.Its shares rallied 47 percent year to date through Friday versus the S&P 500's 15 percent gain.
Tesla nears bear market territory, and it could get a lot worse:::::Tech stocks are soaring, but there's one name that's noticeably absent from the recent rally: Tesla.Shares in the electric-car maker fell 2 percent on Friday after reports that production of the Model 3 would be delayed.Tesla's stock has been on a precipitous decline since hitting a high last month, falling 17 percent, near bear market territory."This is very much a momentum stock ... when you have these kind of momentum stocks, any sort of production delays, or any sort of push-outs they have with any of these new models, these stocks are going to react very quickly," Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Jaffray, said Thursday on CNBC's "Trading Nation."From a technical standpoint, "if you look at the chart, you can see that we've just recently broken what I would define as a bit of an ascending triangle.The stock has broken this, and it looks like to us the next kind of big area of support comes in around $290.So you have another 11 percent downside before you really find that support," he said.Johnson added that he would wait until shares fell to the $290 range before buying the stock.In midday trading Friday, Tesla shares were down 1.3 percent to $320.85.In the past, sharp declines in Tesla have proven to be tremendous buying opportunities.The last time Tesla was in a bear market the stock fell 32 percent over the course of seven months, from April 2016 to November 2016, but then in the period following from November 2016 to September 2017, Tesla shares rallied 122 percent.According to Dennis Davitt, portfolio manager at Harvest Volatility Management, "the options market is telling a story that Tesla is two different companies ... as a car manufacturer, it's overvalued.As an infrastructure play, it can go considerably higher.The momentum can carry it higher."One of the main things that is affecting Tesla is what "most people don't realize.It's a highly rate-sensitive stock.A lot of growth is built on Tesla borrowing money, and if the cost of borrowing money continues to increase, then it's going to have real negative effects on the stock," Davitt said on "Trading Nation."He said that using put options to hedge losses would be the best way to protect against a bigger drop.Options are "very inexpensive, and I mean that's the play in Tesla," specifically Davitt pointed to the January 325-puts.Tesla is set to report earnings next week and the options market is implying a 6 percent move in either direction."Whether you buy it or sell it, if it goes higher or lower, spend a little bit of money.Protect your downside and then you can continue to the upside," Davitt said.Tesla is scheduled to report earnings after the market close on Wednesday, and analysts polled by FactSet are expecting a loss of $2.27 per share on $2.9 billion on revenue.
Facebook political ads will have more public information: Zuckerberg:::::Facebook is trying to make it easier to identify political ads in your News Feed.The social giant announced on Friday it will soon require advertisers especially political candidates to disclose more information about their advertising efforts on the platform as the company seeks to temper concerns from the U.S. Congress about Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.Facebook's new policies include labeling political ads so they're easier to identify, and creating a catalogue of these and other ads so users can see how much advertisers are paying and who they are targeting.But many of the changes intended to create more transparency don't appear to address the most problematic ads purchased last year by Kremlin-backed, online trolls.These ads, referred to as "issue ads," sought to stir social and political unrest in the United States around issues like Black Lives Matter, not necessarily to promote candidates like Donald Trump.Still, the announcements Friday come as Facebook prepares for what could be a brutal grilling before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.The panels are investigating Russia's suspected interference in the 2016 presidential election, and they'll also hear from senior executives at Google and Twitter during back-to-back hearings on Nov. 1.Under the new policy, Facebook is making two new, key demands of its broad universe of advertisers.First, political campaigns and advocacy groups that seek to run election-time ads about a federal candidate must indicate to the company and users alike that they're doing so.Those ads, when presented to Facebook users, will have a new feature in which viewers can swipe up to learn more about the political candidate.Meanwhile, Facebook will set up a new hub for all advertisers political or otherwise where users can see all current ad campaigns running on the site.For these ads, marketers will also have to share basic demographic targeting information.Facebook plans to begin testing these new disclosure policies in Canada before rolling them out in the United States in time for the 2018 midterm elections.Initially, they'll only show active ads, the company said in a blog post Friday.But once the new system rolls out in the U.S., Facebook will begin building a searchable, four-year archive of political ads run on its site.More from Recode: Facebook, Google and Twitter might face yet another grilling by U.S. lawmakers angry about their algorithms What will Facebook, Twitter and Google do about Russia?Bill Gates is the richest man in the world.This is how he gives away his billions.Facebook isn't the only company promising greater transparency around political ads.Twitter, for example, has revealed its own changes designed to make political ads more transparent, similar to Facebook's new policies.Google might soon do the same.And all of these pledges seem designed with one goal in mind: Staving off federal regulation.Lawmakers like Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, are pushing potential new laws that would require large tech and advertising platforms to make much more information available about the political ads they run.But Facebook and its peers haven't exactly endorsed the plan, called the Honest Ads Act.Instead, they've sought to prove they can regulate themselves.For its part, Facebook disagreed with the assessment that its announcements Friday are meant to ward off the U.S. Congress."We are trying to urgently fix the problem," said Rob Goldman, the company's vice president of product for ads and pages, in an interview before the announcement.He stressed that the company "feel[s] strongly about what happened."Previously, though, Facebook lobbied against more extensive political ad disclosure rules.And the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, also initially rejected the influence of Russian trolls on his own platform before ultimately admitting that dismissal was a bad idea.Facebook then promised to hire 1,000 new workers to monitor ads.Still, the new details announced Friday might not satisfy Facebook's federal overseers.For one thing, the changes don't apply to those so-called "issue ads" think political endeavors around immigration, gun control or gay rights that don't actually involve a federal candidate by name.It's precisely those sort of ads that Russian trolls purchased around the 2016 election.At times, suspicious Kremlin-tied profiles and pages even took both sides of controversial issues in the hopes of creating social and political tensions on the platform.But they would only trigger Facebook's new transparency guidelines if they mentioned a candidate by name.The new bill by Warner and crew, in contrast, seems to cover these issue-based ads.And Facebook's revised system is largely the stuff of self regulation: The burden is on political candidates and campaigns, as well as their allies, to disclose their efforts to Facebook.For now, the company hopes that's enough and believes its users, on top of its previous pledges to invest more in people and technology to monitor ads, can spot anyone failing to self-identify as a political advertiser.Nevertheless, the announcements by Facebook on Friday still amount to a new, major change for the company, as it endeavors to demystify why its users see the ads they do.Even with limited information about ad targeting centralized in one place data including age and gender viewers and watchdog groups alike can keep closer watch over the platform.And Facebook's Goldman suggested to Recode there could be more to come.Asked about the absence of issue ads in its new policy, he said: "Over time we may roll out features like this in other places or other ways."By Tony Romm and Kurt Wagner, Recode.net.CNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.
Survey says tech talent wants to work at SpaceX, Google and Shopify:::::Where are dreams fulfilled for tech talent?Companies including SpaceX, Google, Tesla, Netflix, Slack and Facebook rank highly, according to a survey conducted by job website, Hired.For the survey, released Thursday, 2,349 software engineers, product managers, designers, and data scientists were interviewed between Aug. 8 and Aug. 24.Respondents were asked how they would feel about working at the tech companies in their geographical region that have been recently been hiring.Hired counted the percentage of respondents in each area who responded they "would love to work for this company" or "would like to work for this company."In tech's mecca, the San Francisco bay area, 84 percent of surveyed tech talent would "love" or "like to work for" Google.And 73 percent said the same about Facebook.And there were other high scores.In Los Angeles, where SpaceX is headquartered, 85 percent of survey respondents said they would love or like to work for Elon Musk's space company.In Toronto, 83 percent of tech talent would love or like to work for the e-commerce platform Shopify.The chart below shows the top 10 companies with the highest brand positivity score, as determined by the percentage of local tech workers who would love or like to work at the company.
Super Mario Odyssey could make Nintendo's Switch even harder to find this holiday:::::At any point in any console cycle, the launch of a new Super Mario game is a big deal.But "Super Mario Odyssey," which hits store shelves today, is a bonafide event.The game is garnering some of the best reviews of any game this year.And consumer interest in those reviews is so strong that the servers for Metacritic, which acts as a clearinghouse for reviews, were unable to keep up with site traffic on Thursday.That demand is expected to translate into big sales for the game and sales of the game will almost certainly further drive demand for the already red-hot Nintendo Switch.Nintendo expects to sell 10 million Switches this fiscal year and 35 million software units.(It could potentially bump either or both numbers up when it announces its earnings on Oct. 30 before the market open.)While it's easier now to find a Switch in a store than it was a few months ago, the rush of the holiday season threatens to drain store inventories again.Michael Pachter of Wedbush says he expects the attach rate for "Super Mario Odyssey" to be close to 1:1 meaning essentially everyone who buys or already owns a Switch will buy the game.And other analysts say the lure of a new Mario game could push people who have been fence sitting to purchase a Switch."You have a high-demand product with the Switch and you're introducing incredible content all within a holiday sales window," said Mike Hickey of The Benchmark Co. "It's a recipe for ongoing success.Mario alone is some of the best IP in the world and when you produce one of the best reviewed Marios of all time for a platform that's already in demand?They're going to kill it."While "Super Mario Odyssey" will certainly be a hit, it's going to have a lot of competition this holiday season.Ubisoft's "Assassin's Creed: Origins" and Bethesda Softworks' "Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus" both release the same day as Nintendo's flagship holiday game.And next week, Activision's "Call of Duty: WWII" will release.Other big games competing for consumer dollars this holiday include Electronic Arts' "Star Wars Battlefront II" and the previously released "Destiny II" (which, in one month, outsold every other game this year in September) and "Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle," a real time strategy game from Ubisoft.The good news for Nintendo and all publishers in the video game spaces is that consumers are buying more software this year.In September, gamers spent $726 million on games, a 52 percent increase from the same period last year, according to The NPD Group.Year to date, consumer spending is up 7 percent compared to year ago at $3.7 billion with the year's three biggest months to come.Sales of video game hardware (including Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One), meanwhile, were up 34 percent to $316 million.Overall this year, hardware spending has grown 20 percent versus 2016 to $2.1 billion.That's in large part because of Switch, though year to date, Sony's PlayStation 4 remains the top selling hardware system.
This chart shows how Ruth Porat is exercising discipline at Alphabet — and investors love it:::::Google Fiber was one of the company's most ambitious projects.Under the original vision, the company was going to run fiber-optic cable directly to consumers' homes, giving them super-fast internet.Google announced it would roll the service out in Kansas City, Kansas, in 2011, and followed by eight other cities.Then, Alphabet happened.Specifically, Google hired new CFO Ruth Porat in 2015, and that August it reorganized into a holding company called Alphabet, consisting of the core Google businesses which provide nearly all of its revenue and all of its profit and a set of longer-term investment areas called "Other Bets."Fiber was placed into that Other Bets category.A year later, in August 2016, the company took a closer look at the Fiber business and saw it wasn't meeting subscriber expectations.So it decided to concentrate on less-expensive wireless last-mile solutions, according to a report in The Information.A couple months later, in October, Google Fiber CEO Craig Barratt stepped down, the company "paused" all uncompleted but previously promised rollouts, and laid off some Fiber employees.While Alphabet never disclosed exactly how much it was spending on rolling out Fiber, the company does break out capital expenditures within its Other Bets category.Capex there started climbing rapidly in the second half of 2016, peaking at $504 million in Q4.Then, it dropped dramatically.In Alphabet's most recent quarter, which it reported Thursday, it spent only $77 million on capital expenditures in the Other Bets category.Here is a chart showing the spike, which we first saw from analyst Jan Dawson via Twitter.
CNBC put Visa's new Face ID authentication technology to the test:::::IPhone X sales started early Friday morning, and one of the most anticipated new features is Face ID which could be huge for mobile banking.Visa's been developing this technology for banks to better secure transactions and account information.It's said to be far more secure than passwords, because biometrics like face, voice and fingerprint are unique to each person.We got to test it out, and found it's quite secure after trying to, unsuccessfully, hack it.Here's how it works: You register a photo with your phone such as a driver's license or passport and then when you go to unlock, the phone decides if its you based on how similar you look to the photo ID.This allows consumers use their eyes, face, fingerprint and voice to make payments, access accounts and other transactions.Visa will earn revenue from a per use fee on transactions, and says the that the iPhone X will help bring this technology into the mainstream.
Amazon might be more interested in medical devices than pharmaceuticals, one analyst says:::::The news roiled pharmaceutical stocks, while Amazon shares are at all-time highs.According to Tanquilut, Amazon's business-to-business medical device web page was posted during the same period the company was granted wholesale distribution licenses in several states.The licensure was first reported by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.An Amazon spokesperson previously told CNBC by email that the company doesn't "comment on rumors or speculation."While many have speculated these licenses could be used for drugs, Tanquilut said the timing could indicate Amazon is more interested in medical devices."[T]he out-of-state wholesaler license that AMZN filed with the state of Nevada revealed that AMZN did not select 'Controlled Substances' as a type of product that they would be handling," Tanquilut wrote in a Friday research note."While we acknowledge that there are prescription drugs that don't fall under the definition of 'controlled substances', the active decision to choose not to distribute those types of drugs leads us to believe that AMZN will not be using these licenses to distribute any prescription drugs[.]"On the other hand, Wells Fargo analyst David Maris pointed out that AmazonRX.com redirects to the Amazon home page."We find it easy to envision that, if it entered pharmacy, Amazon could offer unique value to some customers, such as the easier ability to manage prescriptions and perhaps discounts, such as free generics to Prime users," Maris wrote.Overall, we think that even though Amazon has not stated a goal to be in pharmacy, history has shown it is better to consider Amazon's disruptive potential beforehand rather than afterward."CNBC's Christina Farr, Dan Mangan, Evelyn Cheng and Thomas Franck contributed to this report.
How Amazon founder Jeff Bezos went from the son of a teen mom to the world's richest person:::::Jeff Bezos was born on January 12, 1964, as Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen.His biological dad, Ted Jorgensen, met and started dating his mother, Jacklyn Gise, when they were both in high school.Jorgensen was 18 and Gise was 16 when she became pregnant.They flew to Mexico with their parents' money to get married.Jorgensen belonged to a unicycle troupe and worked at a retail store making $1.25 an hour, so he didn't have much money.He was also "had a habit of drinking too much," according to "The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon," by journalist and biographer Brad Stone.When Jeff Bezos was 17 months old, his mom divorced Jorgensen.In 1968, Gise remarried Miguel Bezos, who arrived in Miami in 1962 from Cuba knowing only one word of English: "hamburger."Jorgensen agreed to let Bezos adopt his son and, at 4 years old, Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen became Jeffrey Preston Bezos.Biographer Stone suggests that Bezos' childhood may have contributed to his obsession with success."It is of course unknowable whether the unusual circumstances of his birth helped to create that fecund entrepreneurial mix of intelligence, ambition, and a relentless need to prove himself.Two other technology icons, Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison, were adopted, and the experience is thought by some to have given each a powerful motivation to succeed," Stone writes.
The surprising approach LinkedIn is using to woo top talent:::::On average, the company hires about three people at a typical networking event, says Toche.At the first event, six people were hired to fill open roles.One of those hires was Cayman Lowe, who now works for LinkedIn as a relationship manager.At the time, he was living and working as an account manager for a children's education startup in New York City.Lowe tells CNBC Make It that a college friend, who was working at LinkedIn's San Francisco office, called him and invited him to an open mic on the West Coast."I wasn't looking for a job but I wanted to see what my friend did at LinkedIn," says Lowe.He booked his tickets and arrived in San Francisco two weeks later.The relationship manager says that he was a bit nervous walking into the event but was immediately put at ease."There was such a level of energy.The interaction was relaxed and communal.It was very informal and laid back," says Lowe."It felt like an event that was very authentic and didn't feel like a forced culture."Lowe adds that the people who were performing "really resonated with me and didn't feel premeditated."His decision to join the company was bolstered, he says, when he went out for drinks after the event with a few LinkedIn employees."They acted the exact same outside of the work event," he says."I was able to talk with people about open jobs and hear stories about their career trajectory.I felt like it was a good fit."Lowe, who had just gotten married in September, says he started interviewing for open positions about a week after the open mic.The most difficult part, however, was getting his wife on board because she had a "pretty sweet job" in New York City, he says."She was freaked out but was very motivating and supportive.We were both a little nervous," Lowe admits."But this felt like an intelligent risk and a great opportunity to take that risk."Lowe says he was hired a few months later.Since then, the company has had four open mics in different cities.The headcount has doubled, averaging 200 - 250 attendees, says Toche.The first two events were for sales professionals, he says, but they recently started doing events for engineering professionals as well.So far, they have hired six engineers from the open mic, says Toche.This is particularly notable because blacksand Latinos comprise a small percentage of this field in Silicon Valley.
Tech shares are this bull market’s most important stocks right now:::::Technology is the most important industry for stocks today, indicating that blowout earnings from giants such as Microsoft could be good for the market.Shares of Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel soared nearly 6 percent or more in Friday trading after reporting solid quarterly earnings that came in well above Wall Street's expectations.The stocks are among the largest in the S&P 500 by market capitalization.In fact, the technology sector overall has the largest weighting in the index at 23.2 percent, according to a Sept. 29 fact sheet.The high weighting and strong performance heading into earnings season have tied the S&P 500's performance closely to that of technology stocks, especially over the last three months.During that time period, tech had the highest correlation to the S&P at 0.87, according to Kensho, a quantitative analytics tool used by hedge funds.The closer a correlation is to 1, the more in sync two parts of the market are.The closer a correlation to zero, the more independent two parts of the market are.Telecommunications had the lowest correlation with the S&P over the last three months at 0.3."Frankly, it makes sense the correlation has risen here recently" between tech stocks and the S&P, said David Lebovitz, vice president and a global market strategist on the JPMorgan Asset Management Global Market Insights Strategy Team."What you're seeing here as breadth has narrowed over the last couple of weeks, investors have [bought stocks of companies] growing both revenue and earnings as people get a little skittish."The eight-year-old bull market is the second-longest in history, and many investors worry that a sharp drop in stocks is due soon.A bull market is a period without a drop of 20 percent or more in stocks from a recent high.Lebovitz also pointed out that in a sluggish growth environment, stocks such as technology tend to perform better.The International Monetary Fund's latest global growth outlook this month forecasts a modest rise of 3.6 percent this year.The relationship between tech stocks and the S&P has not always been this close.Over the last six months, tech has tied with consumer discretionary for the highest correlation with the S&P at 0.82, according to Kensho.Over the last two years, tech falls to third place behind industrials and consumer discretionary, the analysis showed.However, consumer discretionary is almost a play on tech as well since e-commerce giant Amazon.com is the largest stock in the sector.Shares of the company leaped 11 percent to all-time highs Friday after reporting a quarterly earnings beat and strong sales growth in its cloud business, Amazon Web Services.Big tech earnings aren't over yet.Apple, which has the largest market capitalization in the S&P at $821 billion, is scheduled to report quarterly results on Nov. 2.Facebook, the fourth-largest S&P stock by market capitalization, is set to post results a day before.Going back further into history, the S&P 500 is almost always up when tech stocks are up.Since the current bull market began in March 2009, whenever the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) has gained more than 2 percent in a month, the S&P 500 has risen 96 percent of the time with an average return of 3.2 percent, according to Kensho.On the other hand, the S&P has almost no chance of gains without tech stocks rising.When the tech ETF falls more than 2 percent in a month, the S&P falls 92 percent of the time with an average decline of nearly 3 percent, according to Kensho.The study looked at 37 such instances since the beginning of this bull market going back to 2009.The S&P 500 traded Friday nearly half a percent higher within a quarter of a percent of its all-time high.The tech ETF rose more than 2 percent to a record high as technology stocks led S&P gains, while five sectors traded lower.To be sure, some analysts worry that technology stocks are rising too quickly as investors chase performance.It's not a healthy sign for the market if only technology-related stocks are rising.In 2015, only Amazon and Netflix doubled, while Alphabet and Facebook were up double digits.But the S&P 500 was barely changed on the year."As tech becomes a larger and larger component of the S&P 500, its contribution to risk is larger as well," Lebovitz said.CNBC's John Melloy contributed to this report.Disclosure: CNBC's parent NBCUniversal has a minority stake in Kensho.
Expedia shares nosedive — but new CEO blames passing factors:::::Expedia CEO Mark Okerstrom told CNBC that the company's stock decline on Friday is a "concern" but he is still "incredibly optimistic" about the future of the business.Shares of the travel company fell Friday, one day after it reported quarterly earnings that failed to meet Wall Street's expectations.The stock was down about 18 percent intraday, trading around $120 per share.The stock is down more than 5 percent over the last 12 months, according to FactSet.Expedia's bookings were light for the quarter, and it faced challenges from extreme weather.Okerstrom said he believes investors are reacting to short-term issues, including recent hurricanes and struggles with hotel price comparison site Trivago.Expedia has a majority stake in that company."But when you put those aside, what we believe and what we see ... we see an incredible opportunity ahead of us," Okerstrom told "Squawk on the Street" on Friday.He said the company has been making investments in HomeAway as well as its core business."We've seen our ability to add new properties go from 30,000 about three years ago.This year, we'll add about 85,000.Next year, we're really going to ramp that up," he added.The stock decline is a "concern," Okerstrom said, "but I'm not running a stock, I'm running a company.""When we look at the company ... we look at the strength that we are seeing right now in operations.We look at the size of the opportunity ahead of us.We look at the track record that we've displayed," Okerstrom said."We're incredibly optimistic for the future."
Walmart is using shelf-scanning robots to audit its stores:::::Robots are already a common sight in warehouses (Amazon alone use more than 45,000) but now they're moving into stores too.Walmart has announced it's deploying shelf-scanning bots in 50 locations around the US, using the machines to check things like inventory, prices, and misplaced items.The retailing giant says the robots' introduction won't lead to job losses, and that the company wants to save employees from carrying out tasks that are "repeatable, predictable, and manual."The robots themselves are produced by California-based Bossa Nova Robotics, and are about two-feet tall with an extendable tower containing lights and sensors for scanning shelves.They sit in recharging stations in the store until a human employee gives them a "mission" e.g.checking a particular aisle to see what needs re-stocking.The robots are supposed to save workers' time, but Walmart says it will also use the data they collect to improve efficiency nationwide."If you think about trying to go through a facility with all these different [items] and figure out if your prices are accurate, it can be very time-consuming," John Crecelius, Walmart's vice president of central operations, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette."From our perspective, when you're doing things like this you're trying to improve your service to your customers and trying to make things simpler and easier for your associates at the same time."More from The Verge: iPhone X screen repair will cost $279 Amazon is the ruthless corporate juggernaut people love A third of America wouldn't care if Twitter disappeared
What Worries? Big Tech Companies Post Glowing Quarterly Profits:::::I do not see, to be honest, anything between Amazon and a trillion-dollar market valuation except D.C. and Brussels, and at this point it looks more likely that its Brussels, Mr. Galloway said, referring to the headquarters of the European Union.Amazon showed on Thursday how it continues to play by rules that cause fits of despair among conventional retailers.For a company its size and age, it reports meager profits, choosing to plow the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.Amazon said its net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $256 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $252 million, also 52 cents a share, during the same period last year.But Amazon also gave investors the numbers they love to see, a 34 percent jump to $43.7 billion in revenue, as it continued to nibble away at the pocketbooks of customers.The companys cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, jumped 30 percent to $4.58 billion in revenue, which Wall Street loves because it accounts for most of what little profit the company reports.Amazons recent acquisition of Whole Foods Markets has sparked concerns from rivals that the company could become a terrifying new force in the huge category of grocery retailing.During the quarter, Amazon said, Whole Foods added $1.3 billion to its overall revenue.The most remarkable sign of Amazons growth may be its rise in head count, most of which occurs in its warehouses.At the end of September, Amazon had 541,900 employees, up 77 percent from a year earlier.The average earnings estimate compiled from analysts by Thomson Reuters was 3 cents a share, and the average revenue estimate was $42.14 billion.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Next week, Googles top lawyer, along with general counsels from Facebook and Twitter, will testify in front of lawmakers investigating how Russia used social media and technology platforms in the United States to influence the 2016 election.But as Alphabet reported another blockbuster earnings result on the back of strong sales of search advertising, the inquiry and any potential fallout were not discussed.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.On a conference call with financial analysts, Ruth Porat, Alphabets chief financial officer, and Sundar Pichai, Googles chief executive officer, were not asked about Googles pending appearance before Congress.Unlike Amazon, Alphabet gushed profits.Alphabet reported net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share surpassing Wall Streets earnings forecasts by more than a dollar.The company is bringing in more revenue up 24 percent while squeezing more profit from every dollar it brings in.In July, when Alphabet previously reported quarterly results, investors shrugged off a $2.7 billion fine from the European Commission, the European Unions administrative arm.The fine temporarily hit the companys bottom line but did little to slow revenue growth or demand for its advertising.Alphabet accounts for about 32 percent of all global digital advertising spending, according to research firm eMarketer.When it is combined with Facebook, the pair account for roughly half of all internet ad spending in the world.With earnings showing no signs of slowing, Alphabet continues to amass a cash war chest.The companys stockpile of cash and marketable securities topped $100 billion or roughly the market value of Goldman Sachs.Microsoft is mentioned less frequently as a potential target for regulators, in part because it already went through an agonizing antitrust saga in the 1990s and 2000s, one that hobbled it when big shifts in technology were looming.But in the past several years, Microsofts chief executive, Satya Nadella, has revived the company, in part by redoubling its focus on cloud computing, where it has emerged as a credible No.2 competitor to Amazon.Advertisement Continue reading the main story While Microsoft is not the fearsome leviathan it once was, it is still a moneymaking machine.On Thursday, the Redmond, Wash., company reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 85 cents a share, up from $5.67 billion, or 73 cents a share, the previous year.Revenue was up 12 percent to $24.54 billion.The average earnings estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters was 72 cents a share, with revenue of $23.56 billion.Its shares jumped 3 percent.Microsoft executives credited much of the companys success in the quarter to growth in its cloud computing business, which encompasses everything from online storage to internet-based versions of Microsofts Office applications that customers subscribe to rather than purchase.The company said its commercial cloud business had brought in $5 billion in revenue, up 56 percent from the previous year.While Microsofts attempts at selling some kinds of devices have been a disappointment its foray into making smartphones was a bomb its Surface line of computers showed positive results, rising 12 percent to $1.04 billion in revenue.
Russia Fanned Flames With Twitter, Which Faces a Blowback:::::Perhaps no form of communication has ever established itself so quickly and so thoroughly as social media.Hundreds of millions of people around the world have grown to rely on it for news and information.Now Twitter and Facebook are facing a moment of reckoning.They, as well as Google, are being called to account for their role in the deception and chicanery that has surrounded the 2016 campaign, especially from accounts linked to Russia.How much damage did those accounts do in the months leading up to the presidential election?No one knows, not even the companies themselves, which are slowly and grudgingly releasing data about what happened.Next week, they will send executives to testify at congressional hearings, the beginning of an attempt to calculate an answer.Google and Facebook are powerful and wealthy companies that are skilled enough to ride out this controversy.But for Twitter influential, yet smaller and far less financially successful the situation is more vexing.Its devotion to open discourse is drawing an abundance of troublemakers who threaten to drive out the well-intentioned.Many of Twitters users have long been frustrated with the sites scattershot efforts at preventing abuse and harassment.Twitters critics have counted at least a half-dozen times over the last few years when the company has said it was taking an issue seriously but little seemed to change.The debate about abuse and harassment has even fed complaints about Twitters most prominent fan, President Trump, and his use of the site as a cudgel against everyone from Kim Jong-un of North Korea to Jemele Hill of ESPN.Twitters guidelines forbid threats of violence and targeted abuse prohibitions that some users have tried to hold up against the rhetoric coming from Mr. Trumps account.In recent weeks, Twitter has updated its terms of service to better fit the companys evolving views on hosting the president.That includes allowing tweets under the newsworthy label it might otherwise ban.But the platform was forced to apologize for the confusion it generated in trying to explain the changes, tweeting We need to do better.Twitter declined to comment this week on President Trump.Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder, was dismissive of concerns over the presidents Twitter habits in an interview shortly before rejoining the company in the spring.Its too early to say were all going to die because Trump has a smartphone and can say what he wants to a lot of people, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There are already signs that Twitters bottom line is feeling the effects.An analysis by the research firm eMarketer this week anticipated the number of worldwide Twitter users growing ever more slowly in the years to come: 4 percent this year, 3 percent in 2018, 2.5 percent in 2019.Since other parts of social media most notably Facebook are growing faster, fewer than one out of 10 social media users will be on Twitter by 2019, eMarketer suggested.Hate speech and harassment are real impediments to attracting new users, said Michael Pachter, managing director of the investment firm Wedbush Securities.If you think about why are people alcoholics, its because they dont acknowledge theyre alcoholics.He added about Twitter, It has never managed to come to grips with harassment.Twitter said Thursday that it added four million users in the third quarter of this year.But it also said that it had overstated its user base by two million in the previous quarter, meaning the total user base rose by only two million, to 326 million, in the third quarter.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Its revenue dropped in the quarter from 2016, the company said, but not quite as much as expected.Its net loss narrowed, however, and the company suggested that a profitable quarter may come soon, pushing the stock up more than 20 percent in midday trading.Twitters acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, will represent the company in at least one congressional hearing next week.When the company originally briefed congressional investigators a month ago, the reviews were bad.Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence committee, called it inadequate at every level.He added that Twitter had failed to understand how serious this issue is.On Tuesday, Twitter said it would dramatically increase ad transparency on the platform while also allowing people to report inappropriate ads or ads they simply do not like.Political ads will be specially marked.Mr. Warner called Twitters plan a good first step.On Thursday, Twitter banned all advertising by two Russian news outlets, Russia Today and Sputnik, saying they attempted to interfere with the election on behalf of the Russian government.But the real problem facing Twitter is less with ads than with trolls, who take advantage of the anonymity the platform provides to wreak havoc.The still-incomplete history of @TEN_GOP bears out how reluctant or unable Twitter is to police such activity.@TEN_GOP sprang to life in November 2015 bearing the seal of the state.It billed itself as the Unofficial Twitter of Tennessee Republicans but from the beginning, state Republican leaders knew something was fishy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We thought the handle, @TEN_GOP, was particularly weird, said Mr. Leatherwood.Thats not how you abbreviate Tennessee.Also, Tennessee law prohibits using the seal for political purposes.The real problem, though, was the vitriol it spewed.It was using anti-immigrant and outright racist sentiments, Mr. Leatherwood said.It offended me as a conservative and a Christian, and went counter to what we were trying to do here.Since the account did not represent the Republican Party, even unofficially, Mr. Leatherwood twice reported it to Twitter for misrepresentation.He said others had as well.He never heard back.After the election, the account ridiculed the idea that Russia had tried to affect the voting, celebrated President Trumps firing of F.B.I.director James Comey by suggesting that Mrs. Clinton be arrested, and tweeted, I love my whiteness.And yours.@TEN_GOP was a hot topic in Tennessee political circles.I cant tell you how many conversations I had with editors, colleagues, political types about who was behind this crazy troll account, said Cari Wade Gervin, a reporter with Nashville Scene who said she had also told Twitter that @TEN_GOP was misrepresenting itself.But it never occurred to me it was the Russians.Twitter is, as ever, a work in progress.After it was harshly criticized this month for temporarily banning the actress Rose McGowan when she was speaking out about sexual harassment, chief executive Jack Dorsey pledged, We need to be a lot more transparent in our actions in order to build trust.When asked about troll sites like @TEN_GOP, however, a Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment.Instead, she pointed to a few recent company blog posts for background.One of them presented the companys long-held philosophy: We, as a company, should not be the arbiter of truth.
Twitter Bans Two Kremlin-Backed News Outlets From Advertising:::::Twitter, along with Facebook and Google, is now at the center of congressional investigations into the Russian intervention in the 2016 election.Kremlin-linked operatives deployed paid human trolls and hordes of fake accounts on Twitter and Facebook to push news and conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and criticism of the United States government.But RT and Sputnik, both of them funded by the Kremlin, worked openly, using platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to amplify content critical of Mrs. Clinton, sometimes paying for advertisement to boost their stories more aggressively.Now the Silicon Valley companies long used to practically unchallenged clout in Washington face rising calls for tighter regulation from both conservatives and liberals and growing scrutiny of their sheer market dominance.Twitters general counsel will testify publicly before the Senate Intelligence Committee next week, alongside executives from Facebook and Google.Last month, Facebook said it would adopt new rules to bring greater transparency to advertising on its platform.Earlier this week, Twitter said it would add new labels to political ads on the service, identifying the ads sponsors.But representatives of Facebook and Google declined to say whether they would follow Twitters lead in banning RT and Sputnik advertising.Both companies have recently disclosed that Russian agents purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of advertising on their platforms during the campaign.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Lawmakers who have been pressuring Twitter to address Russian entities use of the platform to influence American politics praised the companys decision on Thursday but cautioned that it would not be enough.I appreciate the effort, although RT and Sputnik have been known entities for some time, said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has emerged as one of Twitters most vocal critics on Capitol Hill.What I hope is well see enhanced efforts on discovering other fake accounts as well as avatars that might not be as obvious.Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and John McCain of Arizona, who introduced bipartisan legislation earlier this month that would force Facebook, Google and other technology companies to disclose who is purchasing online political advertising, said the action only underscored the need for a new, across-the-board standard for social media companies to follow when it comes to political advertising.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Twitters announcement today is a positive step, but one company preventing two outlets RT and Sputnik from placing ads on its platform is not a substitute for government regulation, Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement.Twitter, with 328 million monthly active users, is far smaller than Facebook, and has struggled more to find growth and financial stability.In September, the companys vice president for policy, Colin Crowell, met with staff from House and Senate intelligence committees and shared copies of advertisements run on Twitter by RTs three principal Twitter accounts.In a public statement, Twitter said that RT had purchased about $274,100 in advertising aimed at United States markets in 2016, promoting close to 2,000 Tweets.On Wednesday, Twitter provided additional information, disclosing that Twitter had earned a total of $1.9 million in advertising revenue from RT since 2011.The company said it would now donate the money to research into the civic impact of Twitter, as well as its abuse by purveyors of fake news and propaganda.Despite the sharp response from RT and Russian authorities, it is unclear how much impact Twitters decision will have on the growing threat of fake news and disinformation across its platform.Much of the Russian-sponsored activity surrounding the United States election did not involve advertising by official Russian outlets, but covert intervention: undercover human trolls on social media, Facebook pages impersonating American activists, and networks of automated Twitter accounts designed to amplify real and made-up news.I think its only a drop in the bucket, said Nina Jankowicz, an expert on Russian disinformation at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.Whats far more dangerous and expansive than RT and Sputniks ad buys is the content and messaging promoted by the Russian bot network active on Twitter, which doesnt need to buy a single ad to garner impressions and interactions sometimes numbering in the thousands.Moreover, Twitters decision to limit RT and Sputnik could raise questions about how Twitter and rival social media companies treat other state-run or state-subsidized news organizations operating on their platforms.Across the world, governments have made aggressive use of Twitter and Facebook to drive their own messaging and propaganda.China, for example, while banning Facebook within its own country, has flooded the platform with advertising and paid propaganda and used it to promote its state broadcaster, CCTV.A Twitter spokeswoman said the companys decision on RT and Sputnik was informed by specific findings of the United States intelligence community, made public in January, and would not affect other government-sponsored outlets.This is not about being a state-sponsored news organization, the spokeswoman said in a statement.Its about the behavior of RT and Sputnik during the 2016 election.
Reddit Bans Nazi Groups and Others in Crackdown on Violent Content:::::Even mild violence can be difficult for someone to explain to others if they open it unexpectedly, the statement said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But it added sometimes there were reasons to post violent content such as with educational, newsworthy, artistic and satirical items in which case context should be provided to show it was not gratuitous.On Thursday, as news of the policy surged through the site, moderators began to question how it would be applied in Reddits micro-communities, or subreddits, where interests can range from hunting to Bible study, as well as in its dark corners, where people are urged to kill themselves or others.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.What does glorify mean?one wrote.Will subs like watchpeopledie be categorized as such?(That forum would remain for now, a moderator said.)Among the first to be banned were the subreddits r/NationalSocialism, r/Nazi and r/Far_Right.In a statement on Thursday, Anna Soellner, a spokeswoman for Reddit, said the company was constantly assessing its content policy.We strive to be a welcoming, open platform for all by trusting our users to maintain an environment that cultivates genuine conversation, she said.Reddit, which was founded in 2005 and proclaims itself the front page of the internet with 330 million monthly active users, had been resistant to outright bans on content.In 2014, Yishan Wong, who was then the companys chief executive, wrote a blog post defending the companys hands-off approach to the sometimes toxic content that appeared on the site.You choose what to post, he wrote to the sites users.You choose what to read.You choose what kind of subreddit to create and what kind of rules you will enforce.We will try not to interfere.A year later, under a new chief executive, Ellen Pao, the company announced that it would explicitly prohibit harassment against users.It said then that the move would promote free expression of its millions of users without fear of retribution from a vocal minority of them.The crackdown comes as Reddit expands after receiving millions of dollars in financing in 2014 and again in 2017.It grew from 65 employees in 2015 to 260 employees this year, making it easier to execute new policies to enforce bans on toxic content.The effectiveness of Reddits 2015 policy was analyzed in a study released last month of two subreddits that were banned the racist r/CoonTown subreddit and r/fatpeoplehate, which mocked and abused overweight people.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The study suggested that the most effective tactic to fight hateful rhetoric might be to identify and shut down the spaces where hateful speech occurs, rather than targeting bad actors individually or in groups.
Virtual Reality Gets Naughty:::::You can pretend like you are in the bedroom with me, and it is someone you have a crush on, she said.You are in the experience.Photo While virtual-reality pornography may feel like something out of a science fiction movie, it already has a formidable, if underground, presence.According to website Pornhub, views of VR porn are up 275 percent since it debuted in the summer of 2016.Now the site is averaging about 500,000 views (on Christmas Day in 2016, this number shot up to 900,000.)By 2025 pornography will be the third-largest VR sector, according to estimates prepared by Piper Jaffray, an investment and management firm.Only video games and N.F.L.-related content will be larger, it predicted, and the market will be worth $1 billion.Were getting more and more of it every day, said Mark Kernes, a senior editor at AVN Media Network, which covers the industry.We are leading the technology in this area.Sex sells, and where there is money to be made, there will be entrepreneurs who want to adopt it and make money from it, some by offering it for free to increase clicks.Pornography is what rushed along the first printing press, and spurred developments in the internet, online payment systems and other technology.Now its time for virtual reality, Mr. Kernes said: Im pretty sure there is more porn VR out there than regular VR.Headsets Are Just the Beginning Ms.Darling first experienced regular old VR at E3, a conference for the video-game industry.Excited by the pornography possibilities, she found a college student on Reddit who knew the technology but lacked a star.Before long, Ms.Darling started streaming weekly VR segments live from her bedroom in Los Angeles.Photo She was one of the first VR webcam women, according to Mr. Kernes.She then started a company named VRTube.xxx, which now employs over 40 performers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Though the pornography industry as a whole is challenging to regulate, considering the potential for abuse, disease and exploitation, the virtual kind comes with extra moral and maybe legal issues.For example, can you use someones likeness to have sex with them in virtual reality?Virtual reality is like the Wild Wild West, said Bryony Cole, the host of Future of Sex, a podcast that explores technology and sexuality.At this years AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, a convention and trade show held each January in Las Vegas, the latest advancements in virtual reality pornography were on display.CamSoda, a website that specializes in live sex videos, had an exhibit featuring pornography stars dressed in plunging bathing suits and waving visitors into the booth.They were showing off OhRama, a small canister that attaches to virtual reality headsets and releases scent during the action.Believe it or not, the scents were created by the girls, said Mr. Kernes, who was there.Its sweet and musty.They know what they like.Photo There are also companies that are adding taste and touch to the experience.Another big player is CamasutraVR, a start-up using 142 cameras that all look at one person, or one body part.They are creating images from that, which they are hoping will be indistinguishable from an actual person, Mr. Kernes said.Im sure those people wished they had been using that VR system at home.Still other virtual reality companies were showing off their partnerships with sex toy companies to create vibrators or penis pumps that link to VR material.As the action ramps up so does the vibrations of the vibrator, he said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.One of the most buzzed-about inventions has been the sex robot.The first one, Harmony, was introduced in May by a company named Realbotix.In seductive videos posted on YouTube, Harmony shows off her long legs, her firm breasts, her full lips, her lifelike hand gestures, even her intellect.How do you feel about sex?an unknown presenter asks her in one video.Sex is one of the most fascinating things in the world, she responds in a raspy voice.I dont see anything wrong with it.Harmony can connect with virtual reality so the user can interact with her in that space; she can perform all the acts the viewer is watching.Its a little bit of a video game combined with sci-fi, said Matt McMullen, the C.E.O.and creative director of Realbotix.The company has been making dolls for 20 years that were linked to artificial intelligence but not virtual reality.Based on our experiences with thousands of clients, Mr. McMullen said, people do use them for sex, but there is something more that exists.We focus on companionship.Photo Virtual reality has been nicknamed the empathy machine because it allows people to feel like they are truly connected to the action.Its neurological, said Holly Richmond, a somatic psychologist based in Los Angeles and Portland, Ore. You arent just watching and thinking about it.You are feeling it, and its not just your genitals.There is literally a mind-body connection.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When Ms.Darling does live X-rated performances, users can leave comments and chat to one another on the side of the screen.The people who are in virtual reality tell the other people watching me in 2-D to stop being jerks and knock it off, she said.They feel like they know me and are in the bedroom with me.Many sex therapists and educators are interested in the new technology, just as a dentist might be with the latest plaque-detection gizmos.Ms. Richmond worked with BaDoinkVR, a virtual-reality company in Rochester, N.Y., to create Virtual Sexology, a series of free videos that help men and women overcome common sex problems.A recent video, updated in June, takes women into the bedroom where they see how one blond, busty woman arouses herself before sex.She sits in front of her partner massaging her arms, her legs, her breasts.As her breathing heats up, a voice-over says that some women need to be physically touched before feeling any desire for sex.The first video, aimed at men, was the most downloaded video on BaDointVR.com in 2016 an impressive feat considering it was competing with noneducational pornography.Ms. Cole, the podcast host, is most excited about how virtual reality can be used in sex education.What if we had young people watch videos where they practice consent or practice identifying at-risk behaviors?she said.Or they can be in a room with someone who said, I contacted herpes and this is my experience.That is way more informative than a gonorrhea slide.Photo Indeed.Barbara Rothbaum, a professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine and the director of Emorys Veterans Program, is studying how virtual reality can help treat people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder caused by military sexual trauma.The program is building scenes that take victims to barracks, tents, private living quarters, latrines, offices or remote buildings and vehicles, where the trauma may have taken place.The idea is that going back to these places virtually will help victims confront their memories so they can move forward with more internal peace.But for virtual reality to work, the scenes have to be so lifelike that users get lost in them and take them for reality.They have to feel like they are participants, not just observers.We can create 3-D bodies in virtual reality and do whatever we want with them, Ms. Cole said.As the technology becomes good enough to make that happen, issues are bound to arise.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. McCullen said an issue his company has is clients commissioning dolls that look exactly like people they know in real life, maybe an ex-girlfriend they never got over or someone about whom they fantasize.His company requires written consent from the model for his or her likeness to be used.Ms. Cole said VR companies are going to have to address this same problem as they get better at customizing avatars to look exactly like what their customers desire.What are the lines between reality and fantasy and what can we do in this space?she said.What does consent mean in virtual reality?Can you do something to your girlfriend in virtual reality that you wouldnt do in real life?If you are using someones likeness in virtual reality, do you require their permission?And what about revenge porn?That will be even harsher in virtual reality.She is worried about the technology assimilating into the culture as easily as dating apps, drawing people away from flesh-and-blood encounters.Certainly partners will also have to negotiate whether virtual-reality sex constitutes cheating.It is, after all, much more lifelike than traditional pornography.But Mr. McCullen said a lot of people accuse his sex robot of doing that, but he believes he is helping alleviate a bad situation, not causing it.There are people who are already lonely, and people who live their lives being alone.They work all day and come home to an empty house, he said.This is just offering an alternative to those types of people.They dont have anyone else.
Amazon Key Is a Lot Less Scary Than My Post-1-Click Remorse:::::So, too, may more information about our choices, according to a 2008 study, The Blissful Ignorance Effect: Pre versus PostAction Effects on Outcome Expectancies Arising From Precise and Vague Information, published in The Journal of Consumer Research.Researchers found that the less knowledge consumers had about something before a purchase, the better they expected it to be and the more they convinced themselves that they liked it afterward.This reduction of cognitive dissonance is easier inside and after leaving a store, which never reveals anything negative about its products and doesnt typically burden the consumer with an onslaught of information that might impede an impulse purchase.But the sprawling internet bazaar is filled with scathing critiques, and every pertinent spec exists somewhere online for the diligent buyer to seek out.That one-star rating is hard to forget when your product is failing in the exact way the unhappy reviewer described.The most obvious difference between brick-and-mortar and online shopping is physicality, both of the item itself and the consumers presence in the store.Beyond the potential pitfall of not getting exactly what you thought you were buying online, a problem that is minimized when you can assess the product in person, the lack of tactile interaction may reduce our connection to the object.Martin Lindstrom, the author of several books on branding, has conducted studies on what makes consumers buy a product and how they feel about it after.In one, 34 percent of people who asked an employee for a product in a supermarket and were made to touch it ended up buying it; just 21 percent did if the employee merely pointed it out to them.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of 20 subjects, when the senses of smell and touch were paired with pictures of a product, the right medial orbitofrontal cortex, a region of the brain involved in the perception of pleasantness, was activated more strongly than when those senses were independently engaged.(On its own, smell was the most important sense.)The tactile experience doesnt end in the checkout line.After purchasing an item, the consumer typically takes it home.This act of carrying it into ones domestic space can bolster ones proprietary pride: You are now responsible for its existence in your world.That act, plus roaming through aisles beforehand and going from shop to shop, can also be physically and mentally tiring.But ordering online for an anonymous deliveryman to leave the item at ones doorstep or, with the help of Amazon Key, just inside is impersonal and not enervating.Its the difference between the estrangement of ordering takeout and the intimacy of cooking for oneself.And a pavement-pounding, shop-till-you-drop marathon may recall an even more primal method for acquiring nutrients.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Youre coming back to hunters and gatherers, Mr. Lindstrom said of in-store purchases.Dopamine kicks in when were buying stuff theres a reptile brain that tells us we need to gather things before winter happens.The more we have to fight for things, the less likely we are to return it after.When its delivered on Amazon Prime, you forget it was so hard to get this product.The tactility of how one finalizes the transaction itself can have an effect on remorse, too.Mr. Lindstrom found that 93 percent of consumers feel a stronger connection to cash than to credit cards and are more careful when spending with it.Likewise, for the least tactile connection he studied, Amazons 1-Click Ordering, 70 percent of respondents said it made them spend more money than even with a credit card.But whereas cash-based transactions lead to more immediate remorse, 89 percent of shoppers said they feel guiltier when they receive their credit card statements after 1-Click orders than when they pay in cash.The remorse still exists with online shopping; its just deferred, with extra pain later.Shopping on a website featuring attractive models or beautiful homes may engender the same sense of inadequacy that leafing through catalogs can, unlike picking them up in person, and that visual memory may linger when the object has been delivered, leading to remorse.Buying something online can also lead quickly to a social-media search after the fact for friends and strangers superior products (or better use of the same product).The sneakers I bought in this troublesomely bottomless marketplace were for casual wear, but I also needed a new pair of running shoes, a purchase that I undertook with more serious online research: reading reviews from specialized publications and individual users, comparing models from different years, taking quizzes to determine what was best for my particular stride.But even the highest-rated sneakers had their detractors, and those damning, all-caps review headlines (SHODDILY MADE, THEY RUINED IT) made me hesitate whenever I was on the verge of adding them to my virtual shopping cart.A week after searching in vain and the ensuing deluge of targeted ads, I visited a nearby running store.I tried on a few pairs and solicited opinions from one employee, then picked the sneakers that felt best.Within 20 minutes I was walking out with them, glad to have given my money to a local business over a soulless national chain.There is undoubtedly a better running shoe out there for me, and I could probably find it if I spent enough time scouring the internet.But je ne regrette rien.
Hearing Amazon’s Footsteps, the Health Care Industry Shudders:::::An Amazon spokeswoman, Lori Torgerson, refused to comment on rumors or speculation about Amazon entering the pharmacy business, but she shared a statement that suggested other motivations for the paperwork.Wholesale licenses are required for Amazon Business to sell professional-use only medical devices in certain states, she said.There is little doubt, though, that Amazon is interested in at least some aspects of the pharmacy business.Brittain Ladd, a supply chain consultant who worked at Amazon until earlier this year on groceries and other initiatives, said he participated in discussions about how Amazon could enter the category, including through acquisitions.The pharmacy business was always a topic of interest when I was with Amazon, and there was a sincere desire on the part of Amazon to create a better customer experience across pharmacy and health care as a whole, he said.While Mr. Ladd said he isnt privy to the companys current strategy, he believes existing pharmacy companies are right to be worried.My advice is that executives at pharmaceutical companies should crush all assumptions when it comes to Amazon and their ability to enter, innovate and reimagine the pharmacy business and health care, he said.If Amazon decides to enter the market, it could take a variety of avenues, analysts said.The easiest way in would be to set up a mail-order pharmacy that focused on price-sensitive customers without health insurance or who have high-deductible plans that require them to pay for some drug costs upfront.To do this, Amazon would need retail pharmacy licenses in every state a hurdle, certainly, but not an insurmountable one, the analysts said.They can at least dip their toe in the water with the cash-pay customers, and learn the business, said Ana Gupte, an analyst for Leerink Partners.She said cash-paying customers account for 5 percent to 10 percent of the $560 billion prescription drug business.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The idea could prove attractive to customers who already go to Amazon for a wide range of shopping items, from shoes to electronics to diapers.Retailers like Target and Walmart have added pharmacies to bring in extra business for a similar reason.Amazons recent acquisition of Whole Foods could also provide a physical location for pharmacies.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.A large part of the infrastructure is already there, said David Maris, an analyst for Wells Fargo.In a call with analysts this week, Timothy C. Wentworth, the chief executive of the pharmacy-benefit manager Express Scripts, indicated a willingness to work with Amazon to reach these cash-paying customers.We certainly see that as something where if they wanted to move into a space, we could be a very natural collaborator, he said.If Amazon wanted to go bigger, Ms. Gupte and others said, it could sell to insured customers and even serve as a pharmacy-benefit manager, overseeing drug coverage for people on behalf of insurers and large employers.This would be far more complex.It would likely require Amazon to either acquire a pharmacy-benefit manager or enter into a partnership with an existing one.Expanding the pharmacy business without the aid of a major pharmacy-benefit manager would be tough, because the benefit managers serve as gatekeepers to insured patients, deciding which pharmacies they can and cannot use.The benefit managers also operate their own mail-order pharmacies, which might make them less willing to accommodate Amazon.Some said they expect that if Amazon chooses to enter the health care business, it would do so in a big way.The company could attempt to provide comprehensive services to patients, doctors and others, far beyond selling drugs.Nadina J. Rosier, the health and group benefits pharmacy practice leader at Willis Towers Watson, said other areas the company could explore include offering virtual doctor consults, or using the Amazon Echo, its voice-controlled smart device, for health care applications.No matter the short-term steps Amazon is taking, Ms. Rosier said, her research has demonstrated that it is clearly looking to revolutionize how health care is delivered in some way.But while Amazon has a track record for upending major industries, from books to groceries, she said health care is complicated and there would be intense pressure to get it right.It is just a sensitive topic, she said.We dont have as much scrutiny of how much you paid for your jeans, or your shoes.
At Facebook, Hand-Wringing Over a Fix for Fake Content:::::On one side are employees who idealize Facebooks lofty goals of unfettered speech and do not think the company should be in the business of censoring what its users have to say.On the other side are workers who worry that the companys hands-off approach has already caused problems ones that will grow worse if nothing is done.The algorithms Facebook sets up that prioritize and control whats shown in its powerful newsfeed are a lot more consequential than the ads, said Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who closely follows social media and technology.The company seems stuck between exercising this massive power as it wishes, but also terrified about the conversation about its power and how to handle it.Next week, Facebooks general counsel will be among several tech industry executives expected to testify at a series of Congressional hearings about the role the technology industry played in Russian interference of last years election.Facebook has acknowledged that an organization with ties to the Kremlin purchased $100,000 worth of ads related to the election and has promised to crack down on such advertising.Since Facebook disclosed the existence of those ads and posts with Russian ties last month, the company has attempted to tamp down fears it abetted interference in the election.It has also added rules meant to improve disclosures of political advertising in an attempt to show users exactly who is behind the ads they saw run through their newsfeeds.And on Friday, the company began a test of new features designed to give users a better understanding of the people and organizations buying advertising on Facebook.That included providing users with a searchable database of ads being served to them.But misleading ads were often a small component of the misinformation campaign.Investigators believe the Internet Research Agency, a so-called troll farm that has been linked to the Kremlin, amassed enormous followings for various Facebook Pages that masqueraded as destinations for discussion about all sorts of issues, from the Black Lives Matter movement to gun ownership.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Aided by Facebooks finely tuned ad-targeting tools, the Russian firm would pay to place posts in the News Feeds of users.The ad product, called a promoted post, was designed to look little different than the rest of the content flowing through the News Feed.Users who responded in a positive manner to the advertisements were prompted to subscribe to related Facebook Pages or Groups run by the Russians.If they did, it meant that nonpaid, organic posts would begin to appear in the users News Feeds.From there they spread, being shared and reshared among the users network of friends.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The tactic was effective.Some of the pages, like Blacktivists, which focused on racial issues, had more than 360,000 users who liked the page even more than the main Black Lives Matter page.Facebook is not the only big internet company wrestling with the issue.But at Mr. Zuckerbergs company, the issue has been particularly troublesome, given how easy it is to spread messages to tens of millions of Facebook users.Whether something is removed from Facebook is often dictated by its terms of service, which define standards of behavior on the network.Those standards prohibit posting nudity and threats of violence.But misleading users even outright lying arent necessarily against the rules.And thats hard to police.So far, Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity and identity on the platform.Facebook removed hundreds of ads last month, not because of the content they contained, but because the Russians running the pages did not disclose their real identities.We want people to be able to come to Facebook to talk about issues of public interest, and we know that means people will sometimes disagree and the issues they discuss will sometimes be controversial, Monika Bickert, head of product policy and counterterrorism at Facebook, said in a statement.Thats O.K.But its important to us that these conversations happen in an authentic way, meaning we have to be speaking as ourselves, with our real identities.That line of reasoning may not hold up for long, as Facebook is being forced to deal with policy discussions outside the United States.In Myanmar, Facebook is caught between the government and a persecuted minority group of Muslims, the Rohingya, who face a misinformation campaign on Facebook in posts often from top government leaders.Facebook has said little publicly about the situation but there is intensifying pressure to respond.One of the solutions discussed internally at Facebook has been whitelisting, in which algorithms would decide which content makers would be allowed to publish or advertise on Facebook, according to two people familiar with the companys internal deliberations.They have also discussed blacklisting, in which the algorithms would decide which content makers could not post.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But in closed-door meetings at Facebooks Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters and in Washington, Facebook employees have expressed concern that such a move could have effects on other publications and content makers that are not spreading false or divisive news.Others worry that acting too hastily could establish precedents that would lead to a situation, for example, where human rights activists using Facebook to coordinate protests in Syria would be forced to identify themselves.They also worry that any effort to quash certain content in the United States could only aid censors in other countries.As for a technical solution, some hope artificial intelligence can help Facebook sift fact from fiction.But todays A.I.technology is not advanced enough to do the work on its own.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Zuckerbergs solution is to double down on his community concept.He has said publicly that strengthening social bonds on Facebook will lead to a positive outcome, despite whatever reservations his employees and the general public may have.Every day, I say to myself, I dont have much time here on Earth, how can I make the greatest positive impact?Some nights I go to bed and Im not sure I made the right choices that day, Mr. Zuckerberg said at the June conference.I can tell you, those doubts dont go away, no matter who you are.But every day you just get up and try to make the world a little better.
A War of Words Puts Facebook at the Center of Myanmar’s Rohingya Crisis:::::In Myanmar, Facebook is so dominant that to many people it is the internet itself.And the stakes of what appears on the site are exceptionally high because misinformation, as well as explicitly hostile language, is widening longstanding ethnic divides and stoking the violence against the Rohingya ethnic group.Photo For example, since the government crackdown against the Rohingya began, Zaw Htay, a spokesman for the countrys de facto leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has shared dozens of posts on his Facebook page and Twitter account that include images said to show Rohingya burning their own homes.Many of these images have been debunked, yet they still stand.First-person accounts from Rakhine State establish a coordinated crackdown against the Rohingya minority by the military and by ultranationalist groups, driving more than 600,000 refugees across the border into Bangladesh.Facebook does not police the billions of posts and status updates that flow through the site worldwide each day, relying instead on an oftentimes confusing set of community standards and reports by users of direct threats that are then manually assessed and, in some cases, removed.After the 2016 United States elections, Facebook rolled out a set of guidelines to help users identify fake news and misinformation.The company does not regularly remove misinformation itself.Facebook has no office in Myanmar, but the company has worked with local partners to introduce a Burmese-language illustrated copy of its platform standards and will continue to refine its practices, said a spokeswoman, Clare Wareing, in an emailed statement.Human rights groups say the companys approach has allowed opinion, facts and misinformation to mingle on Facebook, clouding perceptions of truth and propaganda in a country where mobile technology has been widely adopted only in the past three years.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Under the rule of the military junta, strict censorship regulations deliberately made SIM cards for cellphones unaffordable to control the free flow of information.In 2014, restrictions loosened and the use of mobile technology exploded as SIM cards became affordable.Facebook users ballooned from about two million in 2014 to more than 30 million today.But most users do not know how to navigate the wider internet.Photo Facebook has become sort of the de facto internet for Myanmar, said Jes Kaliebe Petersen, chief executive of Phandeeyar, Myanmars leading technology hub that helped Facebook create its Burmese-language community standards page.When people buy their first smartphone, it just comes preinstalled.Mr. Petersen said local media and news outlets should help combat misinformation in a technology sector still in its infancy.There are still some challenges here, and there are of course very big differences between big cities and rural communities, he said.I think its really important that people focus on educating this new generation of digital users.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In the meantime, Facebook has become a breeding ground for hate speech and virulent posts about the Rohingya.And because of Facebooks design, posts that are shared and liked more frequently get more prominent placement in feeds, favoring highly partisan content in timelines.Ashin Wirathu, the monk, has hundreds of thousands of followers on Facebook accounts in Burmese and English.His posts include graphic photos and videos of decaying bodies that Ashin Wirathu says are Buddhist victims of Rohingya attacks, or posts denouncing the minority ethnic group or updates that identify them falsely as Bengali foreigners.Facebook has removed some of his posts and restricted his page for stretches, but it is currently active.In an interview, Ashin Wirathu said that if Facebook did remove his account, he would simply create a new one.He added that if anyone did not like his Facebook posts, they can sue me.Posts from verified government and military Facebook accounts also carry misinformation.Some, for example, refuse to acknowledge the Rohingya as an ethnic group deserving of citizenship rights, despite the fact many have lived in Rakhine State for generations.Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the commander in chief of Myanmars armed forces who has carried out the crackdown on the Rohingya, has more than 1.3 million users on his verified account.A post from Sept. 15 describes the operation as a response to an attempt of extremist Bengalis in Rakhine State to build a stronghold, after an Aug. 25 attack on remote border posts by a Rohingya militant group.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Rohingya activists also use Facebook, documenting human rights abuses, often with graphic images and videos as evidence.Sometimes the company has taken these down.Ms. Wareing, the Facebook spokeswoman, said the company removed graphic content when it is shared to celebrate the violence.She said the company would allow graphic content if it was newsworthy, significant or important to the public interest, even if it might otherwise go against the platforms standards.Richard Weir, an Asia analyst with Human Rights Watch, said the situation was complicated.Its a really delicate balance here between things that are violent and posted by people who would seek to inflame tensions and those that are trying to disseminate information, Mr. Weir said.Its difficult to know where exactly to draw the line.Some of the social media conversation is happening privately.For instance, chain messages on Facebook Messenger before Sept. 11 this year falsely warned of a planned Rohingya attack against Buddhists.Written like a chain letter, the message called for people to share it, and many people were put on edge as it spread.I was nervous about it, said U Tin Win, a teacher from Mandalay, the countrys second-largest city, who received the letter.I dont know who started the message, but I ordered my family not to go outside that day.Mr. Weir said that people in Myanmar relied on social media for their news.The government can sort of trot out its own views and spread them very rapidly, in addition to a bunch of other nonstate entities, he said.Views about people in Rakhine State, about the origins of population and about things that may or may not have happened fly around Facebook extremely quickly and can create unstable situations.
Britain Says North Korea Was Behind Cyberattack on Health Service:::::They encrypted the information on them and then demanded payment of $300 or more in Bitcoin to unlock the devices.In Britain, the attack resulted in the abrupt cancellation of patients operations and delays in medical appointments at dozens of hospitals that struggled to retrieve essential medical information and patient histories.Britains National Audit Office said on Friday that at least 6,900 appointments had been canceled during the attack, which affected more than one-third of Englands 236 N.H.S.trusts.Up to 19,000 appointments may have been affected, it said.Hospital authorities have said that no patient data was compromised or stolen during the attack.But it had particular resonance in Britain where the N.H.S., though chronically underfunded, is a vaunted part of the nations identity.Mr. Wallace warned that it was difficult to respond to a cyberattack committed by a hostile state.North Korea, which has ambitions to develop a nuclear weapon and has been repeatedly testing missiles despite international sanctions, has also proved adept at sowing havoc through cyberattacks.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.North Korea has been potentially linked to other attacks about raising foreign currency, he said, in an apparent reference to an attack last year in which North Korean hackers tried to steal $1 billion from the New York Federal Reserve, and almost succeeded before being stopped by a spelling error.The North has an army of 6,000 hackers, and experts in Britain and the United States say their ability to wage effective cyberattacks has improved.In 2014, the country unleashed a cyberattack against Sony Pictures aimed at blocking the release of a satirical film deemed disrespectful of its leader, Kim Jong-un.Mr. Wallace said it was imperative for Britain to reinforce its efforts to defend against future attacks.Its a salient lesson for us all that all of us, from individuals to governments to large organizations, have a role to play in maintaining the security of our networks, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The National Audit Office said on Friday that the WannaCry attack had been relatively unsophisticated and could have been prevented had the N.H.S.followed rudimentary procedures to protect its systems.It said that N.H.S.management had recklessly ignored security recommendations.Amyas Morse, the head of the National Audit Office, on Friday criticized the preparedness of the N.H.S.The WannaCry cyberattack had potentially serious implications for the N.H.S.and its ability to provide care to patients, he said in a statement.He added that the N.H.S.needed to get its act together.In the immediate aftermath, Amber Rudd, the British home secretary, acknowledged that, despite several warnings of a possible attack, the N.H.S.had been ill prepared to defend itself and was vulnerable because its computers had outmoded software.While the ransom demanded in the attack in Britain was modest, the National Audit Office said evidence indicated that no N.H.S.organization had paid, which experts say could have encouraged further attacks.
How to Stop Waking Up the iPhone:::::Q. I just got a new iPhone and have noticed that every time I pick it up or move it, the screen pops on by itself instead of me turning it on with the switch.Is this a problem with the phone?A.The iPhone 6s and later models include a feature called Raise to Wake that senses when you pick up the device and then automatically flips on the display screen so you do not have to fumble around with the Home or power buttons when you want to check something.If you have just purchased a new iPhone or had not upgraded your hardware in a few years, the sudden activity can seem a little unsettling.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.When you lift the phone and the display wakes up, you land on the iPhones lock screen.You can see your alerts without having to unlock the phone if you have notifications set to show up there.(Some people prefer not to, out of privacy concerns.)Raise to Wake also saves you a step if you need to snap a photo in a hurry because as you lift the phone, you can swipe the screen to the left to quickly jump to the iPhones Camera app.Swiping up from the bottom of the screen summons the iOS Control Center, where you can change the music volume, use the iPhones flashlight, switch on Airplane Mode and adjust other settings without having to unlock the phone and fiddle around in the main Settings app.Photo If you do not want your notifications visible to people nearby or worry your phones battery is taking too much of a hit when the screen pops on each time you move the device, you can turn off Raise to Wake.To do that, unlock your iPhone, tap the Settings app on the Home screen, select Display & Brightness and tap the button near Raise to Wake to disable the feature.
Politicians Are Bad at Podcasting:::::There is plenty of like-minded confabbing Mr. Sanders interviewing Elizabeth Warren, Mr. Duffy interviewing fellow Republican members of Congress that makes everybody look right and good.And in Chicago Stories, with Mr. Emanuel, this combative mayor recasts himself as a kinder, gentler interlocutor of anodyne local figures, like brewery owners and spoken-word poets.Its working.The Chicago Tribune has praised the podcast for showing what can happen when a control-the-narrative mayor loosens the reins just a little.You know, on the podcast he controls completely.Excepting Mr. Duffy, this is largely a Democratic phenomenon, and not because people who listen to podcasts are more liberal.Podcast listeners are only a little more left-leaning than America at large: According to Edison Research, 27 percent of Americans identify as Republicans, compared with 24 percent of adult podcast listeners.And conservative figures like Sean Hannity, Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro all run successful podcasts with sizable audiences.But as President Trump (and before that Candidate Trump) has conquered the media landscape, commanding the agenda on issues big and very, very small, it makes sense that Democratic lawmakers would be most eager to seize alternate outlets to promote their political priorities.(Off the Sidelines from Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Off the Cuff from Representative Jared Huffman of California popped up last year; We the Podcast from Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, begun in 2015, was ahead of its time.)All of these Democrats have taken a page from Mr. Trump himself.The president doesnt have his own podcast (yet), but no other lawmaker has so successfully leveraged the internet to push out his own version of the news, whether through his Twitter account or through his weekly self-branded Facebook video news report, the Real News Update hosted by his daughter-in-law Lara Trump.Traditional news media might be politically polarized watch Fox News or MSNBC for different versions of the days events but the internet has allowed for platforms focused on even more granular political preferences.Now, you dont have to stop at supporting Mr. Sanders as a political candidate; you can get your news filtered through The Bernie Sanders Show, in your podcast feed or on Facebook Live.The lawmaker podcast boom is just another way that our political news is becoming less accountable to the public and more personality driven.But thats not the only thing wrong with it.The podcasts are also boring.Efforts to showcase the lighter side of politicians rarely reveal the most interesting things about them.Mr. Emanuels podcast would probably be more captivating if he werent so focused on seeming supremely relatable and chill.And Im sure Mr. Duffy has some interesting stories about what its like to be in Congress right now, under this president, but hes instead ceding his time to interviews with other lawmakers about their educational and work backgrounds and what kinds of cheese they like best.Advertisement Continue reading the main story None of these shows are the optimal conduit for understanding the political issues of the day, unless youre a big nerd for Congress or really hate conflict.Mr. Duffy has expressed interest in having the liberal California Representative Maxine Waters on as a guest in the future, telling the conservative website The Daily Caller: Maxine and I dont agree on much of anything, but I think Maxine is a nice person, I think Maxine is a good person.Hopefully, theyll get into those disagreements instead of just talking about how nice the other person is.Part of the problem is that for lawmakers, podcasting is obviously a side gig.In the first episode of Canarycast, Mr. Brown tells his guests a trio of Whirlpool workers that he has to end the interview to cast a vote.Ms. Gillibrands podcast unexpectedly went silent in January after only six episodes.I guess shes been busy.The political figures with podcasts actually worth listening to are the ones who have left office.These are people who have relevant inside information about how our government works but who are now in a position to pull back the curtain.They also have more incentive to produce something truly interesting, as opposed to simply politically advantageous.Hillary Clintons campaign podcast, With Her, became instantly more compelling after her loss; the two episodes she recorded in September reflecting on the election are riveting, even for those with Election 2016 fatigue.Freed from being vice president, Joe Biden is now lending his brand to an experimental audio news curation project, Bidens Briefing, which is billed as a skillcast for devices like Alexa and Google Home but is also available to download as a regular podcast.The highlight of the category is Stay Tuned With Preet, starring Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney fired by President Trump.Some speculated that Mr. Bharara might seek elected office, but instead hes teamed up with his brother, an internet entrepreneur, and created a podcast that takes the contours of a thrilling and urgent civics lesson.If politicians really want to excel at podcasting, maybe they should quit their day jobs.For lawmakers, the podcast is rarely undertaken in the legitimate pursuit of good content but is instead a dull, modern version of constituent outreach.These shows are an attempt to signal that they are listening to us.But that doesnt mean that we should listen to them.
How Floyd Mayweather Helped Two Young Guys From Miami Get Rich:::::Thanks in part to the endorsements, in just a few weeks Centras founders raised over $30 million from investors around the world.They finished their fund-raising this month, just before a grand jury indicted two of the three co-founders on perjury charges stemming from a drunken-driving case.Centra was one of the 270 or so I.C.O.s that have raised more than $3.2 billion this year, a 3,000 percent jump from last years total, according to data from Tokendata.io, which tracks coin offerings.Investors have been willing to pay real money for these virtual tokens because they hope their value will go up as fast as the price of Bitcoin, the best-known digital currency, has in recent months.Celebrities have helped stoke the I.C.O.boom.The actor Jamie Foxx, the socialite Paris Hilton and the soccer player Luis Suarez, for example, have all promoted new virtual currencies to their sizable followings on social media in recent months, offering legitimacy and attention to coin offerings that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.Mr. Mayweather, who has promoted three different tokens Centra, Stox and Hubiits has even taken to calling himself Crypto Mayweather in social media posts, a play on his better-known nickname, Money Mayweather.But the story of Centra illustrates that beneath the signs of mainstream acceptance, coin offerings still exist in a legal gray zone with few checks on the ambitions of young entrepreneurs.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its undeniable that a celebrity endorsement brings a new audience into the world of crypto currencies, said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center, a nonprofit that advocates for Bitcoin and related technology.But Im not certain that celebrity endorsements are doing a good job of bringing attention to the legitimate projects.Coins of the Digital Wild West The original virtual currency, Bitcoin, is a digital token with no physical backing that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world.The network on which Bitcoin is stored and transferred was designed to operate without any company or government in charge, governed by a far-flung collaboration of volunteer programmers and computers that maintain all the records.Initial coin offerings have taken advantage of the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and another popular virtual currency network, Ethereum.People can pay for tokens like Centra using Bitcoin and Ether (the currency inside Ethereum), and no financial authority needs to approve the payments or even know they happened.Coin offerings have also copied the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and are riding on the coattails of tech industry enthusiasm for those currency systems.The Centra founders said their token would fuel a new virtual currency debit card and online market.Some venture capitalists have said these new tokens could provide a way to fund and support new global networks like the next generation of the internet.But while Bitcoin and Ethereum have gone through years of public vetting (and still have plenty of critics), the new tokens being sold in recent months are unproven, and marketed on the promises of their creators.The creators of Centra are 26-year-old friends from southern Florida, Sam Sharma and Raymond Trapani.The companys chief marketing officer, Robert Farkas, was recently given the title of co-founder as well.Before Centra, neither Mr. Sharma nor Mr. Trapani had any professional experience with the technologies associated with virtual currencies, or with the debit cards they were hoping to build.The primary business experience of Mr. Sharma and Mr. Farkas was at Miami Exotics, a luxury car rental business that the two built.Mr. Trapanis old Instagram account shows that he was also a credit repair specialist with a penchant for pictures of luxury cars and stacks of $20 bills.You can sit and watch my life, or you can join my team and live a life like mine!he wrote in one post.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The lack of experience in the virtual currency industry did nothing to limit the ambitions of Centras founders.In July, they put out a website and an announcement that described Centra as an answer to the proliferation of virtual currencies.Centra Tech has a brilliant solution, the worlds first Debit Card that is designed for use with compatibility on 8+ major cryptocurrencies blockchain assets, the announcement said.Photo Making up for the inexperience of the young men was an older chief executive named Michael Edwards, at least according to the Centra website at the time.The first cracks in the project appeared in early August when a programmer, Harry Denly, wrote on his blog that Mr. Edwards appeared to be made up.The photo on Centras website was a photo of a Canadian physiology professor who had no relation to Centra and none of the details on Mr. Edwardss LinkedIn profile, like his work experience at Bank of America and Wells Fargo, checked out.Centra initially threatened to sue Mr. Denly but then said the bad profiles were the result of freelancers who had hastily put together the companys marketing material.The LinkedIn profile was deleted.The company has since removed any mention of Michael Edwards from the Centra site and elevated Mr. Sharma to be president.The company also deleted several other employees whose identity and existence were challenged on social media forums.When I got involved, the website got cleaned up from A to Z, Mr. Sharma said in an interview.Centra charged past these hiccups and began its token sale, got its endorsement from Mr. Mayweather (more on that later) and moved ahead with its plans for a virtual currency debit card.The debit card was described as a new product that would make it possible to spend virtual currencies anywhere Visa cards were taken.The companys site showed Centra cards emblazoned with the Visa logo.There was one problem with this plan.The company had not been approved, or had even applied, to run a Centra card on the Visa network, a spokeswoman for Visa said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After The New York Times reached out to Visa this month, Centra took all the mentions of Visa off its website.Mr. Sharma then said in an interview that the company had shifted its strategy and was now planning to run its cards on the Mastercard network in partnership with a Canadian financial institution.He said this would not require approval from Mastercard because the Canadian institution would issue the cards.But a Mastercard spokesman, Brian Gendron, disagreed.Centra would need approval from Mastercard for something like that, and we are not aware of any approval that has been sought or achieved, Mr. Gendron said.Because Centra began raising money without going through any standard background checks, no one verified the companys credentials with the credit card networks or other relevant authorities.A basic background check would have turned up the numerous run-ins with the law that Mr. Sharma, the company president, has had.Photo Mr. Sharma has been sued in Florida and New York several times on allegations of unpaid bills and business deals gone sour.Twice, people have accused him in court of trying to fraudulently sell or lend them cars that he didnt own, and twice he has been evicted for claims that he failed to pay rent.The landlord in Boca Raton, Fla., who evicted him, Steven Fern, said that after Mr. Sharma stopped paying the rent on his condominium, Mr. Sharma promised repeatedly that he would make it up the next month.He stayed the entire time, literally until the day the police came, Mr. Fern said.It was a strange scenario, and we lost a lot of money.Mr. Sharma said that these problems, a few years ago, had happened when he was a kid.He said the landlords statements were not accurate.Sprite, Pinot Grigio and a White Maserati Photo For now, the bigger problem facing Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani is the perjury indictment by a Manhattan grand jury on Oct. 5, just a few days after Centra finished fund-raising.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The charges stem from an incident last year in Manhattan, when Mr. Sharma was arrested early on a Friday in a white Maserati.According to a local news report, Mr. Sharma ran a stop sign and had a flushed face, a strong odor of alcohol on his breath and watery and bloodshot eyes, and was unsteady on his feet.Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani both said during Mr. Sharmas trial that on the night in question, Mr. Sharma had only had Sprite and one glass of pinot grigio, according to the indictment.As defendant Sharma and defendant Trapani knew, the testimony that defendant Trapani gave was false, and the truth was that on March 24, 2016, there were alcoholic beverages other than pinot grigio on the table and the defendant did not order Sprite, the indictment said.Mr. Sharma said that he couldnt speak to the case because it was still going on, but that it should not have any effect on Centra.Im obviously not comfortable with that situation, he said.But its not that I did something so intensely crazy that investors need to worry.He and Mr. Trapani both said they were moving ahead with their big plans for Centra, including more projects with Mr. Mayweather.Mr. Trapani said the company was connected with Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled through social contacts in Miami.Mr. Trapani said Mr. Mayweather was so intrigued by Centras technology that he wanted to be paid in Centra tokens, and wanted to be a partner for future business ventures.Hell do anything we ask, Mr. Trapani said.Hell go shopping around Beverly Hills if we ask him to do it with this card.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The boxing champ understood their deal differently.A spokeswoman for Mr. Mayweather, Kelly Swanson, said he had been paid in cash for the posts and was not involved in any continuing relationship with Centra.She did not say how much he had been paid.After being contacted by The Times, Mr. Mayweather deleted his Instagram and Facebook posts endorsing Centra, though he left up a Twitter post.Mr. Sharma disputed the account of Mr. Mayweathers spokeswoman and said the boxer had received Centra tokens.We dealt with Floyd directly through my guy, Mr. Sharma said.It was a very direct, individual deal.Representatives for DJ Khaled did not respond to requests for comment.Other celebrities have already learned the risks of associating with initial coin offerings.Photo In September, Ms. Hilton endorsed a token known as Lydian Coin on Twitter, where she wrote: Looking forward to participating in the new @LydianCoinLtd Token!Ms. Hilton deleted the post after Forbes reporters uncovered the checkered legal past of the founder of Lydian Coin, who had aimed to raise $100 million.Regulators have been relatively slow to crack down on problematic coin offerings.But the Securities and Exchange Commission did recently bring its first case against what it claimed was a fraudulent project a relatively small one that collected a few hundred thousand dollars.For now, Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani are sitting on the $30 million that investors gave them.Mr. Sharma shared and proved his ownership of the Ethereum wallet where they are currently keeping the money.Assuming regulators dont step in, Mr. Trapani and Mr. Sharma can keep the money, even if they dont build anything.But they say that wont happen.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Sharma said Centra was planning to issue its first batch of debit cards this year, regardless of the denials of Visa and Mastercard, and would unveil its broader technology in November.They have already rented lavish offices in Miami Beach and hired several people.I see us taking over as being the No.1 company that people will use to use their crypto assets, Mr. Sharma said, using an industry term for virtual currencies.Once our proof of concept goes from beta to live, I think that we are going to take market dominance in the full aspect.Some potential investors did not share Mr. Sharmas enthusiasm and discussed their concerns on Reddit and other social media platforms.But those criticisms ended up having less of an impact than the social media nods from Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled.Whats important is Centra is being endorsed and they have a product, a Reddit user named islandsurf wrote back to the critics, explaining his own investment.Thats what matters to investors!
An Explanation of Initial Coin Offerings:::::What does this have to do with existing virtual currencies?These coins are generally inspired by older virtual currency systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum, with a cap on the number of coins that will exist to provide a sense of goldlike scarcity and a structure that allows them to operate entirely outside the existing financial and regulatory ecosystem.Investors generally buy the new coins by sending the programmers Bitcoin or Ether (the virtual currency inside the Ethereum network).Whats more, many of the coins are stored, moved around and enabled by other Ethereum technology.But the coins sold in coin offerings are meant to exist independent of Bitcoin and Ethereum, with their own free-floating value.(For a more complete explanation of Bitcoin, click here, and for an Ethereum explainer, click here.)Is there a relation to initial public offerings of shares in a company?The name for coin offerings was clearly inspired by the initial public offerings that companies do to sell stock to investors.But unlike stock offerings, coin offerings are generally designed so that investors dont get an ownership stake in the start-ups.If the coin does provide an ownership stake, the Securities and Exchange Commission has said, the companies must comply with all securities law.A few coins have done this, but most have tried to avoid it.Investors can contribute as much or as little money as they want in these offerings, which are generally more like crowdfunding campaigns that new projects do on Kickstarter or Indiegogo.Why would anyone pay for these coins?In principle, people buy these coins because they want to use the services on which the coin will be used.So far, though, almost none of the services have been completed.In the meantime, people are buying coins because they are hoping the value will go up.When the Stratis token was released in July 2016, it was worth seven-tenths of a penny.In the fall of 2017, each of those tokens was trading for around $2.95, a 42,000 percent increase.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After the initial coin offering, when the programmers sell their tokens for a set price, coins are traded on third-party exchanges through open-market bidding similar to the way stocks are traded and priced after an I.P.O.The programmers who created the coins generally keep a large stash of coins so that they also benefit if the price goes up.The people betting on the price of these tokens are generally betting that the services promised by the programmers will be completed, creating demand for the coins in the future.Why arent these start-ups raising money through venture capitalists?The most obvious reason to do a coin offering is that you can raise more money than you ever could from venture capitalists.The most valuable virtual-currency company that was funded with venture capital, Coinbase, raised $100 million this year, five years after it was founded.The same day that was announced, Filecoin, which doesnt even have a working product, announced that it had raised over $200 million.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Another plus: Start-ups that raise money through coin offerings dont have to give away ownership of their technology to outside investors.Some programmers look to coin offerings because they can raise money for projects that venture capital wont fund.Specifically, coin offerings can provide funding to build open-source projects that in the end no one will own, the way that no one owns Bitcoin or Ethereum.Filecoins cloud storage network, for instance, would be operated by its users rather than any central company.How do you create your own virtual currency?It is easier than it seems.The software behind Bitcoin and Ethereum is open source, which means that anyone can take the computer code and tweak it to create a virtual currency with slightly different characteristics.There are companies that will do this for you if you are not technologically adept.Convincing people that your new coin will have value is the harder part, and many coins that are released never grow to be worth anything.Some companies have gone the more complicated route of creating their own new software for their coins, with qualities that are very different from Bitcoin and Ethereum.Who can invest in coin offerings?Anyone who has Bitcoin or Ether and is willing to send their money to the creators of a coin offering.Is this illegal?China and South Korea have said it is illegal.In the United States and many other countries, regulators have said some coins should be categorized as securities, like stocks and bonds.If a coin is categorized as a security, it has to follow all relevant securities law, such as registering with the authorities and ensuring that people buying the coins are properly accredited and vetted.Suffice to say, essentially no coin offerings have followed these rules.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Many people are waiting for regulators to crack down.Some are expecting that the first targets will be the exchanges where the coins are traded.What happens if the programmers never build what they promise?Investors dont have much recourse.The most likely outcome will be that the investors will lose the money they put into the project, though people may try to sue.What do real investors think of this?A number of prominent Silicon Valley investors have argued that coin offerings could provide a way to build open-source projects that would not have otherwise received support.Some big names think this will lead to a new generation of open-source internet protocols and loosen the control of big companies like Google and Facebook.Chris Dixon, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, has argued that by enabling the development of new open networks, tokens could help reverse the centralization of the internet, thereby keeping it accessible, vibrant and fair, and resulting in greater innovation.But even sophisticated enthusiasts believe that almost all of the companies currently raising money through coin offerings will fail and lose money for their investors and probably should not happen in the first place.Right now, with all of the enthusiasm for crypto assets out there, I am very

Farhad and Mike’s Week in Tech: Twitter and Reddit Take a Stand:::::Farhad: Im not going to dignify that with an answer.Anyway, in the run-up to that testimony, Twitter which has been criticized by lawmakers for its response so far announced that it would ban two Russian news organizations from buying Twitter ads.The two news sites are Russia Today and Sputnik, both of which are backed by the Kremlin and are accused of furthering Russian propaganda worldwide.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Mike: I was a bit stumped by this.You could praise Twitter for taking some action against groups that have clearly acted against the interests of the American people.That said, I find it difficult for a tech company to position itself as a stateless platform while also largely adhering to Western value structures.Does Twitter block CNN from Russia if Russia lodges a similar election interference complaint?Farhad: Im not sure how effective this change will be in limiting Russian propaganda, since these outlets will still be allowed to have a presence on Twitter they just cant buy ads.This also puts Twitter in a spot I thought it didnt want to be in; its unclear what policies and guidelines it will use to determine whether a news service is actually a propaganda outfit.Is it government funding?Well, then what about the BBC?Is it aggressively pushing a nationalistic point of view?What about Fox News?This is opening a can of worms.Mike: Yep, fully agree.Twitter is trying to push back a bit on that through the lens of transparency.That is, the company promised to give details to individual users on where the ads are coming from and whos spending money to target them specifically.The company hasnt really dug into the details on that yet, but well see if it actually makes a difference.Reddit Bans Nazis, and Honolulu Bans Distracted Walking Farhad: Russia Today wasnt the only thing that was banned this week.It was a big week in bans!Reddit shut several sections of its site that catered to Nazis and white supremacists.This comes after a policy change that now prohibits content that calls for violence.Its a big change for Reddit, which has long had an anything-goes policy.Mike: We cant really emphasize enough how big of a shift this is for Reddit.As youve said, the site has essentially taken a stance similar to Twitter since its inception: Free speech, no matter how odious you may find it, above all else.That has led Reddit down some dark paths, like refusing to ban outright racist groups and topic pages, not to mention dealing with an entire community devoted to creepshots of underage women.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I dont know what changed in their thinking.Perhaps Reddit, which has raised significant venture financing over the past two years, is trying to present a more polished view of itself in hopes of one day being acquired or going public.Photo Farhad: Meanwhile the city of Honolulu banned looking at your phone while walking.If you look at your phone while crossing the street, police officers can fine you $35 for the infraction.Mike, if they had this ban in San Francisco or New York, Id be very very poor.Mike: I do this thing where if a stranger is looking down at their phone and coming at me on the sidewalk, I refuse to move out of the way.Either they look up at the last minute and apologize, or they run right into me.I dont take a stand on many things, but this is one of them.Anyway, go Honolulu!Snaps Spectacles Flopped Farhad: Finally, there was news about Snap.Remember them?They make a popular messaging app that teenagers love.But apparently they dont love it enough to make them O.K.with goofy glasses.According to The Information, Snap badly overestimated demand for Spectacles, the camera-enabled glasses it released last year.I loved these glasses!I thought they were one of the most innovative gadgets Ive used in a while.Apparently kids dont think like dads.Snap sold only 150,000 pairs of specs, and the company has hundreds of thousands of unsold units in its warehouse.And even those it did sell werent used very much; according to Business Insider, most of the people who bought Specs stopped using them after a few weeks.Mike, are you still wearing your specs?Mike: Sadly, no.But not really for any philosophical or fashion reasons.Basically, its because theyre not prescription and I dont want to start running into walls without my regular glasses on.Does the company insurance plan cover Snap prescriptions?Farhad: Um, somehow I doubt that.O.K., see you next week!
Automakers Build War Chests to Finance a Self-Driving Future:::::Mr. Hacketts predecessor, Mark Fields, was ousted in May after he failed to deliver the high-tech strategy that investors were eager to see for future growth.Mr. Hackett has reorganized his management team with an eye toward incremental improvements in the more mundane aspects of the business, such as cutting material costs and streamlining production, as a prelude to making larger investments in electric-powered models driven by computers.It also announced a long list of senior management appointments and departures this week.We are committed to transforming our business, Mr. Hackett said of his companys efforts to bring new driverless technology to market.Yet he seemed most proud on Thursday that Ford had achieved 8 percent operating margins on vehicles it builds and sells in the North American market.That is the type of performance that the Detroit companies must achieve to win over investors, who remain leery of the domestic manufacturers because of their roller-coaster financial histories.It was just eight years ago that both G.M.and the former Chrysler needed bankruptcies and government bailouts simply to survive.For its part, Ford weathered the last recession without the benefit of Chapter 11 or federal aid but only after it borrowed heavily and sold off divisions to generate the capital it needed to stay alive.Now all three manufacturers are committed to reining in costs, aligning production volumes with demand, and reducing unprofitable sales of slow-moving vehicles to corporate fleets and rental-car companies.The Chrysler half of the Italian-American company Fiat Chrysler has gone a step further by dropping most small and midsize passenger cars from its lineup.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its focus on Jeep S.U.V.s and Ram pickups helped Fiat Chrysler post record third-quarter earnings of about $1.1 billion, an increase of 50 percent over the same period a year ago.The results drew praise from one analyst because of the companys aggressive approach to maximizing shareholder value.Fiat Chrysler has continued a relentless restructuring of its brand portfolio to de-emphasize areas where it couldnt make money, the analyst, Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note.The earnings announcements this week were welcomed on Wall Street, with Fords shares gaining almost 2 percent on Thursday.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But attacking costs and shifting investment to more popular products may not be enough for automakers to sustain strong profits if market conditions continue to weaken.Overall sales of new vehicles in the United States have fallen about 2 percent so far this year, after back-to-back record years.An overhaul or abandonment of the North American Free Trade Agreement which is being renegotiated by the United States, Canada and Mexico could also upset the delicate balance of production and parts manufacturing spread over the region.Competition is also getting stiffer, as companies such as the Japanese automaker Nissan expand their S.U.V.lineups and underperforming automakers like the German giant Volkswagen rev up their expansion plans.Still, the healthy profit reports out of Detroit are becoming a proof point that the major domestic carmakers are better prepared than ever for a longer-term downturn in demand.Some of the biggest changes are underway at G.M., the nations largest automaker.The company has made major moves in recent months, such as selling its unprofitable Opel-Vauxhall unit in Europe.Moreover, G.M.slashed its third-quarter production in North America by about 25 percent to respond to weak demand for many of its passenger car models.The company reported a loss of $3 billion for the quarter, mostly because it is still absorbing hefty charges for the sale of the European assets to the French carmaker PSA Group.But G.M.reported 8 percent profit margins on vehicles it did sell in its home market, and pledged to stay focused on selling fewer, but higher-priced, vehicles.Advertisement Continue reading the main story G.M.s chief financial officer, Chuck Stevens, told analysts on a conference call that the results demonstrated the resilience of our core business in the face of declining consumer demand.This was a solid quarter even with significantly lower volumes, he said.But as overall sales in the United States continue to slowly erode, the companies must maintain discipline on production schedules and refrain from piling sales incentives on poor-performing models.The market is more challenging than expected, Mr. Stevens said.Strong balance sheets are essential if the automakers are going to dedicate more spending and resources to expensive strategies for self-driving and electric cars.G.M., for example, is continuing to build on its acquisition of the software firm Cruise Automation in its efforts to put fully autonomous vehicles on the road.The company recently acquired a small laser-imaging company to augment Cruises work on outfitting all-electric Chevrolet Bolts with the most advanced self-driving equipment.And G.M.is building more Bolts for autonomous-driving tests in New York and elsewhere.Mary T. Barra, G.M.s chief executive, told analysts that the company was also looking at potential markets for self-driving vehicles outside the United States.Absolutely, we are going to be looking globally, she said.And even Fiat Chrysler, which has been slow to join the race to develop autonomous vehicles, served notice that it was now in position to accelerate its self-driving program in partnership with the German automaker BMW and suppliers like Delphi and Intel.Were not laggards here, the companys chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said on an analyst call.Weve just chosen our spot carefully before we started playing.

Scanning, Converting and Editing Text on the Go:::::Q.Are there any inexpensive Android apps that let you take a picture of a document and convert the photo to a Microsoft Word-compatible file that can be edited and printed?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.A. Optical character recognition (O.C.R.)apps are designed to convert images of letters in documents or other printed sources into text files you can edit in Microsoft Word or another word-processing program.O.C.R.apps for Android are available in the Google Play store, just as similar programs for iOS, Windows 10 Mobile and desktop systems can be found in the respective app stores.Some apps can even translate photographed text into different languages.If you use the Microsoft Office suite for writing and editing documents, however, a combination of Microsoft Word for Android and the separate Office Lens app is one way to snap, scan and edit when you are on the go.When you have both apps on your Android device, open Office Lens and take a picture of the page or printed material you want to convert into a Word file; the app can also convert a photograph of notes scrawled on a white board into text files.Photo When you are asked to save and store the photo, choose Microsoft Word from the list of apps and services.The Android version of Word then takes over to open the file, covert the text into type you can edit and then open the content in a word-processing document on your phone or tablet.You can edit it there, email it to yourself for use elsewhere or park it in a linked online storage site like OneDrive.The process works about the same way with the apps on an iOS or Windows-based device.
Twitter Says It Overstated Monthly-User Figures for 3 Years:::::Photo Twitter said on Thursday that it had overstated its monthly-user figures since 2014 after mistakenly including data from third-party applications in its counting.The revelation came as the company reported that its net loss had narrowed in the third quarter and that its number of daily active users had risen 14 percent.The disclosure could nonetheless do further harm to Twitters reputation as the company contends with scrutiny over its role in Russias efforts to meddle in the presidential election, complaints about what critics have called its scattershot efforts to prevent abuse and harassment on its platform; and skepticism among some investors concerned about its slowing user growth worldwide.Initially at least, investors did not appear particularly troubled by news of the inflated user figures.Twitter shares were up 10 percent in premarket trading on Thursday.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.The company said it had discovered that its measure of monthly active users had been improperly including figures from third-party applications that used Digits, a software-development program.Digits is part of the Fabric mobile application platform that Twitter sold to Alphabet, Googles parent company, this year.
F.C.C. to Loosen Rules on Local Media Ownership:::::Photo WASHINGTON The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday announced plans to eliminate decades-old media ownership rules meant to protect local coverage and diversity in media voices.The commissions chairman, Ajit Pai, said in a congressional hearing that the agency would vote in November to roll back rules that prevent ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market.The rules were created to prevent an individual or organization from having outsize influence over public opinion.But in the hearing, where he faced fierce criticism by Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Pai defended the plan and other deregulatory actions in recent months, saying media ownership rules were outdated.They were created 42 years ago, when newspapers and television stations dominated the media landscape, well before Facebook and Google.The marketplace today is nothing like it was in 1975, Mr. Pai said.It was the latest action by Mr. Pai, who was appointed by President Trump in January, to overhaul the media industry.Since Mr. Pai has taken the top seat at the F.C.C., his deregulatory actions have ushered in the possibility of consolidation in the broadcast television industry.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the spring, soon after he lifted a cap on how many stations a single company can own, the Sinclair Broadcast Group announced its intention to buy Tribune Media for $3.9 billion.The merger, which the F.C.C.and the Department of Justice are reviewing, would give Sinclair access to more than 70 percent of all television viewers in the United States.This week, the commissions Republican majority lifted rules that required television stations owners to operate a main studio in each locality, which Mr. Pai said was unnecessary and costly for TV station owners.
Amazon’s Latest Way Into Your Life Is Through the Front Door:::::Photo SEATTLE For many online shoppers, packages often linger for distressingly long hours outside their homes, where they can be stolen or soaked by rain.Now, if customers give it permission, Amazons couriers will unlock the front doors and drop packages inside when no one is home.What could possibly go wrong?The head spins with the opportunities for mischief in letting a stranger into an empty home.There are risks for couriers too whether its an attacking dog or an escaping cat.To allay these concerns, Amazon is asking customers to trust it buy a package of technology including an internet-connected smart lock and an indoor security camera.Amazon isnt the only business that believes this is the future of internet shopping, as well as other services that require home access, like dog walking and house keeping.This summer, a start-up that makes smart locks, Latch, struck a deal with Jet.com, an online shopping site owned by Walmart, to jointly pay for the installation of its locks on 1,000 apartment buildings in New York City to make deliveries easier.The arrangement offers some of the security of a doorman for people who live in buildings without them.E-commerce companies have experimented with ways of making deliveries more secure for years.Amazon installs self-service lockers in office buildings and outside supermarkets where customers can fetch their orders, and Daimler and other carmakers have tested the delivery of goods from Amazon and other retailers to customers car trunks.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The costs of package theft arent known Amazon, for example, will not say but are probably substantial.Most people who have spent any time on a neighborhood blog, social network or email list have a sense of how prevalent such crime is.And packages sitting on front porches can also signal to anyone who walks by that the homeowners are away.
How Google’s Physical Keys Will Protect Your Password:::::The physical keys are an evolution of two-factor authentication, an extra security layer to ensure that your password is being entered by you.Google was one of the first companies to start offering two-factor authentication back in 2010, not long after it learned that it had been hacked by state-sponsored Chinese hackers.After the attack, Googles security team came up with a motto: Never again.The company later rolled out two-factor authentication for Google customers Gmail accounts.It involved text messaging a unique code to your phone that you must type in after entering your password in order to log in.Unfortunately, those text messages can be hijacked.Last month, security researchers at Positive Technologies, a security firm, demonstrated how they could use vulnerabilities in the cellular network to intercept text messages for a set period of time.The idea of Googles Advanced Protection Program is to provide people with a physical device that is much harder to steal than a text message.Google is marketing the program as a tool for a tiny set of people who are at high risk of online attacks, like victims of stalking, dissidents inside authoritarian countries or journalists who need to protect their sources.But why should extra-tough security benefit such a small group?Everyone should be able to enjoy stronger security.So we tested Googles Advanced Protection Program and vetted it with security researchers to see if the program could be used by the masses.The verdict: Many people should consider signing up for the security system and buying a pair of keys.But if you are married to some non-Google apps that are not yet compatible with the keys, you should wait and see if the program matures.Setting Up Advanced Protection Anyone with a Google account can sign up for the security program on Googles Advanced Protection webpage.To get started, you will have to buy two physical keys for about $20 each.Google recommends buying one from Feitian and another from Yubico.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The keys, which look like thumb drives and can fit on your key chain, contain digital signatures that prove you are you.To set one up, you plug the key into a computer USB port, tap a button and name it.(The Feitian key wirelessly communicates with your smartphone to authenticate the login.)This process takes a few minutes.On a computer and a smartphone, you need to log in with the key only once, and Google will remember the devices for future logins.That is more convenient than traditional two-factor authentication, which requires entering a unique code each time you log in.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.But there are trade-offs.Googles Advanced Protection cuts off all third-party access by default, allowing only applications that support its security keys.For the time being, that means only Googles Gmail mail app, Googles Backup and Sync app, and Googles Chrome browser.On an iPhone, for example, you will have to use Googles Gmail or Inbox apps for email, and on a computer, you can use only the Chrome browser when signing in with a browser.So if you rely on Apple Mail to gain access to your Gmail on an iPhone, or if you use Microsoft Outlook for getting into Gmail on a PC, youre out of luck.Google says its goal is to eventually allow third-party apps to work with the program, but it is also up to other companies to update their apps to support the keys.Testing the Security Despite the drawbacks, security researchers agree that the Advanced Protection Program is a solid piece of security and relatively painless to use, even for everyday use for people outside high-security jobs.Mr. Sabin, the former N.S.A.hacker, who is now a director of network security at GRA Quantum, a security consulting firm, said the physical keys had pros and cons.On one hand, if you lose a key, a hacker would have a hard time figuring out which account it was associated with.On the other hand, if you lose the keys or dont have the keys around when you need to log in to a new device, it takes longer to regain access to your account.Google has put in place more elaborate recovery steps for Advanced Protection users, including additional reviews and requests for details about why users have lost access to their account.In our test, we answered security questions to try to recover an account, and Google said it would review the recovery request and respond within a few days.Runa Sandvik, the director of information security at The New York Times, said the keys were not much of a hassle.She said Googles requirement of using two keys meant you essentially had a spare: If you lose one key, you can get into your account with the remaining key.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But she noted that the keys could get annoying if you used many devices and constantly needed to carry the keys around to log in to your account.That may be an issue for people who work in the technology industry, but most people probably use only one computer and one phone.Ms. Sandvik, who has been testing Googles program to assess whether to recommend it to the newsroom, said she had not yet discovered vulnerabilities in the security key system outside of the slim possibility that a hacker gained possession of both your password and your key.Its something that is relatively easy to set up once you have both keys, Ms. Sandvik said.I dont see a reason you shouldnt turn this on.The Bottom Line While the security keys are easy to set up and provide tough security, they may be disruptive to your productivity if you rely on apps that are incompatible with the keys.It took a few minutes for us to migrate to Googles apps from Apples and integrate them into our newsroom workflow, which already relies on Googles mail, messaging and cloud storage services.But using the keys required sacrificing an important feature Apples V.I.P.alerts, which notify you when people you deem important email you.Googles iOS apps for Gmail and Inbox lack a similar feature.For people with flooded inboxes, lacking V.I.P.alerts makes sifting through emails time-consuming.Another example of how the keys can stifle productivity: Many employers still require using the Microsoft Outlook app for email, which wont work with the keys.If using Googles security program would disrupt your work, you may want to wait for more companies to update their apps to support the keys, which rely on a standard called FIDO, for Fast Identity Online.Mr. Sabin predicts that many apps will follow Googles lead.If you decide to wait, dont procrastinate on turning on traditional two-factor authentication that relies on text messages.While it is hackable, it is still much safer than relying on a password alone to protect you.The question is how long it will take security researchers to find a way to hack the physical keys as well.When asked if he had already circumvented physical multifactor authentication devices like Googles keys, Mr. Sabin would offer only: No comment.

Can Washington Stop Big Tech Companies? Don’t Bet on It:::::Now, that attitude is beginning to change.I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants power through government and, if so, how.There are growing efforts in Washington to do something about big tech.The recognition that networks like Facebook, Google and YouTube played a great and mainly hidden role in last years presidential election has spurred an urgent effort to regulate political ads online.On the left, there has been a surge of interest in rethinking antitrust policy to deal with the most economically impactful of the Five Amazon, Facebook and Google.Republicans have been more muted, but there are wisps of concern, especially from the Steve Bannon wing of the right.Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart chairman and former presidential adviser, has repeatedly assailed tech companies for their liberal worldview and what he calls their threats to free speech.But there is little to suggest well see drastic action anytime soon.Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants vast powers might be harmful.The intellectual underpinnings for how to regulate one or two or several of the Five remain vague.The political will to do so is even more elusive; the tech companies remain exceedingly popular, and they are using their vast fortunes to acquire political and cultural clout.Individuals, lawmakers, were all feeling a rapid loss of control and power around these companies, said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that opposes concentrated corporate power.For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.Mr. Lynn thinks that view is shifting.In June, Open Markets was forced from its previous home, the New America Foundation, reportedly because of pressure from Google, a huge New America funder.(Google and New America have denied that claim.)Our firing has transformed the discussions among people about the power of these companies, Mr. Lynn said.Folks in this town saw this, noticed it, and Id bet a lot of money a year from now well see real huge shifts in feelings around here.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Part of what has hampered governmental action against the Five is the unusual nature of their power.Much of what they do now, and will soon have the power to do, exceeds what weve ever expected from corporations.In different ways, they each collect, analyze and mediate our most important public and personal information, including news, political data and our relationships.Theyre being called upon to police free speech, terrorism and sex trafficking, and to defend nations and individuals against existential digital attack.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Theyre creating machines that could one day approximate and surpass human intelligence a technological achievement that may come with as many complications as the advent of nuclear weapons.And all of them figure into economic inequality in the United States, since their digital wares provide vast riches to a relative few employees and investors in liberal West Coast enclaves, while passing over much of the rest of the world.But in other ways, the Five do not cleanly fit traditional notions of what constitutes dangerous corporate power.Only a couple of them enjoy monopolies or duopolies in their markets Google and Facebook in digital ads, for example.Apples iPhone is the worlds most profitable product, its App Store the most important digital marketplace, and yet two out of three smartphones sold in the United States are not iPhones.Amazon is considered ground zero in the vast transformation of American retail, and is implicated in the unfolding story of how our jobs and our lunches will be gobbled up by machines.But only in the last year did Amazons annual revenue surpass that of Costco.It does not yet enjoy a majority share of online commerce in America, has a single-digit share of American retail and is still a minor satellite compared with Walmarts sun.Then there is our own complicated relationship with the tech giants.We do not think of them in the same way we think of, say, the faceless megacorps of Wall Street.The Fives power comes cloaked in friendliness, utility and irresistible convenience at unbelievable prices.We hooked our lives into them willingly, and then we became addicted to them.For many Americans, life without all but one or two of them might feel just about unlivable.Weve all become a bit cyborg, writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of New Republic, in World Without Mind, one of several new books examining the giants.What we need to always remember is that were not just merging with machines, but with the companies that run the machines.The complicated nature of the Fives power has sparked novel ideas about how to regulate them.In January, Lina M. Khan, a fellow at Open Markets, published an article in The Yale Law Journal arguing for a complete reconception of antitrust laws to deal with the rise of Amazon.Ms. Khan argued that the modern view of antitrust laws, which were conceived under the Reagan administration, overemphasized low prices as a test for whether a company is gaining too much market power.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Because Amazon manages to keep lowering prices, the antitrust authorities have overlooked other harms caused by Amazons growth, she said, including the way it has created platforms for shipping and cloud storage that give it deep hooks into much of the rest of the economy.Open Markets has offered a similar critique of Google and Facebook.Yet these ideas are controversial even among liberals, in part because its politically perilous to argue that consumers should somehow be suspicious of lower prices.Diana Moss, the president of the progressive American Antitrust Institute, told me that we didnt need new rules to go after tech firms; we just needed stronger enforcement.That, too, seems to be lacking.Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government.European regulators have pursued Google and accused it of abusing its search monopoly, but the Federal Trade Commission closed a 2013 review.During last years presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked often about quashing tech power, but he hasnt done much in office to carry that out.Amazons purchase of Whole Foods, for example, sailed through regulatory review.Put all this together and you get a story of apathy and indecision in the face of colossal corporate power.We are looking at a set of circumstances where the monopolies have become so much more pervasive and intrusive, said Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who took on Microsoft at its peak two decades ago, prompting the historic trial against the company.Mr. Reback, who is now working against Google, argued that the governments antitrust prosecution of Microsoft had altered the companys culture which in turn created room in the market for entrants like Google and Facebook.A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing todays tech giants.But thats a big if.The big hurdle is, are we going to decide to address these problems as a society?Mr. Reback said.Had we been more diligent, we wouldnt have nearly the problems we have today.
Big Tech’s Rivals Pounce at Chances to Win in Washington:::::The action is nascent, but gaining momentum fast.Lawmakers are pushing for regulations for technology companies for the first time in years, encouraged along by big techs broad assortment of rivals.For several weeks, a group of companies including smaller tech companies and entertainment and retail businesses has informally begun regular meetings and conference calls to compare notes about Google, Facebook and Amazon and to find a way to join in a stronger opposition force.Before, any negativity was a risk for the media business because if you were critical, you could be defined as not getting it and being old school, said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times.But now the halo is a bit off these companies.In recent years, lawmakers have held up technology companies as the epitome of American ingenuity and felt that voters did not want the government to slow them down.That attitude was hardened in 2012, after lawmakers suffered a bruising defeat in a bill to strengthen antipiracy rules for internet companies.The proposals set off huge online protests, aided by the big technology companies, that helped stop the legislation.Over the years, Ive watched as the major tech companies not only sought to protect the unlevel playing field they already had, but have used their political influence to expand it to disadvantage businesses with which they compete, said Jim Cicconi, who recently retired after years overseeing lobbying at AT&T.Now I think policymakers are seeing the consequences.But even as they sense an opportunity today, the rivals say that challenging the internet companies

the companys willingness to lose money to gain a foothold.Internet companies are deploying some of the largest armies in corporate America to battle on Capitol Hill.House and Senate staffs say lobbyists for the big technology companies have swarmed their offices in recent weeks.Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have sharply increased their lobbying spending a combined $14.2 million in the third quarter, up from $11.9 million a year earlier.Facebook, which has faced the most scrutiny over the election, increased its third-quarter lobbying budget this year by 40 percent, to $2.85 million.Photo The technology companies go to lawmakers to talk about how their businesses are creating jobs and providing free or lower-priced services for consumers.They also regularly mention donating money for public science, technology and math classes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is unfortunate that companies that have been slow to innovate in a changing consumer-first marketplace are looking for wins through regulation or by scoring cheap political points, said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents Amazon, Facebook and Google.The tech giants are also lodging a strong defense against the newly proposed regulations.Facebook and Google hired high-profile political operatives to thwart changes in election disclosures at the Federal Election Commission and have deployed lobbyists to water down a bipartisan bill introduced last week that would require social media platforms to disclose the financing behind political ads.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Still, their rivals say that for the first time in many years, criticism of Silicon Valley is getting a receptive audience.The clearest opening has been in an unpopular battle that Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple have waged against a bill aimed to curb sex trafficking.The bill would take away some legal protections for sites that knowingly host content that promotes sex trafficking, a move that the internet companies warn could stifle free speech, even though it would largely exempt the big tech companies from liability.Disney, Oracle and 21 Century Fox have endorsed the legislation.The tech companies initially pushed back vigorously against the bill.In recent weeks, though, some of them have softened their stance, saying they hope to seek a compromise.Its past time to dispel the myth that big internet firms cannot or should not be accountable for their business, Chip Smith, the executive vice president for global public affairs at 21st Century Fox, and that includes the personal data they collect and the content and behaviors they promote and profit from online.The tech companies are playing defense on other fronts as well.In September, Yelp said it had filed a complaint against Google with the Federal Trade Commission.In the complaint, Yelp argued that Google had violated a promise it made to the commission in 2013 that it would not reuse the content of competitors for its own advantage.Representative Keith Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, recently wrote the commission to ask it disclose information about why it closed its case on Google in 2013.Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, has asked the agency to reopen its investigation in light of new evidence that surfaced in the case led by European regulators.In July, the News Media Alliance, which represents 2,000 news organizations including The Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, began advocating for antitrust exemptions that would allow the companies to collectively bargain with Facebook and Google for ad revenue.On Tuesday, David Chavern, president of the group, argued at a House hearing that digital platforms like Google and Facebook should follow the same rules that broadcast and print news organizations do.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the fall, you will see us getting increasingly vocal about Google and Facebook and the future of the news business, Mr.

Trump to Open Skies to More Drone Testing:::::Photo WASHINGTON President Trump on Wednesday loosened some rules for commercial drones, including for package deliveries, by allowing broader testing by companies like Amazon and Wing, a part of Alphabet.Mr. Trump signed an executive memorandum to allow more companies to test their flying machines at night, above people, at far greater distances and with packages activities limited by federal restrictions.The Transportation Department will work with states, towns and tribal communities to create pilot programs, the White House said.For example, a drone maker like DJI could apply with a town to test drone deliveries from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m.The pilot programs are expected to be put in place within one year.The announcement is a victory for tech companies that have bet that drone deliveries will be a part of retail in the future, as well as entertainment companies that want to use the machines for filming.Amazon, Google, DJI, Intel and Hollywood lobbied the Obama administration to ease rules on commercial unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones.Amazon even proposed a future highway system in the sky, in which lower altitudes would be reserved for lighter weight drones that could deliver packages.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the Transportation Department has proceeded cautiously around allowing the machines to integrate into airspace shared by planes.Lawmakers and public interest groups have also raised concerns about privacy.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Many questions remain about the program announced on Wednesday, including how many drones could be part of pilot programs.The Federal Aviation Administration is still deliberating potential rules for commercial drones, which are expected to have far more impact on the industry than Wednesdays executive memorandum.
How Australia’s Technology Stands Out:::::What tech equipment additions did you bring into the bureau?Were still finishing up and figuring out what we need, but I bought a Sonos speaker partly to offset the music we can hear from the hip sneaker store below us; partly because I find that music can be a useful team builder and a tool for inspiration.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ill never forget when David Gonzalez, a longtime Times reporter Ive always greatly admired, came into a class I was in at Columbia Journalism School and started playing Miles Davis.The song was So What, and his point was that journalism required a sense of adventure, improvisation and humility.We also went analog with our brainstorming equipment.Instead of white boards, we bought two studio rollers with craft paper.What stands out to you in the Australian tech landscape?Is there a flourishing scene of Australian tech brands, apps and websites?Photo There is definitely a flourishing start-up scene.I went and looked at a bunch of co-working spaces when I first got to Sydney, and they were all packed with people trying to start something and network their way to success.But most people still rely on the main American brands and apps, at least as far as I can see.Atlassian, the software company, is Australian and quite celebrated here.And Gumtree, which is Australias Craigslist for secondhand sales, is really quite good and useful.No offense to Craig Newmark (whom I know from covering tech ages ago) and his Craigslist, but theres a lot to be learned from how Gumtree works on mobile and integrates messaging across platforms.Amazon is coming to Australia and bringing its e-commerce services soon.Are Australians excited?Reaction is pretty mixed.Americans living in Australia seem to be thrilled, especially those (like me) who got very used to relying on Amazon for almost everything in the United States.Some Australians, including small-business owners who will sell through Amazon, are also excited.But mostly, I would say, Australians are curious, and a bit anxious about Amazon.I just wrote a big story about Amazon and the book and bookstore industry here, which is strong and protected, and heavily resistant to outsiders.And the indie bookstore crowd isnt alone in that.After all, this is a country that pushed Borders into bankruptcy, and where Starbucks has really struggled.Malls and small-town Main Streets are still crowded all over Australia, which feels like a throwback to me as an American, and online shopping is not as common as it is in the United States.Just the other day, I interviewed a young woman in a bookstore she was in her 20s who told me she was not willing to pay for something online with a credit card.I was stunned.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.But to some degree this may simply be a product of unfamiliarity.Once Amazon is here, and if it can really undercut some of the very high prices that Australians are stuck with, I imagine there will be a lot of converts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Beyond your job, what tech product do you love using in your daily life right now?I recently bought (via Amazon, which shipped them here from the United States) a set of Bluetooth Jabra headphones, which were recommended by Wirecutter.And I love them.I cant believe how liberating it feels to not have a cord flopping around.What do you and your family do with it, and what could be better about it?I use the headphones for music (of course) and for phone calls, but last night I called my wife walking back from dinner in Melbourne and I discovered that the microphone really doesnt work well with a bit of wind.I dont know how that could be fixed, but finding a way to ensure good audio for conversation would be one obvious improvement.And as long as were talking audio: Hey, Sonos, how about adding some Bluetooth connectivity for those of us with unreliable Wi-Fi?What is your favorite local Australian app or website and why?Gumtree is my favorite.Ive used it to buy a grill, a gas heater for winter and a bunch of other things.The selection is wide ranging; you can easily filter by neighborhood and distance.Its great, especially for someone like me who moves a lot and arrived here with nothing but a few suitcases full of clothes.
Cisco and Google Find Mutual Interest in Cloud Computing:::::Cisco has also faced stiffening competition from rivals like the software maker VMware, which announced a partnership with Amazon last year.Cisco and Google executives vowed to offer something different.They said companies have been struggling with the fact that they need separate tools to manage software on their own premises and those running in the cloud, a situation that sometimes causes security problems.By combining Google programming technology and Cisco networking and security software, they said, tech managers can create and manage software that can run securely in or outside their companies data centers.The idea, said Urs Hlzle, Googles senior vice president for technical infrastructure, is to close those security gaps.Cloud computing has been roiling the strategies of older tech companies for much of the past decade.The concept, besides letting customers sidestep the costs of buying hardware and software, can let companies deploy computing resources more quickly and flexibly.Amazon Web Services pioneered the concept.Synergy Research Group, a market research firm, said in July that A.W.S.accounted for 34 percent of the roughly $11 billion spent on such cloud services in the second quarter, compared with 11 percent for Microsoft, 8 percent for IBM and 5 percent for Google.Amazon and Microsoft are expected to highlight progress in their cloud businesses when they report quarterly earnings on Thursday.Google has moved aggressively to catch up.In late 2015, the company gave the job of running its cloud business to Diane Greene, a widely respected Silicon Valley entrepreneur who helped make VMwares technology a mainstay at many corporations.She made a series of organizational changes, recruited new talent and introduced new technology features.In one important move, Google in September 2016 bought the start-up Apigee Corporation for $625 million, adding capabilities to help customers connect their operations with online services operated by others.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.More mature technology companies have taken different tacks to try to hold on to customers.Some, like IBM and Oracle, offer their own cloud services.Others, like Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell Technologies, have shied away from engaging in a spending war in data centers against deep-pocketed internet giants.Advertisement Continue reading the main story So has Cisco.The company, based in San Jose, Calif., promoted a concept called intercloud that amounted to coordinating a federation of cloud services operated by partners.But Cisco dropped that approach last year, choosing instead to help customers manage hybrid cloud arrangements industry parlance for using a blend of operations in a companys own data centers and those operated by a growing number of cloud services.We think we are one of the few companies that can navigate this multi-cloud world, said David Goeckeler, executive vice president and general manager of Ciscos networking and security business.The company has broadly signaled plans to rely more on software and services than on sales of networking hardware, aided frequently by acquisitions.On Monday, for example, Cisco said it would pay $1.9 billion for BroadSoft, which sells online communications services.Other companies also have embraced the hybrid cloud concept.Microsoft, for example, has longtime ties with corporate software buyers and has come up with ways to run new cloud applications in its data centers or on customers premises, said Al Gillen, an analyst at the research firm IDC.We see other vendors doing things to compete since what we have is so strong and so unique, said Julia White, a corporate vice president with Microsofts Azure cloud business.VMware, a subsidiary of Dell, was first known for software technology called virtualization that allows more efficient use of servers but now competes with Cisco with networking software.Russ Currie, a vice president of enterprise strategy at the network monitoring specialist NetScout Systems, said VMware was effectively using its cloud alliance with A.W.S.to court customers.Pat Gelsinger, VMwares chief executive, called the announcement from Google and Cisco a validation of his own companys vision.Cisco also cooperates in various ways with A.W.S.and Microsoft in cloud computing.But Mr. Goeckeler said that the Google relationship was particularly potent because of the technological specialties of each company.We are both users of each others products, said Mr. Hlzle of Google.But in this case, this is about working together to give their customers the technology they want, he said.
Square, the Twitter Boss’s Other Company, Could Pass It in Value:::::Both of Mr. Dorseys children, as he is known to refer to the companies, bear the imprint of their creator and his careful, trimmed-down aesthetic.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Mr. Dorseys eye for simple solutions has not been enough to turn around Twitter since he returned in 2015 to lead the company he helped found in 2006.He has failed to rein in the use and abuse of the service by trolls and political actors, and he has not found a convincing way to make money despite its ardent user base.At Square, Mr. Dorsey has led one of Silicon Valleys more understated success stories, built from the little plastic white square that allowed small businesses to accept credit card payments via their iPhones.Square has grown into a much broader financial services company, despite some hiccups, like a much-heralded partnership with Starbucks that flamed out.Although Twitters overall revenue shrank 5 percent in the second quarter from the year before, expanding the companys losses, at Square, revenue grew 26 percent, moving the company closer to profitability.The divergent fate of Mr. Dorseys two companies can be understood simply as a matter of timing and control.When he began his second stint as Twitters chief executive in 2015, the company was already struggling and had a series of internal problems that were hard to change, including executive turnover and competing strategic visions.At Square, on the other hand, Mr. Dorsey was able to build the whole company from the ground up, with knowledge from Twitter of how things can go wrong.Square wasnt Jacks first rodeo, said Randy Reddig, who was on the founding team at Square in 2009.It was obvious early on at the company that he took lessons learned from his time at Twitter and applied them at Square.Mr. Reddig said that Mr. Dorseys education from Twitters fractious early years was particularly apparent in the control that Mr. Dorsey kept over hiring and compensation decisions at Square, with a focus on creating a loyal team.Through Twitter and Square, Mr. Dorsey declined to comment for this article.Mr. Dorseys success at Square and his trouble at Twitter also tell a broader story about Silicon Valley, where the boring, back-end businesses often end up generating more money than the flashy social networks and consumer services that capture the publics eye.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Dorsey trained Squares sights on a mostly invisible business electronic payments that has momentum as more and more commerce moves online.Photo Capgemini recently estimated that electronic payments should grow 10.9 percent a year between 2015 and 2020.It is no coincidence that the most successful American financial start-up of the last decade, aside from Square, is Stripe, which helps online businesses take payments.Beyond just payments, though, Square has taken aim at the much larger goal of providing a tech-savvy alternative to the big banks, expanding out from payments to lending and online deposits.This summer, Square applied for a bank charter in Utah, one of just three so-called fintech firms to take such a bold step (the others are Social Finance and Varo).Square is most visibly positioned to use a bank license with its business customers, but the company has also been building more banklike services for consumers, most notably with its app Square Cash.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Square Cash is often described as a competitor and imitator of Venmo, the popular app owned by PayPal that makes it possible for friends to send one another payments by smartphone.In recent months, though, Square Cash has quietly bypassed Venmo to become the most frequently downloaded financial app of any kind on both Apple and Android phones, according to Apptopia.At various points over the past week, Square Cash was ahead of Venmo and Twitter on the charts of the most downloaded iPhone apps.The big banks had aimed to challenge Venmo with their own service, Zelle, but that has not posed a credible challenge to either Venmo or Square Cash so far, the rankings show.Mr. Dorsey and his team made several early design choices with Square Cash that helped make it different from Venmo.As would be expected from Mr. Dorsey, Squares app has a clean, green interface, compared with Venmos busy blue dashboard.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Square also made an apparently boring technical decision, to use the debit card networks rather than bank transfers, to move money around.That has made it easier for Square Cash to put money instantly into the bank accounts of its users, and to collect a fee for the service.These differences appear to have made Square Cash more popular with lower-income customers who more often need instant access to their money and who dont have as wide a variety of credit cards and other financial options.We are reaching an audience that may not have a bank account or may not have a full suite of services from a bank, Mr. Dorsey told analysts last quarter.Photo The shift in people using Square Cash as something more like a bank account has been an important one for Squares bottom line.While Square and PayPal generally dont make money when customers send money to one another, they can take a cut when customers start using the service to make payments at stores.This all looks like a similar playbook to the one Square used with its original credit card dongle, starting with a simple service for an underserved audience and then building from there.Keith Rabois, who was the chief operating officer at Square until 2013, said that the Cash app reflects Mr. Dorseys ability to make deceptively simple products that answer a complicated need.Even though the revenue from Cash is small compared with the money that Square pulls in from businesses, Mr. Rabois said that it may be the most important thing Square is working on.During Mr. Raboiss tenure at Square, the future did not always look so bright.The companys first attempt at a consumer application, Square Wallet, never took off and was discontinued, bringing down the Starbucks partnership with it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Many analysts also expected that Square would have to reduce the price it charged businesses to process credit card transactions as it began working with larger businesses that had more options.Over time, though, Square has been able to keep its prices stable by offering its business customers other services, such as payroll and scheduling.A KeyBanc analyst recently polled 20 businesses that use Square and found that most of them had been offered lower card transaction fees by other companies but passed them up because of the add-ons that Square offers.One of the most profitable such services is Square Capital, which offers small loans to businesses.The revenue from these loans has been increasing faster than the overall growth of the company and has Square looking more like a bank every day.These days, one of the biggest concerns that analysts voice about Square is the time that Mr. Dorsey has to spend on Twitter, with all its problems.During a talk at Silicon Valleys Computer History Museum in August, Mr. Dorsey said he thought he had proved that he didnt need to make a choice between the two.They both have different needs and are in different phases, he said.Focusing on one thing doesnt mean you completely lose sight of something else.
You’ll Wear What They Tell You to Wear:::::Advertisement The Way We Shop Now Youll Wear What They Tell You to Wear Subscription clothing services should make you feel great.Shouldnt they?The authors Emily Gould and Rumaan Alam investigate.Image Credit Ciara Phelan As so many emotional journeys do, this one began with me expressing disgust on Twitter.In this instance, I was angry about the proliferation of lifestyle-touting subscription clothing services.Id recently seen ads for Bombfell on the subway (If shopping isnt your bag, youre going to love our box) and hit a personal tipping point.Clothing delivery services seem somehow dystopian, and although I was freaked out by them, I didnt fully understand why.Twitter people rushed to fill me in, as Id hoped they would.Clothing subscriptions provide a utilitarian uniform for cubicle-bound automatons, people said.They enforce a kind of fascistic conformity, like Mao suits but more cheaply made and less chic.They infantilize us in the same way that meal kit delivery services do: by replacing labor done by someone who might care how were fed or what were wearing (say, a loving parent) with labor done by workers at the bottom rung of a start-up, or even maybe by an algorithm designed to take key words and turn them into outfits.It sounded so much worse than Id even imagined, and of course this made me want to find out more.So Rumaan Alam and I decided to make ourselves his n hers guinea pigs in a harrowing experiment: Together, we would try out the experience of several of the most popular subscription services.We would take notes on our experiences and compare them.In doing so, we would learn a truth.Are clothing subscriptions the Soylent of fashion or are they maybe just a fun and convenient new way to shop?The deal: Seven days to return before you get charged; average price, $89 an article.RUMAAN: Newfangled clothing subscription services are at heart good old-fashioned businesses, in that they make so many promises that its impossible to keep them all.If you have someone at home all day or your UPS driver knows where to hide boxes behind your garage, the promise is convenience.If you live far from any stores or simply dont have time to shop, the promise is access.If you feel overwhelmed by shopping, the promise is attention.If you feel underwhelmed by shopping, the promise is novelty.If you dont care about fashion, theyll care for you; if you do care about fashion, theyll be your clothes buddy.Like so many entities that pledge to disrupt, the subscription service model exchanges one set of hassles for another, more modern, set of hassles.Spend time with the computer instead of a sales clerk.Visit the post office instead of your local shop.My first subscription was to Bombfell, the ubiquitous Instagram advertiser that sounds like a Roger Moore-era Bond film.The enrollment process emphasizes the user over the clothing; you describe your body type, your general style, and indicate anything you know you have no interest in, like boot-cut jeans or graphic tees.(Check, and check.)I am someone who is interested in fashion, which doesnt put me outside Bombfells target demographic, because what the company sells is something Im interested in too: ease.I appreciate that the delivery was fast and the customer service attentive.The pricing was not an issue because you pay only if you keep the clothes Bombfell sends you and I returned everything.In my enrollment, I told Bombfell that I was simply too busy to shop, that I had a modern sense of style.They sent me a long sleeve tee, a chambray shirt, a pair of brown pants and a pair of faded black jeans, all perfectly serviceable.This was more like the clothing a mother might choose for an adult son, rather than what I expect from a stylist, even if thats just a term of art for a customer service representative.Especially galling, I thought, was the long sleeve tee, which Bombfell assured me was a design that was theirs alone.Exclusivity is meant to be alluring, but its hard not to reason that per some arrangement, every customer, no matter his style or needs, is going to be sent this particular garment.Part of this sites appeal is, I think, its prices, but I refuse to pretend that $68 is a fair price for a cotton tee.The deal: Rent as many totes as you like and return when youre done or use their purchase service .EMILY: I started with Le Tote because I get served its Instagram ads most often, and because one Twitter dissenter had mentioned finding it useful when starting a new job.It also seemed to be the cheapest and most flexible of all the services; you can wear the clothes for as long as you want and then send them back, which spurs the shipment of a new box, purportedly styled just for you.All the options it showed for outfits you would potentially wear seemed irretrievably wack to me, but Le Tote does allow you to choose whats in your shipment from a set of options, to which it adds a few fun extras.My first Tote contained a striped shirt, a faux suede moto jacket, a pair of leggings with Nike written up the side, and (fun!)a vending-machine-quality ring and a floral scarf.The whole thing cost $147, if I wanted to buy it all, which I did not; $147 seemed expensive, considering the plastic fast-fashion quality of the clothes in it.I did end up keeping the leggings with Nike written up the side because they seemed as if they wouldnt fall off my butt during yoga if I ever go to yoga again.You win this one, Le Tote.But not any other ones, because I canceled after that shipment.I was left with one burning question.Is Le Tote a play on words?A litotes is a figure of speech that uses deliberately exaggerated understatement to make a point, like not bad or its not my first rodeo.Like Le Tote clothes arent the best Ive ever worn.Im guessing its not a play on words, actually.The deal: Youre sent five things, you try them, return what you dont like.Bonus fun: You get 25 percent off if you buy all five.RUMAAN: Stitch Fix is in the business of style more than convenience.You can hear it in the very name, the notion that your wardrobe is something that can be fixed, and that will in turn fix your life.The style questionnaire is more rigorous than Bombfells, more granular, and I could imagine my fellow consumers answering those queries mindful of what the right articles of clothing might do for them.Thats part of fashions promise, that a girlfriend or boyfriend or a promotion are just one tie or sweater or pair of shoes away.Bombfell emphasizes its personal touch, showing you a head shot of the stylist whos assisting you.Stitch Fix doesnt work quite the same way; youre welcome to send a note to your stylist, but to me it felt like sending a note to an algorithm.Anyway, I requested some blazers.I was sent two, both perfectly serviceable if not quite what I want in a blazer.The trade-off for the convenience of trying something on at home is that you dont have access to much variety.Presumably, over time, your stylist (or the algorithm) will learn to anticipate your tastes, the way were told online advertising works.Of course, when Im online, I find I see mostly advertisements for things Ive already bought.I can see how the subscription model would appeal to the entrepreneurs who adapted it in this manner .Being sent a box feels like receiving a present, and while paying for whats inside may not be top of mind, of course, the company has your credit card on file.Its easy enough to return what you dont want, but its easier still to keep what you dont want.My husband tried on one of the blazers and declared that he wanted it.It was only when I pointed out that it was $200 that he noticed that the shoulder didnt fit quite right, that the cut was not altogether flattering.The deal: You approve your trunk preview, and after it arrives you have five days to return or buy the six to 10 items in a trunk.EMILY: I next tried Trunk Club Women, also based on Twitter recommendation this one from a woman who swore that the apps stylist had heeded her very specific requests and that shed ended up buying several of the items from her first trunk.Unlike Le Tote, Trunk Club is expensive.You also get to have a chat with a person who is definitely not a bot about your style preferences.I actually loved this process so much.Doubters (like Rumaan!)told me, Well, you could have that experience at any department store, especially at Nordstrom, which owns Trunk Club.But the illusory intimacy of digital interaction made me so much more honest with Sophie, the stylist, than I would have ever been with a stranger IRL.Very quickly, she learned about me that I teach undergrad creative writing, that I almost never wear florals or bright colors, that I usually wear boots or sneakers and jeans and a button-front shirt, and that I still have a postpartum gut even though my son is 2.I admitted that I was unlikely to ever wear anything bodycon and described my ideal aspirational aesthetic as rich L.A. lesbian.The results were so shockingly on point that there were two items in my first Trunk preview that I had to delete, not because I didnt like them, but because I already owned them.The experience of trying all these clothes on at home instead of in a Nordstrom dressing room, however, was not actually that luxurious.I found the box big and daunting, and it sat around unopened for days while I waited to have enough time set aside to do a little in-home fashion show for myself.But five days is all you get with Trunk Club, and once its emails started to take on a slightly chiding tone, I worried that the company would charge my credit card for thousands of dollars worth of clothes.So late one afternoon, I opened the box.I made yes, no and maybe piles, and there was a very cozy cashmere/wool blend long sleeve Vince sweater dress in the maybe pile that seemed like the kind of thing that might be worth its $400 price tag.I was in the process of trying it on a second time when disaster struck.I had been standing on my coffee table to look in my apartments only mirror, and without warning the table collapsed underneath me!My first concern, as I assessed the damage, after I determined that I hadnt sustained anything worse than a big, rapidly purpling butt bruise, was that the scrape on my hand had maybe gotten some blood on the dress.It hadnt, but the dress seemed somehow tainted anyway.I ended up sending it back.I also sent back a denim pencil skirt, a Bond-villainess scuba dress and a white silk top that had looked a little bit frumpy even on the lissome teenager who modeled it on the website.I kept a soft cropped sweater and a black velvet Eileen Fisher T-shirt that I wore later that week to a dinner to celebrate my 36th birthday, which seemed appropriate.The deal: For a $60 flat fee, youre sent a couple of new items each month.RUMAAN: Stitch Fix and Bombfell use technology and language to reinvent the low-end and midrange department store experience.FiveFour Club is more like a web version of a boutique with a subscription model thrown in for good measure.Instead of appealing to customers with the siren song of a personal stylist, FiveFour charges a price of admission in exchange for regular deliveries of its own branded clothing.(There is also a web store, membership not required.)The aesthetic here is minimal, sporty and young, so fashion-aware that its hard to envision who the consumer is.While its true we dont all live in ZIP codes with street wear boutiques, the same person who logs onto FiveFour can log on to eBay.In exchange for my $60 membership fee, I was sent a windbreaker and a tee, both in lackluster shades of brown.On a lanky 19-year-old, theyd look stylish.On anyone else, they look like two garments that cost $30 each.Wouldnt I like to be a lanky 19-year-old?Of course.Fashion is about fantasy.Here in reality, FiveFour got my $60 and Ive got these clothes Ill never wear.Those few of us who never read Marie Kondo still have those fashionable mistakes lurking in our closets.Im sort of fond of them, those past selves that never came to be.Ive spent many hours of my life browsing in stores.At 21, I admired clothes I couldnt afford.At 30, I bought them.At 40, I sometimes go simply for the pleasure, of seeing what is new, of learning what counts as beautiful now.So what, if anything, have we learned?One old lesson, at least.Shopping for clothes is time consuming, its tiring, and it can feel like a waste of an autumn afternoon.So you can subscribe to a service that makes your life simpler, although it may come at the expense of expressing who you are.You can also subscribe to the notion that theres still pleasure in some of lifes chores.In the flesh, you can touch a wool jacket or a cashmere sweater as you imagine who you might be if each belonged to

Twitter Plans to Open Ad Data to Users:::::The announcement is part of a major shift in the industry to lift the veil over how its secretive advertising businesses its cash centers work, as lawmakers put more pressure on social media companies about the role their sites played in Russias attempt to influence the election.Twitter, Facebook and Google are scheduled to appear for hearings before the Senate and House Intelligence Committees on Nov. 1.Lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the leading Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, have expressed frustration about Twitter.In late September, he said Twitters response was inadequate when it was asked to provide evidence of Russian-linked advertising and accounts that spread misinformation or were used to favor a presidential candidate.At the time, Twitter said it had discovered about 200 accounts linked to Russian efforts to influence the election.But that figure was significantly less than the number uncovered a month earlier by researchers from the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, the public policy research group in Washington.The researchers tracked 600 Twitter accounts both human and suspected automated bots that they linked to Russian attempts to influence the election.Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said that the companys announcement did not go far enough and that online companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google needed rules that the government could enforce.Last week, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Warner and Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, introduced a bill that would require digital platforms to report who bought political ads on their sites in the same way that TV broadcast stations must maintain databases with those disclosures.The bill was a response to concern that fake accounts linked to Russia on Facebook and other sites were able to fly past monitors on the sites and easily buy thousands of ads promoting racial and other hot-button issues to sow chaos before the election and to influence the result.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I welcome this transparency, Ms. Klobuchar said, but we need a law in place for two major reasons: Not every company will do this, and you need rules for the road.She added that the companies should not be left to police themselves.The announcement from Twitter followed a public relations blitz this month by Facebooks chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, to announce similar voluntary efforts to tighten standards for ad buyers.Lawmakers are still skeptical, saying there are many unanswered questions about whether the social media sites can prevent the mistakes of the 2016 election on their own.The changes also raise new issues for politicians.For one, advertising agencies often consider their digital strategy part of their secret sauce when trying to sell their services to politicians and campaign strategists.Shining a light on the types of ads, the amount spent on them and how often they change could give valuable information to competing candidates.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is also unclear whether Twitter will be able to keep up with campaigns ever-changing digital targeting, budgets and goals, and the company did not mention how it plans to tackle large-scale misinformation spread by bots.Many of those automated accounts, along with Twitter users with suspected ties to the Russian government, bombarded the platform without buying advertising.Researchers at the cybersecurity firm FireEye discovered that hundreds or thousands of fake accounts regularly sent out messages criticizing Hillary Clinton sometimes with identical tweets dispatched seconds apart.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said transparency in advertising alone is not a solution to the deployment of bots that amplify fake or misleading content or to the successful efforts of online trolls to promote divisive messages.Twitter said it would try to tighten standards for issues-based ads that wouldnt fall under its new electioneering rules, such as an environmental groups push for clean-air policies or an energy companys promotion of environmental deregulation.But the company admitted that the industry had not agreed on definitions for issues ads.We will work with our peer companies, other industry leaders, policymakers and ad partners to clearly define them quickly and integrate them into the new approach mentioned above, Twitter said in its blog post.
Hulu Chief Leaves to Lead Sony’s TV Division:::::Photo The chief executive of the streaming service Hulu, Mike Hopkins, is leaving to become chairman of Sony Pictures Television, Hulu said on Tuesday.Randy Freer, a member of the Hulu board, will succeed him.Mr. Hopkins, who has been Hulus chief executive for the past four years, will be moving into the role at Sony that Steve Mosko vacated more than a year ago.Mr.Freer, the Fox Networks Groups chief operating officer and previously a co-president at Fox Sports, will take over the Hulu job on Monday.Hulu got a big boost last month when its The Handmaids Tale became the first show from a streaming service to win the Emmy Award for best drama.The change at the top also comes as Hulus parent companies including Comcast, Disney, Time Warner and 21st Century Fox are making a more concerted effort to sell Hulu the back libraries of their shows, rather than making similar deals with Netflix.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Still, the services performance remains a bit of a mystery.It last disclosed its total number of subscribers 17 months ago; at the time, the figure stood at 12 million.It is unclear whether subscriber growth has slowed, or how well its live television service is faring.By comparison, Netflix announced last week that it now has 51 million paying subscribers in the United States.
What to Do When the Cable Goes Out:::::Q.Is there an easy way to tell if the cable television service is out for everybody or just at my own house because of equipment problems?I really hate calling.A.If you have a working internet connection (or access to one on a cellular device or work computer) and an online account from your cable company, you might be able to check specifically about the status of your own equipment.To do that, log into your account on your TV providers site and find the technical support area.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.What you find there will vary depending on your cable company, but many providers have problem-solving tools available to help lighten the load on the phone lines.Spectrum, for example, lets you select the problematic service (like TV or internet) from a menu to see the status of your service and check for notice of a possible problem in your area.Photo If there is no systemwide disruption, you can use the available guides and tools to troubleshoot your cable converter box and other equipment.Spectrum has a nationwide page that customers can use to check on storm-related problems, and Comcast has its own Status Center page for Xfinity cable customers.Many companies have their own mobile apps for account management.too.Even if you do not have an online account to see your home setup, your cable providers site might have live chat, general support tips and a service-disruption map.(While it may seem like just another password to remember, signing up for an account lets you check your bill, pay online, sign up for service alerts, control your DVR or even watch live television on a mobile device depending on what your provider offers.)Your cable companys customer-service account on Twitter can be another good source of news.Websites that monitor the status of communications services may also be useful.Down Detector, Outage Report and Is the Service Down?are a few sites in this category.
Russia’s Favored Outlet Is an Online News Giant. YouTube Helped.:::::As the presidential election heated up in the spring of 2016, RT consistently featured negative stories about Mrs. Clinton, according to United States intelligence officials.That included claims of corruption at her family foundation and ties to Islamic extremism, frequent coverage of emails stolen by Russian operatives from Mrs. Clintons campaign chairman, and accusations that she was in poor physical and mental health.More than half of American adults say they watch YouTube, and younger viewers are moving to YouTube at staggering numbers, said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russias exploitation of social media platforms based in the United States.YouTube is a target-rich environment for any disinformation campaign Russian or otherwise that represents a long-term, next-generation challenge.Much like the Russian-controlled pages on Facebook, RTs YouTube videos comply with YouTubes community guidelines, which cover things like nudity, copyright violations and promoting violence against a group based on race or religion.But not propaganda.YouTube carries a wide variety of news channels that represent an array of viewpoints across the political spectrum, said a spokesman for the company, Chris Dale.Photo RTs reach on YouTube 2.2 million subscribers, just slightly behind CNN stemmed from a long and mutually beneficial relationship between the news channel and the video site, according to current and former RT employees and technology industry analysts.YouTube had the vast audience and global reach that RT needed as it set out to become a worldwide alternative news source with influence and viewers beyond Russias own borders.RT has YouTube channels in a number of foreign languages including Arabic, Spanish, German, French and Chinese.RT management did view YouTube as hugely important to spreading content, said Liz Wahl, a former correspondent in the United States for RT who quit on the air in 2014 over concerns that the network was whitewashing the Russian annexation of Crimea.Traditional television ratings werent important because the aim was to get the messaging out through various digital and social platforms.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Russian channel was among the first news organizations to recognize YouTubes power and developed content intended to perform well on the platform.RT uploads videos frequently, sprinkling in buzzy viral videos of disasters plane crashes, tsunamis, a meteor strike to earn likes and longer watch times, which YouTubes algorithm rewards with better placement among search results and recommendations.The viral videos, which were often borrowed from other sources, help to build up RTs subscribers, and they became part of the Kremlins audience for more political content.People come for the click-bait material, said Bret Schafer, an official at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, the Washington-based public policy research group.And they eventually land on videos that the Kremlin wants them to see.While much of RTs traffic stems from nonpolitical videos, the channels political and foreign affairs content ranks highly in many YouTube searches.Searches on topics on which the Kremlin is typically eager to promote its point of view American intervention in Syria, the Ukrainian civil war or the rise of Germanys far-right AfD party will often turn up an RT video as one of the top results.YouTube also provided RT with the kind of perks it reserved for big publishers, including custom backgrounds for its channel in the early days and a check mark that designated RT as a verified news source.Until recently, RT was also among a select group of news organizations included in Googles preferred news lineup, granting them access to guaranteed revenue from premium advertisers.Those advertisers, in effect, subsidized Russias international propaganda arm.Google dropped RT from the preferred lineup last month.Andrea Faville, a Google spokeswoman, said the decision was unrelated to the congressional inquiry, and that RT had been dropped as part of a standard algorithmic update.But Google also noted that it was not placing any other limits on RT: The channel could still sell regular ads on its videos and the status downgrade only applied in the United States.Google later clarified that RT was downgraded in other markets, but it would not say which ones.Kirill Karnovich-Valua, RTs deputy editor in chief, said the organization had not been informed of Googles decision and it was puzzled about why it was dropped despite being one of the most watched YouTube channels in the world.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.This speaks to the unprecedented political pressure increasingly applied to all RT partners and relationships in a concerted effort to push our channel out of the U.S. market entirely, and by any means possible, Mr. Karnovich-Valua wrote in an email.Last month, RT said the Justice Department had demanded that a private company affiliated with RT America register as a foreign agent a term that dates back to a law originally enacted in 1938 to deter Nazi propaganda.On Thursday, after the deadline set by American officials had passed, an RT spokeswoman said that the news organization was doing everything possible for RT to avoid having to register.Registration could impose voluminous disclosure requirements on RT, a particular burden for a media organization producing frequent content.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Russias president, Vladimir V. Putin, responded in more forceful terms: Should the United States impose restrictions on Russian media, Mr. Putin said last week, Russian would act symmetrically and quite swiftly.RTs use of other technology platforms is also under investigation.Last month, officials at Twitter told a Senate Intelligence Committee that three RT accounts targeting an American audience with a combined following of roughly six million users had spent $274,100 to promote tweets in 2016.But none of RTs social media activities or its presence in cable and satellite TV lineups has delivered the impact of its YouTube channel.RT launched its YouTube page in March 2007, roughly four months after Google paid $1.65 billion for the fledgling video site.At the time, YouTube was better known for pirated content and videos of cute animals than news programming, but RT caught on quickly.The Russian channel recruited talent from within the burgeoning world of YouTube-born media stars, people who had already shown a knack for creating viral or popular video content.One RT contributor, the British blogger Graham Phillips, built a large following on YouTube with videos from Ukraines civil war, many of them critical of Ukraines central government.RT often featured Mr. Phillips and at one point employed him as a part-time freelancer before he was arrested and deported by Ukrainian authorities.His personal YouTube channel has earned more than 60 million views.Photo Another RT contributor, Lori Harfenist, began her career on public-access television in New York City, and eventually moved her self-produced show, The Resident, to YouTube.Ms. Harfenist was one of the platforms first revenue-sharing partners, according to a biography on Ms. Harfenists personal website.Ms. Harfenist was eventually recruited by RT, which began featuring her on segments with titles like America is a Hypocrite.During the presidential campaign, RTs Twitter account promoted a video from her that claimed the existence of an anti-Semitic conspiracy involving Hillary Clinton, Google and the Illuminati.(She later claimed the segment was meant as satire.)Ms. Harfenist did not respond to emails and Facebook messages seeking comment.Today, RT ranks among the top news channels on YouTube for views, subscribers and engagement such as comments or likes.The most-watched clips on RT are not political or anti-establishment videos, they are snackable content.A clip of a homeless man with a gifted voice for radio is the most popular video on RT, viewed 40 million times since it was uploaded six years ago.Mr. Karnovich-Valua said RTs primary aim is to provide an alternative point of view on current events so its audience can get a full picture of world events.Where relevant, RT does present a Russian perspective on current events, but we dont promote the Russian point of view, we explain it alongside with presenting others, he said.Some lawmakers, including Mr. Warner, have called for tighter regulation and disclosure requirements for political advertising on social media platforms.Yet RTs embrace of YouTube shows how difficult it could be to limit foreign influence.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its not a secret.Its not rocket science, but theyre just doing it much better, said Christoph Burseg, who runs VeeScore.com, an analytics and strategic consultancy that tracks YouTube use.Unless YouTube decides to manually step in, they will continue to be very present.RT isnt doing anything wrong, theyre just riding the algorithms.
Amazon Counts Its Suitors: 238 Want to Be Home for 2nd Headquarters:::::Photo SEATTLE Amazon said on Monday it got a total of 238 proposals from cities and regions across North America that want to be the home of its proposed second headquarters.The bids, received by last Thursdays deadline, came from so many places across the continent that its perhaps simpler to note the ones that didnt fall over themselves to woo Amazon.The company did not provide a list, but a color-coded map posted on its website revealed the applicants came from all but seven American states North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Vermont, Arkansas and Hawaii.In Canada, Yukon Territory and the provinces of Saskatchewan and New Brunswick were among those that said no thanks.In Mexico, on the other hand, Amazons map shows just three applications, from the states of Chihuahua, Hidalgo and Quertaro.Photo In all, Amazon said the proposals came from 54 states, provinces, districts and territories (including Puerto Rico).The company has said it will announce its decision sometime next year.
Reading This While Walking? In Honolulu, It Could Cost You:::::A lot of people do it; they know its risky and do it anyway.They convince themselves that this text is important, he said.Its something we need to be aware of.There is a dearth of data directly linking distracted walking to pedestrian injuries and deaths, but it seems to be a global problem, too.Preliminary studies give a hint to unsafe behavior, said Dr. Etienne Krug, director of the Department for Management of Noncommunicable Diseases, Disability, Violence and Injury Prevention at the World Health Organization.Photo People who text and walk, for example, are nearly four times as likely to engage in at least one dangerous action, like jaywalking or not looking both ways, and take 18 percent more time to cross a street than undistracted pedestrians.Solutions, Dr. Krug said, are hard to legislate and even harder to enforce.A number of other cities have come up with creative ways to help protect so-called cellphone zombies, who talk, text, listen to music, check their email and even snap selfies.Initiatives include low-tech efforts, like edgy signs in Hayward, Calif. (Heads Up!Cross the Street.Then Update Facebook.)and no-selfie zones in Mumbai, and specially designed traffic lights in Europe and several pieces of legislation in reaction to Honolulus new law.Last month, the Board of Supervisors in San Mateo County, Calif., unanimously passed a resolution prohibiting pedestrians use of cellphones while crossing streets.Its not enforceable, as state law governs such issues, but David Canepa, who introduced the measure, said it was an important springboard; the resolution is expected to go to the California Legislature for statewide consideration in January.There is chaos in the crosswalks, said Mr. Canepa, who admits to a few close calls with distracted driving and walking himself.I know its an issue.Ive lived it.My cellphone is my life.As children, he said, we are taught to look both ways when crossing a street, but you cant look both ways when youre looking down and texting.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Critics are concerned about personal freedom and slow to adjust to new ideas, Mr. Canepa said.But at the end of the day, people understand the value of public safety, he added.This legislation is practical and is common sense.It will save lives.At least 10 states have debated similar legislation dealing with distracted pedestrians or bicyclists; none of it has passed, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Legislation is pending in two states, the group said, and in September, New York passed a law that directs New York City to study its efforts to educate the public on the dangers of distracted walking.Photo Municipal laws are not tracked, but Rexburg, Idaho, may have been among the first to adopt a citywide ban, in 2011.The city recorded five pedestrian deaths in a short period in a concentrated area.It was a high toll, given the citys size: about 35,000 residents.It was a shock to our system, said Stephen Zollinger, Rexburgs city attorney.Distracted walking was suspected.Along with other safety measures, Rexburg barred pedestrians from using hand-held devices except while talking while crossing public streets, he said, and weve not had a pedestrian fatality since.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Bodegraven, a small town near Amsterdam, tried a different approach.This year, it embedded LED-illuminated strips in the crosswalk at a busy intersection right in the line of sight of people staring at their phones.When the traffic lights turn red or green, so do the lights at ground level, alerting pedestrians when its safe to cross.The pilot program aims to anticipate trends, not reverse them, said Dolf Roodenburg, the project leader and a traffic engineer in the Netherlands.If its successful, the town hopes to install the lights at more intersections and on bike paths, and offer them to other cities.In Augsburg, Germany, similar lights were installed last year after a teenager using her smartphone was struck and seriously injured by a tram when she walked onto the tracks.There are, of course, contrary points of view on the effectiveness of legislating pedestrian behavior.Janette Sadik-Khan, a former commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation and now transportation principal at Bloomberg Associates, which advises mayors around the world, said laws against texting and walking were not the answer.They have no basis in any research, are poorly conceived and distract from the road design and driver behavior issues that are responsible for most crashes, she said.Photo Its an easy way out.Engineering is a lot more difficult, but a lot more efficient, Ms. Sadik-Khan said.Traffic safety is very serious business in government, based in sound analysis.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She and others recommended focusing on proven strategies like vehicle speed reduction, which is one of the most effective ways to reduce deaths, as survival rates are higher in low-speed collisions.Vehicle design can also help.In some countries, cars are designed to be more forgiving to pedestrians, said Deborah A. P. Hersman, president and chief executive of the National Safety Council.Making bumpers softer and modifying the front ends of vehicles can reduce the severity of a pedestrian impact, but only 44 countries, mostly in Europe, require manufacturers to apply these protections, according to the W.H.O.The United States is not among them.Rochelle Sobel, founder of the Association for Safe International Road Travel, a nonprofit group, said it was important for Americans traveling abroad to learn the local road culture.In the Dominican Republic, pedestrians do not have the right of way, and in some countries, drivers routinely ignore traffic regulations.For example, they may fail to stop at intersections or red lights, Ms. Sobel said.In many low- and middle-income countries, where about 90 percent of the worlds road-traffic deaths occur, according to the W.H.O., pedestrians often share poorly maintained roads with animals, carts, cars, buses and trucks.Those roads are already high-risk environments not designed for walking, Ms. Sobel said.Ms. Hersman, who previously served as chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said concerns about government overreach often lessened with time.Laws requiring seatbelt use or restricting smoking initially met resistance but now are widely accepted.Its important to have an open mind, she said.Society can move forward.Mr. Massey of Synaxis said it would take some convincing for people to see value in laws to combat distracted walking.I agree in principle begrudgingly, he said.Its a bit Big Brotherish.We dont like that in this country.European efforts are more realistic, Mr. Massey added.I think the lights are brilliant, he said.It reflects an understanding of human nature: People are going to do it anyway, so lets make it safer.

B Capital Hires Howard L. Morgan as Its New Chairman:::::Photo LONDON During his long career, Howard L. Morgan has been an early executive at Renaissance Technologies, the giant hedge fund, and a co-founder of First Round Capital, the venture capital firm.His next role: joining the venture capital fund co-led by Eduardo Saverin, one of the co-founders of Facebook.Mr. Saverins venture capital firm, B Capital Group, announced on Monday that it had hired Mr. Morgan as its chairman.It also announced other personnel moves, including the naming of Joe Davis, the chairman of the Boston Consulting Groups North American operations, as vice chairman; the hiring of Allen Duan as an operating partner; and the hiring of Rohit Bhagat as a senior adviser.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The addition of Mr. Morgan and the other executives is meant to bolster B Capital, which looks to invest in start-ups around the world.The firm was created two years ago by Mr. Saverin, who is now based in Singapore, and Raj Ganguly, who is based on the West Coast.It also has a strategic partnership with the Boston Consulting Group, which can both help find potential investments and recommend the firm to start-ups in search of capital.
With Literary Support, Xerox Asserts Its Modern Relevance:::::They had a cultural footprint as a brand that was pretty big and vivid, said Kevin ONeill, an advertising professor at Syracuse University.But the company has had to reinvent itself as other tech companies have caught up.Xerox was looking for a way to reinforce its longtime role as an essential part of office life while producing something culturally significant.Photo The book, which will also be handed out in printed form to customers and clients, was the perfect tool for bridging the goals, said Toni Clayton-Hine, the companys chief marketing officer.It was a logical connection to what you knew of Xerox so far, she said.The company still provides copiers, printers and scanners, but it has branched out into cloud computing and translation software as well.We wanted to show how Xerox is relevant to the workplace today.Xerox gave the writers little guidance, Ms. Clayton-Hine said.We took a leap of faith, she said.In many respects, we werent sure what we were going to get.What we got back was really fantastic.The works include the humorous (Mr. Shteyngart recalls his first job, advertising piano lessons on a sandwich board in Union Square, surrounded by drug dealers) and the musical (Ms. Mann and Mr. Coulton muse on working from home: Tried to Skype with the background clutter / Printer, mug and comb).In his poem, Mr. Collins, a former national poet laureate, remembers his fathers downtown Manhattan office, calling it an Avalon of supplies with an oasis of the water cooler.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The 92nd Street Y, which hosts speakers, concerts and other events on the Upper East Side, recruited the artists.The writing was shepherded by Bernard Schwartz, director of the Ys Unterberg Poetry Center.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There is a unique thrill to coming to work and having in ones inbox new work from artists such as these, Mr. Schwartz said.Corporations have long sponsored cultural institutions and events, but the Xerox project continues a more recent trend toward commissioning art.Photo In 2014, the fast-food chain Chipotle announced that top writers, including Toni Morrison and George Saunders, would produce work for its cups and bags.That project was produced by the novelist Jonathan Safran Foer, whose work also appears in the Xerox book.Classic literature has occasionally provided marketing opportunities as well.A 2012 Audi commercial, for example, adopted a Moby Dick theme to appeal to literary types.Leaning on literature as a marketing tool shows that companies are eager to attract the influentials, Mr. ONeill said.Commissioning works of art is far more significant than simply slapping a corporate name on someone elses event, he said.A key thing with managing a corporate reputation is not what you say, but what you do, said Mr. ONeill, whose fiction has appeared in The New Yorker.Im always much more impressed when I see a corporation doing something like this.Nostalgia was one of the reasons Mr. Shteyngart was drawn to the project.I always loved office equipment, even though I could never get it to work right, said Mr. Shteyngart, who used a voice-activated Xerox printer while writing his essay.But, he added, the Ys involvement in the anthology was crucial to his participation.I probably would have been a little more skeptical if it had been the corporation that approached me rather than the Y, he said.The corporate ties didnt bother Ms. Oates, who said she viewed the book as just another anthology.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I like to write, said Ms. Oates, a Princeton University professor, whose short story explores an awkward relationship between teacher and student.The opportunity to write about work was inviting.
Tech Giants Are Paying Huge Salaries for Scarce A.I. Talent:::::The cutting edge of artificial intelligence research is based on a set of mathematical techniques called deep neural networks.These networks are mathematical algorithms that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing data.By looking for patterns in millions of dog photos, for example, a neural network can learn to recognize a dog.This mathematical idea dates back to the 1950s, but it remained on the fringes of academia and industry until about five years ago.By 2013, Google, Facebook and a few other companies started to recruit the relatively few researchers who specialized in these techniques.Neural networks now help recognize faces in photos posted to Facebook, identify commands spoken into living-room digital assistants like the Amazon Echo and instantly translate foreign languages on Microsofts Skype phone service.Using the same mathematical techniques, researchers are improving self-driving cars and developing hospital services that can identify illness and disease in medical scans, digital assistants that can not only recognize spoken words but understand them, automated stock-trading systems and robots that pick up objects theyve never seen before.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.With so few A.I.specialists available, big tech companies are also hiring the best and brightest of academia.In the process, they are limiting the number of professors who can teach the technology.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Uber hired 40 people from Carnegie Mellons groundbreaking A.I.program in 2015 to work on its self-driving-car project.Over the last several years, four of the best-known A.I.researchers in academia have left or taken leave from their professorships at Stanford University.At the University of Washington, six of 20 artificial intelligence professors are now on leave or partial leave and working for outside companies.There is a giant sucking sound of academics going into industry, said Oren Etzioni, who is on leave from his position as a professor at the University of Washington to oversee the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.Some professors are finding a way to compromise.Luke Zettlemoyer of the University of Washington turned down a position at a Google-run Seattle laboratory that he said would have paid him more than three times his current salary (about $180,000, according to public records).Instead, he chose a post at the Allen Institute that allowed him to continue teaching.Photo There are plenty of faculty that do this, splitting their time in various percentages between industry and academia, Mr. Zettlemoyer said.The salaries are so much higher in industry, people only do this because they really care about being an academian.To bring in new A.I.engineers, companies like Google and Facebook are running classes that aim to teach deep learning and related techniques to existing employees.And nonprofits like Fast.ai and companies like Deeplearning.ai, founded by a former Stanford professor who helped create the Google Brain lab, offer online courses.The basic concepts of deep learning are not hard to grasp, requiring little more than high-school-level math.But real expertise requires more significant math and an intuitive talent that some call a dark art.Specific knowledge is needed for fields like self-driving cars, robotics and health care.In order to keep pace, smaller companies are looking for talent in unusual places.Some are hiring physicists and astronomers who have the necessary math skills.Other start-ups from the United States are looking for workers in Asia, Eastern Europe and other locations where wages are lower.I cant compete with Google, and I dont want to, said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and a co-founder of Skymind, a start-up in San Francisco that has hired engineers in eight countries.So I offer very attractive salaries in countries that undervalue engineering talent.But the industrys giants are doing much the same.Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others have opened A.I.labs in Toronto and Montreal, where much of this research outside the United States is being done.Google also is hiring in China, where Microsoft has long had a strong presence.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Not surprisingly, many think the talent shortage wont be alleviated for years.Of course demand outweighs supply.And things are not getting better any time soon, Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal and a prominent A.I.researcher, said.It takes many years to train a Ph.D.
A Showdown Brews Between Amazon and Alibaba, Far From Home:::::Both are spending billions of dollars on Asia particularly Southeast Asia and India as they look for a place that could repeat Chinas explosive transformation into the worlds biggest online shopping market.Photo Amazon has committed $5 billion to India, where it lures customers to sign up for its Prime service, which includes Western movies and television shows, for a small fraction of the $99 annual membership price in the United States.Alibaba has invested roughly $500 million for stakes in both Paytm Indias largest mobile payments platform and its e-commerce affiliate, Paytm Mall.Alibabas bigger bet is in Southeast Asia.It has spent more than $2 billion to take control of Lazada, a five-year-old online shopping company based in Singapore and doing business in six countries.Last year, Lazada bought RedMart, the online retail grocery.The promise is there, as the regions young middle class grows and goes online.Southeast Asias e-commerce sales could total $88 billion by 2025, according to projections from Google and Temasek Holdings, the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund.Volume was less than one-tenth that in 2015.Over about the same period, Indias market could increase six times to a similar amount, Bain & Company, a consulting firm, projects.Alibaba and Amazon are seeking consumers like Janice Lee Fang, a Singaporean who decided she needed to buy a robot to amuse a 6-year-old daughter home sick from school.Through Amazons Prime Now service, introduced in Singapore in July, she bought a Sphero SPRK Plus a clear plastic ball that can skitter across the floor with a tap of a smartphone that arrived in less than a day.Photo I was thrilled, said Ms. Fang, who said she also uses Alibabas

people, the region is divided by politics, language and culture.Some places are modern, like Singapore.Other places lack the roads and other infrastructure to get people what they need.Its a mix of urban, semi-urban and rural areas, separated by large distances and in the Philippines and Indonesia by water, said Mike Booker, a partner at the Southeast Asian arm of Bain.Cash on delivery is still prevalent, and other local players are in the fray.The challenges have forced Lazada, Alibabas biggest Southeast Asian operation, to get creative.In Vietnam, local post offices take customer returns and give cash refunds.In Malaysia, customers can collect merchandise from lockers at 7-Eleven stores.And in the Philippines, Lazada uses gas stations as places where merchants can drop off their goods for delivery personnel to pick up.Were in the super, super, super early days, said Inanc Balci, who oversees Lazada operations in the Philippines.Photo Alibabas international arm has seen its latest quarterly sales more than double in a year, in part from Lazadas contribution.Still, Lazada and its RedMart subsidiary remain a tiny, and unprofitable, part of Alibabas empire.Max Bittner, Lazadas chief executive, said its Chinese parent has been willing to spend money to build its delivery capabilities and draw more customers.E-commerce is an economy of scale game, Mr. Bittner said.I dont feel constrained in any way.I can go after this opportunity with the amount of firepower I need.Amazon so far counts Singapore as its only Southeast Asian market, though industry experts widely expect it will expand into other countries.An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment.Until recently, direct competition between Alibaba and Amazon has been rare.Amazon has a modest presence in China.Alibaba sells goods in the United States through its AliExpress platform but has backed away from further expansion efforts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Southeast Asia could offer a test of their vastly different business models on neutral turf.Amazon owns more of the inventory it sells.By contrast, most of Lazadas sales come from outside vendors who use its platform as a digital middleman to reach customers.That approach, which keeps costs low, is similar to what Alibaba does in China.But in China, the companys Taobao platform has been accused of offering counterfeit goods.Alibaba says it is working to fight fakes.Photo Alibaba has a long lead over Amazon and is building up its infrastructure across Southeast Asia.In Indonesia, for example, it took a minority stake in August in another online marketplace, Tokopedia.Experts say Amazon could fight back by offering online Western movies and television programs as it does in the United States, which could increase its appeal with younger customers.Amazon stumbled in Singapore initially when the service proved too popular, forcing it to turn away customers.But since then the two companies have amped up their efforts to deliver more quickly to a growing group of customers.At the RedMart warehouse on a recent visit, workers packed cartons sometimes nine at a time from bins holding piles of cereal boxes and canned fruits and vegetables.For those who offer ways to improve the process, merit awards include movie tickets, vouchers and cash of up to $1,000.Competing in the market is likely to be expensive, thanks to customer price cuts and rebates in addition to expansion costs.Its fabulous, said Uma Parameswar, a Singaporean who works in fine arts management.Over two and a half years of using RedMart, she said, only once did she receive fruit that was less than fresh.The enticements make her even more inclined to shop online.She says RedMart gives her a 5 percent discount on grocery bills plus discounts on using Ubers ride-hailing and other services.Its saved me probably $200 in the last three or four months, she said.Its a fair bit.
How to Stop Waking Up the iPhone:::::Q. I just got a new iPhone and have noticed that every time I pick it up or move it, the screen pops on by itself instead of me turning it on with the switch.Is this a problem with the phone?A.The iPhone 6s and later models include a feature called Raise to Wake that senses when you pick up the device and then automatically flips on the display screen so you do not have to fumble around with the Home or power buttons when you want to check something.If you have just purchased a new iPhone or had not upgraded your hardware in a few years, the sudden activity can seem a little unsettling.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.When you lift the phone and the display wakes up, you land on the iPhones lock screen.You can see your alerts without having to unlock the phone if you have notifications set to show up there.(Some people prefer not to, out of privacy concerns.)Raise to Wake also saves you a step if you need to snap a photo in a hurry because as you lift the phone, you can swipe the screen to the left to quickly jump to the iPhones Camera app.Swiping up from the bottom of the screen summons the iOS Control Center, where you can change the music volume, use the iPhones flashlight, switch on Airplane Mode and adjust other settings without having to unlock the phone and fiddle around in the main Settings app.Photo If you do not want your notifications visible to people nearby or worry your phones battery is taking too much of a hit when the screen pops on each time you move the device, you can turn off Raise to Wake.To do that, unlock your iPhone, tap the Settings app on the Home screen, select Display & Brightness and tap the button near Raise to Wake to disable the feature.
Scanning, Converting and Editing Text on the Go:::::Q.Are there any inexpensive Android apps that let you take a picture of a document and convert the photo to a Microsoft Word-compatible file that can be edited and printed?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.A. Optical character recognition (O.C.R.)apps are designed to convert images of letters in documents or other printed sources into text files you can edit in Microsoft Word or another word-processing program.O.C.R.apps for Android are available in the Google Play store, just as similar programs for iOS, Windows 10 Mobile and desktop systems can be found in the respective app stores.Some apps can even translate photographed text into different languages.If you use the Microsoft Office suite for writing and editing documents, however, a combination of Microsoft Word for Android and the separate Office Lens app is one way to snap, scan and edit when you are on the go.When you have both apps on your Android device, open Office Lens and take a picture of the page or printed material you want to convert into a Word file; the app can also convert a photograph of notes scrawled on a white board into text files.Photo When you are asked to save and store the photo, choose Microsoft Word from the list of apps and services.The Android version of Word then takes over to open the file, covert the text into type you can edit and then open the content in a word-processing document on your phone or tablet.You can edit it there, email it to yourself for use elsewhere or park it in a linked online storage site like OneDrive.The process works about the same way with the apps on an iOS or Windows-based device.
How Google’s Physical Keys Will Protect Your Password:::::The physical keys are an evolution of two-factor authentication, an extra security layer to ensure that your password is being entered by you.Google was one of the first companies to start offering two-factor authentication back in 2010, not long after it learned that it had been hacked by state-sponsored Chinese hackers.After the attack, Googles security team came up with a motto: Never again.The company later rolled out two-factor authentication for Google customers Gmail accounts.It involved text messaging a unique code to your phone that you must type in after entering your password in order to log in.Unfortunately, those text messages can be hijacked.Last month, security researchers at Positive Technologies, a security firm, demonstrated how they could use vulnerabilities in the cellular network to intercept text messages for a set period of time.The idea of Googles Advanced Protection Program is to provide people with a physical device that is much harder to steal than a text message.Google is marketing the program as a tool for a tiny set of people who are at high risk of online attacks, like victims of stalking, dissidents inside authoritarian countries or journalists who need to protect their sources.But why should extra-tough security benefit such a small group?Everyone should be able to enjoy stronger security.So we tested Googles Advanced Protection Program and vetted it with security researchers to see if the program could be used by the masses.The verdict: Many people should consider signing up for the security system and buying a pair of keys.But if you are married to some non-Google apps that are not yet compatible with the keys, you should wait and see if the program matures.Setting Up Advanced Protection Anyone with a Google account can sign up for the security program on Googles Advanced Protection webpage.To get started, you will have to buy two physical keys for about $20 each.Google recommends buying one from Feitian and another from Yubico.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The keys, which look like thumb drives and can fit on your key chain, contain digital signatures that prove you are you.To set one up, you plug the key into a computer USB port, tap a button and name it.(The Feitian key wirelessly communicates with your smartphone to authenticate the login.)This process takes a few minutes.On a computer and a smartphone, you need to log in with the key only once, and Google will remember the devices for future logins.That is more convenient than traditional two-factor authentication, which requires entering a unique code each time you log in.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.But there are trade-offs.Googles Advanced Protection cuts off all third-party access by default, allowing only applications that support its security keys.For the time being, that means only Googles Gmail mail app, Googles Backup and Sync app, and Googles Chrome browser.On an iPhone, for example, you will have to use Googles Gmail or Inbox apps for email, and on a computer, you can use only the Chrome browser when signing in with a browser.So if you rely on Apple Mail to gain access to your Gmail on an iPhone, or if you use Microsoft Outlook for getting into Gmail on a PC, youre out of luck.Google says its goal is to eventually allow third-party apps to work with the program, but it is also up to other companies to update their apps to support the keys.Testing the Security Despite the drawbacks, security researchers agree that the Advanced Protection Program is a solid piece of security and relatively painless to use, even for everyday use for people outside high-security jobs.Mr. Sabin, the former N.S.A.hacker, who is now a director of network security at GRA Quantum, a security consulting firm, said the physical keys had pros and cons.On one hand, if you lose a key, a hacker would have a hard time figuring out which account it was associated with.On the other hand, if you lose the keys or dont have the keys around when you need to log in to a new device, it takes longer to regain access to your account.Google has put in place more elaborate recovery steps for Advanced Protection users, including additional reviews and requests for details about why users have lost access to their account.In our test, we answered security questions to try to recover an account, and Google said it would review the recovery request and respond within a few days.Runa Sandvik, the director of information security at The New York Times, said the keys were not much of a hassle.She said Googles requirement of using two keys meant you essentially had a spare: If you lose one key, you can get into your account with the remaining key.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But she noted that the keys could get annoying if you used many devices and constantly needed to carry the keys around to log in to your account.That may be an issue for people who work in the technology industry, but most people probably use only one computer and one phone.Ms. Sandvik, who has been testing Googles program to assess whether to recommend it to the newsroom, said she had not yet discovered vulnerabilities in the security key system outside of the slim possibility that a hacker gained possession of both your password and your key.Its something that is relatively easy to set up once you have both keys, Ms. Sandvik said.I dont see a reason you shouldnt turn this on.The Bottom Line While the security keys are easy to set up and provide tough security, they may be disruptive to your productivity if you rely on apps that are incompatible with the keys.It took a few minutes for us to migrate to Googles apps from Apples and integrate them into our newsroom workflow, which already relies on Googles mail, messaging and cloud storage services.But using the keys required sacrificing an important feature Apples V.I.P.alerts, which notify you when people you deem important email you.Googles iOS apps for Gmail and Inbox lack a similar feature.For people with flooded inboxes, lacking V.I.P.alerts makes sifting through emails time-consuming.Another example of how the keys can stifle productivity: Many employers still require using the Microsoft Outlook app for email, which wont work with the keys.If using Googles security program would disrupt your work, you may want to wait for more companies to update their apps to support the keys, which rely on a standard called FIDO, for Fast Identity Online.Mr. Sabin predicts that many apps will follow Googles lead.If you decide to wait, dont procrastinate on turning on traditional two-factor authentication that relies on text messages.While it is hackable, it is still much safer than relying on a password alone to protect you.The question is how long it will take security researchers to find a way to hack the physical keys as well.When asked if he had already circumvented physical multifactor authentication devices like Googles keys, Mr. Sabin would offer only: No comment.

How Australia’s Technology Stands Out:::::What tech equipment additions did you bring into the bureau?Were still finishing up and figuring out what we need, but I bought a Sonos speaker partly to offset the music we can hear from the hip sneaker store below us; partly because I find that music can be a useful team builder and a tool for inspiration.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ill never forget when David Gonzalez, a longtime Times reporter Ive always greatly admired, came into a class I was in at Columbia Journalism School and started playing Miles Davis.The song was So What, and his point was that journalism required a sense of adventure, improvisation and humility.We also went analog with our brainstorming equipment.Instead of white boards, we bought two studio rollers with craft paper.What stands out to you in the Australian tech landscape?Is there a flourishing scene of Australian tech brands, apps and websites?Photo There is definitely a flourishing start-up scene.I went and looked at a bunch of co-working spaces when I first got to Sydney, and they were all packed with people trying to start something and network their way to success.But most people still rely on the main American brands and apps, at least as far as I can see.Atlassian, the software company, is Australian and quite celebrated here.And Gumtree, which is Australias Craigslist for secondhand sales, is really quite good and useful.No offense to Craig Newmark (whom I know from covering tech ages ago) and his Craigslist, but theres a lot to be learned from how Gumtree works on mobile and integrates messaging across platforms.Amazon is coming to Australia and bringing its e-commerce services soon.Are Australians excited?Reaction is pretty mixed.Americans living in Australia seem to be thrilled, especially those (like me) who got very used to relying on Amazon for almost everything in the United States.Some Australians, including small-business owners who will sell through Amazon, are also excited.But mostly, I would say, Australians are curious, and a bit anxious about Amazon.I just wrote a big story about Amazon and the book and bookstore industry here, which is strong and protected, and heavily resistant to outsiders.And the indie bookstore crowd isnt alone in that.After all, this is a country that pushed Borders into bankruptcy, and where Starbucks has really struggled.Malls and small-town Main Streets are still crowded all over Australia, which feels like a throwback to me as an American, and online shopping is not as common as it is in the United States.Just the other day, I interviewed a young woman in a bookstore she was in her 20s who told me she was not willing to pay for something online with a credit card.I was stunned.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.But to some degree this may simply be a product of unfamiliarity.Once Amazon is here, and if it can really undercut some of the very high prices that Australians are stuck with, I imagine there will be a lot of converts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Beyond your job, what tech product do you love using in your daily life right now?I recently bought (via Amazon, which shipped them here from the United States) a set of Bluetooth Jabra headphones, which were recommended by Wirecutter.And I love them.I cant believe how liberating it feels to not have a cord flopping around.What do you and your family do with it, and what could be better about it?I use the headphones for music (of course) and for phone calls, but last night I called my wife walking back from dinner in Melbourne and I discovered that the microphone really doesnt work well with a bit of wind.I dont know how that could be fixed, but finding a way to ensure good audio for conversation would be one obvious improvement.And as long as were talking audio: Hey, Sonos, how about adding some Bluetooth connectivity for those of us with unreliable Wi-Fi?What is your favorite local Australian app or website and why?Gumtree is my favorite.Ive used it to buy a grill, a gas heater for winter and a bunch of other things.The selection is wide ranging; you can easily filter by neighborhood and distance.Its great, especially for someone like me who moves a lot and arrived here with nothing but a few suitcases full of clothes.
What to Do When the Cable Goes Out:::::Q.Is there an easy way to tell if the cable television service is out for everybody or just at my own house because of equipment problems?I really hate calling.A.If you have a working internet connection (or access to one on a cellular device or work computer) and an online account from your cable company, you might be able to check specifically about the status of your own equipment.To do that, log into your account on your TV providers site and find the technical support area.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.What you find there will vary depending on your cable company, but many providers have problem-solving tools available to help lighten the load on the phone lines.Spectrum, for example, lets you select the problematic service (like TV or internet) from a menu to see the status of your service and check for notice of a possible problem in your area.Photo If there is no systemwide disruption, you can use the available guides and tools to troubleshoot your cable converter box and other equipment.Spectrum has a nationwide page that customers can use to check on storm-related problems, and Comcast has its own Status Center page for Xfinity cable customers.Many companies have their own mobile apps for account management.too.Even if you do not have an online account to see your home setup, your cable providers site might have live chat, general support tips and a service-disruption map.(While it may seem like just another password to remember, signing up for an account lets you check your bill, pay online, sign up for service alerts, control your DVR or even watch live television on a mobile device depending on what your provider offers.)Your cable companys customer-service account on Twitter can be another good source of news.Websites that monitor the status of communications services may also be useful.Down Detector, Outage Report and Is the Service Down?are a few sites in this category.

The best Black Friday 2017 deals in the US: here are all of the early discounts:::::We're almost ready to say Black Friday 2017 deals in the US are this month, with just a few hours left in October and days in advance of the November 24 date.The best Black Friday deals are actually coming even sooner, with discounts on technology and everything else through online deals.Your timing is important.You're going to need a list of what's on sale for Black Friday and know where to shop.Amazon, Walmart, Target, Newegg and Best Buy will all be competing for your attention on November 24.Today, we're really looking out for Black Friday ad leaks, which make their way online a few weeks in advance of the actual date.We're expecting to see big-screen 4K TVs, laptops, toys and PS4 and Xbox One bundles.The hardest gifts to find will be the iPhone X and SNES Classic, which will be too rare to finding in stock.We'll still post about them here our expert thinking is that US retailers will use them to lure your to their stores and websites.A total of $3.45 billion was spent online alone for last year's Black Friday deals period, according to Adobe Digital Insights.Retailers efforts in 2017, just less than month away from today, could top that.That has everyone excited.This is the US Black Friday 2017 page.For UK deals please visit our UK Black Friday 2017 page When is Black Friday 2017?Black Friday November 24, 2017, the Friday immediately after the Thanksgiving holiday, and that's one month from today.Its the official start to the holiday shopping season, and its famous for what retailers call doorbusters: deals so good that shoppers will try and break down the front doors to get at them.Inevitably that means its also famous for shoppers battling one another, with each Black Friday bringing a new bunch of YouTube clips showing people fighting over flat-screen TVs.Despite the chaos, Black Friday continues at just about all the major US retailers every year.Many even open start the bargains on Thanksgiving to give shoppers a chance to grab the best deals even earlier.Last year, $1.9 billion was spent online on Thanksgiving Day, bringing the two-day Thanksgiving and Black Friday total to over $5 billion.Why Black Friday matters Black Friday has transformed the holiday shopping season, for better and for worse.James Miller, senior retail consultant at Experian Marketing Services, told the BBC that there is little doubt Black Friday has dramatically changed the way people shop in the run-up to Christmas and has created an expectation of deep discounts that arguably did not exist before, while a report by LCP Consulting found that nearly one-third of US retailers believe Black Friday is unprofitable and unsustainable."Before Black Friday became a big deal, the run-up to the holidays was a great period for retailers: wed buy loads of presents for others and for ourselves, and retailers would make huge piles of money.Then Black Friday happened, and all of a sudden many of us were browsing the bargains for the presents to put in Santas sack.Money spent on deeply discounted products in November is money that wont be spent on more profitable products in December.According to research by Verdict Retail, there is no evidence that Black Friday stimulated demand: Black Friday is essentially a black hole that sucks in a big part of peoples pre-Christmas shopping.We buy more but pay less for it.The National Retail Federation has numbers to back that up; according to the group, shoppers spent less on average over the 2016 Thanksgiving weekend, though that was largely because items were so deeply discounted.Amazon led the way with an average of 42% off items available on its digital storefront, according to Reuters.It was a strong weekend for retailers, but an even better weekend for consumers, who took advantage of some really incredible deals, said NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay.In fact, over one third of shoppers said 100% of their purchases were on sale.As online shopping overtakes in-store shopping on Black Friday, mobile is playing an increasingly important role.Many retailers reported significant leaps in mobile shopping last year, and it was the first-time ever shopping via phones and tablets topped $1 billion in the US.That's a 33% increase in mobile shopping over Black Friday 2015.Black Friday 2017 won't be so crazy While Black Friday of years' past may have spelled mayhem, with more people shopping online than in stores, the main thing you'll have to worry about on Black Friday 2017 is whether stock will run out, not whether you'll be bowled over by a shopping cart.Retailers, too, will have to be prepared for an increase in online shoppers on Black Friday 2017.Macy's wasn't prepared for the traffic that came to its website on Black Friday 2016, and shoppers were kept off the site at several points during the day.Not good.This year, expect major retails to be well prepared for even higher online traffic, especially on mobile.What's more, just like Black Friday 2016, there will likely be lots of savings spread out over the week, not just on Thanksgiving and Black Friday.Last year, many big-name retailers spread their sales over an entire week from the Monday before Black Friday to Cyber Monday 2017, the Monday immediately after.Cyber Monday used to be a separate event, the day everybody panicked that they hadn't bought any presents before visiting Amazon on their work computers.But in 2016, it was just another part of Black Friday Deals Week.There is no question that heavy discounting early in the holiday sales season, both online and in stores, along with retailers opening their doors on Thanksgiving Day have cut into Black Friday sales, NRF spokesperson Ana Serafin Smith told USA Today.However, Black Friday remains the official kick-off to the holidays and an important tradition for millions of shoppers across the country.There is no indication that will change in the foreseeable future.During what some call the Cyber Five weekend (Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday), Internet Retailer (via CommerceHub) estimated Amazon sold more than $4.7 billion.That's a lot of Amazon Echo speakers, GoPro cameras, and other goods!With deals spread out over several days, Black Friday has lost some of its influence as the biggest shopping day of the year.Still, retailers reserve some of their best bargains for Black Friday, so it's well worth keeping an eye on the day.The best Black Friday deals from last year Every year, we load up with pizza and energy drinks to scour the entire internet for Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals.These were some of our favorite deals from Black Friday from a year ago.iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus for $0 + gift card Apples iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus may have been new but that didnt mean you couldnt get a Black Friday deal.T-Mobile was selling the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus for $0 and giving away $250 gift cards when shoppers signed up for a two-year contract.$50 off PS4 with Uncharted 4 bundle The PS4 is a brilliant console, and last Black Friday it was a brilliant bargain too: the best-selling console bundle was $50 off for the PS4 500GB with Uncharted 4 at Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, Target and more, bringing its price to $249.$150 off iPad Pro 9.7 There were lots of iPad bargains on Black Friday 2017 including $150 off the iPad Pro 9.7 and $70 off the iPad mini 2.Apple wasnt offering those discounts, but it did bundle gift cards with various products.$1,301 off Sony Ultra HD 4K TV Hows this for a discount: Black Friday meant a massive $1,301 off the Sony 65" XBR Ultra 4K LED Smart HDTV, bringing its price down to a much less scary $998.There was also $400 off Samsung 4K TVs and over $200 off LG 4K OLED TVs.Huge savings on Xbox One bundles The Xbox One S was just $299 with Battlefield 1 or Gears of War 4 thrown in, or an even cheaper $249 for a non-special edition console.Prices were slashed all over the place for every conceivable combination of console, controllers and games.There were good deals to be had on accessories too.What to expect from Black Friday 2017 Last Black Friday had some of the most ambitious deals we've seen to date, so expect even deeper discounts in 2017.In addition to greater markdowns on Black Friday, retailers will try to beat their own savings - and each other - with better deals even earlier.What started as Black Friday weekend has become Black Friday week, and this year we expect some big-name retailers to start discounting long before that.That makes sense for many reasons: it spreads the load on their websites and stores, and more importantly it means the news of their deals wont be buried amid the avalanche of Black Friday announcements.So keep your eyes peeled - and keep visiting our deals page - from early November, and maybe even earlier than that.Something we saw a lot of in 2016 and expect to see even more of in 2017 is a sliding scale of discounting: we noticed deals got bigger and better as the month progressed.Thats likely to happen again in 2017, with reasonable deals at the beginning of the Black Friday period and more exciting but limited quantity deals on Black Friday itself.The emphasis will be on the more expensive products where retailers can cut prices but still make a decent profit.Best Black Friday deal 2017 predictions iPhone 8 and iPhone X deals By Black Friday, both the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X will be available.And anyone thats waiting that long to get the latest and greatest iPhones should expect to see some kind of deals popping up for the devices.Youll have to act fast though, as these will be some of the most popular deals of the shopping day, and iPhone X supplies are likely to be very limited.Expect deals similar to 2016s $100 price cut and gift cards included with the purchase.iPad deals will probably pop up alongside iPhone deals.Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8 deals Weve already seen loads of crazy deals for the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus.Now the Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy S8 Active have joined the family, and when Black Friday 2017 rolls around, there will undoubtedly be huge deals on the whole lot.Well just have to wait and see if those deals are sweeping discounts, freebies like wireless charging docks and 360 cameras or buy-one-get-one offers.Google Pixel 2 deals This is a bit up in the air, but rumor has it that Google may have a Pixel 2 in the works with a launch possible in early October.While the release is expected in late 2017, that could still see a release in time for some slick Black Friday or Cyber Monday deals to make the new flagship an affordable one.PS4 Pro deals Black Friday 2016 was all about the PS4 Slim, and Black Friday 2017 will be all about the PS4 Pro.As with 2016 wed expect the very best deals to be on bundles, with some of them costing only a little more than the PS4 Pro itself, so start working on your game wish list: a bundles only a good deal if it includes the games you actually want to play.Up to now, the PS4 Pro is holding its MSRP but you can expect that to change later this year, particularly when Microsoft has launched the Xbox One X... Xbox One X deals Microsofts got a pro console too, and unless something goes wrong with the release schedule it will be on sale long on November 7 - right in time for Black Friday 2017.As with the Xbox One in 2016 wed expect to see the very best deals on bundles, rather than on the console itself: theres more wiggle room for the retailer there, so they can afford to be more daring with the discounts.4K HDR OLED TV deals Black Friday 2016 was positively packed with TV deals, including nearly half-price deals on select TVs.High-end sets are where the really expensive MSPRs are, and the ever-advancing world of TV tech means those prices can only be sustained for a fairly short time.If youre in the market for the kind of TV with a price tag that wouldnt look out of place on a car, Black Friday 2017 could be a very good day for you indeed.4K Ultra HD Blu-ray players deals 4K Ultra HD is in an upswing, as more affordable 4K TVs hit the market.While streaming services offer 4K content, the best experience comes from 4K Ultra HD Blu-rays.Come Black Friday, and you can expect to see plenty of 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray players sitting alongside high-end TVs with the best discounts on both.Black Friday 2017 FAQ: what it is, when it happens and where to get the best deals What is Black Friday?Black Friday is the Friday immediately after Thanksgiving.Its a day when retailers offer big discounts to kick-start the holiday shopping season.When is Black Friday 2017?Black Friday 2017 will be Friday, November 24.What is Cyber Monday?Cyber Monday is the Monday immediately after Black Friday.When is Cyber Monday 2017?Cyber Monday 2017 will be on Monday, November 27.What is Black Friday deals week?Its the week that includes Black Friday.Retailers are increasingly offering deals before and after Black Friday itself so they stand out from the crowd.Are Black Friday deals real?Yes, although in some cases the discounts have been negotiated well in advance with suppliers.As with any sales youll see a mix of genuine bargains, discounted end-of-line stock and mysterious things found in the back of a warehouse somewhere.In other words, alongside all those shiny new consoles, you'll also see deals on random items like cheese graters and shaving razors.Where can I find the best Black Friday deals?Right here on TechRadar of course!We scour all the top retailers Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals so that you dont have to - and we tell you whether the deals are worth getting excited about too.Whether its a 4K HDR OLED TV or an Xbox One controller, if its discounted well have the details here.How do I get the best Black Friday 2017 deals?Know what you want, know what you can afford to spend and know the market: youll often see retailers charging higher than usual prices in October so they can offer amazing discounts on Black Friday.Pay particular attention to real prices, not MSRPs: TVs are notorious for this, with sets having a suggested retail price of several thousand dollars routinely selling for a few hundred.Sites such as CamelCamelCamel, PriceGrabber and Become and PriceSpy will help tell you if youre looking at a legitimate bargain as well as track deals on items you want to buy.Its also a very good idea to be flexible: for example, if you want a Sony 4K TV then think about the features you want rather than a specific model number: the BRV123ABD54-88C-9218-B may not be discounted on Black Friday, but an almost identical set with the specification you want probably will be.Can I get cashback on Black Friday deals?Sometimes, yes.Your debit card or credit card may offer cashback on purchases, and sites such as Ebates offer cashback for customers of big-name online shops.Its definitely worth looking into, not just for Black Friday but for any online shopping.Am I protected when I buy on Black Friday?Yes.In the US, anything you buy from a company online is covered by a wealth of consumer protection legislation including the Fair Credit Billing Act.This bill lets you dispute a charge or stop payment under certain circumstances while the retailer is being investigated, according to the FTC.How can I stay safe on Black Friday?Black Friday brings out the scammers as well as the sellers, so be wary of unsolicited emails or links to deals on social media no matter how legitimate they look: anything asking for credit card details or login details is a scam.Phishing sites do big business on Black Friday, so be extra suspicious - and if youre on a PC, make sure your security software is up to date.Many suites automatically block known scam sites.

it was more than 150 off for a retail price of 248.97.2.LG OLED55C6V 4K TV How about more than 500 off your 4K television?If you've been paying attention to PC World this year then you might have grabbed the 55-inch LG OLED55C6V for just 1,489.3.Asus Zen 21.5-inch all-in-one All-in-ones give you the benefit of desktop power and screen size without the bulk, and PC World has had the Asus Zen 21.5-inch all-in-one on sale for 449.98, more than 100 off.4.Microsoft Surface Pro 4 PC World has been selling the excellent Surface Pro 4 from Microsoft for the knock-down price of 916.97, more than 160 off (that's for the 256GB Core i5 model with 8GB of RAM).5.HP Stream x360 You can get the benefits of a tablet and a laptop with the Stream x360 from HP, with an 11.6-inch screen and Windows 10, which could've been yours for just 219.99 this year.
You could soon be texting from your Chromebook:::::Back in July, we saw some snippets of code buried in Chrome OS that suggested Chromebook owners would soon get the chance to send SMS messages from their laptops through their Android phones.Well, it looks like the feature is arriving with Android 8.1.The Android code hints at the same feature - SMS Connect - and this time there are accompanying messages that show how to set up the feature.For now it doesn't seem to be working (Android 8.1 is still in beta) but it's a good bet that the functionality will go live soon (maybe something to consider if you're in the market for a new laptop)."Read and reply to messages on your Chromebook," explains the uncovered splash screen."To set up SMS Connect, allow access to your phone calls, messages, and contacts.Your wireless carrier's standard messaging rates may apply."Wait for it Various browser add-ons and third-party services have enabled this kind of functionality for years, so it makes sense for Google to bake it right into Chrome OS - plus Apple has the tight integration between macOS and iOS as far as iMessage goes, so Google is playing catch up in this area (especially as Google Hangouts seems to be business-focused now).The revealing code was first spotted by Ars Technica and it seems that SMS Connect can also be enabled on a Chromebook by changing one of the browser flags - though it's still not functional even when you do that.It also looks likely that this will be a Pixel exclusive, at least to begin with, because of mentions of the Pixel devices in the code.Pixel phones can also be used as hotspots for the new Pixelbook instantly, no setup required, so Google is obviously keen to improve the integration between all of the kit it makes now.
The best Amazon Black Friday deals 2017:::::Another day of Black Friday deals is almost upon us, which means big discounts on your favourite tech products, and the chance to plug a few gaps in your gadget collection.Amazon usually has some of the best offers on the table, and we've picked out all the highlights below.You don't have to spend ages searching around the site yourself (though feel free if that's what you'd prefer), because we've collected together all the must-see deals for your bargain-hunting pleasure, from consoles to cameras.Whether you need a smart assistant for the living room, an upgrade on your ailing mobile phone , or a wearable to track your fitness over Christmas and into the new year, you're sure to find something of interest in our Amazon Black Friday 2017 round-up.Read on for our picks - and happy shopping!Note that all deals on this page will keep going until they sell out of their allocated discounted stock - Amazon doesn't say how much stock it has, so if you like the look of something, go for it before the prices go back up.Amazon Prime and Black Friday If you're already a member of the Amazon Prime subscription club, you've already got a head start on everyone else for Black Friday; if not, it's something worth considering ahead of time.So, for instance, you can get early access to some of the Lightning Deals on Amazon that don't stick around for long.You might also get extra discounts on prices that have dropped already, or you might get deals that don't apply to non-Prime members throughout the course of the day.We're not sure exactly what Amazon will do when Black Friday arrives, but it's a good bet that you're going to be at an advantage if you've signed up for Amazon Prime , whether that's through nabbing exclusive deals or through getting at the deals before anyone else.At the moment a subscription costs you 79 (or $99) a year, or slightly more if you go month-to-month, and of course there are a host of other benefits besides improved access to the Black Friday deals.Amazon even runs its own deals day exclusively for Prime members every summer.As a Prime member you get access to Amazon Prime Video and the Amazon Prime Music (Amazon's competitors to Netflix and Spotify), as well as a ton of cloud space for storing your digital photos.All that and more, and faster delivery times throughout the year as well.Amazon Lightning Deals Amazon loves its Lightning Deals: as the name suggests, these are very short-lived offers that usually involve items where the stock is low, so if you don't jump in when you've got the chance, you might miss out.We should take a moment to say that you shouldn't feel pressured into deals that you don't feel sure about - just be aware that Lightning Deals aren't going to stick around.Because these days are only available for a short amount of time, you can often pick up some very tasty discounts.To quote straight from Amazon, a Lightning Deal is "a promotion in which a limited number of discounts are offered on an item for a short period of time", and the easiest way to find them is to click through on the Today's Deals page.Don't forget that Prime members get early access to the Lightning Deals on Amazon, so it might be worth you signing up if you haven't already.Black Friday deal predictions We're still a few months out from this year's Black Friday sale, but you can make some pretty good educated guesses as to what may possibly get a discount based on a) what else is on sale throughout the year and b) what's been on sale during previous events.While we've picked out our favourite historical deals a little further down the page, you can almost certainly guarantee that Amazon's own line of products including the Echo and Echo Dot speakers, Fire stick, Fire tablets and Kindle e-Readers.Also, if you're a Prime member, it's worth keeping an eye on the Early Access deals that are on offer, with a wide variety of items from wearable tech to homeware on offer.As for odds-on deals, expect to see the Xbox One S and PS4 heavily discounted, massive savings on Blu-rays and computer accessories.Amazon Black Friday deals Ahead of Black Friday 2017, here are the best deals we saw during Black Friday 2016, just to whet your appetite for this year's extravaganza.PS4 Black Friday deals - we didn't have the supercharged PS4 Pro to drool over last year but we did have the original console on sale for under 200 with two games, plus the 500GB edition, with Lego Star Wars and The Force Awakens Blu-ray, for 229.99.More recently Sony has been offering the Pro version of the console together with Horizon Zero Dawn for a mere 349.99.Xbox One/One S Black Friday deals - last year the Xbox One X was just a rumour, but Amazon treated buyers to the 500GB Xbox One S plus Minecraft plus Forza Horizon 3 for 199.99.Xbox Live 12 Month Gold memberships were going for 24.99 apiece too.Since the last Black Friday we've also seen the same 199.99 price attached to an Xbox One S bundle that includes Forza Horizon 3 and Destiny 2.Computing Black Friday deals - there were a host of computing deals last year, including 200 off the ASUS Flip UX360UA 13.3-inch Touchscreen Zenbook Notebook (down to 599.99) and a very capable HP Slimline 410-135na Desktop machine for just 329.99.More recently, Amazon has been seen knocking 180 off its Vibox Vision 2SXLW Gaming PCs, putting them down to 639.95 with free delivery.If you want a gaming rig at a low price, it's well worth checking out.Audio Black Friday deals - audiophiles were certainly spoiled during Black Friday 2016, with more than 50% off the Sennheiser HD 598 headphones, down from 199.99 to 89 on the day, and the Sonos Play:1 smart wireless speaker down to 138 from 169.Another great deal we saw recently on Amazon was 55 knocked off the Sony MDR-ZX770BN wireless and noise-cancelling headphones - which means you could pick them up for just 95.Camera Black Friday deals - those after a discounted camera during Black Friday 2016 could've gone for the Canon EOS M3 and lens, available for 409 rather than 479.99, or the GoPro HERO Session Bonus Bundle Action Camera, down to 149 from 200.97.The Canon EOS 200D was recently reduced from 679.99 to a mere 549.00 which is an incredible discount and a whopping saving of 130.99.Phone Black Friday deals - we saw a lot of great deals covering smartphones last year, including the excellent Wileyfox Swift 2 , discounted from 174.99 to 119.99, and a significant 180 drop for the Sony Xperia X , down from 499.99 to 319.99 on the site.Another fine deal we spotted recently was 60.99 off the Blu Vivo 5R, a reduction of more than a third, which meant you could get it for 109.Smart Home Black Friday deals - smart home enthusiasts had plenty to tempt them with 30% off the Netatmo Smart Thermostat on Amazon on Black Friday 2016, down to just 99.99 from 142.37, and up to 40% off various bits of Philips Hue lighting kit as well.Television Black Friday deals - plenty of bargain hunters picked up a smart TV last year.You could, for example, have got yourself a Panasonic TX-40DX600B 40-inch TV for 429 instead of 549.99, or a Sony Bravia KD49XD7004BU 49-inch TV for 550 instead of 799.Wearable Black Friday deals -

last year the lightweight device was on sale for 79.99 as opposed to the usual price of 109.99.4.MSI Gaming Notebook Few laptops match power with portability quite as well as the MSI GL62 15.6-inch Core i5 laptop does, and last year it was yours for 649.99 from Amazon, 100 off the retail price.5.Sony Bravia KD65XD7504BU Black Friday is a great time to get discounts on big ticket TVs, and if you were around last year you could get the Sony Bravia KD65XD7504BU 65-inch TV for 1,149 instead of 1,699.
The Techapocalypse: why we need a giant shield to save us from the Sun:::::Can you imagine a world without SnapChat, Google Maps and selfies?It may not sound like a world worth living in, but if we don't start thinking about how to protect Earth from the Sun, a techapocalypse could be on the cards sometime this century.So says a study by Avi Loeb and Manasvi Lingam from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, published in the The Astrophysical Journal.It indicates that we're badly underestimating how potentially deadly the Sun is.Their solution?Build a 105-ton shield in space.But how?And do we really need to?A solar super-storm will come within 100 years.Credit: NASA/SDO The nightmare scenario That would be a solar super-storm.The Sun may be a life-giver, but its unpredictable power could one day cause a catastrophe.A massive solar flare has the power to knock out satellites, communications systems and damage the digital technologies we now all use daily, including smartphones, TVs and radios.Given how reliant we are on satellite technology for navigation, communications and for entertainment that's probably the big one.A solar super-storm could blank sat-nav systems by interrupting the radio transmission paths between the satellites and devices on the ground.Aircraft and shipping, in particular, could suffer.Some satellites will be destroyed, and the entire fleet will be severely aged by such an event, making new launches necessary (SpaceX and the rest of the space industry would be quids-in).Perhaps the key finding of the paper is that the economic losses caused by a flare 150 years in the future would equal that of the current GDP of the USA.So this is about insurance against an economic catastrophe.A solar super-storm would give air passengers a large dose of radiation.Credit: creative commons/Pixabay.com Solar surge A severe solar storm could cause a sudden massive surge of current that brings down power grids.The worst case scenario would see geomagnetic forces damage super grid transformers for weeks and months.Developed countries tend to have significant redundancy in the network, but that doesn't apply to most of the world.Another issue would be increased radiation, with those travelling in aircraft during a solar super-storm exposed to a one-off dose of radiation.Theorising that the next big solar flare is coming within 100 years, the Harvard researchers compared geological records with data about the activity of stars similar in size to our Sun.They calculated that ultra-risky 'extinction-level' super-flares though "not sufficiently appreciated" only happen every 20 million years, but that techapocalypse-grade flares are far more likely.How do we protect against a trillion-pound Solar Superstorm?Credit: NASA/SDO The Carrington Event Exhibit number one is the so-called Carrington Event, the most famous case of harmful space weather ever recorded.It occurred in September 1859 when a mega-flare recorded on the Sun triggered the biggest solar storm of the last 500 years.It knocked-out telegraph lines and started fires in telegraph stations in Europe and North America.Another major incident in 1989 caused a blackout in Canada that left six million people without electricity for nine hours, while in 2010 a solar superstorm much like that which caused Carrington missed Earth only by about nine days.Some estimated that the economic cost would have been about US$2.6 trillion over at least four years.Considering how much we now depend on technology and communications, the risks of being hit by extreme space weather are far greater than ever.Are we ready?The Northern Lights are a benign effect of space weather.Credit: Jamie Carter Our existing defenses That would be Earth's own natural magnetosphere.A coronal mass ejection (CME) an explosive blast of plasma from the Suns surface seen from Earth as a black spot on the Sun can cause a geomagnetic storm to drift towards Earth.It happens all the time, but most miss Earth completely.Earth's atmosphere does provide some protection against solar activity, essentially funnelling highly charged solar wind towards the polar regions, areas that frequently suffer interruptions to radio.One visible consequence of space weather is the spectacular aurora borealis and aurora australis, the Northern and Southern Lights, which display in an oval shape around the planet's poles.They're caused by super-charged electrons hitting Earth's upper atmosphere about 60 miles up and colliding with other molecules, emitting light.However, there is some good news; space-weather takes a few days to reach Earth, so even if billions of tons of solar particles are spewed out by the Sun and head our way, we will get some warning.In fact, upon hearing about heightened space weather, dedicated aurora-hunters often head for the Arctic Circle to view the resulting aurora.A Sun-shield would cost about the same as the International Space Station.Credit: Avi Loeb and Manasvi Lingam/The Astrophysical Journal.Shields up Our own atmosphere might be good, but it's not great.So let's make it great, write Lingam and Loeb, who propose a huge 105-ton magnetic shield surrounding Earth to protect the planet by setting up a magnetic shield to deflect charged particles and save our smartphones.They reckon it would cost about US$100 billion about the same as the International Space Station and "three to four orders of magnitude lower than the current world GDP, or the economic damage from a flare around 100 years henceforth."Why not?Aliens would do it, after all."It seems reasonable to conclude that technologically advanced civilisations on planets orbiting these stars would be well aware of the economic and biological risks posed by flares and super-flares," reads the paper."In order to mitigate the damage wrought by extreme space weather events, it is very conceivable that they would adopt shielding strategies against such phenomena.[This would] necessitate large-scale engineering projects that may be detectable by future observations."Lingam and Loeb propose putting a shield at the Lagrange point L1, which lies between Earth and the Sun about a million miles from Earth.The researchers also pointed out that the Kepler Space telescope has proved that super-flares are more common on M- and K-dwarf stars the most common stars in the galaxy so any advanced civilisations out there have probably already constructed magnetic shields.So why not use the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to look for the 'techno-signatures'?The James Webb Space Telescope could look for alien 'star shields'.Credit: NASA Lingam and Loeb think that the harm caused by a super-solar flare will be particularly damaging in the decades to come, not because the Sun is going to be particularly active, but because of where our civilisation is at.The vulnerable phase is during the relatively short-lived regime of exponential amplification that is likely to begin a few decades henceforth," they write.A major solar super-storm may be a once-in-100 years event, but it's a chilling reminder that even at 150 million kilometres distant, the Earth still lies within the Sun's atmosphere.

Change your VPN now if it doesn’t have these 8 essential features:::::Given the large number of VPN services available, it can be challenging deciding which one to sign up for.While the websites of VPN providers are useful up to a point in terms of highlighting important features (and indeed limitations), sometimes more crucial info is buried deep in the site.Weve also debunked 6 common myths concerning VPNs So to avoid any danger of you being razzle-dazzled by a VPNs fancy website, weve put together this article which looks at the truly important features to bear in mind when picking the best VPN service for you.1.Plentiful server locations A VPN hides a users data by encrypting it with a tunnel created between the users device and the VPNs web server.The user then takes on the IP address of the web server (rather than their true IP), and this leads to one advantage of a VPN, namely that a user can appear to be in a different geographic location than they are actually located in.This can have many uses, such as being able to access streaming services or shopping sites specific to a certain country, bypassing whats known as geo-blocking.The important point to bear in mind here is that any good provider will have a healthy spread of coverage across a wide range of countries, giving you more options overall.Furthermore, the more servers available in each location, the better (as theyre less likely to be overloaded, so youll get better performance levels).2.Mobile apps Any VPN will offer client software for a Windows PC.However, many of us now spend more time on our smartphones or tablets than on a traditional desktop computer or laptop.In fact, in many places (including the US) there are now smartphone only folks, who use their handsets as a primary method for online access, and this trend may be responsible for slowing fixed broadband growth.Therefore, when choosing a VPN, make sure that it supports the platforms for the mobile devices that you use.Both iOS and Android support are quite common these days, but support for some rarer devices, such as a dinosaur BlackBerry, can be found among a few of the more robust VPN providers with truly wide-ranging device support.3.Integrated kill switch No VPN service is 100% secure, and they can be susceptible to IP leaks, which expose your true IP address when you are online.This can occur more frequently when the VPN service gets overloaded.The solution is a VPN kill switch, that can monitor for the VPN connection failing when the connection drops, thats when your true IP will be exposed, and in this case, a kill switch shuts down the transfer of data.In short, as the name suggests, it kills the connection, preventing unencrypted data from being transmitted (and your true IP from being leaked).While not all VPN services offer a kill switch, some do, with the feature embedded in the client software.Look for an integrated VPN kill switch with the service, and be sure to turn it on in the VPN apps settings; many are disabled by default.4.Anonymous DNS servers DNS (Domain Name System) resolution is the process that turns the address you type into your web browser's address bar, such as www.techradar.com, into the IP address that the worldwide web uses to direct traffic to the user.Most users perform the DNS translation, by default, through their ISP, although this can be easily changed.Of course, when using a VPN the goal is privacy, and therefore we want the VPN to be set up to protect us in the DNS translation process as well (keeping data away from the potentially prying eyes of the ISP).While the Google DNS translator is often used for its speed, this would be a lousy choice from a privacy perspective.Rather, there are DNS services that are designed for anonymity, such as FreeDNS or DNSWatch, and indeed, your VPN provider should be using its own anonymous DNS to better preserve your privacy.Check out the best VPN services of 2017 and visit thebestvpnfor.me to get the best VPN deals on the market 5.No log policy VPN services differ on their logging policies.Some VPNs may keep elements of browsing activity for months, for example potentially data that could be turned over to authorities, if requested.Ideally, you want a VPN which has a no log policy, although be wary here, as many providers will claim they offer this, when the reality is they may still keep some data (such as session logs, for example).It pays to carefully read the VPN providers privacy policy and ensure there are no hidden catches in this respect.Alternatively, check out our extensive collection of VPN reviews where we thoroughly evaluate VPNs in this regard.6.Router support Rather than installing the VPN on all your individual devices, an alternate strategy is to just install the VPN directly on the router of your home network, and then every device connected to the network will have the benefit of VPN protection.While this is often a better plan, it requires two things: a compatible router, and a VPN service that supports this.Getting a VPN to work on a router is a good intermediate networking project, and for more details on how to do this, see our guide here.7.Support for OpenVPN While all VPNs keep your data private by creating an encrypted data tunnel between the client and the VPN server, there are multiple protocols for performing this data encryption.The bigger the selection and more choice of protocols that a VPN offers, the better, but you particularly want a service which supports the OpenVPN protocol.This is the most modern protocol in mainstream use, and is considered highly secure preferably your VPN will allow you to choose between the two flavors of OpenVPN (TCP and UDP), which we discuss further in this feature.8.Low price Perhaps this seems like an obvious point to make, but weve included it because its important to realize that there are a very wide variety of plans and pricing levels when it comes to VPNs.Almost always, youll get a much cheaper deal if you commit for at least a years worth of service, and you can get some truly bargain-basement deals with some providers.At the same time, bear in mind that sometimes the most basic plans wont have the full range of features, and you might be missing out on something good (say, for example, a proprietary protocol for avoiding being detected as a VPN connection, so you dont subsequently get blocked or throttled).If all this sounds confusing, it certainly can be, but the good news is weve already done all the hard work for you in our feature which highlights the best VPN deals.
Apple talks up iPhone X sales, some delivery dates improving:::::How was iPhone X pre-order day for you?It was very, very good for Apple - says Apple - with customer demand "off the charts" according to an official statement.Delivery dates for the high-end, bezel-free phone have now been pushed back to December, though you could always overpay on eBay."We're working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible," says Apple, as 9to5Mac reports.Pre-orders went live on Friday morning but whatever initial stock there was seems to have quickly been snapped up.The other option for getting your hands on Apple's latest and greatest (and most expensive) handset is to walk into an Apple Store on November 3 - Apple will have some units in stock, it says, but advises interested punters to turn up early.Meanwhile, despite the apparently low stock levels, some customers are seeing improvements in their delivery times, MacRumors reports.A handful of readers saw delivery dates brought forward from November 10-17 to November 3.If you have managed to get your name down for the iPhone X then, it might show up a little earlier than you reckoned, so adjust your plans for booking time off work accordingly.If you haven't already got a pre-order in, it looks like you'll have to wait until December at least if you order now.We won't know for sure how many iPhone X units Apple has shifted until the company announces its financial results for the quarter on November 2.In the meantime don't forget there are plenty of phones out there if you're shopping on a budget.
WhatsApp now lets you 'unsend' embarrassing and accidental messages:::::We're usually forced to live with our mistakes in this world, but WhatsApp is now giving us a way to erase our little embarrassments.Starting now (at least for some users), if you accidentally send a message to someone, you'll be able to delete it for everyone who can read it as long as you act within seven minutes.WhatsApp describes the process more thoroughly in an updated FAQ entry .WhatsApp already gave the illusion of allowing this, but the truth was that only you would see the message deleted from your client.Whoever else you sent the message to would continue seeing it until they deleted it themselves, which could be a problem if you sent the message to the wrong person or it "contains a mistake."We suspect that's likely a euphemism.The feature is clearly labeled, too, so you'll now see an option called "delete for everyone" when you select the trash can option after holding down your thumb on the message.Whenever someone on the other end tries to read the message in the future, they'll just get a notification saying, "This message was deleted."Again, though, you'll have to act within seven minutes of sending the message for it to work.You may have to wait a while to enjoy the full benefits.For one, it's a gradual rollout, so not every user has it yet.Secondly, both users must have the latest version of WhatsApp running for it to work properly.Otherwise you may hit "delete for everyone" and sadly find that everyone but you can still see it.WhatsApp won't send you a notification if this turns out to be the case.And then, of course, there's always the chance that the recipient will see your message anyway, allowing them to screenshot your "mistakes" for everyone to see.In other words, we're glad the feature has made it to WhatsApp, but you might want to play it safe and just be better aware of what you're sending when you send a message.
The 7 best Chromebooks of 2017: the top Chromebooks ranked:::::Maybe the last time you owned a cheap Windows notebook, it crashed on you constantly.Maybe that Not responding error appeared too much or perhaps after shelling out nearly two grand for a MacBook Pro, some dust jammed up your space bar and allofyourwritinglookedlikethis.At any rate, the best Chromebook is a solid alternative.Not all the best laptops are Chromebooks Because they run Googles lightweight and thin client Chrome OS, Chromebooks dont take a lot of horsepower to operate smoothly and as expected.Instead, the best Chromebooks can handle the aforementioned out of the box.Theyre usually under $500 USD, more than suitable for work and now you can even use them as alarm clocks , thanks to Android integration.Okay, they dont come with true Android pre-installed, but every Chromebook that releases these days boasts support for Google Play Store apps, making their value all the more impeccable.We wouldnt suggest replacing your smartphone with one, but the best Chromebook on the market could substitute your existing PC.Here it is, along with 6 others.1.Google Pixelbook Making good on its Android promises CPU: Intel Core

Surface Book 2 release date, price, news and features:::::After being two years worth of patient with Microsoft, weve finally happened upon the Surface Book 2, a machine thats ostensibly more focused on iterating on its predecessor than breaking new ground in an ever-flourishing market of 2-in-1 laptops .In spite of some presumably biased hearsay , Microsofts Surface devices are doing well for themselves.Sure, theres a bump in the road here and there, but ultimately the company has the numbers to prove that its hardware is here to stick around for longer than the 2019 expiration date previously suggested by analysts.Get up close and personal with our hands-on Surface Book 2 review Here we have a laptop one that doubles as a tablet, mind you that ignores many of the trends were seeing in the Ultrabook space in favor of a garish hinge that uplifts its unwieldy screen.That was the premise of the Surface Book after all, flexibility over mobility, and it continues to set the stage for the Surface Book 2.Whether thats a successful strategy compared to Apples push for thinner and lighter notebooks, often at the cost of keyboard quality and power, remains to be seen.What we do know for certain about the Surface Book 2 are its release date, price and features, as well as the news surrounding it, which well describe in great detail below.Cut to the chase What is Surface Book 2?The sequel to Microsoft's first laptop The sequel to Microsoft's first laptop When is Surface Book 2 out?November 16 November 16 What will it cost?Starts at $1,499 (1,499, $2,199) Nearly two months after we thought we saw the Surface Book 2 in an Intel sizzle reel, Microsoft confirmed to TechRadar that its second full-on convertible laptop would touch down on November 16 in the United States in addition to ten other markets simultaneously.Its on this date that well see not only a new 13.5-inch Surface Book, but a 15-incher as well.Thats just 30 days after the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update starts to rollout, at least to non-Insiders , along with the companys Windows Mixed Reality headsets.Its also nine days after the Xbox One X comes out, making autumn an especially busy season in Redmond, Washington.Microsoft will start taking pre-orders for the Surface Book 2 on November 9.Surface Book 2 price and configurations Starting at $1,499 (1,499, AU$2,199), the Surface Book 2 costs about the same in all regions as the OG Surface Book.Though, with a total of seven configurations to choose from, the price is sure to escalate from there.The 13.5-inch model alone will be available in four configurations, the cheapest of which comes with a 2.6GHz Intel Core i5-7300U processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of PCIe SSD storage space.Should you care to spend some extra cash, you can net a 1.9GHz Intel Core i7-8650U, 16GB of RAM and either 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of SSD space paired with the same 13.5-inch display and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card equipped with 2GB of GDDR5 VRAM.Meanwhile, the 15-inch Surface Book 2 packs an i7-8650U chip, 16GB of RAM and either 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of SSD storage along with a GTX 1060 GPU sporting 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM.We're about to see another clash of chrome logos in coffee shops everywhere An even bigger (and better) screen The Core i5 edition Surface Book 2 is only slightly lighter than its precursor at 3.38 pounds, or 1,533 grams with the keyboard attached.But, its clear Microsoft wasnt focused on making things thinner this time around, but rather, making its laptop more powerful and impressive, spec-wise.You can expect a higher resolution on the 15-inch model, for instance, albeit a lower pixel density due to the size bump.At 3,240 x 2,160, this version of the Surface Book wont look any sharper than it did before, but at least the company didnt stretch the existing 3,000 x 2,000 PixelSense resolution to fit the new dimensions.The 13.5-inch Surface Book does stick with the same 3,000 x 2,000 pixel resolution of its predecessor, leaving it with 267 pixels-per-inch compared to the Surface Book 2s 260 ppi.Both come close to 4K, but seeing as Microsoft decided to keep the glaring 3:2 aspect ratio, expect thick black bars when youre watching TV and even moreso with some movies.The fulcrum hinge is still there to keep the display attached to the keyboard, although Microsoft does say its been refined for a more stable touch experience.The PixelSense display featured on both the 13.5- and 15-inch Surface Book 2 models can be used with the next-generation Surface Pen and Surface Dial.Undeterred by the resolution increase on the 15-inch Surface Book 2, its maker promises a 5-hour battery life in tablet mode and a 17-hour battery life while docked.But, well believe it when we see it considering the first Surface Book lasted only 3 hours and 58 minutes in our own internal testing.We get more power Interestingly enough, every Surface Book 2 bears Windows 10 Pro pre-installed with the Creators Update not the latest Fall Creators Update.Then again, we can imagine there are many units already packed up and headed to retailers given that Microsofts next 2-in-1 laptop comes out next month.Rather than gracing the Surface Book 2 with the newest version of its operating system, however, Microsoft is focused on delivering the cutting-edge specs that admittedly make us want to toss our MacBook Pro .In fact, Microsoft boasts that its second hybrid notebook is twice as powerful as Apples pro-grade clamshell.Certainly, this has to do with the discrete graphics tech found in higher tier Surface Book 2 models.Whereas the MacBook Pro only gets AMD Radeon Pro 555 and 560 graphics in its 15-inch configurations, both the 13- and 15-inch Surface Book 2 laptops can be built-to-order with Nvidia Pascal-series GPUs.Likewise, the MacBook Pro hasnt been updated with Intels 8th-generation processors yet, while the Surface Book 2 is stacked with the an assortment of the freshest quad-core selections from the Santa Clara chipmaker.Finally, the Surface Book 2 has a single USB Type-C port, regardless of which build you opt for.Dont expect Thunderbolt 3, though, because this is a simple first-gen USB 3.1 port that can deliver power in and out and output video to an external monitor.Luckily, it still uses its two proprietary Surface Connect ports for charging, so you wont have to buy an adapter to use the USB-C port for miscellaneous activities while youre refilling its battery gauge.Plus youll be able to play with one of Microsofts Mixed Reality headsets with your Surface Book plugged into the wall since it now meets the requirements.Bigger, sharper and light as ever A race to beat its new rivals?At the very least, we need a device that can handle the latest Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, unlike the Atom-based 2-in-1 laptops of just a few years ago.So, it would make sense, given the conjectured release frame, to refresh the Surface Book with Intel's newest Kaby Lake Refresh processors.The Kaby Lake architecture supports up to quad-core processors as the default configuration with a thermal envelope of up to 95 Watts (W), meaning it shouldn't be a battery hog even with increased performance.Whats more, Kaby Lake offers native support of the faster USB 3.1 Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 specifications in addition to CPU/GPU performance enhancements.That said, the Surface Book 2 will need better battery support overall, as the original provides only 4 hours of activity in the Clipboard and only 8 hours of juice in the base (based on our tests).Customers eager to use the Clipboard on its own would no doubt be disappointed by the current batterys inept sustenance while consuming 4K video.An improved battery would also be needed to support a built-in recharge dock for the Surface Pen.If a patent filing from late last year is to be believed, Microsoft may have an improved Surface Pen loop in the works that would not only holster the Surface Pen itself, but simultaneously charge it via the USB port on supported Surface devices.More power might also be needed for an updated, discrete GPU option, too.As previously stated, the current model has an option for a Nvidia GeForce graphics chip based on the Maxwell architecture, which has a thermal envelope of up to 75W.If Microsoft were to offer, say, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 graphics chip, the power wattage requirements wouldnt skyrocket and DirectX 12 support would assuredly be in the cards.This would fare well with gamers looking to take advantage of the latest API on their rotating laptop screen.What would make the Surface Book 2 really shine is if it were to be VR-ready.Its not too far-fetched, either, considering Microsofts own Mixed Reality headsets will be available on October 17, and the system requirements are substantially lower than that of the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift , though notably the current Surface Book doesnt meet them.Spoiler: the Surface Book 2 is just as photogenic A race to beat its new rivals?There was a good deal of talk about when the Surface Book 2 will be released and what it will contain leading up to its official announcement.A handful of reports with dodgy reliability speculated that the sequel to Microsofts first notebook was supposed to come out last summer alongside the Anniversary Update.Of course, that never happened and a Surface Book 2 didnt arrive in time to beat Apples mid-2017 MacBook Pro to market.Yet, with Mac shipments struggling , perhaps Microsoft was better off taking its time to launch a fully realized Surface Book 2 with more substantial upgrades instead of taking the Cupertino approach and refreshing its lineups within seven months of each other.Still, theres a lot we dont know about the Surface Book 2, including the price tags of specifically configured models.For that reason, lets hope the Surface Book 2 shows its face at Future Decoded in London on October 31.Otherwise, we may not know of the specifics until pre-orders go live on November 9.For all of your Surface Book 2 news, rumors and reviews, stay tuned to TechRadar as we gear up for that sweet November 16 release date.Weve found

Best processors 2017: top CPUs for your PC:::::When it comes down to the best processors, the competition never really stops.This is even evident with AMD Ryzen, only a few months ago it was praised by everyone around for finally giving Intel some much-needed competition, but just a few months later theyre being challenged by Intels 8th-generation Coffee Lake CPUs, which now boast more cores and threads than their 7th-generation Kaby Lake predecessors.As the best processor game continuously ramps up and gets more heated, however, pricing and availability start to complicate things a bit.If youre going strictly by MSRP, for instance, Intel would hands down be offering a better price to performance ratio than their competition with their coffee lake processors you wont be able to find one that hasnt had the price hiked to a ridiculous degree by retailers.In the ever present war of AMD vs Intel , who triumphs?Luckily, if you need a CPU now, and you dont want to go down the rabbit hole of availability and outlandish prices, there are plenty of still-good 7th-generation Intel Kaby Lake and AMD Ryzen CPUs that are going to be a lot easier to find.Whatever you choose, though, youll need to make sure that you have the best motherboard for whichever CPU you decide on, or you could find yourself with a very expensive paperweight.Just remember, AM4 is AMD and Z270 is Kaby Lake.And if youre looking to overclock, make sure you pick up one of the best CPU coolers.To further complicate things on the brand-new processor front, Intels Coffee Lake processors require their own distinct chipset even though they have a similar socket to Kaby Lake processors.Its complicated, but just keep in mind that if you do go for an 8th generation Intel CPU, youll need to buy a Z370 board.Dont let any of that discourage you though, weve culled through two generations of Intel CPUs and AMDs new Ryzen line to find only the best processors on the market.Whether AMD Ryzen, Intel Kaby Lake or Coffee Lake, our top picks are listed below: Best CPU: Intel Core i7-8700K Overclockable champion, now with more cores Cores: 6 | Threads: 12 | Base clock: 3.7GHz | Boost clock: 4.7GHz | L3 cache: 12MB | TDP: 95W Hyper-threading overtakes Ryzen Low-impact overclocking Overclocking only on K models Requires new motherboard During the Coffee Lake-S launch, Intel claimed that itd be giving us its best gaming processor ever; they werent wrong.This K series chip decimates AMDs flagship in almost every way possible.Abandoning the companys invisible rule to keep processors sporting over four cores out of the hands of the mainstream, the i7-8700K makes hexa-core the new vogue.Read our full review: Intel Core i7-8700K Best high-end CPU: AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X Ripping threads and breaking records Cores: 16 | Threads: 32 | Base clock: 3.4GHz | Boost clock: 4.0GHz | L3 cache: 32MB | TDP: 180W Ready for the ultimate mega-tasking Easier to install than Intel More power-hungry than Intels rival Switching profiles requires a full restart When AMD released its Zen architecture-based Ryzen chips back in June, they relied on the promise of a price-to-performance ratio that finally knock Intel off of their untouchable throne.Simultaneously, however, they fell quite short of Intel in terms of raw horsepower.That all changed overnight with the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X, a chunk of silicon thats not only a better value than Intels Core i9-7900X, but its also easier to anchor into the socket of any x399 motherboard.Read the full review: AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X Best mid-range CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 1600X Six cores for less than the price of four-core chip Cores: 6 | Threads: 12 | Base clock: 3.6GHz | Boost clock: 4.0GHz | L3 cache: 16MB | TDP: 95W Awesome multi-core performance Cool running chip Tricky overclocking It shouldnt come as a surprise that with its mid-range chip, AMD offers more cores for less money when compared to Intel.While in years past this has equated to making compromises in other areas to keep the costs low, the Ryzen 5 1600X remains economical without being shown up.After all, operating with six cores and 12 threads, theres no shame in a 3.6GHz base frequency, not to mention the 4.0GHz boost in addition to overclocking capabilities.Read the full review: AMD Ryzen 5 1600X Best entry-level CPU: AMD Ryzen 3 1300X Welcome to the circus of value Cores: 4 | Threads: 4 | Base clock: 3.5GHz | Boost clock: 3.7GHz | L3 cache: 8MB | TDP: 65W Impeccable value More cores than most budget CPUs Lagging benchmark scores Runs a little too warm Many people will assume that because it requires discrete GPU to use, the AMD Ryzen 3 1300X is built solely for gaming.Once you drop your assumptions, though, youll see it as the little processor that could.Thats because, at a price thats the definition of reasonable, youre getting a chip thats 53% faster at encoding video than the Intel Core i3-7350K in Handbrake and with the right GPU attached can easily help you attain 60 frames per second in Overwatch.Read the full review: AMD Ryzen 3 1300X Best gaming CPU: Intel Core i5-7600K K series Core processing at an i5 cost Cores: 4 | Threads: 4 | Base clock: 3.8GHz | Boost clock: 4.2GHz | L3 cache: 6MB | TDP: 91W Easy to overclock OC approaches i7-6700K stock speeds Negligible upgrade over Skylake Like the 7700K that preceded it on this list, the Intel Core i5-7600K is an unlocked, overclockable quad-core processor from Intel.However, it also suffers from the same integral shortcoming; that is that its barely an upgrade over the i5-6600K.Be that as it may, squeezing out only 300MHz over its precursor brings it nearly in line with the last-gen Core i7-6700K when overclocked.All the while, it wont put too much of a dent in your budget either.Best VR CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 1800X Ryzen to the occasion and VR-ready to rumble Cores: 8 | Threads: 16 | Base clock: 3.6GHz | Boost clock: 4GHz | L3 cache: 16MB | TDP: 95W Stunning multi-core performance Insane price Overclocking is touch and go Temperatures are unique The primary contender to Intels Core i7-7700K, the AMD Ryzen 7 1800X poses a convincing threat to Intels flagship.While its unfortunately more expensive than the 7700K, uncharacteristic for the oft value-focused Red Team, the Ryzen 7 1800X most certainly keeps up with some of Intels older chips.Plus, unlike the Core i7-5960X and -6700K it most intimately rivals, the AMD Ryzen 7 1800X is much more qualified for VR now and into the future.Read the full review: AMD Ryzen 7 1800X Best video editing CPU: Intel Core i7-7820X X gon give it to ya Cores: 8 | Threads: 16 | Base clock: 3.6GHz | Boost clock: 4.3GHz | L3 cache: 11MB | TDP: 140W Solid multi-core performance Best value for an eight-core Intel chip Little benefit over cheaper Ryzen 1800X Threadripper is cheaper The naming convention is confusing, given that the Intel Core i7-7820X is part of Intels Skylake-X series rather than the X-class chips built on the 14nm Kaby Lake node, but semantics matter very little when you get to go hands-on with an Intel CPU boasting this many cores.Although the fact that youll need a new motherboard to use this octa-core monster might be enough to scare some users off to Ryzen, Intel loyalists shant mind the upgrade.Best performance processor: Intel Core i9-7980XE This 18-core processor dominates all Cores: 18 | Threads: 36 | Base clock: 2.6GHz | Boost clock: 4.4GHz | L3 cache: 24.75MB | TDP: 165W Exceptional performance Single-core results are incredible Price, price, price Monstrous overclocking power draw Intel's 18-core processor is all about brute force.With the ability to kick up all of its cores to 4.8GHz (by our testing at least), this monstrous CPU brings performance to a new level of insanity.The only caveats are this processor power draw and price are equally beastly.Read the full review: Intel Core i9-7980XE Best budget CPU: Intel Pentium G4560 Intel Core i3 power at a Pentium price tag Cores: 2 | Threads: 4 | Base clock: 3.5GHz | L3 cache: 3MB | TDP: 54W Closely tails Core i3-7100 Supports hyper-threading Limited to DDR4-2400 memory Inferior performance to Intel Pentium G4560 With the amount of money youll save by purchasing the Intel Pentium G4560 over a Core i3 chip, we promise you wont mind the ever-so-slight loss in performance you can expect from this hardy value chip.As the first Pentium processor in quite some time to feature hyper-threading, the G4560 goes out of its way to show us all what weve been missing.And, in benchmarks, it proves itself eerily adjacent to the more expensive Intel Core i3-7100.Best HTPC CPU: AMD A12-9800 Integrated graphics, now theres a novel idea Cores: 4 | Threads: 4 | Base clock: 3.8GHz | Boost clock: 4.2GHz | L2 cache: 2MB Doesnt require graphics card Compatible with AM4 mobos Limited to DDR4-2400 memory Inferior performance to Intel Pentium G4560 Maybe youve probably heard some bad things about the AMD A12-9800, some of which are justified, but some salty impressions weve seen are just based on how AMDs first AM4-compatible APUs arent Zen-based.Instead, the A12-9800 takes advantage of the Bristol Ridge architecture, which is basically just a refresh of the Bulldozer family AMD has been slowly iterating on since 2011.Even so, this is the best way single AMD chip build independent of a discrete GPU for now.
Best running gadgets 2017: the top fitness tech to help you run better:::::Running is quickly becoming one of the most popular forms of exercise for one main reason: its simple.You just go outside, put one foot in front of the other, and just repeat However, at TechRadar, were firm believers that theres nothing that a bit of innovative technology cant improve and streamline, running included.If you talk to a runner, theyll certainly go on and on about the locations of every local water fountain and public toilet, but theyll all eventually end up at the same place: declaring their undying love for running data.Runners love this data because being able to monitor your form and knowing how fast, how far and just how close you are to a new personal best (PB) while youre running is a phenomenal way to help you really get a grasp on and optimize your training, recognize areas to work on and bring you closer to achieving your goals.While the best running watches, wireless earbuds, trainers and some sweat-wicking gear is likely at the top of your list, we went ahead and took the liberty to bring you a list of the best running gadgets that could bring you just that much closer to that ever elusive PB, one step further from injury and generally make running an easier, more enjoyable time.Note: we've ranked these from cheapest to most expensive according to prices at time of writing.1.FlipBelt Ultimate stash belt for all your run-tech Nothing falls out Soft, secure and comfy Need to take care with sizing Not waterproof The market is absolutely saturated with devices that feature data tracking, stats and apps, but FlipBelt is one of the most uncomplicated pieces of gear around.Its also one of the most indispensable.Pull the flexible fabric tube up around your waist, fill it with all your running essentials phone, credit card, energy gels, emergency change for the public bathroom and flip over.And, just like that, everything sits firmly around your waist.Unlike a fanny pack with its adjustable straps and buckles, the belt sits flush against the skin so theres essentially no bounce.No zips on the openings means no chafing and, assuming you get the correct size there are five to choose from ranging from a 23- to 41-inch waist theres no riding up either.You can even get water bottles designed to fit inside the belt, so its goodbye to that sloshing lopsided gait.2.Shapeheart Armband Two-for-one HR tracker and phone holster Heart rate tracking Data syncs with Strava Its an armband Heavier than other bands Any runner that is striving to be more efficient in their exercise needs one thing above any other, and its a space-saving two-in-one gadget like the Shapeheart Armband.Unless youre planning to purchase the Apple Watch 3 , carrying your phone on runs is often an unavoidable hassle and, while armbands arent everyones favorite, theyre regrettably necessary for most runners.And if thats something you need, you may as well make it twice as useful.Not only does the Shapeheart provide a convenient way to carry your phone, with a magnetic case that allows you to easily detach your phone from the strap to take calls, capture those necessary running selfies (or check Google Maps), it also monitors your heart rate.A detachable optical heart rate (HR) sensor located in the neoprene armband sends your heart rate data to basically any running app you choose Nike+, Strava and Runkeeper so you can ensure youre training in the right zone for your goals.While it obviously wont be as accurate as a HR chest strap, the armband should be more trustworthy than the data from a watch as youre less likely to get that gap between sensor and wrist that can cause irregular HR stats.3.Lumo Run Sensor Perfect for fixing form Comprehensive form advice Helpful post-run video drills Easy to lose No third party app sync The Lumo Run is one of the best running gadgets in the world, and anyone who is serious about improving their performance and speed should be paying attention.With no less than seven different sensors, including an accelerometer, gyroscope and vibration sensor, all you need to do is attach the 25g lightweight device to the back of your shorts and you've negated the need for a trip to the augmentations lab.Lumo tracks all your essential running form stats thats cadence (steps per minute), bounce, pelvic movement and how much brake you apply with each step and sends them to the Lumo app for you to obsess over later, along with personalized recommendations for pre- and post-run exercises based on how youve just performed.Youll also get tips on aspects of your form to work on during each run, along with live audio-coaching to help you adjust your form on the go.The caveat for those who prefer running on the light-side, however, is that audio cues and GPS stats, such as pace and distance, are only available if you take your phone along for the ride (see the Shapeheart Armband listed above).With 20 days of run time and onboard storage for sessions where you want to track phone-free runs this is your best tool for developing your form.4.Jaybird X3 Lightweight sounds for wireless miles Excellent adaptable sound Good battery life Proprietary charging dock Intermittent signal The Jaybird X2 in-ear headphones were extremely popular among runners and we expect the X3 to follow in that tradition These new neckband-style Bluetooth earbuds improve upon their predecessors in nearly every way and even come in at a more respectable price.To begin with, theyre slightly smaller but keep the sweat-proof design and shockingly great sound.Bluetooth 4.1 means longer battery life that can easily last you through a marathon with battery to spare, while theres also more precise control over the audio, thanks to a new companion MySound app that lets you fiddle with sound levels to your hearts content.However, what really makes them significant to any runner is how great they fit while running.The wide variety of fitting options means they stay secure in your ears while the lightweight cable eliminates any tug.The only thing that reminds you theyre attached to your head at all is your exercise jam motivating you to strive for that PB.Read the full review: Jaybird X3 5.AfterShokz Trekz Air Perfect for safer running soundtracks in urban spaces Super lightweight Improve awareness for safer running Uncomfortable on longer runs Sound leakage Designed exclusively for working out, the new generation of wireless AfterShokz IP55 sweat-resistant bone-conduction headphones weighs in at just 30g, thats about 20% lighter than the original Trekz Titanium because every gram counts when youre shooting for a PB.Ideal for running, no wires means no pulling your earbuds out with every arm swing, six hours of music and calls from a 90-minute full charge means theyll see you through a marathon with time to spare.The battery life is far from its most important feature, however, the open-ear design allows you to hear whats going on around you at all times, particularly important on darker nights and misty mornings and makes them race legal in the UK for open-road running.Other useful improvements include dual noise cancelling mics so you can actually take that call while youre on the run (as long as you can breathe) and redesigned bone transducers that deliver more bass, one of our biggest bugbears with previous AfterShokz.The pause button has been overhauled to be easier to tap too... in short, this is a brilliant upgrade.And because sport headphones tend to spend a lot of time kicking about in the bottom of a bag, they come with a durable premium titanium frame and wraparound band that can withstand a few knocks.6.Altra Torin IQ Smart shoes for improving technique Form tracking without extra gear Detailed running dynamics insights Live coaching lacks finesse Only one style of shoe Designed to improve your technique and reduce the chance of injury, just about the only thing these smart trainers dont do is run for you.As you plod the pavements theyre collecting all kinds of data via lightweight pressure sensors that run the length of the shoes, storing the stats on the Altra IQ app and providing live coaching tips to help you improve your stride.Monitoring cadence, impact every time you hit the ground, data on how youre landing heel, midfoot or forefoot first how your stride changes with terrain and elevation and even how long your foot is in contact with the floor, these zero-drop cushioned shoes are a stat-loving striders dream.7.LifeBeam Vi The future of run coaching Excellent cadence coaching Brilliant audio Limited post-run stats No training plans The Lifebeam Vi is an AI running coach contained in these specially designed headphones.This amazing AI technology will adapt to your training schedule and offer personalized advice and workout suggestions as you go.The bio-sensing earbuds keep track of your distance, speed, elevation, heart rate, cadence and more.This way, the Vi can learn every aspect of your running game, encouraging you to keep going when youre about to hit a new goal, instructing you to slow down if you have a tendency to set off too fast, offering pace-specific training and suggesting recovery days or harder sessions where necessary.And, you might think this is kind of creepy, but the Vi will learn your name, where youre at, and even the weather around you, in order to tailor her advice to the exact minute and location you are at.For instance, shell give you some tips for running in the rain if winter is coming.The Vi is ambitious by design, and represents a future of intelligent fitness and running devices.Weve spent a lot of time with her the AI is female-voiced and while right now shes a great tool for casual and newer runners building fitness, shes lacking some essential features that more serious runners, those chasing new PBs, are going to be looking for.However, with the ability to support years of software upgrades, Vi can only get better as you do and for those whod love real-time run coaching but cant afford it, Vi could make for a good AI option.8.Halo Sport Using brain science to improve your performance Uses science to improve performance Free scalp massage Bulky to wear Audio quality could improve Theres a reason these headphones look like theyre going to tweak your brain they are.Part of a rising trend for applying advanced neuroscience to sport and fitness, Halo Sport employs clever, and somewhat complex, brain science to make you run faster.Worn before your workout, Halo delivers a tingling electrical stimulation over a 20-minute warm up period known as neuropriming.The idea is that electric signals help the movement-controlling neurons in your brain fire more easily.Your brain learns to repeat movements such as the strides you make when running through a process called plasticity, but neuropriming is intended to get your brain into a state of hyper-plasticity so it reaches its fine-tuning state more quickly and you get greater muscle control and better results from your workout.Small-scale studies with baseball team San Francisco Giants showed improvements in speed and explosiveness and theres a weight of scientific research to back up their effectiveness.However, unless you really, really care about shaving that elusive minute off your Parkrun time, then this might be a trend to monitor rather than dive in to at this stage.
Best 32-inch TVs of 2017: the best secondary TVs for any budget:::::These days, it seems like whenever anybody is talking about TVs, theyre talking about 4K TVs, theyre really all the rage now, and usually people are talking about the massive displays.There are even rumblings among popular TV manufacturers that 55-inch TVs are now the most popular size around.Just a few years ago, every AV enthusiast was looking for the best 32-inch TVs, and while theyre not quite the pinnacle of innovation and entertainment they once were, theres no reason to believe that 32-inch TVs have completely fallen into obsolescence.Believe it or not, its the opposite, it continues to be one of the most in-demand categories of the TV market and when you sit down and think about it, it really makes a lot of sense.If you, like many people, are considering putting TVs in second, third, and even fourth rooms, the best 32-inch TVs achieve the ideal balance between affordability and utility (especially if you happen to get a smart TV): Its large enough to be comfortably viewable even in typically large rooms such as kitchens and conservatories, but not so big that it overwhelms smaller areas such as bedrooms or studies.Which TVs does TechRadar recommend?Because shopping for a new TV can potentially be kind of a hassle when you dont know what to look for, we here at TechRadar have taken the liberty to come up with a useful list of features to consider when looking for the best 32-inch TV for you.One of the most important things to consider is that smart TVs are called smart for a reason.Second-room TVs stand to gain much more from a good range of smart features than main living room sets.Its not really that difficult to see why either, rather than having to buy another set-top box or streaming stick for your second-room TV, all of that functionality is instead built right into it, saving you time and money.So, if you are indeed shopping for a second-room TV, you should definitely consider a set with Wi-Fi capability that supports both video streaming services and file sharing.With even the best 32-inch TVs, you should always go for a 1,920 x 1,080 resolution.Most 32-inch TVs these days are labeled as HD Ready, meaning it has a high definition resolution and can play high definition sources.Dont be fooled by misleading labeling, though.There are two different resolutions that meet the HD Ready criteria: 1,366x768, and full HD 1,920 x 1,080.A TV with a 1,920 x 1,080 resolution will always give you a cleaner, more detailed image than one with a 768p resolution, and theyre not even that much more expensive.One last thing to consider before you decide which TV you want, is whether or not it has all the ports you need.Devices like PS4s, Nintendo Switches and DVD/Blu-ray players will need HDMI inputs, the Nintendo Wii or other legacy game consoles will need a component or even composite video input, PCs, if they dont use HDMI, will likely use a DVI or VGA input and Sky/Cable set top boxes will need an additional HDMI.When you have a lot of different devices to connect, it will really make your life easier getting a TV that has enough ports to support everything you want to do with it.Keep these tips in mind, and you should have no problem finding the small screen of your dreams.However, just in case you cant find something, weve taken the liberty of compiling a list of the best 32-inch TVs of 2017.1.Sony KDL-32RE4 (UK only) Sony's 32RE4 packs HDR into a 32-inch screen Screen size: 32-inch | Tuner: Freeview HD | Resolution: 1920 x 1080 | Panel technology: LED | Smart TV: Smart Hub | Curved: No | Dimensions: 543 x 156 x 826 mm HDR support Great for gamers Not a smart TV Screen is a bit dim Weve chosen to highlight Sony's 32RE4 because, uniquely, it supports high dynamic range video.The screen wont be bright enough to do HDR full justice, but any sort of HDR impact is welcome.Gamers may be particularly drawn to it given the HDR potential of the Xbox One S and PS4 consoles.Unlike 4K, HDR doesnt need a big screen to deliver palpable picture quality improvements.Just remember youll need to feed the TV HDR sources to unlock its HDR potential.2.VIZIO D32X-D1 (US Only) Apps and full array backlighting for less than you might expect Screen size: 32-inch | Tuner: N/A | Resolution: 1920 x 1080 | Panel technology: LED | Smart TV: VIZIO Internet Apps Plus | Curved: No | Dimensions: 505 x 733 x 184 mm 1080p resolution Full array backlighting Remote isn't great Sound quality isn't top class VIZIO has never been known for catchy or easy to remember model names, so it's only fitting that one of the best small screens from the company has a name like D32X-D1.While it might not have the catchiest name in the world, VIZIO's small screen has a lot going for it including a full 1080p resolution and an app tray full of the most popular streaming services like Netflix, YouTube and Hulu.3.Samsung UN32M5300 (US Only) Samsung's M5300 Series is the top of its class for 2017 Screen size: 32-inch | Tuner: NA | Resolution: 1920 x 1080 | Panel technology: LED | Smart TV: Smart Hub | Curved: No | Dimensions: 29.2 x 18.5 x 5.7 inches 1080p resolution Great app selection Only 2 HDMI ports Only optical audio supported Samsung has been a leader in the 32-inch screen space for years.The top of the line model from the South Korean manufacturer this year is the UN32M5300.Why?It offers full 1080p images and its Tizen operating system for a price that most folks can afford.Sure, it doesn't have the most connections in the world, but hey, the small compromises are absolutely worth it.4.LG 32LJ610V (UK Only) LG's 32-inch screen is great for bright, open rooms Screen size: 32-inch | Tuner: Freeview HD | Resolution: 1920 x 1080 | Panel technology: LED | Smart TV: No | Curved: No | Dimensions: 480 x 720 x 160mm Good for bright rooms webOS smart TV platform Design could use work IPS panel The 32LJ610V is a bit on the ugly side by 32-inch TV standards, and it uses an IPS panel, making it a bad option for dark room environments.However, its picture is bright enough to stand out in light rooms, and best of all its webOS smart TV system makes it fantastically easy to use.Two out of three isn't so bad, right?5.Toshiba 32D3753DB (UK only) Toshiba's 32-inch screen is for cinephiles with DVD collections Screen size: 32-inch | Tuner: Freeview HD | Resolution: 1366 x 768 | Panel technology: LED | Smart TV: Cloud TV | Curved: No | Dimensions: 498 x 745 x 215 DVD combo Freeview Play Only 720p resolution If youre still rocking shelves full of DVDs or youve got a habit of popping the latest bargain bucket DVD title in with your weekly shopping, this new Toshiba model features a built-in DVD drive.It likely wont rival the other models here on all-round picture quality, but it still looks attractive despite its combi design, and supports the Freeview Play smart system in the UK.Which adds up to a lot of features for its 299 price tag.
iPhone X repair fees are absolutely bonkers, even for Apple:::::So you thought the iPhone X itself was expensive?Just wait until you see the repair costs.As MacRumors discovered, today Apple updated its non-warranty servicing pricing for the iPhone X, just in time for today's preorders.Judging from the numbers, it's probably a good thing they didn't update it earlier as they may have scared off potential buyers.One of the standout features of the iPhone X is that fancy new OLED screen, which should save power and render images in brighter, crisper colors.Unfortunately, that means it's going to cost you $279 in the US to replace it if you shatter it.Compare that to the iPhone 8 Plus , which will only set you back $169 if you break the screen (and that's the same price you'll pay for breaking the screen of the older iPhone 7 Plus ).It gets far, far worse if you have to repair any of the rest of it, likely because of that all-glass back that Apple included so the device would support wireless charging.Specifically, any "other damage" costs $549 to repair, which is crazy for a device that already costs $1,000.Outside the US, non-warranty screen repairs will run you 286, AU$419 or CA$359, while anything in the "other damages" category will run you 556, AU$819 or CA$709, depending on where you live.A breaking point?You can avoid these obscene prices if you pick up Apple's $199/199/AU$299 AppleCare+ plan, which allows you to get relatively inexpensive out-of-warranty repairs for two years from the data of purchase.Under the plan (which is more expensive for the iPhone X than earlier models), you'd only have to pay $29/25/AU$45 for screen repairs and $99/79/AU$149 for other damage.That's especially worthwhile if you end up dealing with the dreaded "other damage," as the cost of AppleCare+ and the repair cost together would only amount to $298/278/AU$448.Apple clearly wants you to pick up its plan.
Missed the iPhone X pre-order? Boost and Virgin Mobile have it November 10:::::Preorders for the iPhone X opened this morning for major carriers like T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, AT&T and, of course, Apple itself.They also quickly sold out, pushing shipment times back by several weeks.But if you're a customer of the smaller services Virgin Mobile and Boost: fear not, your time will come soon, too.Relatively, anyway.Today Virgin Mobile announced that its customers can pre-order the hotly anticipated smartphone on Virgin's website on November 3, the day on which the iPhone X officially lands in Apple Stores and goes out to customers of the other carriers who successfully pre-ordered this morning.Virgin Mobile will actually start shipping the phones on November 10.If you're a Boost customer, you'll unfortunately have to wait until November 10 to even order one of the new phones.Boost's announcement doesn't mention if there's a separate day for when iPhone X will ship.Small sacrifices All of this means you technically have another way of getting an iPhone X sooner than later if you missed last night's pre-order rush, provided you're willing to wait a bit and don't mind switching carriers.We've long expected this kind of shortage would happen, and just yesterday we warned that you might end up waiting until 2018 to get an iPhone X if you didn't manage to snag one last night.Here's what you'll get if you switch.Virgin Mobile offers what it calls an "Inner Circle" unlimited talk, text and data plan for $50 a month.If you bring your own unlocked iPhone (of any recent model) to Virgin, though, you'll also be able to take advantage of a promotion that gives you six months of data usage for only a dollar each month.Boost also offers a $50 unlimited plan, along with a $35 plan that gives you full 4G LTE speeds while only giving you a paltry 3GB of data to work with, Both Virgin Mobile and Boost are owned by Sprint, and all three providers share the same data network.

Rocks Full HD gaming Deliciously vibrant screen Middling battery life The Asus Strix GL502 may not boast the most innovative design, swapping out the usual black and red color scheme for one that makes it feel like Halloween year-round.But, it's undoubtedly one of the best when it comes to gaming in 1080p.In fact, we were able to crank the settings all the way up in Overwatch without taking a hit below 60fps.The battery life is janky, sure, but the screen, performance and onboard sound system more than make up for it.Read the full review: Asus ROG Strix GL502 4.Alienware 13 R3 Gawk at the first-ever OLED gaming laptop CPU: Intel Core i5 i7 | Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 | RAM: 8GB 16GB DDR4 | Screen: 13.3-inch HD 1,366 x 768 TN QHD 2,560 x 1440 OLED touchscreen | Storage: 180GB 512GB SSD Gorgeous OLED screen Improved hinge-forward design Unexpectedly dense Short battery life Unlike most laptops its size, the Alienware 13 R3 bears a hinge-forward design.By moving the heat sinks behind the screen, the chassis is allowed to be thinner, at 0.81-inch (0.22cm).Unfortunately, this means you wont find many 13-inch laptop bags that will actually suit the Alienware 13 R3.While you may be tempted by the inclusion of a full-size Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060, its the OLED touch display that caught our attention.Read the full review: Alienware 13 R3 5.Razer Blade Pro Finally, a desktop replacement with portability in mind CPU: Intel Core i7 | Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB GDDR5) 1080 (8GB GDDR5X) | RAM: 16 32GB | Screen: 17.3-inch, FHD (1,920 x 1,080) 120Hz matte

120Hz or a G-Sync-laden 4K touchscreen, the Razer Blade Pro also introduces the companys ultra-low-profile mechanical switches to a notebook for the first time ever.Thats a deal thats only sweetened by an unusual trackpad placement that makes it comfier to boot.Read the full review: Razer Blade Pro This product is only available in the US and UK as of this writing.Australian readers: check out a

1,080) IPS wide-viewing angle display | Storage: 1TB HDD, 256GB SSD Affordable price Excellent keyboard and touchpad Below average battery life Underwhelming speakers and display For less than a grand and a half, you might not think it, but the Gigabyte SabrePro 15 is a bargain.In its price range, you wont find a laptop with this level of performance.Although its only available in one configuration, the GTX 1060 is a nice change of pace considering most affordable gaming laptops struggle to run triple-A games beyond medium settings.That goes without mentioning the fantastic RGB keyboard and Microsoft Precision Touchpad.Read the full review: Gigabyte SabrePro 15 7.Gigabyte Aero 14 An Ultrabook thats first-rate in performance and value CPU: Intel Core i7 | Graphics: Nvidia

Loaded with bloatware Donning a 7th-generation Intel Core i7 processor, Nvidia Pascal-series GPU and a screen resolution that soars above 1080p, this laptop is more affordable than a comparably specced Razer Blade or Alienware 13 R3.At the same time, it fails to compromise in terms of portability and performance.Factor in the a reasonable battery life and 190-degree hinge, and its easy to see why the Gigabyte Aero 14 made the cut.Read the full review: Gigabyte Aero 14 8.Alienware 17 R4 Restoring honor to the Alienware name CPU: Intel Core i7 | Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti (2GB GDDR5) GTX 1080 (8GB GDDR5X) | RAM: 8GB 32GB | Screen: 17.3-inch, FHD (1,920 x 1,080) UHD (3,840 x 2,160) IPS anti-glare 300-nits | Storage: 128GB SSD, 1TB HDD 2TB SSD, 1TB HDD Wildly powerful Swanky looks Obnoxiously loud fans So-so battery life To be frank, Alienware hasnt been a name typically associated with value.That seems to be changing with the Alienware 17 R4, which bears so many different customization options when it comes to specs that you can practically name your own price.Bespeckled with all of the signature elements weve come to expect from the brand, such as RGB backlit-accents and tons of ventilation, our only real qualm with the Alienware 17 R4 is a disappointing battery life.Read the full review: Alienware 17 R4 9.Dell Inspiron 15 Gaming This gaming laptop

Cloud Alpha Solid stereo sound tuned specifically for PC gaming Interface: Wired (3.5mm) | Features: Dual chamber audio, removable cable and microphone Improved looks and comfort Defined mid-tones and booming bass Muddled lows Theres a common misconception the best PC gaming headsets have to cost a fortune.Thats fortunately untrue of the HyperX Cloud Alpha, which presents a compelling design along

drivers, Windows Sonic compatibility, detachable microphone boom, volume wheel, microphone mute slider Comfortable to wear for long periods Microphone is crisp and clear Surround sound lacks nuance Lacks advanced features Although its designed to be used for the Xbox One, Windows users can take solace in the fact that the Turtle Beach XO Three is compatible with any PC sporting a single jack for both mic input and headset output or a PC splitter cable.In spite of this minor caveat, the XO Three is a steal for the price, especially considering its use of 50mm sound drivers.Whats more, it even

audio control; Virtual 7.1 Surround Sound; Steelseries Engine software, Compatible with PC, Mac PS4, Xbox One, smartphones, tablets and VR Sterling bass and treble quality Professional design Ugly suspension headband Unlike some of its competitors, SteelSeries stresses subtlety in its headset designs.The Arctis continues this trend by flaunting sound quality and comfort over gaudy appearances.When you pop an Arctis on your head, the goal is for, say, your stream audience to see a professional environment rather than a Dorito stain on your chair.The customizable lighting gives you plenty of wiggle room, too, in case the whole monochrome look isnt your thing.10.HyperX Cloud Stinger Better sound for the buck Interface: 3.5mm analog wired | Features: Closed back earcups, swiveling noise-cancellation microphone, onboard volume slider, multi-platform compatibility, memory foam earcups Lightweight Excellent ergonomics Unremovable microphone Light on bass Arguably one of

earpads Dolby surround only works with PC More affordable than Sennheiser's flagship PC 373D while still packing an audible punch, the GSP 350 carries over that headset's stellar 7.1 Dolby surround sound and closed ear cup design.Brandishing a closed-back design and toting a noise-cancelling microphone that mutes breathing sounds by default, if you like the look of Sennheiser's flagship gaming headset but can't quite stomach the price, the GSP 350 is the lite version youve been holding out for.12.Logitech G933 Artemis Spectrum A command center on your head Interface: Wireless or wired

G933 Artemis Spectrum gaming headset can be recognized by its cup-mounted G-keys that provide handy shortcuts to performing actions in-game.And, if you're fed up of round ear-cups on headsets then

room and your ears Interface: Wireless or wired (USB) | Features: 7.1 software-based surround sound, 2.4GHz wireless, 40-feet wireless range, 16-hour battery life, mic-on indicator, RGB lighting,

affordable option for surround sound gaming.14.HyperX Cloud Revolver Affordable and comfortable with punchy bass Interface: Wired (dual 3.5mm) | Features: 53mm drivers, ear cup memory foam, noise-cancellation mic, audio volume and mute controls, detachable microphone Good value Decent build quality Punchy, bass-driven sound No surround sound No headset controls Here we have a no-frills headset with an upstanding build quality closely rivaling those which cost nearly double.Used by a number of eSports teams, Kingstons HyperX Cloud Revolvers large interchangeable memory foam cups help block out unwanted noise, and the retractable mic allows clear and distortion-free communication with teammates.With 53mm drivers designed for punchy mid-tones and pounding bass, this headset comes highly recommended.15.Turtle Beach Elite Pro Like kicking back on your favorite comfy couch Interface: Wireless or wired (3.5mm) | Features: 3.5mm upstream and downstream jack, 50mm drivers, memory foam earpads, glasses relief system, optional tournament audio controller, standard microphone included Comfortable Tactical Audio Controller No surround sound Pricey with TAC Aimed at PC and console

Rumu is the sweet and sad indie game for the smart home era:::::Robot House In the age of the smart home, indie games are turning to intelligent appliances for their next hit.And they may have found it.Meet Rumu.Rumu is a smart robot vacuum who just wants to be loved.But in the futuristic smart home where Rumu lives, it's pretty clear something strange or quite awful has gone down.The humans are missing, the in-home AI sounds like she's hiding something, and Rumu has to work out what's going on.Officially launched at the PAX AUS 2017 gaming conference in Melbourne, Australia, this week, Rumu is the debut game from Aussie indie studio Robot House, and it's a delight.Equal parts sweet and sad, the game has you rolling around the house as Rumu the robot vac, solving puzzles, interacting with other appliances and interfacing with the house's AI while you try to work out what happened to your owners.The studio showed an early prototype at PAX AUS, but with the title launching by the end of the year, Robot House project lead Ally Mclean says the game has come a long way in building its narrative."We had a lot of discussions around the ethics and morality of technology," Mclean told CNET."It's very inspired by traditional point-and-click adventures like [The Secret of] Monkey Island, but the way you have to twist your brain around is to really think about how you engage with technology on a day-to-day basis."With puzzles that revolve around resetting passwords or proving you're not a robot, Mclean says the game takes everyday technological tasks and recontextualises them within a "near-futuristic artificially intelligent house."The Wall-E-like robot vac alone in the cold and artificial house is a good fit for an indie game, and a great way to tell a small story while exploring bigger themes.We checked out plenty of games on the PAX AUS show floor, but we're really looking forward to this one hitting Steam by the end of 2017.'Alexa, be more human': Inside Amazon's effort to make its voice assistant smarter, chattier and more like you.Tech Culture: From film and television to social media and games, here's your place for the lighter side of tech.
I went to Best Buy to buy a Pixel 2 and it was strange:::::Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.Enlarge Image Best Buy When Google's Pixel 2 and 2XL phones launched last week, I went to a Verizon store -- Verizon has the exclusive deal on the new phones -- and had an unsatisfying experience.The salesman seemed far more motivated to sell me a Samsung Galaxy S8 than to enthuse about the Pixel 2.After I'd written about my chat with him, I received many reactions.There were those who had endured similar experiences in Verizon stores as customers.There was the Verizon store employee who explained, "Advertising may be heavy on a particular device because it is new, but that's only to drive new consumer growth."He also insisted that the Pixel 2 XL was, in fact, better than the Galaxy S8, even if he didn't necessarily tell customers that.Commission can be a powerful influence.In search of sales objectivity Still, an employee from an east coast Best Buy wrote to me and tossed shade at carrier store employees who make commissions.He insisted that if I wanted true objectivity, I had to go to Best Buy."You've gotta go to the right place to get what you're looking for.I'm not sure why carrier stores still exist, honestly," he wrote.So, being the obedient type, off I went to a Bay Area Best Buy on Friday, in search of this alleged sales objectivity.I looked around for the Pixel display.There was a Verizon area, but all it had were Samsung phones, iPhones and prepaids.Yet a big electronic board featured deals for the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL.I asked a salesman, who turned out to be a manager, whether the store had any Pixel 2 phones."One," he said.He proceeded to unlock a cupboard beneath some computers, and he pulled out a Pixel 2 in a box."We don't have any 2XLs," he said."We're selling them as fast as they come in.""But what about the screen issues?"I asked.(Some customers say some Pixel 2XL phones have blurry screens, bluish screens and even screen burn.)"There may have been a few, but I don't think it's a big deal," he said, a touch dismissively.I explained that I still had an iPhone 6, as Apple's newer phones have been a little dull, and that I was considering something different."So which one is better?The S8 or the Pixel?"I pressed.He leaned toward the Samsung.In fact, as we chatted, it seemed clear he didn't know that much about the Pixel 2 at all -- a similar experience to the one I'd had at the Verizon store.I asked him whether the back of the phone was plastic (it isn't), and he didn't seem to know.Indeed, there was nothing he could tell me that made the Pixel stand out -- other than that it was from Google.For me, though, handling the Pixel 2 without it being on a security cable (as it was at the Verizon store), made it feel more attractive than it had last week.The manager explained that he owned both an iPhone 6 (for his personal life) and a Galaxy GS7 (his work phone).He preferred the Galaxy, he said, because he could customize it and simply do more with it."The iPhone is a phone for dummies," he said."But my whole house is Apple, so it fits in easier."Camera.Lights.Google.I asked which camera was better, the GS8's or the Pixel 2's.After all, my colleague Lynn La -- who really is the fountain of objectivity -- had reviewed the Pixel 2 as being "all about the camera," and I was here to get the allegedly unbiased Best Buy verdict.I was a little surprised by what happened next.The manager pulled out his phone and said, "Let's see."He Googled the comparison.As he did, he read out the specs of the two cameras.It was all quite entertaining.But then he offered an insight into why my comparative questions and my openness to at least learn about a new phone may have been, for him, peculiar."Around here, people already know what phone they want," he said."They either walk in and ask for the new iPhone or the new Galaxy.They're just not interested in looking at a Sony Xperia or anything else."We're all in our very narrow ecosystems now, it seems.And we're too far gone to turn back.That makes things harder for Google, a company that hasn't enjoyed much hardware success.He added that the store had very few Pixel 2 phones because the number it was shipped was based on how many Pixel, um 1, phones the store had sold.Which wasn't many.He admitted -- with a hoarse laugh, it must be said -- that the store hadn't sold many iPhone 8 devices either.I contacted Best Buy for its corporate view of my experience and will update, should I hear.The manager had no idea when the store would get more Pixel 2 or 2XL phones, or whether there would be some for display.It does help when you can actually handle the phone yourself.The S8 phones on display looked lovely."But if you want one, I can get you one sometime between next Tuesday and Friday," he offered.Ah.His straightforwardness was refreshing.When I asked about switching from iOS to Android, he conceded that trying to transfer music was "a pain in the ass."He said he wouldn't do it himself because he had so much music on his iPhone."So you're stuck with iPhones?""Yes," he said."Which means you'll be getting an iPhone X?""Hell no.I can think of a lot better things to spend $1,000 on."Batteries Not Included: The CNET team reminds us why tech is

Which 'Stranger Things' character matches your music tastes?:::::Enlarge Image Spotify The music featured in Netflix's hit series "Stranger Things" is just as central to the story as the monsters themselves.Whether it's Jonathan introducing his younger brother Will to the sounds of The Clash, or even just the ominous theme song of "Stranger Things" itself, the '80s music soundtrack often reflects not just the tone of a scene but the very personality of a character as well.Most recently, the music soundtrack in season 2 of "Stranger Things," proves that certain bands and songs play an even bigger part in the story, as new characters like Bob Newby (Sean Astin) talks about loving Kenny Rogers, while Billy the bully (Dacre Montgomery) prefers metal bands Metallica and Ratt.Now fans can learn even more about their favorite "Stranger Things" characters in a new immersive music experience from Spotify and Netflix.Spotify created musical profiles of 13 characters from "Stranger Things" -- including favorites like Will, Eleven, Dustin, Joyce, Chief Hopper, Jonathan and even the Demogorgan monster himself.Spotify then matches those character profiles with your own listening habits to find out which character you may be most like.If you enjoy listening to retro bands like New Order or the Pixies, then you might end up being paired with Joyce's Halloween House Party playlist, which includes Michael Jackson's "Thriller" and the Doors' "People are Strange."If you like Johnny Cash and the Rolling Stones, Hopper's Nighttime Drive playlist is perfect for "small-town police chiefs that like their coffee and contemplation to go."If indie bands that tend to be on the more morose side appeal to you, then you'll dig Jonathan's playlist full of angst-ridden loner anthems from Radiohead and White Stripes.Eleven's Breakfast Jams playlist wins for having the most eclectic mix, with Lorde, Patti Smith and Madonna.Best of all, when you share your "Stranger Things" character match playlist on social media, the Spotify screen itself rotates so you can pretend to be passing through The Upside Down -- without all the dangers of being attacked by Demo-dogs.Season 2 of "Stranger Things" debuted Friday on Netflix, just in case you feel like binge-watching the entire series now.Tech Culture: From film and television to social media and games, here's your place for the lighter side of tech.Special Reports: CNET's in-depth features in one place.

Koss’ all-new $30 KPH30i headphone is a winner:::::Enlarge Image Koss Koss makes a bunch of headphones over a wide price range, but the company has a special affinity for making outstanding budget 'phones.Take its Porta Pro: It's been in the line since 1984, and when you pick up a pair it's easy to see why.Nothing else looks or feels like a Porta Pro, and it's so darn lovable.I mean that -- when I'm wearing a pair people sometimes stop me in the street to tell me how much they love it!So I was eager to check out Koss's latest budget model, the KPH30i on-ear headphones.The sound is beautifully balanced, with an amply endowed midrange tone that flatters the sound of vocals, and the upper bass is also rich and satisfying.This on-ear is classified as a semi-open design, and indeed the stereo imaging is broad.Treble detail is soft, the KPH30i isn't by any stretch a high-resolution headphone.There's a fuzziness to the sound to be sure, but it didn't intrude or detract from the music.The non-user-replaceable cable is 4 feet (1.2 meters) long, and it has a one-button remote.The headphone's impedance is rated at a slightly high-ish 60 ohms, but my iPhone 6S had no trouble making the KPH30i sing.It comes in two colors: black (which looks like gray to me) and white.Better still, the KPH30i comes with Koss's limited lifetime warranty -- if it breaks Koss will always repair or replace it.The KPH30i is unusually comfortable to wear for extended periods.The KPH30i actually feels more solidly constructed and upscale than the more expensive Porta Pro, and the KPH30i's thicker cable and plastic barrel plug certainly feel durable.The Porta Pro is more transparent and clear, so in that sense it's a more audiophile-oriented sound.The KPH30i is less so, with a more prominent mid bass and fatter midrange.It's a sweet and non-fatiguing sound, very easy on the ears.The price is easy on the wallet too, just $30.UK and Australia prices haven't yet been set, but that converts to about 25 or AU$40.For comparison, the Porta Pro runs $50, 33 or AU$70.The National's "Sleep Well Beast" album has some great tunes -- too bad the sound is aggressively harsh with a lot of headphones -- but here with the KPH30i I made it through the whole album, and that's a first!Matt Berninger's deep, throaty vocals were given their full due, and the band's strong rhythm section made me sit up and take notice.Then I remembered I was listening to a $30 headphone -- nice!I liked the Koss's big soundstage.It extended outside the ear cups, which is not always a given with on-ear headphones, including a lot of very expensive ones.Maybe that's the thing about the KPH30i that kept me coming back for more -- it's a cheap headphone that doesn't sound like one.

'Stranger Things' sounds: All the music from season 2:::::Netflix The '80s are officially back.And so is the decade's music.Netflix released the second season of "Stranger Things" Friday, and watching it brings you back to the era of "Terminator," "Ghostbusters," VHS tapes, the Cold War and teased hair.Jonathan asks his younger brother Will who he'd rather be friends with: David Bowie or Kenny Rogers.But don't get any ideas, this season you'll be listening to the latter.With "This Is Radio Clash" and "Should I Stay or Should I Go," The Clash makes a comeback after last year.That's Jonathan's sound.But there's also an investigative journalist with a soft spot for Billie Holiday.A mean stepbrother who's quite an enthusiast of the heavy metal sound of Metallica and Ratt.Joyce's new boyfriend, who looks like a goonie/hobbit, loves the definitely-too-sweet "Islands In The Stream" (we warned you there was going to be Kenny Rogers).Steve drives to the rhythm of "Hammer to Fall (Headbanger's Mix)" by Queen.And we learn that Nancy and Mike's mom's idea of the perfect evening involves a hot bath reading the romantic novel "Heart of Thunder" while listening to Barbra Streisand's "The Way We Were" and Donna Summer's "I Do Believe I Fell (I Fell in Love)".Jackson Lee Davis/Netflix Then there's Eleven.Not only does she dress like "some kind of MTV punk," as Hopper puts it, this season she runs away with Bon Jovi's "Runaway" and The Runaways' "Dead End Justice."If you're not quite sure of which character best suits your tastes, you can actually check Spotify to discover your match.The season is a little bit uneven in its musicality.The first and the last episodes are among the best, while others, like the third one, are a bit meager on melodious offerings.And while it's difficult not to hum to the tune of DEVO's "Whip It" or the "Ghostbusters" theme song, you can't beat a season-ending with Cyndi Lauper's "Time After Time" and The Police's "Every Breath You Take."Maybe next season we'll get to listen to Bowie.Here's our Spotify playlist with most of the songs played during the nine episodes of "Stranger Things 2."You can also listen to the themes from the original soundtrack composed by Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein.They go very well with that '80s sound that we love.Tech Culture: From film and television to social media and games, here's your place for the lighter side of tech.CNET Magazine: Check out a sample of the stories in CNET's newsstand edition.
Where are the iPhone X carrier deals?:::::The days of free iPhone promotions are long gone.A year ago, the carriers were doling out new iPhone 7 units if you exchanged your old iPhone -- even if the unit was 2 years old.It was a sweet deal, perhaps too sweet -- which is probably why you don't see the offer anymore.But that doesn't mean the carriers aren't offering some discounts for the iPhone X, which became available for preorder on Friday and hits stores Nov. 3.Though the offers aren't as generous as before, every little bit helps when faced with an iPhone X starting price of $999.In this edition of Ask Maggie, I outline the deals offered by the big national wireless carriers.And I highlight the fine print.Dear Maggie, I really want the new iPhone X. I was hoping to see some good trade-in deals through my carrier.Last year, they were practically giving away new iPhones.(I wish I had traded in my iPhone 6S then!)But this year the deals don't seem as great.Am I missing something?Any advice or tips you can offer for getting a good deal this time around?Thanks, Bargain Hunter Dear Bargain Hunter, You're right.Last year's trade-in deals for the iPhone 7 were pretty incredible.Almost too good to be true.So far this year, the carriers' deals on the iPhone X are not nearly as generous.James Martin/CNET If you recall a year ago, when Apple launched the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon basically offered to give you a free iPhone 7 in exchange for an older iPhone.AT&T initially offered the deal to just its DirecTV customers, before opening it up to everyone.Of course, there was some fine print.You still had to pay a monthly device fee, but you got a $650 credit, split between 24 months to cover the payment, which essentially amounted to a free phone, minus the taxes and added cost if you wanted a model with more memory or the iPhone 7 Plus.Customers were required to stick with the carrier for a full 24 months or they'd have to pay off the remainder of the phone.But for loyal customers with no plans to switch provider, it was a great deal.This year, three of the four major wireless carriers -- Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint -- are offering similar trade-in deals, but the amount of the credit is much smaller and there are a few quirky catches you need to be aware of.T-Mobile T-Mobile lets you trade in a qualifying iPhone to get a credit of up to $300 that can be applied to your monthly bill when you order a new iPhone X.What's a qualifying phone?The iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus and the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus all qualify.But remember that the discount is up to $300.This means that T-Mobile may give you less for an older phone or one in poor condition.Customers also have to purchase their new iPhone through T-Mobile's Equipment Installment Plan, which breaks up the cost into 24 equal payments, or the Jump!On Demand leasing program, which lets people upgrade more regularly.AT&T AT&T isn't offering any kind of special iPhone trade-in promotion yet.But the company has a regular trade-in program that could net you cash you could put toward your new device.The amount of the trade-in will vary depending on your phone.On the company's earnings call earlier this week, in which it reported it had lost 97,000 postpaid phone customers, Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said AT&T is ready to announce a special promotion if it needs to.But he noted that consumers shouldn't hold their breath."We believe we can compete and win based on our product offering," Stephens said."And promotional activity is not necessary."We'll see.If the iPhone X is too expensive, you can always consider the iPhone 8.Right now AT&T is running an aggressive promotion: If you buy one iPhone 8, you get another free.The catch?You also have to subscribe to AT&T's DirecTV satellite TV service.Verizon Verizon is offering up to $300 in credit to iPhone X buyers who trade in a more recent model phone.The offer applies to new or existing customers who sign up for the carrier's unlimited plan.And you must sign up for Verizon's installment payment plan.The discount will be applied to your monthly device payments.If you decide to pay off your device at any time before 24 months, you'll stop getting your discount.Think of the discount as the new two-year contract meant to keep you with the carrier for a set period of time.Here's a list of phones and what you can get for them: $300 discount: iPhone 6S or 6S Plus, iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, Google Pixel XL, LG G6, Moto Z2 Force, Galaxy S7 or Edge, Galaxy S8, or S8 Plus $200 discount: iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, iPhone SE, Google Pixel, LG G5, LG V20, Moto Z Force, Moto Z Droid, Moto Z2 Play, Galaxy S6 or S6 Edge, Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, or Galaxy Note 5 $100 discount: iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, iPhone 5S, HTC 10, Moto Z Play, Galaxy S5, Galaxy Note Edge, Galaxy Note 4 Sprint Sprint is offering a $350 credit paid out over an 18-month lease for iPhone X buyers if you trade in a qualifying phone.This means customers can pay $22.22 a month for the iPhone X instead of $41.67 for 18 months.At the end of the lease, you have to turn in your iPhone X, or if you want to keep it and own it, you have to pay the remaining balance.(With the iPhone Forever offer, you can upgrade to a new iPhone after 12 months.)There is a catch.The offer is available to new Sprint customers and existing customers.But existing customers have to add a new line of service to get the deal.Phones you can trade in include: iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6 and 6 Plus,iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, Samsung GS8, Samsung GS8+, Samsung GS7, Samsung GS7 Edge, Samsung Note 5, LG G5, LG G6, LG V20, Google Pixel, Google Pixel XL, Moto Z Droid, Moto Z Play, Moto Z2 Force, Moto Z Force Droid, Moto Z2 Play, BlackBerry KEYone, HTC U11.If you're not currently a Sprint customer, there's a trick you can use to basically get a free iPhone X.You can buy your iPhone X from Verizon at full price.Then switch your service to Sprint to take advantage of a deal that gives new customers who've switched free unlimited data for 12 months.The $75 a month you save on service will pretty much pay for your new iPhone X after about a year.The bottom line Wireless carriers aren't competing as aggressively as they were a year ago to get iPhone users to switch to their networks or to keep them.This means the deals that are out there aren't quite as attractive as before.But if you're interested in getting the iPhone X and you have an older iPhone or premium device to trade in, now's probably a good time to make the purchase.The trade-in deals the carriers are offering are for a limited time.But before you commit to a deal from a carrier with all its conditions, you might want to check out the trade-in value of your used iPhone on sites like Gazelle, Nextworth and the comparison site Flipsy.com.You may be able to get more cash for your phone using these sites than you would via the carrier trade-in.CNET an Ask Maggie is an advice column that answers readers' wireless and broadband questions.If you have a question, I'd love to hear from you.Please send me an e-mail

DC superhero Shazam gets his own movie starring Zachary Levi:::::DC Comics Children love to pretend to be superheroes, but what if you could go from being a kid to an adult with god-worthy powers just by uttering a single word?That's exactly what happens to young Billy Batson, who can change instantly into an adult superhero just by saying "Shazam."Now DC Comics and New Line want to bring this underrated comic book character Shazam to life on the big screen with "Chuck" actor Zachary Levi playing the lead, according to the Hollywood Reporter.Levi is no stranger to the world of superheroes.He played Fandral -- one of Marvel's Warriors Three -- in "Thor: The Dark World" and "Thor: Ragnarok."He also starred in the superhero TV series "Heroes Reborn."Shazam (formerly called Captain Marvel) has always been an unusual character.His powers were granted to him by a wizard also called Shazam.When he says the wizard's name, Billy is hit by a magical thunderbolt that transforms him into the adult superhero.Shazam is an acronym for ancient gods and heroes: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles and Mercury.When Billy changes from a little boy to an adult superhero, he takes on the attributes of all those legendary characters.The "Shazam" screenplay is written by Henry Gayden and Darren Lemke, with David F. Sandberg tapped to direct, the Hollywood reporter said.Sandberg posted a photo on Instagram that included a Shazam action figure to celebrate the announcement."Shazam" hits theaters in April 2019.
Amazon's Jeff Bezos retakes world's richest title:::::Drew Angerer/Getty Images Three months ago, Jeff Bezos was for a brief moment the world's richest person.This time, Amazon's CEO and founder may get to keep that title for a little longer.On Friday, the online retailing giant's stock shot up a whopping 13 percent, a huge amount for such a large company, after Amazon easily outpaced its third-quarter earnings expectations.That surge catapulted Bezos -- yet again -- to world's richest, according to both Bloomberg and Forbes, helping him take the crown from Microsoft co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates, who's been in the top position since 2013.Bezos' wealth reached $93.8 billion, as of Friday's market close, rising $10.4 billion (this is not a typo) in just one day.No need to feel bad for Gates, since his net worth is $88.7 billion, Bloomberg reported.Bezos' fortune has risen a staggering $28.5 billion this year, Bloomberg said, thanks to a huge rise in Amazon's stock.That shows the stock market is expecting Amazon to keep growing strong for years to come as it's dominance in e-commerce may spread to more areas like grocery, drones and television.While Gates has contributed billions of dollars to his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Amazon's CEO is still not a major name in philanthropy.However, he has expressed an interest in giving away more of his wealth.He may have another reason to do so now.'Alexa, be more human': Inside Amazon's effort to make its voice assistant smarter, chattier and more like you.Rebooting the Reef: CNET dives deep into how tech can help save Australia's Great Barrier Reef.
Open source Apollo speeds up Baidu's self-driving software development:::::Wayne Cunningham/Roadshow In July, Chinese technology company Baidu made its Apollo 1.0 self-driving car software available as open source on Github, using the Apache/BSD license.By Day 4 of the release, it was the most downloaded C++ software on the site.At an Apollo meetup hosted by Baidu at its Sunnyvale, California, offices, company president Ya-Qin Zhang announced Apollo 1.5, a major iteration of the software, just three months after the initial release."Tesla, Apple, Waymo, essentially everyone is building their own platform, their own technology.So at the beginning of the year we contemplated our own strategy.We looked at the history of PCs and mobile, and we believe an open system is more powerful, more vibrant, in the longer term.So we decided to open Apollo, both the IP, the technology and the source code."The meetup was one way that Baidu is promoting the open-source nature of Apollo.Situated near US tech companies such as Google and Yahoo, the Sunnyvale location made it possible for engineers to walk or bike over after work.The local streets teem with self-driving research cars honing their real-world driving capabilities.Enlarge Image Baidu Baidu is hardly alone in developing self-driving car technology.A multitude of companies, from automakers to automotive technology suppliers to large tech companies, have all been working on the problem.The technology has the potential to reduce or eliminate the more than 1 million deaths caused by cars around the world each year.For the Apollo 1.5 release, Zhang said, "1.5 is a lot more capable, it has all the perception features, the sensors like radar and lidar.It has end-to-end learning technology.It has high-definition mapping access."Sensor and high-definition mapping access are two of the biggest updates to the software.The current technology trend for self-driving cars is to load them with high-definition maps of specific roadways.These maps not only show the location of the roads, but also include fixed objects, such as infrastructure, around those roads.The self-driving car compares what its sensors detect with its stored maps to determine its exact location.The maps also show the car where it can safely drive, and include trajectories to take when making turns in intersections.The car uses its onboard sensors to make sure it can follow the trajectory given to it on the map without hitting another car, pedestrian or anything else in the environment not depicted on the map.These updates show that Apollo is behind the curve somewhat compared with systems being tested by other companies.Google's Waymo, for example, has been using lidar sensors with its self-driving software for years.However, Baidu's open-source approach may help it catch up much more quickly.Open source could also help Baidu in the Chinese automotive marketplace.Zhang said that the country has over 200 automobile brands, making it difficult to sign partnership deals to develop the technology with so many.With open source, any of those companies can download Apollo and begin to develop a self-driving car on its own.Enlarge Image Wayne Cunningham/Roadshow Baidu has partnered with a few Chinese automakers on its self-driving car technology.Zhang said, "We announced a partnership with Beijing Automotive, one of the biggest automakers in China, that will make Level 3 cars by 2019 and Level 4 cars by 2021."In autonomous vehicle engineering lingo, Level 3 means cars can handle some driving tasks, but must share driving with a human.Level 4 cars can handle all driving tasks by themselves, although they still have controls that let a human take over.Open-sourcing Apollo wouldn't seem to do much for Baidu's bottom line.However, Zhang said, "Our business model in China is very clear.We are going to charge for services, such as car services, mapping services, and for some of the technology we provide, like driving simulation."Baidu is a major purveyor of digital maps in China, and has been developing its own high-definition maps in the country.Zhang said that it has already created high-definition maps of over 300,000 kilometers (186,411 miles) of Chinese highways.With high-definition maps playing such an important role for self-driving technology, any company that wants to develop for China will have to work with Baidu.Open-sourcing Apollo will make that easier.
Facebook working on adding state, local election ads to archive:::::James Martin/CNET Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced new rules on Friday designed to bring more transparency to political ads as critics argue the social network was used as a tool for Russian meddling in last year's presidential election.One of the planned changes includes Facebook building an archive of federal election ads that have run on its network.The archive will provide information on how much money political advertisers spent for each ad, the number of impressions the ad garnered and demographic information about the audience the ad reached.The archive is intended to help counter complaints that Facebook hasn't done enough to curb misinformation distributed on its network, which reaches 2 billion people a month.But the archive won't only include federal election ads.Facebook also told CNET it's actively working on having the database include ads related to state and local elections in the US.The database is supposed to be up and running by the mid-term elections in November 2018.After Facebook first announced the new ad rules, Democratic State Sen. Todd Kaminsky of New York, who authored a bill demanding more transparency around political ads, said the change didn't go far enough."I am disappointed that Facebook's policy changes do not impact state and local elections," he said in a statement earlier today."As the victim of malicious, false, and anonymous political advertising, I know that voters deserve information on who is targeting them so that they can properly evaluate the messages they receive."When Kaminsky first introduced his bill earlier this month, a Facebook spokesman said the company was "open to reviewing any reasonable proposals."Kaminsky didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Facebook's decision to include state and local ads.Facebook's policy comes days before the company, along with rivals Google and Twitter, are scheduled to testify in hearings before the Senate and House intelligence committees.On Wednesday, lawmakers will grill the tech giants on how Russian agents might have used their platforms to spread misinformation and meddle with last year's US presidential election.Other changes announced by Facebook on Friday include a "paid for by" label that will accompany political ads, which people can tap on to view more information.While Facebook hasn't disclosed how many employees check ads today, Zuckerberg said Facebook is adding "thousands" of people to its ad review teams.The Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new ways to make you, and the things around you, smarter.Special Reports: CNET's in-depth features in one place.
We were promised fusion:::::Editors' note: This article is part of Dear Future, a collaboration between CNET and VICE Motherboard that looks at major innovations -- in robotics, space travel, VR and more -- shaping the world around us.Now Playing: Watch this: Dear Future: Nuclear fusion energy and the race to create... For the entirety of recorded history, humans have worshipped nuclear fusion.It's gone by different names over the millennia, of course: the Egyptians called it Ra, the Greeks called it Helios, and the Aztecs knew it as Tonatiuh.Today, most of us know it as the sun, but leading physicists around the world regard it with the same sense of awe as our ancient ancestors.This is not because these physicists believe the sun rides across the sky in a giant reed boat, ready to exact retribution on us mortals at any moment, however.Rather, they know that the sun harbors the secret to a virtually unlimited source of clean energy.Every second, trillions of hydrogen ions are fusing in the sun's ultradense 27-million-degree core.The crushing weight of the sun's gravity forces the protons of hydrogen atoms so close together that they combine into a heavier atom (helium) and release an enormous amount of energy: a process called nuclear fusion.Even though the natural fusion reactors at the heart of stars are abundant in the universe, this process has been remarkably hard to replicate on Earth.This is because the sun's own gravity is able to contain the ultrahot and ultradense plasma at its core, but trying to contain even small amounts of hydrogen plasma in containers on Earth for a few hundredths of a second has proven to be a difficult challenge for engineers and physicists.If the processes powering the fusion reactor at the sun's core could be recreated on Earth, it would be one of the most important events in the history of our species.Nuclear fusion power plants could end our dependency on fossil fuels and provide a virtually limitless, highly efficient source of clean energy.They could help end the developing world's energy crisis and help lift them from poverty.They could also change life off Earth, providing power to lunar and Martian colonies, or even interstellar generation ships.Of course this future assumes that fusion reactors are even possible.Figuring out how to make a fusion reactor, or a "star in a jar," has been one of the holy grails of physics.It ended up being a more difficult problem than any of the fusion pioneers in the early twentieth century anticipated, which led to a running joke among nuclear physicists: fusion is always 30 years away.I went to two of the world's leading nuclear fusion research centers, Sandia National Labs in New Mexico and General Fusion outside Vancouver, to see how close we are to bringing the power of the stars down to Earth.In this episode of Dear Future, we explore the experiments that are laying the groundwork for a future of limitless clean energy.At Sandia, many of the physicists see fusion research as an exploratory science and a phenomenon that we're just beginning to understand.The researchers at General Fusion, however, are not content to keep waiting for fusion and are actively attempting to harness fusion energy for a practical power plant.Even if neither of these efforts succeed, dozens of other projects employing thousands of scientists around the globe are also in the race to develop a practical source of fusion energy.In the private fusion reactor space, companies such as California-based Tri Alpha and the UK company Tokamak Energy have both been able generate and sustain plasma in their reactors, despite their radically different approaches to driving fusion reactions.Our fusion future is coming, but, we just don't know when.
What to play this weekend: Super Mario Odyssey, Wolfenstein II:::::Nintendo I've been up all night playing Super Mario Odyssey, and it's all I can think about -- but I know I won't be able to marathon it all weekend.There's simply too much to do.Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus just came out, and there are Nazis to kill.I've also been waiting almost two months to explore the world of Destiny 2 on my PC, and I can't afford to fall behind the rest of my clan.The next few days are going to be busy even if I let that Australian copy of Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp I downloaded fall by the wayside.There's even more, too.Assassin's Creed isn't a franchise I've ever been into, but Origins looks like a fun romp through ancient Egypt.There's even a handful of great looking mobile games.Dig survival horror?Sheltered has you covered.Survival horror with retro arcade action?Try Death Road to Canada.Like I said, it's going to be a busy weekend.New releases (Oct. 23 to 29):
Wheelchair Halloween costume revs up as a retro Batmobile:::::A force for good has arrived to save us from crummy costumes this Halloween.Jeremy is a 10-year-old kid with a passion for exceptional cosplay, and he's rolling out this year in a custom Batmobile modeled after the crazy car from the 1960s Adam West "Batman" television series.Jeremy's primary ride is a wheelchair due to spina bifida, a condition that affects spinal cord development.His dad, Ryan Scott Miller, turns Jeremy's wheelchair into a wild new costume every year.This year it's the Caped Crusader's vehicle.Last year, Miller created the Ecto-1 car from "Ghostbusters," and in 2015 it was a Star Wars snowspeeder.Jeremy has his very own Batman costume to wear while piloting the Batmobile.The unveiling video also features Jeremy's siblings in familiar roles as Batgirl and Robin.The costume car has working lights, a blowing jet engine replica in the back and some impressive fins.A PVC pipe frame helps to keep the weight down, while the body is formed using foam board and fiberglass.Miller tells CNET the biggest challenge this year was procrastination."We learned a lot from last year and so many things went a lot smoother, but knowing how much work it was going to take made us drag our feet," he says.That didn't stop him from completing the Batmobile in plenty of time for Oct. 31.Miller and his family were considering taking a year off from big costume builds until a neighbor knocked at the door and offered to help with the cost of this year's creation."I was bowled over when he handed us a check for $1,200!"Miller says.The Batmobile and 2016's Ecto-1 make sense with Jeremy's existing wheels, but 2018 could see a different approach."Next year we also want to break from the car costumes and try something new," Miller says.We'll just have to tune in next Halloween, same Bat-time, same Bat-channel, to see what Jeremy and his family will come up with in 2018.
Google to roll out fix for Pixel 2 XL's audio-recording woes in 'next few weeks':::::It looks like there may another problem with the Pixel 2 XL, Google's 6-inch marquee phone of the season, but Google says a solution is on its way.First reported in the Pixel user community, there has been evidence of the Pixel 2 XL recording terrible-sounding audio in video recordings.In addition to recordings sounding sharp and tinny overall, background sounds are muddy and warbled.In one extreme case, a user uploaded a recording in which the whole track sounds completely stifled for a few seconds before returning to sounding somewhat normal again.Now Playing: Watch this: Pixel 2 and 2 XL pack top-notch cameras No complaints have yet been raised on the smaller Pixel 2 phone exhibiting the same issue, but during our Pixel 2 video shootout, CNET editor Lexy Savvides noted that its audio wasn't as robust as the iPhone 8 Plus.(Read: iPhone 8 Plus vs Pixel 2: Which phone records better video?)Josh Miller/CNET Google is aware of the issue however, and told CNET that a fix will be "rolled out in the next few weeks."During our time with the Pixel 2 XL, we noticed that the phone's audio recording abilities were lacking.Recordings sounded sharper and thinner when compared to the Pixel 2 and Note 8.However, the quality in our recordings were not at all as bad as the one's reported in the user forum.We look forward to testing the phone again when Google's update launches.Audio quality isn't the only problem plaguing the Pixel 2 XL.Earlier this week, reported cases of the phone's display showing screen burn-in emerged, in which remnants of images remain on the screen despite not being actively displayed, prompted Google to roll out a software fix and extend the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL warranty to two years.
Magazine signed by Steve Jobs sells for over $50K:::::A Newsweek magazine from 1988 signed by Steve Jobs has sold for $50,587, according to RR Auction.RR Auction The magazine went up for auction last week, and was consigned by Diane Williams of Escondido, California.Williams met the Apple co-founder back in October 1988, while working as a senior buyer for software company Lotus Development Corp. (now Lotus Software).She attended the unveiling of Jobs' NeXT computer at the Sonesta Hotel in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and brought along a few magazines that featured him on the cover.After the unveiling, she said, Jobs came down and sat on a table close to her.She asked if he would sign one, to which he responded, "I don't do autographs."Williams said she asked him to "write something from your heart then," at which point he smiled, hesitated and then pulled the Newsweek and wrote "I love manufacturing."After hesitating again, he underlined "love."Then he looked at Williams and signed it."It was like time stood still," Williams said in a previous interview with CNET.She'd kept the magazine in a safe deposit box at the bank before sending it to RR Auction.The starting bid for the magazine was $1,000, and it was estimated to sell for between $10,000 and $15,000, according to RR Auction Executive Vice President Bobby Livingston.He says the auction house is thrilled about the final price -- but not surprised at all."This was a signed image of Jobs, which is almost impossible to find," Livingston said.He says there were 34 bids and 18 different qualified clients -- each bid had to be 10 percent more than the previous one -- during the auction.In March, RR Auction sold a Jobs-signed poster promoting the 1992 NeXTWorld Expo in San Francisco for $19,600.And four years ago, it sold a signed contract from 1978 for $40,000.The winning bidder of the signed Newsweek magazine is an anonymous collector from the Chicago area.The Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new ways to make you, and the things around you, smarter.CNET Magazine: Check out a sample of the stories in CNET's newsstand edition.
'Alien' asteroid spotted dive-bombing our solar system:::::ESA/ATG medialab All the asteroids and comets astronomers have ever spotted in our celestial neighborhood appear to come from somewhere else in the solar system and orbit the sun, just like Earth.That is, until the University of Hawaii's Pan-STARRS 1 telescope last week discovered what appears to be the first ever seen "interstellar object" -- an asteroid (or maybe a comet) that escaped from the gravitational grasp of another star and fell through the roof of our solar system.That makes the object currently designated A/2017 U1 an alien of sorts around our corner of the cosmos.The foreign space-something is less than a quarter-mile (400 meters) across, but is moving super fast at 15.8 miles (25.5 kilometers) per second.That's over three times faster than Asteroid 2012 TC4, the rock that gave Earth a close shave earlier this month."This is the most extreme orbit I have ever seen," said Davide Farnocchia, at NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS)."It is going extremely fast and on such a trajectory that we can say with confidence that this object is on its way out of the solar system and not coming back."A/2017 U1 dropped into our neighborhood from "above" the relatively flat ecliptic plane in space where the planets and other asteroids orbit the sun.So, if you imagine our solar system as being more or less flat, it's as if the object dropped in out of the sky.But rather than impacting anything in our solar system, the object passed closer to the sun than the orbit of Mercury on Sept. 2 before making a hairpin turn under our solar system and getting flung back out of town.NASA/JPL-Caltech The well-traveled asteroid passed under Earth's orbit on Oct. 14 but never came closer than 15 million miles (24 million kilometers) to us and is now speeding away in the direction of the constellation Pegasus."We have been waiting for this day for decades," said CNEOS manager Paul Chodas."It's long been theorized that such objects exist -- asteroids or comets moving around between the stars and occasionally passing through our solar system -- but this is the first such detection."Astronomers around the world are currently pointing telescopes at the object to collect as much data as possible while it's still visible and hopefully learn more about where it came from and what it's made of.I can already hear the gears turning in the heads of the many alien enthusiasts out there, and as Sky and Telescope notes, the object appears to have come from the vicinity of the star Vega, home to the aliens in the Carl Sagan novel "Contact" that was adapted into a popular movie starring Jodie Foster in 1997.Of course, at the rate the object is moving, it would have taken 300,000 years to travel the 25 light-years from Vega.That long ago, Vega would have been in a totally different location, meaning it probably was not deliberately launched in our direction by ancient aliens.But who knows what else is flying around out there between the stars.Crowd Control: A crowdsourced science fiction novel written by CNET readers.Solving for XX: The tech industry seeks to overcome outdated ideas about "women in tech."
Twitter hate, violence policies to take effect late November:::::Social media site Twitter announced Friday that it will roll out new policies relating to violent groups, hateful imagery and hate symbols late next month.Now Playing: Watch this: Twitter now has a calendar for tackling abuse and trolls This is all part of the company's ongoing efforts to improve user safety and cut down on online harassment and abuse.According to its calendar, which details upcoming approaches regarding safety policies, the rules announced last week will be implemented on Nov. 22.They are as follows: Getty Images Violent groups : Twitter will suspend accounts for organizations that use violence to advance their cause.: Twitter will suspend accounts for organizations that use violence to advance their cause.Hateful Imagery and Hate Symbols: Hateful imagery and hate symbols will no longer be permitted in avatars or profile headers.Tweets containing this type of content will be placed behind an interstitial.(Twitter will share examples of hateful imagery and symbols as it finalizes this policy).Harassment and abusive dialogue have plagued Twitter, which is often criticized for coming up short in trying to curb such behavior from its users.Earlier this month, users were urged to boycott Twitter for one day to bring attention to the harassment directed toward women on the site.As a result, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced that Twitter will prohibit "creepshots" and "non-consensual nudity."First published Oct. 27, 1:16 p.m. PT.Update at 5:08 p.m. PT: Clarifies that Friday's announcement was about the timeline for the new safety policies.The policies were first announced last week.
Preordering is broken, and here's how to fix the system:::::If you're not happy with how the iPhone X preorder launch went, you're not alone.Twitter, Reddit and other social media forums were full of complaints from the moment Apple's preorders opened (or, for some people, failed to open) on Oct. 27.Websites and apps stalled, crashed or hung; shopping carts mysteriously reset themselves; partner handshakes with carriers and financing companies failed.And that's on top of the entire iPhone-buying east coast of the US getting up at 3 a.m. to fight the online hordes.(West coasters had it easier, they only had to wait up until midnight.)None of this should be surprising to anyone who has tried to order a hot product with limited supply, from past iPhones to the Nintendo Switch and NES/SNES Classic to the Oculus Rift.There's an announcement of a preorder date, everyone rushes the same website or websites at the same moment and in the end it's the overload of web traffic, rather than the limited supply of whatever you're buying, that really causes the most headaches.Best practices, worst results For example, I followed the suggested best practices for trying to order an iPhone X promptly at 3 a.m.ET on Oct. 27, by going to the Apple Store app on my current phone.Once there, adding an iPhone X to the shopping cart was the easy part.Attempting to confirm my details with my phone carrier caused timeouts and errors, and once I'd lucked my way through that, Apple's financial partner for the Apple Upgrade payment plan couldn't process my order.It eventually sent me a follow-up email asking me to start my order again from scratch.Going directly to my carrier was little better -- before even logging in, there was a 15-minute countdown timer queue, and new phones kept showing up and vanishing from my pending orders list.I ended the evening with one iPhone X order, but this morning woke up to three -- two of the ones that vanished in-progress have now reappeared, and even 40 minutes on the phone with my carrier couldn't resolve which ones were real and which were phantoms.The problem is not (entirely) the purportedly limited stock.It's the overloading of websites and online tools, with everyone flooding in at the same second.You're stuck in a traffic jam, and it's pure luck whether all the checking of boxes and intracompany communications required to simply purchase a new phone will work when you need them to.The only silver lining is that, at least as far as I can tell, no one's invented an iPhone-ordering sniper-bot yet, like the ones that plague eBay auctions and Ticketmaster sales.There's got to be a better way, right?I think there is, and it's simple, nearly frustration-free and -- if done right -- wouldn't help or hurt your chances of scoring whatever hot new gadget is in short supply.It would just make the process much less painful.Here's my modest proposal (no, not that kind of modest proposal): Let's replace the first-come/first-serve mad dash with a time-based lottery system.(No, not that kind of lottery.)The sudden start of preorders for a hard-to-get gadget becomes a set preorder window shared by all.Now there's no reason for everyone to rush a website or app at the same time, which inevitably crashes it or causes slowdowns or errors.Just log in anytime over the course of 24 hours, 72 hours, a full week, whatever the agreed-upon term is.For something like an iPhone, you do the same things -- attach it to your phone service and number, pick a payment plan, get preapproved if needed and other options -- but since there isn't an overload of concurrent traffic, your order information is much more likely to be properly stored and not lost to a handshake error or website crash.Sarah Tew/CNET Once the preorder window closes, the seller (Apple, Nintendo, Amazon, whatever...) applies a random number generator to the applications and assigns inventory, or the best ship dates, to the first X names drawn from a virtual hat.Sure, conspiracy types may insist the random lottery system is rigged against them, but surely even they'd agree the current system is just as untrustworthy.You're at least as likely to get as good spot on the preorder list this way as you would from resubmitting the same order every time the website crashes at 3 a.m., or from watching a status wheel spin for 10 minutes trying to connect a handshake between Apple and your phone carrier.Sure, there'd be a natural tendency to rush the gates on this preorder system, too, but if you wait until the next morning, or afternoon, you'd still get the same shot as everyone less, just with a lot less frustration.Is this a perfect system?Probably not.But it sure beats what we've got going on now.Got a better idea?Let me hear it in the comments section.iPhone X: Absolutely everything you need to know Apple says iPhone X demand is 'off the charts'
How to change the LibreOffice Interface:::::For years, LibreOffice has insisted the only interface of value was the traditional drop-down menus.And why not?It worked for a very long time.However, it's now 2017 and every UX designer has to modernize their thinking.That's why LibreOffice has finally brought about a few new options to make LibreOffice look at bit more clean and modern as well as work with a bit more efficiency.Unfortunately, at the moment, you can't get to those shiny new interfaces out of the box.In order to gain access to the new layouts, you must enable an advanced option.Here's how.Open up one of the LibreOffice tools (such as Writer) and click Tools | Options.In the resulting window, expand the LibreOffice section and click on Advanced.In the resulting window, click to enable experimental features and then click OK. At this point, the new options are now available.Click on View | Toolbar layout and you can select from Default, Single Toolbar, Sidebar, and Notebookbar.You'll have to play around with each layout to decide which best suits your needs.For my taste, the Sidebar is the best ratio of form and function.Thank you, LibreOffice developers, for finally bringing the interface into the modern era.Automatically sign up for TechRepublic's Open Source Weekly Newsletter for more hot tips and tricks.Subscribe Also see
Google expands its bug bounty program to include third-party Android apps:::::Bug bounty programs are often offered by companies to solicit assistance from the public in finding flaws, vulnerabilities or other design problems within applications.For some time now Google has offered a standard bug bounty program for proprietary apps.On October 19th, the company announced that they have expanded the program to apply to security vulnerabilities or possible viruses in specific third-party apps on the Play Store, including the following: Alibaba Dropbox Duolingo Headspace Line Mail.Ru Pandora Snapchat Tinder Google will pay $1,000 for each verified and resolved software vulnerability, which at this time only includes remote-code-execution vulnerabilities and proof of concepts that run on Android 4.4 KitKat or higher.Specifically, the vulnerabilities must be based on one of the following conditions: The vulnerability allows an attacker to run code on a user's device without the user's knowledge or permission, take over a device entirely by gaining full control, committing transactions by manipulating the user interface, or using the Android webview function without user input.There is no requirement that the OS sandbox has to be bypassed for a vulnerability to count here, but any vulnerability that depends on other app interaction or installation will not qualify under this program.In order to qualify for the reward, the vulnerability must be reported directly to the app developer via their current vulnerability disclosure process.This link contains details on how and where to submit bugs found in the third-party products listed above.The app developer must then work with you to resolve the vulnerability, at which point you can request a reward via the Google Play Security Reward Program.Only vulnerabilities resolved within the past 90 days will be eligible for a reward, and detailed information about the vulnerability should be submitted to provide as much data as possible about the bug and it's corresponding fix.The reward program works on a "first come first served" basis whereby if the same fix is developed by two different individuals working separately from one another, the person who requests the reward first will receive the bounty after a confirmed resolution.Only one reward will be paid out if more than one vulnerability was caused by a single issue.Individuals are expected to comply with any and all existing laws and to not compromise information owned by others.Finally, individuals on US sanctions lists, or located in countries which are on US sanctions lists (Iran, North Korea, and Syria are a few examples) are not eligible for the rewards, nor are individuals employed by Google or their partner companies whose occupations involve programming code for any devices which fall under this program."This is definitely a step in the right direction for Google," said Chris Olson, CEO of security firm The Media Trust."Using a limited bug bounty program is an interesting approach to dealing with the increasing levels of malware and other security concerns found on third-party apps."Olson also said that a bug bounty should not be viewed as a substitute for a comprehensive security program, and that the onus should still fall on app developers to resolve security issues as quickly as possible, and on Google to vet apps in its store.For news on the latest threats and how to mitigate them, subscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.Subscribe Also see
How to implement digital transformation strategies in field service by starting small:::::Digital transformation is moving organizations toward greater uses of automation, analytics and digital devices, but it's a transformation that is far from complete.Consequently, managers must work and measure the effectiveness in both digital and non-digital environments.Nowhere is this mix of digital and non-digital technology more apparent than in field service."A combination of events cause service organizations to function in both connected, digital environments and unconnected 'pen and paper' environments," said Amit Jain, senior director of product at ServiceMax, a provider of field service mobile solutions."In some cases, service technicians go out into very remote areas where it is impossible to get a communications link into a cloud based service system, so they have to manually record information on the devices or clipboards that they carry, later entering the information in the system."SEE: IT leader's guide to achieving digital transformation (Tech Pro Research) Even more challenging are the different maturation curves of manufacturers and machines when it comes to service and repair.For instance, the manufacturer of a refrigerator that you service might have an IoT-equipped unit that you can take readings from and interact with digitallybut an older model of that same refrigerator might not have sensors or IoT enablement at all.Consequently, you can use digital automation and technology in some service cases, but not in all.For managers of functions like service, which by necessity operates in both digital and non-digital environments, the challenge becomes managing not only staff but information.How do you continuously improve performance when the flows of information, business processes and even equipment that you are called upon to repair is divergent and unpredictable?Take a measured approach to your implementation of digital technology and IoT "The shelf life of an elevator is 20 years, so you can be servicing older equipment that is not digitally enabled for long periods of time," said Jain.In other words, moving to an all-digital servicing concept doesn't happen at the push of a buttonor even at the turn of one year.Instead, the implementation of IoT and digital servicing is a gradual process that is dependent on the types of equipment that you must service.SEE: Special report: Digital transformation: A CXO's guide (free PDF) (TechRepublic) Orchestrate your transition to digital technology in short pilot project steps While the bulk of your staff is still largely servicing an installed base of older machines, you can begin phasing in digitalized technology and IoT for new machines as they begin to trigger service calls.With an approach like this, you gradually shift more of your operations into the digital format, based on the digital capabilities of the machines being serviced.Double-train technicians Because field technicians will encounter both old and new equipment, must be equipped to handle both digital and non-digital scenarios.This means that they should be thoroughly trained in the methodologies and tools of each.Most companies train employees on new gear and systems, but they often fail to train the same employees on the changes in the business processes that go along with these new technologies.If they would do this, there would be far fewer questions, and employees would feel more confident about doing their jobs in new ways.Think about your service information repository Whether your service crew is working digitally or non-digitally, eventually all information must be collected and available for analytics and queries in a single data repository.The database must be able to interact with both digital and non-digital data from a variety of systems and devices.On the digital side, this means the ability to interact with laptops, machine-generated data, and IoT devices and systems.On the non-digital side, this means the ability to interact with legacy systems where employees hand key information from paper-based field reports.Develop a set of metrics that can tell you how your department is performing When operations are a mix of digital and non-digital experiences, it becomes difficult to measure effectiveness and efficiency because of diversity of operations.One way to approach this is to maintain a separate set of metrics for service calls that are done digitally and a second set of metrics that measure non-digital service.A third set of metrics can gauge the percentage of digital versus non-digital service calls, with the goal of moving the needle toward the digital side of the scale.Connect service performance to business performance "By measuring the productivity and efficiency gains from using mobile devices in the field, such as how many work orders can be completed in a day, you can show efficiency," said Jain."In one case, a company reported an 18% improvement in productivity just by moving to mobile devices and digital technology in the field."Other areas of the business that you can measure are the number of leads and cross-sales for other services or products that your techs get when they are out doing service calls, and how many trouble calls are resolved on the first visit."Overall, the best thing you can do when moving to mobile applications and a digital environment is to start small," said Jain.It is equally important to be agile in your approach to testing new digital approaches in the fieldmuch like software developers use agile techniques in programming.In some scenarios, a given approach might work wellwhile in others, it might not.By trying variations of processes as you implement more digital technology for your staff, you can evolve the practices that work the best.For more leadership advice and strategies for digital transformation, subscribe to our Executive

Shark Tank's Robert Herjavec: Cybersecurity at work is everyone's responsibility:::::Despite the critical nature of cybersecurity, it is often made the responsibility of a few specialized individualseven in large organizations.And that needs to change.Robert Herjavec, star of ABC's Shark Tank and founder of cybersecurity firm Herjavec Group, recently spoke with TechRepublic about his belief that cybersecurity in the workplace is everyone's business.While there's a crucial need for defined cybersecurity professionals in an organization, the rest of the employees need to be involved as well.Good security starts with understanding the weakest link in an organization's system.According to Herjavec, this is always human beings."As long as there's human beings, there will be security breaches and security flaws," Herjavec said.SEE: Information security policy template (Tech Pro Research) Two of the biggest threats facing the enterprise today are malware campaigns and phishing scams.Traditionally, these are accomplished via malicious emails that require an employee to act by clicking on something or filling in a form, and some of them have tremendous success.While these attacks are designed to deceive, it is the employee who must complete the action that allows them into their network.Herjavec recommended that employers conduct training and internal testingsuch as phishing their own employeesto help them better recognize these threats and not act on them.Herjavec said that he performs these tests on his own employees as a way to consistently bring the issue before workers."You're never going to get 100% perfection, but at least it creates a sense of awareness," Herjavec said.In addition to offering training to prevent attacks, businesses also need tools that can prohibit the consequences of attacks, such as the exfiltration of corporate data.Companies that deal with a lot of data should invest in a DLP solution, Herjavec said.But, that can create new problems, as employees can feel burdened by the extra time that certain solutions take to implement.In order to properly overcome this barrier and get all employees on board with security, Herjavec said that IT leaders and security professionals must adjust their message to fit the audience at hand."The one thing I've learned from being on Shark Tank for nine years is, to make a great pitch, the first thing you have to do is tailor your pitch to the audience," Herjavec said."The common flaw I see in a lot of these cybersecurity training exercises is it's one message to the entire company."This also includes changing the amount of technical or business language in your pitch."CEOs, CISOs, people like that want to hear the effect of cybersecurity on the business," Herjavec said."People on the front lines want to hear the effect of security on their daily life."In addition to properly communicating the impact of security, business and IT leaders must be realistic about their ultimate goal with their security strategy.Realistically, Herjavec said, organizations should be working to decrease their incident response time."It's impossible to stop a targeted breach, but it's possible to have a very quick response time to a breach," Herjavec said.If a breach is to be expected, one may wonder why it is necessary to invest in preventative technologies.The analogy Herjavec gave is that if someone targeted a home for a break in, they're probably going to break in.That doesn't mean the resident shouldn't have doors, windows, and an alarm system.Knowing someone cracked a window gives them time to respond accordingly, he said.The security landscape is different from many other technologies, in that its pace of change is so rapid, Herjavec said.As attackers and their metrics shift, it's important to keep employees aware of these changes.Additionally, front-line security professionals should be properly equipped to deal with emerging threats.Security technologies are very good to have, but they become dated very quickly, Herjavec said.Companies shouldn't abandon them, but they need to form a strategy for adopting new niche technologies.For example, Herjavec said his team is seeing massive growth in threats at the endpoint, and it's one thing that businesses need to investigate.As such, leaders must allocate a percentage of their security budget to these new technologies to remain properly secured against the threats they bring.Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.Subscribe Also see
Report: UK's NHS ignored patch warnings months before WannaCry, leading to wide-scale devastation:::::A report out from the UK's National Audit Office (NAO) reveals that the National Health Service (NHS) was warned by its digital arm to patch its computers against WannaCry as early as March 2017, two months prior to the attack.The report found, however, that the NHS was negligent in following the warning, which NAO head Amyas Morse said led to a "relatively unsophisticated attack [that] could have been prevented by the NHS following basic IT security best practice."The critical vulnerability that the NHS was warned about was EternalBlue, one of the alleged NSA-crafted exploits leaked to the public in April by hacker collective the Shadow Brokers.It was that exploit that powered WannaCry just a month later, and NotPetya a month after that.Now, just four months later the world is facing another ransomware outbreak called Bad Rabbit, which uses a similar Shadow Broker-leaked exploit called EternalRomance to spread laterally on networks.All of which could have been avoided by proper patching and basic IT security best practices.Image: Talos EternalBlue: A timeline EternalBlue targets the Windows implementation of Server Message Block (SMB) version 1, which can be tricked by a fake packet sent by an attacker, granting them the ability to execute malicious code on the affected machine.That the exploit was crafted by the NSA is still up for speculation, but regardless of its source Microsoft released patches for EternalBlue and similar exploits in March and April 2017.SEE: How the GoldenEye/Petya ransomware attack reveals the sorry state of cybersecurity (TechRepublic) On April 14, 2017, the Shadow Brokers released the exploits previously patched by Microsoft.If Microsoft's security bulletins had been adhered to, then what came next may never have happened.But it did: On May 12, 2017, the WannaCry ransomware hit the internet, doing massive damage around the world.Then on June 27 came NotPetya, another global ransomware attack.Fast forward a few more months and the banking Trojan Retefe made use of EternalBlue as well.The important thing to note in all of this is that every version of Windows still supported by Microsoft, and since June even those that aren't, are protected against EternalBlue, and thus from WannaCry and other related ransomware attacks.A momentary lapse of patching?WannaCry managed to disrupt 34% of NHS trusts, and it could have been prevented had those trusts only followed the warnings of their own IT organization, NHS Digital.The wider problem is that a lapse in patching critical vulnerabilities isn't isolated to the NHS, as evidenced by the wide spread of WannaCry, NotPetya, and other EternalBlue-leveraging attacks.SEE: The Four Volume Cyber Security Bundle (TechRepublic Academy) Now, just four months after an already-patched exploit disrupted digital business around the world, the Bad Rabbit ransomware has started to spread.While it doesn't use EternalBlue it does use an exploit that also leverages an SMB exploit and is covered by the exact same Microsoft security bulletin.The unfortunate takeaway is that cries to improve security have fallen on deaf ears.Some of the most devastating cyberattacks in recent memory have relied on known exploits, not unique code crafted by a master hacker.When security bulletins are issued, IT professionals need to listen and take action immediately.The top three takeaways for TechRepublic readers: A report issued by the UK's NAO revealed that the NHS, one of the hardest hit by WannaCry, could have prevented the attack with basic IT security practices.The exploit leveraged by WannaCry, NotPetya, and other ransomware was patched several months before the outbreak, but despite multiple warnings the NHS, and IT professionals around the world, failed to patch their systems.The spread of a new ransomware, Bad Rabbit, that uses a nearly identical exploit as that used by WannaCry shows that IT teams aren't paying attention to security in the way that they should.Stay ahead of the security curve: Subscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.Subscribe Also see:
Microsoft ups investment in AR with new Mixed Reality studio for content creators:::::This week, Microsoft announced the launch of Microsoft Reactor in San Franciscothe flagship hub for the tech giant's efforts in mixed reality (MR)."We are at the threshold of the next revolution in computing," Liz Hamren, corporate vice president of Microsoft Devices Marketing, wrote in a blog post.To help fuel this opportunity, we are expanding our investment in technologies that enable the broader ecosystem to create for mixed reality worldwide.Our goal is to reach and support partners, creative agencies, studios, application developers, and others to help them create the most immersive mixed reality content possible."The Microsoft Reactor will act as a community hub for creators and developers to collaborate on mixed reality projects.It will be home to two initiatives: The Mixed Reality Capture Studio and the San Francisco Mixed Reality Academy.At Mixed Reality Capture Studios, Microsoft workers record holographic video to create holograms of people and performances.Then, audiences can interact with the holograms in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), or on 2D screens.SEE: Virtual and augmented reality policy template (Tech Pro Research) Since launching the Microsoft Mixed Reality Capture Studio in Redmond, CA, seven years ago, the company has captured thousands of performances from musicians, athletes, actors, educators, and dancers.Along with the new San Francisco location, a third such studio has opened in London as well.The San Francisco Mixed Reality Academy, also following in the footsteps of its counterpart in Redmond, will provide developers with the tools they need to create content in mixed reality.The most popular courses and workshops offered at the Redmond location will now come to San Francisco, including an introductory discovery program, an expert program, tailored workshops for specific skillsets, and hackathons.These initiatives continue the investments Microsoft has made in the MR space.The company unveiled the Microsoft HoloLensthe world's first fully self-contained holographic computerin 2015, and has since partnered with Ford and other enterprises to improve design work and collaboration.Earlier this month, the company announced a new Windows Mixed Reality headset from Samsung, called the Samsung HMD Odyssey.As TechRepublic's Conner Forrest noted, this is a premium AR headset that could be a strong option for businesses looking to explore the technology.Microsoft may face competition in the mixed reality space from Facebook-owned Oculus, which recently launched Oculus for Business bundle and a less expensive Oculus Go headset for enterprise use.The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers 1.The Microsoft Reactor in San Francisco will act as the flagship hub for the tech giant's efforts in mixed reality, including the San Francisco Mixed Reality Academy and the San Francisco Mixed Reality Capture Studios.2.At Mixed Reality Capture Studios, people can record holographic videos that audiences can interact with in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), or on 2D screens.3.The Mixed Reality Academy will provide developers with the tools they need to create content in mixed reality.Image: Microsoft Stay up to date on all the latest Microsoft news.Click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Microsoft Weekly newsletter.Subscribe Also see
Cisco catches up to Brocade with SAN monitoring software:::::Cisco Systems this week is releasing its first analytics software for fiber channel storage networks.Storage administrators can use analytics software to troubleshoot problems; determine whether applications, the network, or servers are to blame; and predict upcoming issues.SEE: IT leader's guide to big data security (Tech Pro Research) Cisco has long had similar software for its IP-based storage networking gear, hinted at a fiber channel version in April 2017, and previewed it in September 2017.Customers who wanted fiber channel monitoring had to buy from other companies such as Virtual Instruments, which specializes in networking performance tools.The software collects data directly from Cisco's 32 gigabit storage networking cards.The cards can be installed into older 16 gigabit switches in order to backport their function.Cisco is also releasing an application programming interface (API), product manager Adarsh Viswanathan said.Cisco customers have long been at a disadvantage to those of Brocade Communications Systems, which announced a fiber channel monitoring system called Analytics Monitoring Platform in summer 2015.Brocade updated its software several times in 2016 and 2017, but there is no API available, which arguably makes the Cisco version more useful because external products can interact with it.Virtual Instruments will be using that capability in its products."The VirtualWisdom platform ingests those statistics and performs fairly complex correlation and contectualization," from which it recommendation actions for configuring and zoning, Virtual Instruments chief technology office John Gentry explained.Virtual Instruments' software is in version 5.2 since fall 2016 and will see an upgrade to 5.4 in December 2017, Gentry added.But it's expected that high-end customers will still opt for a hardware-based analytics and monitoring product, he said.International Data Corp. analyst Brad Case said the announcements from Cisco and Virtual Instruments are good news for customers.Industry-wide, "It's amazing that it's taken so long for telemetry and streaming analytics to make it to storage area networks and fiber channel...It's amazing that people were without this for so long," Case said.As for Cisco, "They are following, but they've done a good job here," he said.The dream goal is clear: "The network becoming more self-healing and ultimately becoming more self-driving," Case said."But I think we're a long way from it."Cisco also announced expansions to its virtualization software and the new MDS 9122T switch, available by the end of October 2017.Keep up with the latest storage news and analysis by subscribing to our Data Center Trends newsletter.Subscribe Also see
Walmart deploys shelf-scanning robots to free up employees to help customers:::::Walmart is deploying shelf-scanning robots to some 50 stores after initially testing the technology in a few locations, the retail giant announced in a Thursday blog post.While the robots won't necessarily be stocking the shelves themselves, they will be scanning for out-of-stock items, making note of incorrect prices, or checking that the correct label is on a product, the post said.Doing so would free up many employees from having to check the shelves manually.The program is part of Walmart's effort to use automation to handle "repeatable, predictable and manual" tasks, the post said.The goal is to free up workers to be able to spend more time helping customers and selling items.SEE: Hiring kit: Robotics engineer (Tech Pro Research) The initial tests took place in a few Walmart stores across Arkansas, Pennsylvania, and California.As the company rolls it out to 50 more stores, it will rely on customer and employee feedback to shape its future use of automation, the post said.The use of robots to check on out-of-stock items could also help save customers time, guaranteeing that more products would be in stock when they visited a store.Walmart also noted in the post that it hopes the technology makes the shopping experience more convenient.Automationrobotics especiallyhave been a sensitive subject in conversations around the future of work.While Walmart claims to be using the technology to complement its human workers, and free them up to accomplish more complex tasks, the same isn't true for every implementation of the technology.In fast food, for example, a robot named Flippy has been used to make to burgers.Additionally, the growth of autonomous vehicles has also been predicted to eventually be a major disruptor of the trucking market, with manufacturers like Tesla pushing full-steam ahead on such efforts.A widely-cited 2013 Oxford University study estimates that 47% of current US jobs could eventually be taken over by robots.However, many have argued that automation and robotics, while great for menial tasks, won't take over full jobs any time soon.Others have posited that robots killing jobs isn't that big of a deal, because they will create other, more interesting jobs for human workers.Whatever their impact, the use of robots will likely remain controversial for some time.However, a massive firm like Walmart introducing them in their stores, which are likely patronized by a diverse population, could help reduce potential stigmas and get everyday consumers more comfortable with the concept of robot-human collaboration.The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Walmart is using robots to scans shelves for out-of-stock items, incorrect prices, and missing labels, freeing up employees to work with customers.The program started with a few US stores, and will be expanding to 50 more stores, relying on customer and employee feedback as it grows.Robots are controversial, but Walmart's program could help reduce the stigma around them and normalize these automation technologies.Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Next Big Thing newsletter.Subscribe Also see
How to make confusing privacy policies usable:::::Privacy pundits have warned for years of the need to read privacy policies, yet many people who use the internet choose to ignore this advice.Why is that?First and foremost, not everyone has a law degreea requirement to understand the legalese rampant in privacy policies.Another reason is the cost.My TechRepublic article Reading online privacy policies costs us $781 billion per year was written in 2012; one can imagine what the amount would be today.Time spent reading privacy statements is another consideration.The 2008 paper The Cost of Reading Privacy Policies (PDF) written by Dr. Aleecia M. McDonald and Dr. Lorrie Faith Cranor states: "If all American internet users were to annually read the online privacy policies word-for-word each time they visited a new site, the nation would spend about 54 billion hours reading privacy policies.To put these figures in perspective, using the estimate of 244 hours per year to read privacy policies per person means an average of 40 minutes a day."SEE: Information security incident reporting policy (Tech Pro Research) Privacy policies have become more complicated Unfortunately, things have gotten worse."People are confronted with terms of service agreements and privacy policies all the time," writes Florian Schaub, assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, in The Conversation column Nobody reads privacy policies - here's how to fix that."Regulations requiring these notices aim to ensure that consumers can make informed decisions, but current privacy policies miss the mark."It's unclear what information is collected and who sees it Schaub is also concerned that privacy policies are unnecessarily vaguein particular, how collected personal information is used, and with whom it is shared.Schaub uses Google's privacy policy as an example.It states: "We collect information about the services you use and how you use them, like when you watch a video on YouTube, visit a website that uses our advertising services, or view and interact with our ads and content."Schaub's point of contention: What exactly is "information" and how is it used?SEE: Cybersecurity in an IoT and mobile world (free PDF) (TechRepublic) Privacy policies are not readily accessible Another consideration is that privacy policies are becoming increasingly difficult to locate.It is more convenient for app and website developers to post privacy policies on a communal website rather than as an integral part of the application or website.For instance, websites have links to privacy policies at the bottom of web pages; mobile apps link to policies in the app store; and privacy policies of IoT devices are likely posted somewhere on the company's website.Who do privacy policies help?Privacy policies, according to Schaub, serve too many masters.Companies concerned about limiting liability use privacy policies to advertise compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.On the flip side, governmental agencies use privacy policies to enforce compliance with their regulations.As one might expect, this legal jousting places consumers several rungs down on the priority ladder.Break privacy policies into manageable chunks Schaub suggests breaking the documents into smaller pieces."People casually browsing a website only need information about how the site handles their IP address; if what they look at is shared with advertisers; and if they can opt-out of interest-based ads," writes Schaub."Those people do not need to know about rules associated with subscribing to the site's email newsletter, nor how the site handles personal or financial information."Continuing the example, Schaub explains if a visitor to the website decides to sign up for an email newsletter, a privacy notice could pop up with additional pertinent information."These shorter documents should also offer users meaningful choices about what they want a company to door not dowith their data," adds Schaub."For instance, new subscribers might be allowed to choose whether the company can share their email addresses or other contact information with outside marketing companies."Privacy notices could be simpler if they focused on unexpected data collection or sharing.For instance, people with fitness trackers understand the device counts steps, but they typically do not expect other personal data to be collected, compiled, and shared with third parties.SEE: WhatsApp, Facebook to face EU data protection taskforce (ZDNet) Coexist with traditional privacy policies Schaub and other privacy pundits are heartened by the fact that companies like Google and Apple have already incorporated the shorter, consumer-friendly privacy notices into mobile-device firmware."Systems like this give consumers usable information and real choices," concludes Schaub."And they encourage app developers to communicate better with users about privacy."Keep up with the latest IT security news and best practicessubscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.Subscribe Also see
54% of security experts anticipate a successful cyberattack on their enterprise within the year:::::Cybersecurity Trends Spotlight Report 2017 Ask a cybersecurity expert or hacker to name the weakest link in any security plan and they will inevitably answer "the people."Just like everything else, security can't account for the unpredictability of the human factor.In an enterprise setting, employees will circumvent protocols for the sake of convenience, offer bits of information to strangers because they asked nicely, and generally make a mess of any well-laid enterprise-wide cybersecurity plan.According to the Cybersecurity Trends 2017 Spotlight Report (PDF), 54% of cybersecurity professionals surveyed anticipate a successful cyberattack on their organization in the next 12 months.Some 40% of those professionals also view the lack of employee awareness as a major obstacle to stronger cybersecurity.With increases in mobility and the adoption of a BYOD culture in the enterprise, 69% of the surveyed cybersecurity professionals are increasingly concerned about data leakage.Another 64% believe their organizations will have to deal with the download of unsafe applications and the introduction of malware stemming from portable storage devices and the like in the next year.While workforce mobility and the culture of BYOD certainly produce tremendous benefits for modern enterprises, the technology presents a challenging risk for cybersecurity professionals.The only viable approach to overcoming, or at least mitigating, the human factor is to educate employees and establish a comprehensive policy to govern how personal devices, especially portable storage devices, will be introduced to an enterprise network.TechRepublic's premium sister site, Tech Pro Research, offers a ready-made Portable Storage Device Policy to help you regulate and secure usage of portable storage devices to help reduce the risks.Keep up with cybersecurity news and the latest threats to enterprise networks and systems.Subscribe to our free Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.Subscribe Also read...Your thoughts What steps have you taken to combat the potential vulnerabilities created by BYOD programs and portable storage devices?Share your tips and opinions with fellow TechRepublic members.
2 ways to better secure your Linux home directory:::::Linux.That's right, the platform of reliability, flexibility, and security.Even though you do gain significant amounts of security with the open source operating system, no computer is one hundred percent safe.Period.End of story.However, there are things you can do, even with Linux, to make your experience considerably more secure.One often-forgotten area of Linux security is the home directoryotherwise known as ~/.Something to keep in mind, is that particular directory houses user data.In other words, this is the default directory where documents are stored.If this machine is used in a business environment, there could be sensitive information stored within.Let's see what we can do to that home directory to make it more secure.We'll start with the easy tip first.I'll be demonstrating on a freshly installed Ubuntu 17.10 desktop.Permissions One thing you must know is that, out of the box, users can read each other's files in their home directory.That's right, if you have a Linux machine with multiple users, those users can read one another's files (so long as they are housed within their home directory or child folders within the home directory).So if user jack has a file /home/jack/jacksfile, user olivia could read the contents of that file (although not write to it).How do we prevent this?Actually it is quite simple.What we must do is change the permission of each user's home directory.For each user directory, execute the following command: sudo chmod -R 700 /home/USER Where USER is the actual username.When a user attempts to either list the contents of a directory in that user's account (or read a file in that same directory), they will receive a permission denied error.That's the easy way.Now let's take a look at a more complicated method of better security your user's home directory.SEE: Securing Linux policy (Tech Pro Research) Encryption During the installation of the platform, you will be asked if you want to encrypt each user's home directory.If you skip that during installation, worry not, you can do it post-install.Here's how.The first thing you must do is install a couple of extra tools.Back at the terminal window, issue the following command: sudo apt-get install ecryptfs-utils cryptsetup The next step is to create a temporary account with admin privileges.To do this, open up the Settings app and search for Users.In the new window (Figure A), click the Unlock button and type your sudo password.Figure A Next, click the Add User button and fill out the information for the new user (Figure B).Remember, this will be a temporary user, used only for the encryption of another user's home directory.Figure B Once you've created the new user, close out the Settings window and log out of your current user.You'll then log into the temporary user account.From that new user, open up a terminal window and issue the following command to encrypt the user's home directory: sudo ecryptfs-migrate-home -u USER Where USER is the username whose home directory you want to encrypt.You will first be prompted for the temporary user's sudo password, followed by the password for the user whose home directory is being encrypted.The above command will not only encrypt the user's directory, it will also create a backup of the contents of that directory (in case of a problem).This next step is vital.Before you reboot the system, you must do the following: Login as the user whose directory was just encrypted.Issue the command ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase and record the randomly generated passphrase (you will be prompted for your user login password, in order for this to work).If swap space is being used on the system, you should also encrypt it with the command sudo ecryptfs-setup-swap The backup, created by the ecryptfs-migrate-home command is found in /home and will be in the form of USER.XXX (where USER is the username and XXX is a random string of characters).Leave that in place, until you've rebooted a couple of time and verified the user can access all of their files.Once you've taken care of the above, reboot the system and then attempt to log in as the user whose home directory was just encrypted SEE: 20 quick tips to make Linux networking easier (free PDF) (TechRepublic) Cleaning up And that's it.Your home directory is encrypted.Repeat this process for all users who require encrypted home directories.Once you're finished, and have verified everyone can access their files and folders, you can delete the backups as well as the temporary user.Your encrypted home folders are good to go.Automatically sign up for TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter for more hot tips and tricks.Subscribe Also see
How to use secure copy with ssh key authentication:::::Anyone that administers Linux machines knows secure shell well.Without this tool it would be quite a challenge to remotely administer those servers.It would also become quite a bit harder to move files back and forth, at least with a modicum of security.That's where secure copy comes into play.With the scp command, you can copy files to and from a remote Linux server, through an encrypted ssh tunnel.However, with the help of ssh key authentication, you can make that even more secure.I want to show you how you can make use of secure key authentication, along with scp, so you can rest assured your files are being moved back and forth securely.I will be demonstrating on an Elementary OS client and Ubuntu 16.04.1 server and will assume you have secure shell installed and working.ssh keys The first thing that must be done is the creation of an ssh key pair.To do this, open up a terminal window and issue the command: ssh-keygen -t rsa You will be asked to name the file (use the default) and give the keypair a passphrase (Figure A).Figure A Once the key's randomart prints, your key is ready to go.The next step is to copy the key to the remote server.This is done with the command: scp-copy-id USER@SERVER Where USER is the username on the remote server and SERVER is the address of the remote server.You will be prompted for the remote user password.Once you successfully authenticate, the public key will be copied to the server.You're ready to go.SEE: Securing Linux policy (Tech Pro Research) Using scp with your key Now that our keys are in all the right places, let's see how we can make use of them, through scp.The command to send a file to your remote server, using your ssh key, is (assuming you accepted the default name for your ssh key upon creation): scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub FILENAME USER@SERVER:/home/USER/FILENAME Where FILENAME is the name of the file, USER is the username on the remote machine, and SERVER is the address of the remote server.You should be prompted for the ssh key password (not the user password).Once authenticated, the file will be transferred.The same holds true if you need to pull a file from the remote server.The structure of that command would be: scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub USER@SERVER:/home/USER/FILENAME /home/USER/FILENAME Again, you will be asked for your ssh key password and the file will be pulled from the server and copied to the local machine.Forget that password Let's say you are about to undergo a long session of copying files to your server.Sure you could tar them all up into one bigger file, but say they need to all be placed in different directories.That's a lot of typing.You can make this slightly more efficient by using the ssh-agent and ssh-add commands.That's right, using the combination of scp, ssh key authentication, and ssh-agent works really well.What this will do is keep you from having to type that ssh key password every time you issue the scp command.The one caveat to this is that you must remember the PID of the agent session and kill it when you're done.Here's what you have to do.Before issuing the scp command issue eval `ssh-agent` to start the session Make note of the Process ID (PID) you are given when the session starts Add your ssh key to the session with the command ssh-add Start using scp to copy your files That's all there is to it.When you're done with the session, make sure to issue the command kill PID (Where PID is the actual number given to you when you started the ssh-agent session with eval).SEE: 20 quick tips to make Linux networking easier (free PDF) (TechRepublic) Added security and ease And that, my friends, is how you make use of ssh key authentication with the scp command.It may not change your world, but it will certainly make it a bit more secure and, with the help of ssh-agent, a bit easier.Automatically sign up for TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter for more hot tips and tricks.Subscribe Also see
Bad Rabbit: A new Petya-like ransomware that's spreading, but beatable:::::A new form of ransomware, dubbed Bad Rabbit, is infecting computers via drive-by attacks masquerading as Flash updates.This latest form of rapidly spreading ransomware is believed to be a variant of the Petya family; DLLs associated with it share approximately 67% of their code with known Petya variants.Bad Rabbit has the potential to spread fast, but it isn't doing soat least not as fast as 2017's earlier ransomware outbreaks.That doesn't mean it isn't dangerous: It uses serious encryption to lock down infected machines and can use the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol to spread itself to other machines on a network.But it can be avoided by taking a few simple steps.What is Bad Rabbit?The name Bad Rabbit comes from a header on the malware's ransom site, but the real name of this new strain of malware is Diskcoder.d, a name that will sound familiar to anyone with knowledge of the Petya outbreak from earlier this year, which was caused by Diskcoder.c.Diskcoder.d/Bad Rabbit is using a nearly identical ransom note to the one used by Petya and has a countdown timer until the ransom fee increases, just like what Petya did.SEE: 17 tips for protecting Windows computers and Macs from ransomware (free PDF) (TechRepublic) What it doesn't do is use the EternalBlue exploit Petya used to spread, instead relying on another SMB exploit known as EternalRomance, which was also part of the Shadow Brokers leak from earlier this year.What makes Bad Rabbit particularly adept at using SMB exploits for lateral movement is a new feature that Petya lacked: a list of common usernames and passwords to brute force its way to other machines.In short, it's not Petya (or NotPetya), but it looks, feels, and behaves a lot like it.Where Bad Rabbit is striking Cisco's Talos security research group, and several other threat analyst organizations, report that Bad Rabbit is primarily attacking businesses in Russia and Eastern Europe.Kaspersky Labs reports that Ukraine, Germany, and Turkey have also been affected, with the bulk of targets being in Russia.Avast added Poland and South Korea to the list of affected nations as well.The infections have hit three media and news organizations in Russia, along with several transportation agencies in Ukraine, leading Kaspersky Labs to assert that it is an attack targeted against corporate networks.Bad Rabbit droppers have been found on a variety of siteseven one located in the USaccording to a tweet from Costin Raiu, director of Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Labs.Raiu also said that the network of compromised sites had been set up by Bad Rabbit's distributors since July 2017.Image: iStock/Gilles_Paire How to avoid a Bad Rabbit outbreak Those hoping to protect their networks from Bad Rabbit have a few things going for them.First off, it has to be manually downloaded and installed via a fake Flash update.If antivirus software catches the executable at any stage, or if the user simply doesn't install it, then it can't do any harm.Second, several security products claim to protect against Bad Rabbit, including Kaspersky and ESET.Those running antivirus software should double-check to see if theirs protects against it, and be sure that security definitions are up to date.SEE: Cyber Security Volume IV: End Point Protection (TechRepublic Academy) Third, It's known what files Bad Rabbit uses to execute its code, and they can be blocked.Both are located in the Windows directory of the C: drive and are called infpub.dat and cscc.dat.Those running Windows 10's Fall Creators Update should also be sure they have enabled Controlled Folder Access, which blocks any application from making changes to specified files and directories.Lastly, if you're concerned about Bad Rabbit spreading laterally through your network there's a simple solution: Be sure that all the latest Windows Security Bulletins have been installedBad Rabbit's propagation method was shut down in June 2017, so if it's spreading beyond a single infected machine on your network you know who to blame.The top three takeaways for TechRepublic readers: A new Petya ransomware variant, called Bad Rabbit, is spreading through Russia and other Eastern European countries.It has already attacked several media organizations and transportation entities in Ukraine.Bad Rabbit infects machines using a fake Flash update download.It can spread laterally through a network using the EternalRomance SMB exploit released by the Shadow Brokers in mid 2017.Stopping the spread of Bad Rabbit has already begun, and there are several things IT professionals can do to prevent their networks from being infected: Make sure Windows Security Bulletins are all installed, and be sure to check to see if your antivirus software protects against it, which several have claimed they do.Stay on top of the latest threats by subscribing to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.Subscribe Also see:

How the Missouri Photo Workshop built a network in a day to handle 850GB of video and photos:::::In 1949, photography instructors at the University of Missouri joined with legendary photojournalists from the era to hold the first Missouri Photo Workshop.Nearly seven decades later, the workshop is still going strong, selecting a new small town in the midwestern state to document each year.It's the longest-running documentary photography workshop in the US.But the days of the darkroom are long gone, and the workshop each September is faced with setting up a network to handle tens of thousands of images, hundreds of gigabytes of video, and wireless access points for more than 100 people.All out of thin air."The main obstacle every year is the venue itself," said Hany Hawasly, a New York-based video producer and Mizzou graduate who returns each year to help solve the workshop's IT solutions."We are pretty much limited to whatever space there is and whatever internet connectivity they have to offer.""One year, actually, the whole town didn't have any connection faster than 5 mbps, and that was tough," he said."We have to adapt, and we have less than a day to figure it out."By the time the weeklong workshop concludes, more than 15,000 images have been processed, 400 large prints have been made, and 850GB of data has been created.All of the images have to be organized, renamed and catalogued.Dozens of hours of video is shot by a workshop crew that produces a documentary film about the week's experience.All of that data must be backed up throughout the week, to ensure the archive is available to future generations of visual journalists.All published work is then presented at the end of the week to the community at a public viewing, and displayed on the Missouri Photo Workshop's website.For more about digital transformation, subscribe to our Next Big Thing newsletter.Subscribe Also see:
Dr. Alexa? What Amazon might do in health care:::::(Photo: Amazon.com) SAN FRANCISCO Paging Dr. Alexa?As the U.S. health care industry shifts and slides, Amazon is quietly moving in directions that suggest the company may be planning to deliver prescriptions, not just books, clothes and other merchandise.Its entirely likely Amazon will play a role in health care.Theyre a company thats been very disruptive to multiple industries," said Wendell Potter, a health care industry critic."I bet you theyve been looking at healthcare for some time there are opportunities there for them, Speculation has intensified after the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Thursday that Amazon has received approval for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12 states.They include Nevada, Arizona, North Dakota, Louisiana, Alabama, New Jersey, Michigan, Connecticut, Idaho, New Hampshire, Oregon and Tennessee.An application is currently pending in the Maine.Amazon declined to comment on the report.While no outsiders know the famously secretive company's plans, experts and analysts say they can easily see a place for an "Amazon-like company" in the health care market.A lot of (health care) companies are already looking to see what they can learn from Amazon, said Marcus Ehrhardt, partner of the consulting firm PwCs pharma and life sciences division.Could U.S. consumers one day find themselves logging in to Amazon Healthcare Prime, or asking Dr. Alexa Amazon's popular Echo home assistance device uses a digital voice that answers to the name Alexa what they should do about their cough?A complex market The licenses Amazon has so far sought are far from what's needed to begin shipping drugs to consumers.They give it the ability to sell medical professional-use-only products such as sutures, ultrasound gel and syringes for use in medical and dental offices or hospitals, the company said.Delivering prescription drugs might seem like simply a transportation issue, but it's actually not.Neither Amazon nor any other online seller can just put drugs next to toys, books and household staples in its warehouses and ship them all in the same box to homes due to complex, state-based regulations around prescriptions, said Ehrhardt.But Amazon does have expertise that makes it a natural candidate to look for ideas that would reform the U.S. healthcare industry as it tries to control costs, said Gil Irwin, PwC deals partner.Seattle-based Amazon excels at analyzing enormous amounts of data and then knowing how to use that information to motivate customers, he notes.(Photo: Cerner Corp) Amazon, for example, might see that a customer has bought cough drops every week for the last month, and went to the doctor for a cold six weeks before but never filled their prescription.Amazon, or an Amazon-like company could use that kind of insight to encourage consumers to go back to the doctor, or drop by a nearby clinic for a nurse practitioner to examine them, said Irwin.That could help solve the problem of getting the wrong care, and overall lowering expenses.Dr. Alexa, I presume?Potter, who recently launched Tarbell.com, a site that focuses on corporate influence over health care, can see a role for Amazons digital assistant Alexa.His first job in health care was setting up a hotline for a hospital so patients could talk to a nurse about their symptoms and get advice on what to do.Why cant Alexa do that?Potter asked.While patients would have to be clear that Alexa is neither doctor nor nurse, it could be a helpful way to get them talking to the right person, or get the right information to them quickly simply by asking questions, he said.Amazon's possible entry into health care is an equally intriguing and terrifying thought, said Sucharita Mulpuru, an Amazon analyst with Forrester.One day, we could tell Echo our ailments and have recommendations and potentially some drug recommendations, which they could fulfill if they also

multi-year deal that would add FedEx pick-up and drop-off service for pre-packaged and pre-labeled packages at 8,000 Walgreens stores.At the time of the announcement, the plan was aimed at having the service in all Walgreens locations by 2018.However, during Walgreens earnings call with financial analysts on Oct. 25, company executives said the FedEx service has already launched in most stores

These six tips will help you stay safe while online shopping:::::These six tips will help you stay safe during the holiday shopping season.(Photo: Getty Images) Love online shopping?You're not alone.The National Retail Federation predicts online retail will grow 8-12% in 2017, up to three times higher than the growth rate of total retail sales.Clearly, many enjoy the benefits of online shopping.You dont have to fight traffic to drive to the mall and circle the parking lot.Online stores are open 24/7, and you can wear your pajamas.Its easy to compare prices between multiple retailers and read both customer and professional reviews of products before you buy.Product selection is vast, to say the least, including many stores and unique items sold outside of the country.And, hey, products are shipped right to your door (and with Amazon Key, even dropped inside your door, too).But to shop online safely, and protect your personal identity from malicious types, take heed of these online shopping safety tips, ahead of next months Black Friday and Cyber Monday.Look for the padlock Always use a secure Internet connection when making a purchase.Reputable websites use technologies such as SSL (Secure Socket Layer) that encrypt data during transmission.What does that mean to you?Look for the little padlock in the address bar or a URL that starts with https instead of http, as the s stands for secure.Some browsers will tell you its safe to give out your credit card by showing you a green address bar, while unprotected ones will be highlighted in red.Use a secure payment method Only shop on sites that take secure payment methods, such as credit cards and PayPal, as they likely give you buyer protection just in case theres a dispute.In other words, you wont be held liable for fraudulent charges.Even before it gets to that, you might be notified by your credit card company or bank if suspicious activity is detected.Its always a good idea to review your account transactions online or go through monthly paper statements to see if anything looks questionable.Beware of sites and apps that only accept money orders, wire transfers, or checks.Look for well-known security labels such as DigiCert, VeriSign, and other seals.Password pointers A strong password is at least seven characters long, has a combination of letters, numbers and symbols, and with some uppercase characters, too.Change passwords routinely.Or use password management apps if youre worried you wont remember the password.Many opt for a passphrase instead of a password, which is typically a long sequence of strung-together words, but perhaps with a number and symbol in there, too.For example, the sentence My dog Eddie has a birthday May 15!could be used to create a passphrase like Md3habM15!It's good to reset your shopping passwords every so often, just in case someone guesses them, or if theres a data breach at an online retailer.And never use the same password for all online shopping sites (or other Web activities, like online banking), as once someone guesses one password, theyll have free reign over everything else.The National Retail Federation expects online retail sales to grow between 8% and 12% in 2017.(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Do your homework, dont be naive When on marketplaces like eBay, check the sellers reputation and read comments before buying a product to see what the experience was like for past customers.You can always ask a question of a seller and reputable ones will reply in a timely manner.Also, read the item description carefully before you buy, including where the seller is located, shipping charges, if the product is new or used, refund and return policies, and payment methods accepted.Also, don't forget about the No.1 tip about shopping: If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.Avoid unbelievably hot deals from unknown merchants, such as someone selling an iPhone 8 for $200.Ignore emails or texts that claim to be from a retailer (or your bank or Internet Service Provider).These phishing attempts look legit, but it they ask you to confirm your financial or personal details on a website, theyre fake.Theyre trying to lure you to click a link in the email, which takes you to an authentic-looking website, and fool you into typing in information.Watch out for fake shopping apps As we saw last year, hundreds of phony retail apps popped up in Apples App Store and Google Play (for Android devices), in the hopes of tricking shoppers into downloading and using them.Similar to phishing emails that look like theyre from legitimate stores, these counterfeit apps complete with an authentic-looking logo and marketing messaging want your credit card information to steal your identity.Some have been found to contain malware (malicious software) that can also infect a mobile device, while others ask you to log in with Facebook credentials to lift personal data.U.S. consumers have steadily increased how much they shop on the internet.(Photo: Getty Images) Be sure youre downloading the legitimate app by getting it from the companys official website or, if downloading from an app store directly, check to see its been around for a few years and has high ratings from many users.Never be the first to download a new shopping app.If youre interacting with brands on social media, make sure theyre verified, with the little blue checkmark by their profile, which means the company is legit.Avoid shopping on hotspots Try not to do any online shopping when you're using a public computer (such as in an airport lounge) or when you're using a public Wi-Fi network (say, at your favorite coffee shop or in a hotel lobby).You never know if your information is being tracked and logged so it's best to wait until you get home.Or use your smartphone as a personal hotspot, which is safer than free Wi-Fi.Another tip is to use gift cards, like many retailers offer, as a smart way to shop without providing any financial information.On a related note, keep your devices up to date by turning on automatic updates.This includes your web browser and third-party add-ons, which could warn you if you land on suspicious websites.Always have good anti-malware (anti-malicious software) installed to catch threats like viruses.Follow Marc on Twitter: @marc_saltzman.E-mail him at

Doctor says he diagnosed his own cancer with iPhone ultrasound machine:::::The Butterfly iQ.(Photo: Butterfly Network) With the right device, it appears the iPhone can even detect cancer.John Martin, the chief medical officer for Butterfly Network was testing out a device called Butterfly iQ, a small imaging machine for ultrasounds compatible with the iPhone.According to MIT Technology Review, Martin noticed an unusual discomfort in his throat, so he ran the device similar in design to an electric shaver across his throat.He discovered a mass that turned out to be squamous cell cancer.Martin has since undergone surgery and radiation."I felt something funny in my neck, connected the probe to my phone, did an ultrasound, and there it was: My tumor," said Martin in a testimonial on Butterfly Network's website.According to the website for Butterfly iQ, the device sells for under $2,000.According to health industry website Modern Healthcare, the average price for ultrasound systems is $115,000, with low-end systems costing $25,000.The device is aimed at healthcare practitioners and facilities in the U.S. licensed to perform ultrasounds.It ships in early 2018, and works with iPhone models as far back as the iPhone SE.A big reason the device is much cheaper than a traditional ultrasound machine is most of the technology is housed within a microchip."Just as putting a camera on a semiconductor chip made photography accessible to anyone with a smartphone and putting a computer on a chip enabled the revolution in personal computing before that, Butterfly's Ultrasound-on-a-Chip technology enables a low-cost window into the human body, making high-quality diagnostic imaging accessible to anyone," said Dr. Jonathan Rothberg, founder and chairman of Butterfly Network Martin said it was while waiting for biopsy results to return on his mass and waiting for radiation therapy he considered how valuable time is when treating patients."The sooner we make a diagnosis, the sooner we start treatment," said Martin."The secret behind our device is we're conquering time."Follow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2he3Nt6
Facebook makes political ads more transparent ahead of Russia hearings:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Facebook is apparently clamping down on the distribution of political advertisers using the social media platform.Buzz60 Facebook says it will begin disclosing more about political ads that run on the giant social network ahead of next week's Russia hearings.(Photo: Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO Facebook says it will begin disclosing more about political ads that run on the giant social network ahead of next week's congressional hearings in which the nation's technology giants will testify about Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election.Federal political advertisers will have to verify their identities and locations and ads will carry a disclosure saying who paid for them.Facebook is also testing a feature that lets anyone visit any page on Facebook and see what ads that page is running, whether they are political in nature or not.The new rules for political ads bring Facebook closer to what's required of other media such as television, an effort to persuade lawmakers the company is capable of policing itself.Pressure on Facebook is intensifying in Washington.Last week senators introduced a bipartisan bill, the Honest Ads Act, that would require the companies to disclose who is paying for political ads that appear on their online platforms.The legislation by Sens.Mark Warner, D-Va., Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and John McCain, R-Ariz., comes in the wake of damaging revelations that Kremlin-linked groups exploited American social media to influence the 2016 presidential election."When Russians took advantage of loopholes in our laws and bought ads to divide Americans and influence our election it was a big wake-up call.The lack of transparency and accountability in online political advertising is a threat to our democracy," Klobuchar said in a statement Friday."Its good to see companies taking these concerns seriously and I appreciate that Facebook is taking some new significant steps, but fixing this problem cannot be done with a patchwork of changes by individual platforms."Facebook says it's adding thousands of people to its teams and will start using machine learning to identify political ads, just as it does spam.And the Menlo Park, Calif., company plans to build an archive of federal election ads so people can look up campaigns."These changes will make it easier to see what different groups are trying to communicate around elections and will make it harder for anyone to break the rules.This won't stop all bad actors, but it's one of many important steps forward," CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post.More: Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook fake news didn't sway election More: Facebook political ads are coming out of the shadows why you should care More: Twitter bans Russia-backed outlets RT and Sputnik from advertising over election meddling Facebook, which for years resisted complying with federal ad disclosure rules that apply to other types of media, isn't the only company trying to show lawmakers it's taking seriously foreign efforts to manipulate the American electorate.On Thursday, Twitter said it would mandate disclosures for political ads and banned Kremlin-backed media companies Russia Today and Sputnik from advertising on the social media service.Facebook this month turned over thousands of Russian ads to congressional investigators.It's an about face-for Zuckerberg, who called it a "pretty crazy idea" that Facebook had any influence over the outcome of the election.He has since apologized for dismissing the idea."We need Congress to pass my bipartisan Honest Ads Act to ensure all major online platforms are held to the same standards in place as broadcasters including advertisements for issues of national legislative importance," Klobuchar said.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2zL4H78
Want the iPhone X? It doesn’t have to cost you $1,000:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE The iPhone X is expected to sell out fast--Jefferson Graham has tips on how to navigate the pre-order sales process on #TalkingTech.(Photo: Apple) The new iPhone X has given Apple fans plenty of reasons to be excited.Its the first drastically redesigned iPhone in ten years, with a full edge-to-edge OLED display, facial recognition and improved cameras that are ready for augmented reality.It also is the first with a nearly $1,000 starting price tag.While the price may be off-putting, with pre-orders set to begin this Friday, carrier offers have begun to appear and carry some good news.Assuming you have a semi-recent iPhone (iPhone 6 or later) or one of a variety of Android devices that aren't cracked, broken or water-damaged, you should be able to save several hundred dollars off the cost of the X, in many cases getting you more credit for your old phone than you would by trading it in to an online "reCommerce" site like Gazelle or uSell.Here's a breakdown of who will pay what.More: iPhone X orders: Here's how to nab one if you simply cannot wait More: Follow USA TODAY Money and Tech on Facebook First, the catch: Payment plans As to be expected, there is a catch with all of these deals.Each carrier is offering the iPhone X trade-in, assuming you finance the phone on one of their respective monthly payment plans.These plans are the equivalent of the old two-year contracts, allowing you to get the phone at a discount while presumably keeping you locked into a carrier for the next 12-24 months.The one (current) bright side is that thanks to increased competition, all the major carriers have various promotions where they are willing to buy you out of your current payment plan so long as you agree to switch to their network.More: T-Mobile plus Sprint: If you're a customer, here's why a merger would matter Sprint Sprint has one of the better trade-in deals available, offering $350 off the cost of an iPhone X if you trade in an iPhone 6 or later or if you trade in one of a variety of recent Android phones (including the Samsung Galaxy S7, S7 Edge, S8 and S8 Plus).As with other discounts, the credits will be applied to your monthly bill within two billing cycles, allowing you to get the 64GB iPhone X for $22.22 per month for 18 months on the company's Sprint Flex payment plan.The "limited time" offer is available to both new and existing subscribers and also includes the company's "iPhone Forever" program which will allow you to upgrade to next year's presumed newest iPhone.(Photo: Apple) T-Mobile T-Mobile will give you $300 off an iPhone X with the trade-in of a "qualifying device", a list that includes the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, 6S and 6S Plus, 7 and 7 Plus and the 8 and 8 Plus.The discount will be doled out as monthly bill credits over 24 months.Like Sprint, T-Mobile's program will allow you to trade in your iPhone X for a new device once 50% of the device has been paid off.T-Mobile's payment plans for the iPhone X range from $279.99 down and $30 per month for the 64GB model to $429.99 down and $30 a month for the 256GB version, after which you own the phone.Those who would prefer to lease the phone, and gain the flexibility to upgrade to a different device once every 30 days, can get the 64GB iPhone X for $0 upfront and monthly payments of $41.56 over 18 months as part of the company's "Jump on Demand" program.The 256GB iPhone X is $429.99 upfront and then $24 per month under this program.More: Genius new uses for that old iPhone More: How to make the most money selling your old iPhone Verizon Have an iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, 7 or 7 Plus?Verizon will give you $300 off a new iPhone X.

How much reach do Facebook and Twitter have? Data may not be as accurate as you think:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Twitter says it could turn its first ever profit in the fourth quarter, after cutting expenses and finding sources of revenue beyond advertising.Angela Moore reports.Video provided by Reuters Newslook Twitter headquarters in San Francisco (Photo: Eric Risberg, Associated Press) SAN FRANCISCO Data-driven Internet companies that boast they can precisely target advertising down to users' laundry detergent and their favorite TV shows are getting a reputation for overstating their reach.On Thursday Twitter admitted it had miscounted its monthly user numbers for three years, raising tough questions for social media companies about how accurate this data is.The revelation came as Twitter, Facebook and Google face intensifying scrutiny over hundreds of fake accounts from Russia that purchased political advertising to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.As they prepare to be hauled before Senate and House intelligence committees next week to testify on how Russia may have advertised on their services to sway public sentiment, these colossal information portals are being cast as the Wild West of the Internet, with too few checks and balances on their growing power over people's time and advertisers' pocketbooks."I believe it's an honest mistake but it doesn't look good because it's an overstatement and when they have mistakes it's always overstating and not understating," Dennis Yu, chief technology officer of BlitzMetrics, said of the Twitter measurement error.More: Twitter overcounted active users since 2014; shares surge More: Twitter bans Russia-backed outlets RT and Sputnik from advertising over election meddling More: Facebook apologizes for inflating video numbers The challenge: It's not as simple as you might imagine to figure out how many people use a social media service.Counting errors can occur as they did with Twitter.Social media companies also include all kinds of users, from businesses to publishers.Duplicate accounts when a person has more than one Facebook or Twitter account, say one for themselves, one for their business, one for their child and another for their pet can also inflate numbers.And then there are the fake accounts and accounts that are run by bots, not humans, that these companies are constantly trying to root out and remove.Duplicates and bots That's why third-party measurements often conflict with measurements provided by the companies themselves, says eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson.For example, eMarketer factored out bots, duplicate accounts and spam accounts to estimate that Facebook had 1.37 billion monthly active users in 2016.Facebook calculated it had 1.86 billion monthly users at the end of 2016."Duplicate" accounts (an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her main account) represented 6% of monthly active users and fake accounts represented 1% of its user base in 2016, according to Facebook."Digital media measurement has never been as exact a science as you would think," Williamson said."People used to call the Internet 'the most measurable medium,' but there have been many instances over the years where things like user counts have been under- or over-stated."More: Twitter removed 200 Russian accounts that targeted Facebook users during election More: Those Russian political ads on Facebook?Yep, they ran on Instagram, too Twitter, which has struggled to add users amid withering competition from Google, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, on Thursday revised down its monthly active users by 1 million to 2 million for each of the past three quarters.It said it miscalculated monthly users because it included third party applications that should not have been counted."It's important to note that since it's a small absolute number on a base of over 300 million (monthly active users), that historical growth rates and absolute numbers really don't change very much," Twitter's chief financial officer Ned Segal said during a conference call with analysts.Investors shrugged at the disclosure.But this isn't the first time Twitter has had a problem with how it's measuring its audience.In 2016, it briefly miscalculated metrics on video ad campaigns, which it blamed on a technical error.Twitter's also constantly trying to weed out fake or spambot accounts.As much as 15% of Twitter's user base may be bots, according to research from the University of Southern California and Indiana University.Automated systems catch more than 3.2 million suspicious accounts a week, Twitter says.Spam accounts that Twitter has identified are not included in the active user numbers reported to shareholders, the company says.And Twitter estimates that fake or spam accounts represent less than 5% of its monthly active users.Twitter is far from the only company facing criticism over measurement errors.Facebook vs. the U.S. Census Facebook (Photo: Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty Images) In September Facebook was accused of overestimating its reach with young people.That's when Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser noted that Facebook claimed to advertisers it could reach 25 million more young Americans than the U.S. Census reports exist.According to Facebook's Ad Manager, a planning tool for marketers to consult before purchasing ad campaigns, advertisers could reach 41 million 18- to 24-year-olds in the U.S. and 60 million 25- to 34-year-olds.Wieser pointed out that the census counted just 31 million 18-to-24-year-olds and 45 million 25-to-34-year-olds last year.Facebook said the numbers are self-reported by users and include non-residents and it said the estimates are based on "Facebook user behaviors, user demographics, location data from devices and other factors."The estimated reach advertisers are given does not determine how much they pay for the ads and advertisers mostly focus on how well their campaigns perform.Still, the discrepancy has shaken the confidence of advertisers who are keen on Facebook's targeting power and extensive reach but are frustrated by a series of audience measurement misstatements including how long and how often people watch videos and read articles on Facebook."Advertisers are frustrated, and the underlying drivers may be the source of the concerns that regulators and politicians have about them in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere," Wieser said."However, were not seeing it in the numbers yet, which is why investors havent expressed much concern."More: Facebook: 10 million people saw Russia-backed election ads More: USA TODAY Poll: Facebook faulted for not doing more on Russian ads in 2016 race Those misstatements have escalated calls for independent oversight and for the companies to submit to measurement conducted by third-party companies.This week Twitter agreed to be audited through the Media Rating Council, the media industrys measurement watchdog.The audit will evaluate how accurately the social media company reports ad impressions and video views.The decision follows Facebook's move earlier this year to allow the information it provides advertisers to be audited by the Media Rating Council.It also says it's offering new tools for advertisers to judge the performance of their campaigns."Any company that does business with a digital publisher shouldnt let them grade their own homework," Williamson said."Its always going to make sense to look to other sources of information about usage, and to ask questions if something doesnt seem right."Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2zIxQQy
7 steps for crafting the perfect password:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Kim Komando tells you what to do, and what old advice to ignore, about creating passwords that will thwart hackers.The man who said use capital letters, special characters and numbers in your password is now taking back that advice.(Photo: hanieriani, Getty Images/iStockphoto) Your password can ruin your life.I know that sounds dramatic, but its true.If someone figures out the password to your email, youre in trouble.Social media?Even worse.Once hackers access your online bank account, they can wreck your finances, and you may feel the repercussions of that break-in for years.It seems not a week goes by that we dont hear about another data breach.How do you know if the hackers have your info?Find out whether your email has been hacked or stolen.Most of us have the wrong idea about passwords.We think they have to be convoluted messes, like F$%Th5l2K!&.This theory reigned for yearsthat passwords should be nonsensical and hard to remember.It started in 2003 with guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which insisted on random combinations of numbers, letters, and symbols.The organizations manager, Bill Burr, spread this gospel for years.But in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, he admitted that this wasnt nearly as effective as hed thought.Thanks to a new round of research, cyber-security experts have changed their tune.Yes, you should still avoid guessable passwords like p@ssword1 or letmein.But a strong password also can be logical, fluid and easy to remember.More: Password expert says he was wrong: Numbers, capital letters and symbols are useless 1.Passwords should withstand 100 guesses This is the most important part: No matter what your password is, it should withstand 100 guesses, which means it shouldnt be tied to any public information about you or your family.Hackers often turn to your social media profiles to find information about you, and a little data goes a long way, such as your birthday and the name of your pet.Experts believe that criminals can guess the average person's password nearly 73% of the time, and they can often access other accounts by using slight variations on the same password.Facebook is all about making it easy to share your life with your friends and family.Unfortunately, there are some things you shouldn't share online.These bits of information can put you in danger of identity theft, losing your job or causing other major headaches.Here are five of the biggest offenders you should not put on your profile.More Kim Komando: How to stop ads from following you online 2.Use a phrase Instead of thinking of your password as a secret code, think of it as a passphrase.These are strings of words that are both easy to memorize but hard for anyone else to crack.Suppose you wanted to be an astronaut when you were a kid, and your favorite color is fuschia.You have never mentioned these facts online, and only your Mom knows such trivia about you.You could compose a passphrase like ilikefuschiaastronauts.Youll never forget it, and the passphrase will confound hackers for (literally) centuries.I actually recommended and told how to create a great passphrase a little over a year ago.The advice is still valid.Go here to come up with your own.3.Go long You might want to sit down for this one: The new NIST guidelines suggest allowing users to create passwords up to 64 characters in length.As if that isnt weird enough, the guidelines also allow spaces between words.While many people just try to meet the bare minimum requirement of using eight characters, you will get a much stronger password by stretching things out.You could theoretically create a complex list or sentence, which still makes perfect sense to you.You could list all your pets names from childhood, like fluffy princess rex spike booboo chewie, or all the streets on the way to your favorite restaurant, like academy main washington ohio central.Easy to remember.Hard to crack.More: If you're going to use your pet's name as a password, it better be good 4.Dont change your password until you have to Until recently, consumers were advised to change their passwords every three months.But as NISTs Paul Grassi recently told the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Expiration isnt a motivator to create a brand new password, its motivation to shift one character so you can remember the password.If youve created a strong password, then dont worry about changing it out all the time.Just stick with it unless youve been notified of a security breach that requires a password reset.More Komando: How to create passwords that are easy to remember 5.Choose something memorable Remember, each password should be unique, but they dont have to be cumbersome.The NIST calls passwords memorized secrets.You want to avoid the temptation to write down passwords, so pick a password that has enough meaning to you to stay in your mind.Im not a big fan of password managers.I commit my passwords to memory.But if you cannot do that, heres a free program that will help you store your passwords safely and easily.6.Get creative with characters It may take websites some time to catch up to the latest NIST guidelines, but you can still create a memorable password that meets current restrictions.Go back to Burrs advice on passphrases.You might choose something like ArizonaCardinalsfootballisnumber1!or Igivemyjob1000%everyday.Those meet the requirements of having at least eight characters, a special character, and upper and lowercase letters.7.Use two-factor identification While passwords help protect your information, cyber-criminals are more sophisticated than ever.If they break into your accounts, you may not recognize the damage until its too late.Months passed before the public learned about the Equifax breach, and its hard to assess how much information has been leaked, nor how it will be used.If you havent checked to see if your personal details are in the hands of cyber crooks, do it now.Thats why two-factor identification is so important.Using text-messages, emails or special apps, an account-holder will receive a notification every time a password is changed, entered on a new device, or at a new location.You will have to verify that its you attempting to gain access.How do you do this?Ill walk you through just a few steps to set it up.What questions do you have?Call my national radio show and click here to find it on your local radio

Amazon now employs half a million people, up 77% vs. a year ago:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Amazon is holding a giant job fair and plans to offer thousands of jobs at nearly a dozen U.S. warehouses.Nearly 40,000 of the 50,000 packing, sorting and shipping jobs will be full time.AP A logo for Amazon appears on a logistics center near Berlin.(Photo: John MacDougall, AFP/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO Amazon has been on a hiring spree, increasing its staff by 77% in the past year to 541,900 full and part-time workers, due largely to its purchase of Whole Foods as well as a rapid buildout of its regional warehouses.That number doesn't include the more than 120,000 seasonal jobs it says it expects to hire for over the holidays.Another staffing bump came from Amazon's acquisition of Souq.com, a Middle East-based e-commerce company, in July.Amazon's headcount is up 42% year over year without Souq and Whole Foods included, staff said on the company's earnings call Thursday afternoon.That places Amazon second only to Walmart, with 2.3 million workers, among publicly-traded U.S. companies.Kroger, with 433,000, is No.3, according to company filings.The surge comes as the Seattle-based company announced its third-quarter earnings, which blew past Wall Street's expectations and caused its stock to leap 7.7%, to $1,045 per share in after-hours trading.The consensus estimate from S&P Capital IQ had been for a Amazon loss of one cent per share.Amazon smashed that with a gain of 52 cents per share.Despite increased spending, including of the newly-completed purchase of Whole Foods Markets for $13.7 billion in August, net income rose to $256 million from $252 million a year ago.The company reported revenue of $43.7 billion, up 34%, helped by $1.3 billion in sales at Whole Foods.In its release, Amazon vowed to continue the downward pressure on prices at often-pricey Whole Foods, saying "the two companies together will pursue the vision of making high-quality, natural and organic food affordable to everyone."The staffing numbers come as 238 cities nationwide are vying to be the location of the company's second headquarters, eager for the high-paying tech jobs and economic impact one of America's biggest companies would bring.It expects to employ 50,000 in its second headquarters.Once again, Amazon's bottom line was buoyed by its hugely profitable cloud services division, AWS.This quarter it had revenue $4.58 billion.More: New Amazon Key lets the delivery driver leave packages inside the front door More: Amazon gets 238 proposals for its second headquarters More: Amazon Prime is popular, but in three-quarters of all U.S homes?That's open to debate Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2zGIsPE

Tesla's $1,000 car referral purchase credit is about to go 'poof':::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE As the founder of Tesla, Elon Musk is arguably at the forefront of electric vehicles, and yet the billionaire admits to owning two gas cars!Buzz60 Model 3.(Photo: Tesla) SAN FRANCISCO If you're in the market for a long-range electric car, you've got until Wednesday to take advantage of a $1,000 referral credit to buy a new Tesla.Existing owners who referred prospective buyers to Tesla are still granted a range of thank-you gifts.But new buyers lured to the brand by a referral from a current owner have just a few days left to take advantage of a credit toward their purchase.That $1,000 referral purchase credit is valid for anyone placing a Tesla order by day's end on Halloween.One perk to those who procrastinate and buy a Tesla after the deadline remains intact: Use of the company's roadside Superchargers for quick range-extending battery fillups for life.More: Tesla delivers solar power to Puerto Rico hospital More: Consumer Reports rejects Tesla's criticism of its ratings More: Report: Tesla reaches deal to build factory in China The electric automaker reiterated the upcoming changes in a blog post that also outlines what's in it for referring owners.For those referring one or two new buyers, those gifts include a Tesla wall connector for car charging or an electric toy Tesla for children.Anyone sending three customers Tesla's way gets sport wheels or one week with a Model S or X.At the five-buyer referral level, a Tesla owner get an invite for two to Tesla's next big product unveiling.Next on that list should be a Los Angeles demo of the company's self-driving semi truck, whose debut was pushed off to Nov. 16 after CEO Elon Musk noted that the company's priority was getting out of "production hell" on its pivotal new entry-level sedan, the Model 3.Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, discusses new technologies that before an event for Tesla owners and the media held at the Hawthorne Airport on Oct. 9, 2014.In the background is a Tesla model P85D.(Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY) The Model 3, which starts at the mass-market price of $35,000, is considered critical to vaulting Tesla from being a niche 100,000-unit-a-year automaker that loses money on every car into a mass-market EV player pumping out around 500,000 vehicles a year.Beyond the production line issues, Tesla also has been dismissing employees for what it describes as performance reasons.Reports indicate that between Tesla and SolarCity, the company has let go hundreds of workers, which it says it plans to replace.Follow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hgpZCM
Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' BMW Z8 sports car goes up for auction:::::Steve Jobs bought this BMW Z8 new in 2000.It's now selling for triple its original price.(Photo: Karissa Hosek 2017 Courtesy of) SAN FRANCISCO What gave birth to the Apple iPhone?It could well have been the balky Motorola flip phone that came with the BMW Z8 that Apple cofounder Steve Jobs bought new in 2000.That's according to RM Sotheby's, the auction house that will be selling Jobs' silver-over-black roadster at its upcoming "Icons" event in New York on Dec. 6.Steve Jobs was a private man but he registered this car in his own name at his personal address, and kept the BMW Z8 for three years.(Photo: RM Sotheby's) The no-reserve price estimate: between $300,000 and $400,000.Is there a premium because it was owned by a tech legend?You better believe it.New the Z8 cost $128,000, and today most used models go for between $170,000 and $250,000.The Z8 is still considered one of BMW's most striking automotive designs, based as it was on the iconic '50s 507 designed by Raymond Loewy.But while the Z8's swooping sheetmetal clearly seduced Jobs, its standard-issue flip phone was something "he was known to have hated," according to RM Sotheby's.Although Jobs changed cars often and wasn't known as a keen car enthusiast or collector RM Sotheby's contends that he was steered toward this purchase by known car geek and fellow techie, Oracle founder Larry Ellison he did keep this car, which was registered in his name, until 2003.The BMW Z8 featured some of the most innovative automotive design available in 2000, with a distinct nod to the past.(Photo: Karissa Hosek 2017 Courtesy of) At that point, his Apple team was hard at work on what would become the iPhone, which launched in 2007.Jobs passed away in 2011.Not only was the Z8 the halo car for an iconic brand, but it caught the eye of the most iconic and influential entrepreneur of our time, RM Sothebys car specialist Don Rose said in a statement.Jobs legacy is all around us, with over one billion iPhones sold to date.However, he only owned one Z8, and this is that car."The second owner of this 2000 BMW Z8 makes it clear with the license plate who the first owner was.(Photo: Karissa Hosek 2017 Courtesy of) The auction house says the Jobs Z8 was sold to its current owner and sold a year later to another tech executive.But the second owner immediately had regrets, and bought it back.While Jobs was low key about his personal life, the second owner of this Z8 has no such qualms: his plate reads "JOBS Z8."Follow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2zLhPsL
Harvey Weinstein effect: Men are getting outed and some are getting fired as women speak up.

provided by Newsy Newslook The New York attorney general has opened an inquiry into The Weinstein Company, co-founded by Harvey Weinstein.(Photo: Yann Coatsaliou, AFP/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO Call it the Harvey Weinstein effect.In years past, powerful men busted for preying on women could pay out large sums in legal settlements or issue public apologies and pledges to reform and then keep right on doing what they were doing.No longer.Women breaking the culture of silence are putting unprecedented pressure on companies and whole industries to crack down on sexual misconduct in the workplace.From ESPN abruptly canceling a deal with Barstool Sports over growing criticism of the controversial sport media outlet's sexist content, to New Orleans celebrity chef John Besh stepping down from the company he founded over sexual harassment allegations lodged against him and other male employees, the nation's tolerance for men behaving badly has reached an all-time low.Tales of sexual misconduct have barreled into the headlines for decades.What's different this time?Not the egregious details but perhaps how people are reacting to Weinstein's behavior, says Noreen Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, which fights for women's rights.More: Follow USA TODAY's Money and Tech Facebook page Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMES OUT OF

"Because of sheer number and the similarities of stories, we're actually exploring why it happened and not whether it happened," Farrell says."This feels different."Or this could be Groundhog Day for sexual harassment a fleeting moment of national outrage that returns us to the status quo with women, like Weinstein's accusers, continuing to silently suffer through on-the-job abuse so they don't torpedo their careers."Why did this happen to these women?Its economic status.Theyre looking for a career, a job, a promotion," says Toni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization of Women."As long as we keep women from earning a rightful living in every sense of the word, we won't change."More: Anita Hill on O'Reilly harassment charges: People need to keep coming forward More: Harvey Weinstein scandal: Total accusers pass 50 women More: Harvey Weinstein scandal: New accuser files first lawsuit against Weinstein Company This time around there's a key new ingredient in play that's helping to fuel more disclosures and build solidarity for women: social media.Hundreds of thousands of women began posting their own experiences of sexual misconduct under the hashtag #MeToo.After investigations by The New York Times and The New Yorker exposed decades of Weinstein's predatory misbehavior, the consequences were harsh and swift.Accused by dozens of women, including major celebrities, Weinstein was canned from his job running the movie studio that bears his name and from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Producers Guild.And he's being investigated by the LAPD for a rape allegation.In recent days, Weinstein has denied non-consensual sex and said he has a different recollection of events.That dizzying fall fueled a domino effect that has touched workplaces across the country.In August, producer Isa Hackett accused Amazon Studios chief Roy Price of making unwanted sexual remarks in technology news outlet The Information.It wasn't until after the Weinstein scandal broke that Price was forced out.More allegations erupted from the movie industry with the Los Angeles Times reporting that 38 women had come forward to accuse director James Toback of sexual harassment.Toback has denied the charges, but the total number of women making accusations now tops 200.This week, senior political analyst Mark Halperin, who often appears on MSNBC and NBC News, is leaving his contributor post after five women said he sexually harassed them while he held a powerful position at ABC News more than a decade ago.On Tuesday, one-time New Republic literary editor Leon Wieseltier apologized to past staffers for behavior that accusers say included inappropriate touching.The Emerson Collective, a philanthropic organization led by Steve Jobs' widow Laurene Powell Jobs, immediately pulled its support for a magazine Wieseltier was set to publish.Fashion photographer Terry Richardson, who has taken photos of Beyonce, Rihanna and Miley Cyrus, was banned by Conde Nast for sexual assault allegations that have been circulating since 2010.In a statement, Richardson admitted he sometimes behaved in a sexually explicit manner during photo shoots.And Abigail Johnson, the chief executive of Fidelity Investments, told employees that the financial giant has no tolerance for misconduct after reports emerged alleging two company executives had been forced out for sexual harassment.More: Robert Scoble resigns from Transformation Group after sexual harassment allegations More: Sexism and Silicon Valley: Women can't raise cash and now we have one more reason why More: After Uber, more women speak up about Silicon Valley sexism "We're now at an inflection point where companies, and even entire industries, need to make a pretty basic decision: Take this seriously, or get left behind," says Joelle Emerson, founder and CEO of Paradigm, a strategy firm that consults with tech companies on diversity and inclusion.Yet, it's not clear that America is ready to take the shocking disclosures trickling out of nearly every sector of the economy as seriously as it should.Exhibit A: Many powerful men have faced serious allegations yet few consequences.A prime example: Singer R. Kelly has emerged relatively unscathed from accusations of underage sex and abusive treatment of women after reports in BuzzFeed and Rolling Stone.Kelly, who denied the allegations through his attorney, canceled a few dates on his concert tour.Dozens of women have accused Bill Cosby of using date-rape drugs to molest them throughout his career.Yet, despite the multitude of victims, a judge in his June sexual assault trial declared a mistrial after jurors said they were deadlocked after six days of deliberations.He will be retried, prosecutors say.One of the most famous incidents the Access Hollywood tape released right before the election of then Republican candidate Donald Trump boasting of groping or impulsively kissing women didn't derail his campaign.A month later, he won the election with the support of 42% of women, a shocking development to many who turned out in the millions in national marches to protest his remarks.And, if history is any guide, workplace-rattling change will not come easily.Consider that the term sexual harassment was coined by author and journalist Lin Farley in the mid-1970s.In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled that sexual harassment was a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.And, in 1991, Anita Hill thrust sexual harassment into national debate during the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.In April, Hill told USA TODAY that it was time for a nation that too willingly accepts men's excuses to change the status quo."We have a whole host of people accepting that as just something men do as opposed to understanding it as predatory behavior that is not only immoral but is also illegal," Hill said.The nation's response to charges of sexual harassment began to shift in July 2016 when Gretchen Carlson's lawsuit forced the resignation of Roger Ailes, chairman and chief executive of Fox News.That a woman could take down a man of his power and stature emboldened more women to come forward and for more journalists to pursue the rumors and whisper about Bill O'Reilly and Weinstein.Bill O'Reilly (Photo: Jeff Christensen, AP) Heads quickly began to roll, turning 2017 into the year sexual misconduct became a fireable offense.Six women have reached settlements with Fox News or O'Reilly after having made allegations against the host, whom the network fired in April, according to TheNew York Times.O'Reilly has repeatedly denied charges of wrongdoing, as did Ailes before his death.Software engineer Susan Fowler's blog post about sexual harassment and misconduct at Uber ignited an uproar, toppling CEO Travis Kalanick and unleashing a series of revelations in Silicon Valley that led to the ouster of two technology investors, Dave McClure and Justin Caldbeck.Now Fowler is a celebrity in the business world, is working on a book and has a Hollywood movie deal.And she and others are pushing for fundamental changes in business practices and laws to protect women at work.In August, Fowler petitioned the Supreme Court to consider her experience as it decides whether employees can be forced to abandon their right to pursue class-action lawsuits when they agree in their employment contracts to resolve grievances through arbitration.California is now considering legislation that would prohibit investors from sexually harassing company founders.Another bill would ban secret settlements in sexual harassment cases.And while there have been no official changes yet to corporate policies, one legal expert predicts that the practice of general counsels rubber-stamping payments to victims will start to fade."If anyone out there just saw this as ever being 'fun' behavior, it's very clear now that it's expensive fun, and company-threatening fun," says Joan Williams, a law professor at the University of California-Hastings and director of the Center for WorkLife Law."Will this all end?No it won't.But it will become less common, and when it happens it will last less long.Sexual harassment complaints are now the invisible buzzsaw that can cut down your career or company."Follow USA TODAY tech reporters Jessica Guynn and Marco della Cava.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2gIMmUx
We answer your questions about iPhone X:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE USA TODAY goes to the Apple hands on room to check out the iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus and Apple Watch.USA TODAY LOS ANGELES You've got lots of questions about the new Apple iPhone X, which will be released Friday at 8 a.m. You've posed them to us on social media so let's dive in and answer them.Shoppers at a Los Angeles Apple Store (Photo: Jefferson Graham) First, a quick primer: The iPhone X is Apples new flagship 10th anniversary phone, the first re-designed phone since 2014s iPhone 6.It features facial recognition to unlock the screen, an edge to edge 5.8-inch OLED screen, promising richer blacks and colors, and the ability to make animated emojis based on your expressions.The iPhone X went on pre-sale Friday morning and quickly sold out its initial shipment.Deliveries for current orders are promised within 5-6 weeks.Apple says it will have some inventory Friday at retail, but due to production issues, the company is expected to have fewer units available than usual.The best way to ensure getting the product is to pre-order, either via the Apple Store app, or online at Apple.com or via third-party re-sellers like the wireless carriers.More: Iphone X only for very patient More: You can't get the iPhone X, so maybe the iPhone 8 isn't so bad after all More: Want the iPhone X?It doesnt have to cost you $1,000 The iPhone X starts at $999, vs. $699 for the iPhone 8, the other new phone Apple released this year, in September.Now onto the questions: Ariel Keller: Should I stick with the 8 or get the 10?Thats a personal choice, and up to you.The 8 is a classic iPhone that works like other models in the past.It has a faster processor, a glass back and if you get the step-up premium Plus edition, software enhancements on the camera that are fun for photographers to play with.Roger Daniel: "Will there be an X Plus?"Apple hasnt announced one at this point.But who knows?Rebecca Navarro-Vomas: Will the charger be different with the X?No, its the same lightning charger weve been using the past few years.Both the X and 8 can also be charged wirelessly, with the addition of wireless chargers from Belkin and Mophie.Harjeet Singh: "What's the price?"The X starts at $999 with 64 GB of storage, and I recommend stepping up to the next level, $1,149 and 256 GB of storage.Shoot a lot of 4K videos and download apps, and storage adds up quick.On my 8 Plus review unit, Im up to 120 GB already.Brandon Barton: "Is the X waterproof?"The phone is water-resistant, like the 8 and 7.I wouldn't go swimming with it.Gary Moskowitz: "What's the size of the iPhone X?"That would be 5.8 inches, the largest screen size ever for an iPhone.The iPhone 8 Plus is 5.5 inches.Amy Howorth: "Is the iPhone X camera the best one to date?"Yes and no.Its basically the same as the 8, but with two minor differences.You can shoot Selfies in Portrait mode, and blur the background, and the second, portrait lens that we met on the iPhone 7 Plus and 8 Plus has a faster lens opening on the X, 2.4 vs. 2.8.A billboard for the iPhone X in Los Angeles (Photo: Jefferson Graham) Finally, Shelbie-Lynn Welbie asked about upgrading from the 7 Plus to the 8 Plus.What are the benefits?Well Shelbie, the 7 Plus and 8 Plus are virtually identical, except for the ability to do wireless charging, the new glass back, more powerful chip and enhanced camera.In my back to back tests of the cameras, it was hard to see major differences between the two, but the 8 Plus did end up coming out on top with more pleasing photos.Should you make the upgrade?Id hold out and wait to see the reviews for the iPhone X, which will be out any day.Thanks everyone for your questions and keep them coming in!Follow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham on Twitter, @jeffersongraham and listen to the daily Talking Tech podcast on Apple Podcasts and Stitcher.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hjXC6J

not computers, they were so last century.The smartest students leaving university may well find the adventure of creating in transportation.A science-led revolution is in the making in transportation.Leading this revolution is the electric car.It is no longer a drawing-board dream.It is here and gaining market share, albeit miniscule at present.The surge to electric-powered transportation goes beyond the Tesla and Elon Musk although Musk has been a catalyst.All manufacturers are now making or investigating electric cars.But the electric car is only a beginning: buses, trucks, trains, boats ships and even airplanes are in the mix.China is throwing government and private resources into an electric future.France, Britain and eight other countries have declared that they will ban the internal combustion engine by mid-century.Volvo has said that it will stop\making fossil fuel-powered cars.At the extreme end of the electric car excitement are automated vehicles.These have caught the imagination and the dollars of Google and Uber.But Detroit is also is coming to realize that it has to go electric.General Motors has paved its way with the EV1 and the Volt.Others are scrambling.The political pressure behind the urge to go electric is clean air, reduced noise and, for many countries, the end of a huge oil bill.One hundred and forty years after Thomas Edison first perfected a light bulb, electricity is once again a major disruptive technology and not just on the surface of the Earth.Electric aircraft are in design with short-haul, small-load passenger versions flying in Dubai.Mighty Boeing has teamed up with innovative JetBlue to work on an electric-powered aircraft, although these might have to wait for much better electric-storage batteries than now exist.Naysayers are quick to point up the inadequacy of batteries lithium ion are the workhorses in this revolution and the difficulty of charging them.Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE If you're thinking of buying an all-electric or hybrid car, here are a few things to consider.USA TODAY These arguments point up a fork in the road for electric enthusiasts: Will the future depend on todays charging technology where a car has to be tethered to the charging apparatus by a wire, or will electromagnetic fields be used in inductive charging, eliminating the wire?This is known as Wireless Power Transfer (WPT).Enthusiasts see WPT charging in two ways: either a plate set in a driveway or parking lot with the vehicle at rest or a strip in a roadway which can charge vehicles in motion a grander idea.If the latter is successful, it opens the way to smaller batteries in lighter vehicles, cheaper trucking.The disruption is going to be very large.Gas stations would largely disappear or be very few.Automobile technicians might want to look for alternative employment, as will, eventually, many truck drivers.The search for new batteries is frenetic and international.New, longer-lived batteries will, in large measure, determine the rate of growth in the more advanced electric vehicle applications.Another big imponderable is who will provide the electricity?There is a general assumption in the electric utilities that they will do this.But will they?The new owners of the charging networks may choose to make their own with wind, solar and small modular nuclear reactors.Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Does the fuel efficiency of hybrid and electric vehicles make up for the higher premiums of these low-emission vehicles?Buzz60's Tony Spitz will help you decide.Buzz60 What will the role of government be?Local government will have to deal with the road-use issues.But what of the federal government?It has always been involved in transport.As Peter Morici, the economist and columnist, points out, it stimulated the railways with right-of-way grants and the airlines with mail-hauling contracts.Will it find a similarly elegant way to stimulate the flow of electrons into transportation, and a whole new way of getting ourselves and our stuff around?Maybe it will be led by the military: The Navy wants electric ships.No wonder the best minds out of colleges and universities are getting wanderlust.Oilprice.com is a USA TODAY content partner offering energy industry news and commentary.Its content is produced independently of USA TODAY.More top reads from Oilprice.com: Expect New Aramco IPO Details This Week Oil Prices Rise Ahead Of Inventory Data Aramco CEO Warns Of Imminent Oil Supply Crunch Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hhFp9Z

You can't get the iPhone X, so maybe the iPhone 8 isn't so bad after all:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Jefferson Graham tests the Google Pixel 2 XL smartphone camera--is it the best one ever, as some have said?He compares to the Apple iPhone 8 Plus in a beach shootout on #Talking Tech.LOS ANGELES The iPhone X appeals to early adopters who want to own a cutting-edge gadget.But what if, feature for feature, the comparatively ho-hum iPhone 8 is actually the one for you?The iPhone X, which went on pre-sale Friday and lands in stores November 3, is in limited supply, with delivery waits reported as five to six weeks on Apple's website.Apple's iPhone 8 (Photo: Apple) The X (pronounced 'ten') is what Apple CEO Tim Cook says will "set the path of technology for the next decade."It's been released on the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone and wraps together state-of-the-art software and hardware, including facial recognition to unlock the phone, an 5.8-inch edge-to-edge OLED screen, which promises brighter colors and deeper blacks, and the ability to create ultra-cool animated emojis based on your expressions.More: iPhone X pricing, features vs. iPhone 8 and 8 Plus: Which is better for you?More: iPhone 8 review: An excellent phone forced to the shadows by iPhone X More: The iPhone X is now available to pre-order, but be ready to wait Meanwhile the iPhone 8 looks, for the most part, exactly like last year's iPhone 7.Yes, there are upgrades, including a glass back, a more powerful processing chip, new photo software and the ability to charge the phone wirelessly all like the iPhone X.But the early adopters who overwhelm Apple on opening weekends have shunned the iPhone 8.Wireless carriers have publicly said that demand is lower for the 8, and if you want one, you won't have to wait several weeks for delivery.It's available to pick up today, in most stores.Gene Munster, an investor and analyst with Loup Ventures, says that while iPhone 8 sales are down compared to the 7, Apple's master plan was to launch two new lines this year and thus grow the overall business by 10%."On that measure, the 8 is a success."It'll still fit in your pocket, just not as comfortably as the smaller-sized iPhone 8.(Photo: Reviewed.com / Michael Desjardin) A big difference between the 8 and X is the price.The new X has an opening list price of $999, though for a phone this feature-rich, you'll need all the storage you can getwhich will send you to the $1,149 256 GB edition.In contrast, the iPhone 8 starts at $699 with 64 GB of storage, or $849 with 256 GB.For the difference of about $300, iPhone X possesses more features.But beyond the cool factor, and bragging rights, it's worth asking if you really need them.Of the six features Apple is promoting on its website for the iPhone X, two of them are also available for the 8, and three for the larger, 5.5-inch 8 Plus, which starts at $799.New iPhone 8 rests on the Mophie wireless charging base.(Photo: Jefferson Graham) These include: Wireless charging The new A11 Bionic chip for extra power Portrait lighting software effects on the iPhone camera, for the 8 Plus only.(Photo: Apple) Missing: The 8 doesn't have the facial recognition, OLED screen or ability to make animated emojis based on your facial expressions.Decision time So lets say you have a 2-year-old phone whose battery is running down, youve got a cracked screen, and youve run out of room to put new apps and photos on your device.The 8 and 8 Plus weren't your first choices, but here's what you'd get: Apple's "Retina HD" LCD screen that's also on the 7, a more powerful processor than the 7, new wireless charging and a better battery.It also has an improved camera, especially in the 8 Plus (we just gave it top nod in head to head vs. Googles new Pixel 2 XL).In our head-to-head camera shots on the 8 Plus vs. the 7 Plus, most of the shots looked virtually identical.What is different is the iPhone 8's Portrait Mode, which offers software tricks to emulate pro studio lighting, often very well.The Stage Lighting software trick in iPhone 8 Plus Portrait Lighting tools.Photographer Tony Prince poses for us.(Photo: Jefferson Graham) And when it comes to the cameras on X and 8, we're splitting hairs.On the X, you can use Portrait Mode for selfies, it has a slightly faster portraits lens (better in low light, with a 2.4 lens opening, vs. a 2.8) and offers image stabilization on the portrait lens as well.Are the 8's as cool as the X?Clearly not.But sometimes it pays not to be an early adopter, and wait for tech companies to work out the kinks before joining the party.If you're itching for facial recognition to unlock a phone and to make animated emojis, and willing to work through the kinks, the X is for you.If not, there's that underrated wallflower, the plain 8, just waiting to go home with you.And for comparison sakes, a reminder on other smartphone models and pricing.The iPhone 7 starts at $549 with 32 GB of storage, while the iPhone 6S, the last model to still have a headphone jack, starts at $449 with 32 GB of storage.The most affordable iPhone is the SE edition, which starts at $349 with 32 GB of storage, or $449 with 128 GB.The Google Pixel 2 phones, which try to up Apple on features (longer lasting battery, a crazy camera that can take pictures of street signs or CD covers and use visual search to tell you what you're looking at) starts at $649 for the 5-inch version, or $749 for the 6-inch model.The Samsung Galaxy S8 phone sells for $749 with 64 GB of storage, while the larger Galaxy Note8 is a hefty $950 with 64 GB of storage.Like the Pixel, they run on the competing Google Android operating system.Follow USA TODAY's on Twitter, @jeffersongraham Read or Share this story:

Is this silly egg gadget the secret to a healthier brunch?:::::The first time I saw an egg separator, I thought, I would never use one of those in my kitchen.Then I took some time for self reflection: I'd never actually used an egg separator, so how did I know for sure that I didn't need one?What if the gadget was totally worth it?What if it made my life easier?As a professional chef, I love playing around with kitchen tools, so I decided to nab Amazon's top-rated egg separatorthe kooky, bird-shaped Egg Yolky (just $2.99)and put it to the test.Would it turn out to be a kitchen must-have, or could I live without it?The Gadget Using the Egg Yolky Egg Separator - quick, easy, and clean.There are a couple different egg separator brands out there (including a novelty version called the Bogeyman that's designed so the egg whites look like snot coming out of a nose...humorous, but no thanks).We chose the Egg Yolky Egg Separator from MSC International because more than 250 Amazon reviewers gave it the highest rating of any egg separator.The gadgets purpose is to catch egg yolks.When you crack the egg into the bowl, the egg yolk stays put while the whites pass through its grates.This particular model looks like a chicken (how cute!)and has feet that cling to the edge of the bowl, making it a hands-free device.The Alternative Using the eggshell - kinda messy, and with dangerously jagged edges.Without using a gadget, the most common way to separate an egg is by using the eggshell.After you crack the egg against the countertop, position the cracked egg over a bowl.Remove the top half of the eggshell and allow the whites to spill over the edge.Pass the yolk from one shell half to the other until all the whites have oozed into the bowl.Alternatively, you can use your hands (which is super common in restaurants, where you have to separate dozens of eggs at a time).After cracking the egg into your hand, jiggle your fingers back and forth until all the whites have strained through your fingers.I find this method easier and faster than the shell method, albeit much messier.The results The results - the Egg Yolky on the left gave me cleanly separated yolks, while the eggshell method on the right was messier broke some yolks.Im completely surprised that I love the Egg Yolky!First of all, it looks totally adorable clipped on the side of the bowla functional feature, but mostly just super cute.More importantly, it did exactly what it was supposed to do and separated all the eggs quickly and easily.While some of the whites did cling to the yolk, they came off with a vigorous shake.And the most important factor: not one yolk broke as I used the device.When I separated the whites and yolks using the shells, some of the yolks caught on the side of the jagged shell, breaking the yolk into the whites.The finger method kept the yolks more intact, but I made a mess as I used my hands to both crack and separate eggs, trailing egg whites pretty much everywhere.The winner I gotta give this one to the gadget!Its easy to use, was a breeze to clean, and its certainly worth the pricea bargain at $3.99 with Prime shipping.The separator worked just as well (if not better) than the all-purpose methods, and its small profile makes it easy to store in your gadget drawer.At the end of the day, you don't need this gadget to get great results, but it did make separating eggs a little bit easier.I'm pretty egg-static to try my favorite egg-filled baking recipes of cook up an egg white omelet now that I have one of these!

Bitcoin's creator may be worth $6 billion — but people still don't know who it is:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE If you dont prepare, it might vanish forever.Time (Photo: Getty Images) One of the biggest mysteries in the technology world is the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the computer programmer who invented the digital currency bitcoin.That's because the name Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym.It could represent a man, a woman, or even a group of people.And, since the cryptocurrency was created in 2008, no one has been able to figure out who Nakamoto really is.But beyond solving a longstanding mystery, experts agree that uncovering Nakamoto's identity could have an immense impact on bitcoin's economics and internal politics.Bitcoin's beginning In 2008, Nakamoto published a nine-page white paper containing the first-ever mention of bitcoin, calling it a "peer-to-peer electronic cash system."A few months later, Nakamoto released bitcoin's first software and partnered with developers and coders online to improve it.This collaborative environment continued until 2011 when, without warning, Nakamoto vanished.Before ceasing all online communication, they emailed a fellow bitcoin developer saying they had "moved on to other things."But here's the catch: Nakamoto didn't walk away empty-handed.Sergio Demian Lerner, an Argentine researcher, has estimated that Nakamoto accumulated around a million bitcoins before disappearing.Today, that stash is worth over $5 billion.Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto is shown during an interview at the Associated Press bureau Thursday, March 6, 2014 in Los Angeles.Nakamoto, the man that Newsweek claims is the founder of Bitcoin denies he had anything to do with it and says he had never even heard of the digital currency until his son told him he had been contacted by a reporter three weeks ago.(Photo: Damian Dovarganes, AP) Power in numbers Matt Green, a cryptocurrency professor at Johns Hopkins University, says Nakamoto has the power to tank the currency if he wants to.Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million which is expected to be reached by the year 2140.Nakamoto's one million bitcoins amount to 5% of the entire cryptocurrency."The thing about bitcoin is if you control a million of them, you have the ability to flood the market at any point.Think of them as rare baseball cards.They're valuable because they're rare.If somebody could dump hundreds or thousands of Mickey Mantle trading cards, rare ones, onto the market, they wouldn't be worth so much anymore," said Green.Essentially, if Nakamoto chose to sell their bitcoin, they could flood the market and cause the price of bitcoin to tank.Ben Yu, a bitcoin investor living in San Francisco, says Nakamoto's stake in bitcoin is extremely significant."If bitcoin fulfills its role of becoming a global currency, than Satoshi Nakamoto would likely be the richest person in the world and also hold a proportionately higher share of the ultimate supply of bitcoin than something like the U.S. government holds in gold today," said Yu.Yu's math works out.The U.S. government holds the most gold reserves of any other entity in the world, at about 8,000 tonnes.That's a little over 4% of the world's total supply, less than Nakamoto's 5% stake in bitcoin.Some analysts believe bitcoin's rally is only just beginning.Kay Van-Petersen, a Saxo Bank analyst, told CNBC in May that he estimates bitcoin could hit $100,000 by 2027.If that prediction comes true, Nakamoto would have around $100 billion.Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Bitcoin has so much flavor of the month because it is a relatively new alternative currency demanded by hackers.Video provided by TheStreet Newslook Political influence Beyond economics, there's also Nakamoto's influence on politics.The bitcoin community has been entangled in a number of internal debates over the future of the cryptocurrency.Without a leader, the bitcoin community makes decisions through consensus.Various constituents of the community, like miners, investors and developers, get together to discuss changes.This process works, but it can take an extremely long time.It also means change is slow to come by."Very few major decisions that would surprise people or are controversial actually get made.That's both strength of bitcoin, because it's very static, and it's also a weakness, because it can't react and develop new features the way that other systems can," said Green.Nakamoto's opinion and leadership whether wanted or unwanted would no doubt influence the future of bitcoin."I think the community may actually benefit if Satoshi did choose to come back and become a spiritual leader who could provide guidance and reconcile the community towards consensus," said Yu.Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Jim Cramer talks Bitcoin with his Trading Strategies panel, despite the fact that he rarely even comments on the cryptocurrency.The panel mentioned that people are using it to store value.They also discussed Bitcoin ETFs, which are one of the only ways to short it.The panel also speculated that people in Venezuela might turn to Bitcoin because gold could be seized.It isn't just all Bitcoin.Jim Cramer's daily insights on Real Money break down the stocks moving the markets every morning.Jim Cramer and the AAP team know what's causing oil prices to decline,

by TheStreet Newslook So, who is Nakamoto?For now, it doesn't seem like the real Satoshi Nakamoto is interested in coming forward.Anonymity provides privacy, protection and peace three things that likely appeal to the owner of one million bitcoins.But is that really such a bad thing?With the havoc it could wreak on the price of bitcoin and internal politics, it may be better off that Nakamoto whoever that is remain anonymous and inactive indefinitely.Of course, that won't stop people from wondering."Every single one of us, every technical person is curious about Satoshi.We want to know where this person came from and where bitcoin came from, because it's kind of a miracle, this system," said Green."But beyond that, we'd like to know what the future of bitcoin is.We'd like to know what is going to happen to all of those coins that Satoshi mined.If they're gone forever, that means one thing, if they're coming back, that means another thing.There's probably some interest in having a person with this kind of skill back, part of the community, and contributing to it."CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.Its content is produced

Amazon's Jeff Bezos is now the richest man in the world with $90 billion:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos saw a $6.6 billion dollar increase in his fortune, tentatively putting him at number one on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.For more on the story here is Zach Devita Buzz60 Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos at times has pursued investments in growth over profit.(Photo: David Ryder/Getty Images) Jeff Bezos became the richest man in the world Friday morning, after adding nearly $7 billion to his wealth overnight.With Amazon's share price surging Friday morning after its earnings report, Bezos's wealth shot up to more than $90 billion, according to calculations by CNBC and data from the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.That put Bezos past Bill Gates to become the richest man in the world.Gates also added to his fortune Friday morning with the rise in Microsoft stock after its earnings.But his gain of around $550 million put his fortune at $88.5 billion not enough to stay ahead of Bezos.It will be a horse race throughout the day, however.If Microsoft goes up more, or if Amazon slips after the stock starts trading, Bezos could fall back to No.2.This isn't Bezos' first time as numero uno.He became the richest man for the first time in July but his reign only lasted a day.On July 27, Amazon's share price topped $1,050 and Bezos' paper fortune soared past $90 billion.But after Amazon's share price slipped, Bezos fell back to second place behind Gates.At some point, given Amazon's dominance in so many markets, Bezos is likely to pull further ahead in the race for the richest man.For now, however, the battle is between Microsoft and Amazon.Just after the market's open, Amazon shares were trading up nearly 10% at around $1,067, while Microsoft's stock gained 9% to trade just under $86.More: Amazon now employs half a million people, up 77% vs. a year ago More: Microsoft's Nadella hits promised $20 billion cloud milestone months early More: Google flies high into regulatory threats Google co-founder Larry Page is $1.2 billion richer and co-founder Sergey Brin's fortunes increased by $1.15 billion after Alphabet's third-quarter profit blew past expectations.Prior to the results, they were worth $49.3 billion and $48.2 billion, respectively.Technology leaders are climbing the ranks of the world's wealthiest people this year as their businesses outperform the rest of the market.Six of the top 10 names on the list are founders of U.S. tech companies.Next up is Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who's ranked fifth on the list at $72.4 billion, according to Bloomberg.His company reports results on Nov. 1.CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.Its content is produced independently of USA TODAY.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2heP0hE
The Hollywood talent agency that represents Tom Hanks opens startup studio:::::Former vice-president Joe Biden reads the news on Biden's Briefings, a podcast and connected speaker "skill" (Photo: Chris Ferenzi) LOS ANGELES The Creative Artists Agency, one of the most powerful talent agencies in Hollywood, just launched a new start-up studio to develop apps for its celebrity clients, initially focused on audio for the connected-speaker market.The agency's Creative Labs has two companies in its portfolio already: Ground Control, which offers daily news updates from former vice president Joe Biden on Amazon's Alexa-activated speakers and Google Home and a trivia game from baseball great Buster Posey of the San Francisco Giants.And it has Belletrist, an arts community aimed at millennial women that was co-founded by actress Emma Roberts.Labs is working with comedian Mike Epps on a new audio game that will be introduced by the end of the year.CAA, which represents such superstars as Tom Hanks and George Clooney, is also a longtime co-founder of tech firms, including the comedy site Funny or Die, and Moonshark, which created apps for celebrities like Hanks and Jennifer Lopez.It has also invested in start-ups like Patreon, the app for fans to offer funding, and the Medium blog posting platform.Instead of helping to found companies piecemeal, we realized it would be easier to start companies and raise capital and also have available engineering and designer talent to build the companies, says Michael Yanover, head of business development for CAA.CAA has earmarked $12.5 million for the new company, raised from a variety of investors, including Boatrocker Ventures, Entertainment One and the Telegraph Media Group.The company which is headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, an area Yanover says is under-appreciated and brimming with available talent.The business chat app Slack as well as social media monitor HootSuite were both born in Vancouver.Silicon Valley is a war for talent, and the talent is fleeting, Yanover says, and while his local community in L.A. has a good supply of engineering talent, the costs arent as reasonable as they are in Vancouver, he says.They speak the same language as us, are on the same time-zone, there are government incentives to be based in Canada, so it just seemed like a great place to be.Leonard Brody, a Canadian venture capitalist who serves as chairman of the new company, says the connected speaker market is a priority.The market is where apps were 9 years ago, he says.Amazon is banking on selling many more units of the Echo speaker, which now come in a variety of sizes, and Google recently expanded beyond the initial Home speaker to also offer a smaller, Mini version.Apple is releasing its first smart speaker in December, the HomePod.With CAAs array of celebrity talent looking to lend their voices to projects, Yanover believes hes on a winning strategy.They all have their Echos at home, and are really intrigued, Yanover says.This week Amazon announced new monetization features for Alexa's "skills," offerings, making subscriptions to premium content, such as within the Jeopardy game app, available to subscribers of the Prime shipping/entertainment service."This is an important sector for us to be in," adds Brody.Follow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham on Twitter, @jeffersongraham Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2zLzsc5

There are now 'low fat' pigs, thanks to science:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE This could change a lot more than bacon.Wochit-All Ready for a world with low-fat pork bacon?Chinese researchers used the gene editing tool CRISPR Cas-9 to create "low fat" pigs capable of surviving longer when they're at a younger age.The study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) found the pigs produced a leaner meat and were better at surviving colder temperatures.Researchers believe the genetically modified pigs could reduce economic losses and help boost pig welfare.The study involved creating the swine through CRISPR, and adding an uncoupling protein making it easier for them to generate heat.Results showed piglets with the uncoupling protein "showed an improved ability to maintain body temperature during acute cold exposure, but they did not have alterations in physical activity levels or total daily energy expenditure."A tool like CRISPR opens the door to significant advancements in gene editing.Tools could be used to create not only more resilient animals like pigs, but food like fruits and vegetables.Closeup of a mini pig baby.(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) More: CRISPR gene editing tool: Are we ready to play God?However, use of tools like CRISPR carry ethical concerns, said Jennifer Doudna, a professor in the departments of Molecular and Cell Biology and Chemistry at the University of CaliforniaBerkeley.Doudna is considered one of the pioneers of CRISPR technology."CRISPR is a profoundly powerful tool and we must ensure that the public has a strong voice in how it is used," said Doudna."An informed public discourse will help ensure that CRISPR does not contribute an additional layer of inequality in our society."In the case of the study creating low-fat pigs, Doudna cites the potential for CRISPR to provide value to society."CRISPR can be used as a strategy to lower agriculture costs, boost the welfare of a particular species, and increase the nutritional value of a potential food source for humans at a time when climate change is beginning to threaten crops globally."Follow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hbVNJ6

Google ups warranty for Pixel 2 smartphones in response to critics:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Google is investigating the root of a potential \u0022burn-in\u0022 problem spotted by some users of its new Pixel 2 XL phones.USA TODAY LOS ANGELES Google stands by its new Pixel 2 smartphones and says the ghost images that remain behind on its advanced high-definition screen, as reported by some critics, are normal.Still, Google said in a blog post that it is upping the warranty for the new Pixels to 2 years, up from 1 year, "to give users peace of mind."A man looks at a one of the new Google Pixel phones at a Google event at the SFJAZZ Center in San Francisco, on Oct. 4, 2017.(Photo: Jeff Chiu, AP) More: Pixel 2 XL smartphone 'burn in' could burn Google Google introduced the sequel to the original Pixel smartphone last week with two new models that start at $649 and $849 and featuring a large, advanced OLED display and stronger battery than rivals.The problem, which multiple reviewers referred to as "burn in," refers to ghosted logos, icons or other images from a previous screen that may appear after the current screen that you are viewing.It is usually more evident when youre looking at a gray screen, notes USA TODAY tech reviewer Edward C. Baig.Google said the "decay" characteristics are similar to OLED panels used in comparable products.Google's investigation, which began on Sunday, "confirms that the differential aging is in line with that of other premium smartphones and should not affect the normal, day-to-day user experience of the Pixel 2 XL."Still, Google said it will try to address the issue by making software updates.Some critics have also complained that the Pixel 2's images weren't as vibrant as other phones.Google said it wanted to provide a more natural and accurate rendition of colors."We know that some people prefer more saturated colors, so both Pixel 2 phones already include an option to boost colors by 10% for a more vivid look," Google said."And based on the recent feedback, were adding a new mode for more saturated colors, which will be made available via a software update to both Pixel 2 phones in the next few weeks" The brouhaha couldn't come at a worse time for Google.The company is trying to dent the market forces of Apple, which has a shiny new iPhone X going on pre-orders Friday morning, and Samsung, with a smartphone it believes is as state-of-the-art as it gets.Having to defend itself against critics just a week after launch isn't usually in the successful marketing plan.Follow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham on Twitter, @jeffersongraham Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hd5EhN
Google flies high — into regulatory threats:::::Google's main campus at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway in Sunnyvale, CA on Monday, April 27, 2015 (Photo: Martin E. Klimek, USA TODAY) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) Is it possible to win so much that you end up losing?That's one question facing Google and some of its tech compatriots as they prepare to testify before congressional investigations into Russian meddling next week.Google continues to pile on billions in ad revenue every quarter.But like its chief rival Facebook, it's being pressured to rein in its hyper-efficient advertising machine.Google and Facebook dominate the U.S. digital ad market Google will take 42% and Facebook 21% of U.S. digital ad revenue this year, according to eMarketer.But pressure to limit the spread of fake news and curb foreign influence in elections could crimp revenue and raise costs in the future if the companies, for instance, have to add further human oversight to their machine-powered algorithms.Both Facebook and Twitter have already announced plans to make political ads more transparent in line with a bill introduced last week by Sens.Mark Warner and Amy Klobuchar.Facebook said it was adding 1,000 human checkers to review ads.Google hasn't said how it might comply with potential new rules around political ads, but observers say it's unlikely to get a free pass from Congress."It's hard to know whether Congress or regulators will actually step up and regulate the company, but there seems to be a newfound willingness to consider such action," says Daniel Stevens, executive director of the Campaign for Accountability, a nonprofit watchdog that tracks Google spending on lobbyists and academics."Google, like every other industry, should not be left to its own devices."Google was hit in June with a $2.9 billion fine by European Union for harming competitors, and in response, it has tweaked its product search results in Europe by allowing competitive online retailers to bid for premium spots in a search results pane.EU regulators have said they will keep a watchful eye on whether the adjustment actually gives equal treatment to rivals.Neither Google CEO Sundar Pichai nor Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Google parent Alphabet Inc., mentioned the Russia probe or congressional hearings on a call with analysts Thursday.The most the company has said publicly is a statement it issued last week, in which it offered support for "efforts to improve transparency, enhance disclosures, and reduce foreign abuse."Google added that it is "evaluating" further steps of its own and pledged to work closely with government and industry to "explore the best solutions."Alphabet posted third-quarter revenues, excluding that shared with partners, that rose 22% to $22.27 billion.Net income rose to $6.73 billion from $5.06 billion a year ago, a 33% increase.The profit jump was a surprise to analysts, and Alphabet shares rose 3% in after-hours trading.Monica Peart, senior forecasting director with eMarketer, says increased revenue is largely coming from higher-cost segments like mobile search and YouTube, where Google ends up sharing a bigger portion of ad revenue with partners like cellphone makers and video creators.Meanwhile, research and development costs continue to rise up 17% to $4.21 billion as Google and other Alphabet units plow more money into artificial intelligence, Google-branded hardware such as the Pixel phone and Home smart speaker, and so-called moonshot projects like its Project Loon balloons, which were recently deployed to deliver internet access to hurricane-ravaged parts of Puerto Rico.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2zH2qtA

Twitter overcounted active users since 2014, shares surge on profit hopes:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Twitter says it could turn its first ever profit in the fourth quarter, after cutting expenses and finding sources of revenue beyond advertising.Angela Moore reports.Video provided by Reuters Newslook Twitter shares surged 18% after it said it was getting closer to profitability.(Photo: Matt Rourke, AP) Twitter revealed Thursday it had included users of third-party applications that should not have counted as part of the social media company's user base.Since the fourth quarter of 2014, Twitter was counting an average of 1 million to 2 million users extra per quarter, said the company in its letter to shareholders detailing third quarter results.The applications used a software development kit called Digits, "which did not relate to activity on the Twitter platform," read an excerpt from the letter.For Twitter's previous quarter, its adjusted monthly active users hit 326 million, instead of the 328 million first reported.The daily active user count was not affected and grew 14% since this time last year.Twitter shares surged 18% after the company beat expectations on revenue and gave higher-than-expected guidance for the fourth quarter.The company reported a 4% increase in monthly active users year over year to 330 million.Third-quarter revenue reached $590 million, down 4% from a year ago.The company said in its guidance for next quarter that if it hit the high end of its estimates for operating performance an adjusted EBITDA of $220 million to $240 million it could be profitable under generally accepted accounting principles.User growth has been a major focus of investors hoping the social media company could reach the heights of companies like Facebook.Twitter has introduced several features in hopes of attracting more users and improving the overall experience.Last month, Twitter revealed it was experimenting with longer tweets, allowing some users to post updates with up to 280 characters, up from the standard 140 characters.Follow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2zHwllk
How to stop your devices from listening to (and saving) what you say:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE USA TODAY Tech columnist Kim Komando explains how to keep your devices from listening to what you say.Kim Komando, Special for USA Today This Monday, June 19, 2017, photo shows Facebook launched on an iPhone, in North Andover, Mass.(Photo: Elise Amendola, AP) Yes, voice technology is amazing.You can ask your phone a question.You can talk to your speaker system and even book an Uber.With the right setup, you can verbally lock the doors in your house, dim the lights, and change the thermostat.All across America, people are embracing their oral fixation.Virtual assistants are handy, but theyre always listening.As more manufacturers and developers jump onto the audio tracking bandwagon, you may wonder how much your devices are recording.And what happens to the audio files they gather?Worst of all: apps that use ultrasonic data to profile you.You dont hear the tones, but your device does.More about that later.Some regular apps are designed to spy and report back recordings.Read more on five spy apps that could be on your phone watching and listening right now.Creeped out?Many people are.Lots of consumers dont trust their virtual assistants and wonder how to switch them off.If you're worried about the privacy risks of your smartphone's always-on microphone, here are tips on how to turn it off: Facebook When you put the Facebook app on your phone, it requests access to your microphone.Why?Facebook needs to record your voice when you shoot live video.But some people are wary of this.Does the app only record you when youre on camera?Or is Facebook listening through your microphone?Facebook denies these claims, and there is no solid evidence to support this fear.But you are absolutely welcome to sever the tie between app and microphone.Many people have no use for this access anyway, so theres nothing to lose by switching it off.If you are an iPhone user, go to Settings >> Facebook >> Settings >> slide the Microphone switch to the left so it turns from green to white.That turns it off.Alternatively, you can go to Settings >> Privacy >> Microphone >>

Julia Louis-Dreyfus' cancer disclosure shouldn't be a model for everyone. Consider this first.:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Julia Louis-Dreyfus announced she has been diagnosed breast cancer.The Emmy Award-winning actress shared the news on Twitter.She thanked her friends and family for their support and called on others to help "make universal health care a reality."Wochit Emmy winner Julia Louis-Dreyfus in HBO's 'Veep.'(Photo: Colleen Hayes, HBO) My heart skipped a beat when I saw actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus disclosure on Twitter that she has breast cancer.In a completely matter-of-fact way, the Emmy Award-winning actress tweeted: 1 in 8 women get breast cancer.Today, Im the one.Like that, the world knew about her diagnosis.As a cancer survivor myself, Im all for being more open about our medical diagnoses because they reduce stigma, allow us to get the help we need, and if anything be authentic at a time of much stress.But self-disclosure, especially via social media, isnt for everyone.More: Julia Louis-Dreyfus' breast cancer news shows how far we've come More: Julia Louis-Dreyfus: 'One in eight women get breast cancer; today, I'm the one' More: 'Veep's' Julia Louis-Dreyfus: 'World would be better if more women were in charge' Despite greater acceptance, theres still considerable stigma about various cancers and other serious conditions.You may be blamed for your disease, ostracized by family or friends, fired from your job (even though thats not legal in the United States) or left by a loved one.Its got to be a very individual situation, said Steven Joffe, MD, chief, division of medical ethics, at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, since some people may want to choose to protect their privacy.For a star such as Louis-Dreyfus, already a public figure with a history of speaking out on social causes, theres little downside and a much bigger upside in terms of drawing media attention to a disease that will strike more than 230,000 women this year, according to the American Cancer Society, and kill 40,000.The public outpouring of support everyone from her current Veep co-stars to former vice president Joe Biden has only been supportive.We Veeps stick together.Jill and I, and all of the Bidens, are with you, Julia.pic.twitter.com/JP0c2wtrJ6 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 28, 2017 Still, there are possible repercussions.For instance, actors must remain insurable to get work.In this case, HBO, which produces Veep, says it supports Louis-Dreyfus and will delay production of the series as necessary.Not everyone facing a serious illness finds such an embrace from his or her employer.Questions to ask before making a disclosure of serious illness online 1.Are you sure of the diagnosis?With more than 12 million adult misdiagnoses a year, according to a 2014 study published in the journal BMJ Quality and Safety, you dont want to post this kind of news unless you are sure.Thats one in 20 patients.Wait until you have confirmation.2.Have you already told those nearest and dearest to you?Before any public disclosure, talk with family, close friends and especially your kids.You may want to first consult with your physician or a counselor.With a partner, you may both be sharing feelings of helplessness and fear try to talk about it openly, and be there for each other," says Susan Brown, MS RN, senior director of education & patient support at the Susan G. Komen organization.With children, decide how much to say, but make sure you give honest, real answers to their questions, which can help lessen their fears.Remember: Once you post online, you won't be able to control who knows or how the news is shared.3.What is your motivation for sharing the diagnosis?Mike Threadgould, a social media manager at the Livestrong Foundation, suggests people think about the purpose of posting by asking themselves these questions: Is it for catharsis?Is it to keep friends/loved ones informed?Is it to connect with other patients/survivors?Or do you just want to raise awareness of the issue?He adds that establishing your goal will help guide where and with whom you share this information.4.How will your colleagues and boss react?While the Americans with Disabilities Act protects the jobs of those with serious diseases, the real world is less than perfect and people have been fired either directly because of their diagnosis or for trumped up reasons.No one wants to be fighting a lawsuit to keep their job at the same time as undergoing treatment.If youre worried, find out how other sick co-workers have been treated or talk with a lawyer.Dont necessarily trust a human resources manager to keep your news confidential.More: How to choose a health insurance policy 5.Are you ready to answer the questions youre likely to be asked?Friends are likely to ask all kinds: What is the prognosis?Will you lose your hair?What kind of treatment is planned?This may happen in person or online.Do your homework ahead of time.6.What am I hoping to achieve with an online disclosure?Joffe said Louis-Dreyfus was sending a very clear message in her tweet, that is, "Im lucky because I have a wonderful family and friends, great insurance, and lots of support.Others are not so lucky, Joffe added.One thing she accomplishes by doing this is reducing the stigma of breast cancer.7.Do you understand the possible negative ramifications?Dont act in the spur of the moment or emotion.Threadgould cautions that if you post to Facebook or Twitter to remember you are putting your diagnosis out there for everyone forever, including potential employers a decade from now.Its also possible that public disclosure could impact your eligibility for certain kinds of insurance such as long-term care, disability or life.More: Your health data is vulnerable to hacks.Here's what you can do Finally, my last piece of advice: Be sure to make your own decisions but, if necessary, ask for help from a wise friend or therapist.Always, weigh the pros and cons of disclosure versus privacy.Take small steps at the beginning to determine your own comfort level and see how people react in your own offline circle before posting on social media.Then, only when ready, type and hit post.You may be surprised, as Penns Joffe said, How very meaningful these online communities are.USA TODAY columnist Steven Petrow offers advice about living in the digital age.Submit your question at stevenpetrow@gmail.com.You can also follow Petrow on Twitter: @StevenPetrow.Or like him on Facebook at facebook.com/stevenpetrow.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2yybSPA

Computer files at the heart Georgia election security case deleted day after suit filed:::::The interior of a Diebold Election Systems voting machine.It was taken apart by at the DefCon computer security conference in Las Vegas as part of an event aimed at raising awareness about vulnerabilities to the U.S. election system.(Photo: Elizabeth Weise) A computer server crucial to a lawsuit against Georgia election officials was quietly wiped clean by its custodians just after the suit was filed, The Associated Press has learned.The server's data was destroyed July 7 by technicians at the Center for Elections Systems at Kennesaw State University, which runs the state's election system.The data wipe was revealed in an email sent last week from an assistant state attorney general to plaintiffs in the case that was obtained by the AP.More emails obtained in a public records request confirmed the wipe.The lawsuit, filed by a diverse group of election reform advocates, aims to force Georgia to retire its antiquated and heavily criticized election technology.The server in question, which served as a statewide staging location for key election-related data, made national headlines in June after a security expert disclosed a gaping security hole that wasn't fixed six months after he reported it to election authorities.More: Election hacking suit over Georgia race could be sign of what's to come Wiped out It's not clear who ordered the server's data irretrievably erased.The Kennesaw election center answers to Georgia's secretary of state, Brian Kemp, a Republican who is running for governor in 2018 and is the main defendant in the suit.A spokeswoman for the secretary of state's office said Wednesday that "we did not have anything to do with this decision," adding that the office also had no advance warning of the move.The center's director, Michael Barnes, referred questions to the university's press office, which declined comment.Plaintiffs in the lawsuit, who are mostly Georgia voters, want to scrap the state's 15-year-old vote-management system particularly its 27,000 AccuVote touchscreen voting machines, hackable devices that don't use paper ballots or keep hardcopy proof of voter intent.The plaintiffs were counting on an independent security review of the Kennesaw server, which held electronic poll book data and ballot definitions for counties, to demonstrate the system's unreliability.Wiping the server clean "forestalls any forensic investigation at all," said Richard DeMillo, a Georgia Tech computer scientist who has closely followed the case."People who have nothing to hide don't behave this way."State security The server data could have revealed whether Georgia's most recent elections were compromised by malicious hackers.The plaintiffs contend that the results of both last November's election and a special June 20 congressional runoff won by Kemp's predecessor, Karen Handel cannot be trusted.Possible Russian interference in U.S. politics, including attempts to penetrate voting systems, has been an acute national preoccupation since the Obama administration first sounded the alarm more than a year ago.Kemp and his GOP allies insist Georgia's elections system is secure.But Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a plaintiff, believes the server data was erased precisely because the system isn't secure."I don't think you could find a voting systems expert who would think the deletion of the server data was anything less than insidious and highly suspicious," she said.J.Tom Morgan, a former Georgia prosecutor, said destruction of the drive would not be a criminal act unless it was in violation of a protective court order (It appears no such order was requested).But it could seriously damage the defendants' case, he said.Now you see it, now you don't It could still be possible to recover relevant information from the server.The FBI is known to have made an exact data image of the server in March when it investigated the security hole.The email that disclosed the server wipe said the state attorney general's office was "reaching out to the FBI to determine whether they still have the image."Atlanta FBI spokesman Stephen Emmett, responding to AP questions, would not say whether that image still exists.Nor would he say whether agents examined it to determine whether the server's files might have been altered by unauthorized users.Other backups also appear to be gone.In the same email to plaintiffs' attorneys, assistant state Attorney General Cristina Correia wrote that two backup servers were also wiped clean on Aug. 9, just as the lawsuit moved to federal court.Failing to service the server A 140-page collection of Kennesaw State emails, obtained Friday by the Coalition for Good Governments via an open records search, details the destruction of the data on all three servers and a partial and ultimately ineffective effort by Kennesaw State systems engineers to fix the main server's security hole.As a result of the failed effort, sensitive data on Georgia's 6.7 million voters including social security numbers, party affiliation and birthdates as well as passwords used by county officials to access elections management files remained exposed for months.The problem was first discovered by Atlanta security researcher Logan Lamb, who happened across it while doing online research in August 2016.He informed the election center's director at the time, noting in an email that "there is a strong possibility your site is already compromised."Based on his review of the emails, Lamb believes that electronic polling books could have been altered in Georgia's biggest counties to add or drop voters or to scramble their data.Malicious hackers could have altered the templates of the memory cards used in voting machines to skew results.An attacker could even have modified "ballot-building" files to corrupt the count, said Lamb, who works at Atlanta-based Bastille Networks.But it will be impossible to know for sure unless the FBI provides a copy of the server image for analysis.Read or Share this story:

Apple says iPhone X pre-orders are 'off the charts':::::(Reuters) - Apple Inc quashed concerns of muted demand for its iPhone X on Friday, saying pre-orders for the 10th anniversary phone were off the charts.Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017.REUTERS/Stephen Lam The companys shares, which have fallen steadily since it announced in early September it would launch two iPhones within two months, rose nearly 3 percent in response.Pre-orders for the much-anticipated 10th anniversary phone started from 12.01 am PT (0701 GMT) on Friday.We can see from the initial response, customer demand is off the charts, an Apple spokeswoman told Reuters.Were working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible.The companys website showed delivery times pushed out to five to six weeks for the phone, compared to an initial plan of Nov. 3.IPhone Xs launch follows weeks of concerns among analysts about the production of the new phone, which for the first time includes new facial identification software to replace the fingerprint used on previous phones.FILE PHOTO: An attendee checks out a new iPhone X during an Apple launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017.REUTERS/Stephen Lam Analysts have cautioned that production of the phone was below target, due to difficulties in producing the TrueDepth camera system, which houses sophisticated cameras and sensors making it possible to unlock the phone using Face ID.Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades.Major promotions on the iPhone X from U.S. carriers have yet to materialize, and in some cases, the offers have been even less generous than what was available for the iPhone 8, said Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG in a research note on Thursday.The base price for the phone is $999.He noted that Sprint Corps iPhone X promotion of $350 in savings for trading in an eligible device was the most aggressive but still lower than what it offered for last years launch of the iPhone 7.However, electronics retailer Best Buy Co is charging shoppers an extra $100, if they wish to buy an unactivated iPhone X outright.If customers order the phone on an installment billing plan, they will pay the same price charged by Apple and the carriers.Our prices reflect the fact that no matter a customers desired plan or carrier, or whether a customer is on a business or personal plan, they are able to get a phone the way they want at Best Buy, Best Buy spokeswoman Carly Charlson said.Our customers have told us they want this flexibility and sometimes that has a cost.
Telekom CEO argues for strong No. 3 player in U.S. wireless market: newspaper:::::FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A strong No.3 player in the U.S. wireless market would enhance competition, the chief of Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) told a German newspaper, as T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) seeks to merge with Sprint Corp (S.N).Timotheus Hoettges, Chief Executive Officer of Germany's telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom AG poses for a picture at the Cyber Defense and Security Operation Center (SOC) of Telekom Security in Bonn October 26, 2017.REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay Chief executive officer Timotheus Hoettges also urged the new German government to think twice before selling down its large stake in Deutsche Telekom, according to an interview in Welt am Sonntag.T-Mobile US, majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom, is close to agreeing tentative terms on a deal to merge with Sprint Corp, people familiar with the matter have said, a breakthrough in efforts to merge the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers.Hoettges, in the interview published on Sunday, declined to comment directly on talks between the companies.In the U.S. there is a duopoly between two very big players, and then there are two smaller players well behind, he said.A third strong player would be good for competition.Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T Inc (T.N) are the two largest wireless carriers.Competition regulators have in the past quashed consolidation efforts by T-Mobile, but Hoettges said chances are now better under U.S. President Donald Trump.History has taught us that governments led by Republicans are more hands-off than Democratic administrations, he said.On the German states nearly 32 percent stake in Deutsche Telekom, Hoettges acknowledged it would be the new governments decision whether to sell or keep.But he said those who argued for a sale should perhaps ask themselves who will buy the stake.What interest would the owner have in infrastructure security?Would the owner want to invest in Germany, and if so, where and in particular, how much?The FDP and Green parties, which are in talks to form a coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkels conservatives, have both advocated a sale or partial sale of the stake.

U.S. wants to remove 'unnecessary' barriers to self-driving vehicles:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic-Safety Administration said Friday it is looking for input on how it can remove regulatory roadblocks to self-driving cars.FILE PHOTO -The rear of a Lexus SUV equipped with Google self-driving sensors is seen during a media preview of Google's prototype autonomous vehicles in Mountain View, California September 29, 2015.REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage/File Photo The auto safety agency said in a report that it wants to find any unnecessary regulatory barriers to self-driving cars particularly those that are not equipped with controls for a human driver.The agency also wants comments on what research it needs to conduct before deciding whether to eliminate or rewrite regulations.But it could take the agency years to complete the research and finalize rule changes, and advocates are pushing Congress to act.NHTSA said in a statement it plans to issue a formal notice in the near future requesting comment on the hurdles.The agency hopes to make the notice public by the end of November.Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle.The agency said last year that current regulations pose significant regulatory hurdles to vehicles without human controls.In early October, a U.S. Senate committee unanimously gave the green light to a bill aimed at speeding the use of self-driving cars without human controls and would allow the agency to waive requirements.General Motors Co (GM.N), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and others have lobbied for the landmark legislation, while auto safety groups urged more safeguards and have pledged to keep fighting for changes.The Senate Commerce Committee approved the bill, and the U.S. House passed a similar measure last month.Automakers would be able to win exemptions from NHTSA for safety rules for up to 80,000 vehicles annually within three years.Under the Senate measure, NHTSA would have to write permanent rules on self-driving cars within a decade.
Facebook, in reversal, to publish cache of political ads:::::SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) announced a plan to increase transparency about its role in political advertising on Friday, ahead of congressional hearings next week on social media companies and Russias meddling in last years U.S. presidential election.FILE PHOTO: Facebook logo is seen at a start-up companies gathering at Paris' Station F in Paris, France on January 17, 2017.REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo Rob Goldman, Facebooks vice president for ads, said in a blog post that the company would launch a publicly searchable archive next year containing details about the advertisements it runs related to U.S. federal elections.Details will include the size of spending and the demographics of the audience the ads reached, Goldman said.The archive, beginning with ads carried in 2018, will cover a rolling four-year period, he said.Internet political ads have boomed in recent years as U.S. politicians looked for different ways to reach potential supporters, and as companies including Facebook have created tools to allow targeted marketing.Online ads, though, are generally viewable only to the intended audience, raising concerns among transparency advocates, researchers and lawmakers about how to hold politicians accountable for what they say.The planned archive reflects a change in corporate policy for the worlds largest social network, which had previously resisted the idea.In June, Facebook told Reuters that it would go on treating political ads like all others and that creating an online repository would violate the confidentiality of those advertisers.Since then, Facebook, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Alphabet Incs (GOOGL.O) Google have all said that Russia-based operatives bought ads and used fake names on their services to spread politically divisive messages in the months before and after the 2016 U.S. election.Moscow has denied interfering in the election.Next week, general counsels for Facebook, Google and Twitter will testify before public hearings of three U.S. congressional committees about the alleged interference and proposed legislation to require them to disclose election-related ads.Goldman wrote in his post: Transparency helps everyone, especially political watchdog groups and reporters, keep advertisers accountable for who they say they are and what they say to different groups.Facebook said its archive will eventually expand beyond the United States and show ads from elections in other countries and jurisdictions.In the future, advertisers on Facebook will also be required to include a disclosure in election-related ads, to read: Paid for by, the company said.The announcement fleshes out ideas that Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg outlined in September, as criticism of California-based Facebook built inside the United States over the Russian ads.The changes will test in Canada before being brought to the United States ahead of November 2018 elections, Facebook said.Twitter took similar steps this week, saying it would add labels to election-related ads and say who is behind them, and it barred two Russian media outlets from running ads.

Uber hires Pepsi's Tony West as new chief legal officer:::::SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] said on Friday it hired a new chief legal officer to guide the company through its many legal quandaries, filling one of the crucial vacancies in its leadership.FILE PHOTO: An Uber sign is seen in a car in New York, U.S. June 30, 2015.REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/File Photo Tony West will join Uber next month from PepsiCo Inc, where as general counsel he led a team of lawyers across more than 200 countries.He was also a former federal prosecutor and senior official in the U.S. Department of Justice under former President Barack Obama.At Uber, West will contend with a number of criminal probes and one of the biggest legal battles playing out in Silicon Valley, a lawsuit against Uber from Alphabet Incs self-driving car unit, Waymo.Tony is exactly what Uber needs now, Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi wrote in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters.West is the first significant hire for Khosrowshahi, whom the Uber board hired in August after former CEO Travis Kalanick was pressured by investors to resign following a series of company controversies.Salle Yoo formerly held Ubers top legal job, but she is departing the company in the coming weeks.Last month, Yoo said she would leave Uber when a new general counsel was hired.Many of Ubers senior jobs remain vacant, including chief financial officer, but the general counsel role was among Ubers most critical to fill.The company faces a long list of legal tangles, including the lawsuit from Waymo that alleges trade-secrets theft; a class-action lawsuit from drivers; and a number of federal investigations that span possible bribery of foreign officials in Asian countries and the use of software to evade regulators.Earlier this week, three Latina software engineers sued Uber in San Francisco, alleging discrimination based on their gender and race.During his three-year tenure at Pepsi, West was also one of that companys leading advocates for diversity, Khosrowshahi said.While in government, West helped the Justice Department secure a nearly $17 billion settlement with Bank of America over toxic mortgage securities and played an integral role in the 2011 decision by the Obama administration to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act, which barred federal recognition of same-sex marriages.West also has family ties to government.He is married to Maya Harris, a former senior adviser to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and his sister-in-law is California Senator Kamala Harris.Pepsi said in a statement it had replaced West with Dave Yawman, the companys senior vice president and deputy general counsel.

Britain believes North Korea was behind 'WannaCry' NHS cyber attack:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Friday it believed North Korea was behind the WannaCry cyber attack in May that disrupted businesses and government services worldwide, including the National Health Service (NHS) in England.FILE PHOTO: An NHS logo is displayed outside a hospital in London, Britain May 14, 2017.REUTERS/Neil Hall Security Minister Ben Wallace said Britain believed quite strongly that the ransomware attack came from a foreign state."North Korea was the state that we believe was involved in this worldwide attack on our systems," he told BBC radio.We can be as sure as possible - I cant obviously go into the detailed intelligence but it is widely believed in the community and across a number of countries that North Korea had taken this role.WannaCry infected more than 300,000 computers in 150 countries in a matter of days, demanding victims pay ransoms starting at $300 to regain access to their machines.Cyber security researchers quickly identified a possible link to North Korea.More than a third of Englands 236 NHS trusts and an estimated 19,000 appointments were affected, Britains National Audit Office said on Friday in a report on the attack.It said WannaCry was a relatively unsophisticated attack that could have been prevented by the NHS had it followed basic IT security best practice.No NHS organization paid the ransom but the government does not know how much the disruption to services cost the NHS, it said.Wallace said Britain needed to redouble its efforts to strengthen cyber security.Its a salient lesson for us all that all of us, from individuals to governments to large organizations, have a role to play in maintaining the security of our networks, he said.
Wall Street loves electric cars, America loves trucks:::::DETROIT (Reuters) - Wall Street may love the shares of Silicon Valley electric carmaker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), but Americans love big, fuel-thirsty trucks like Ford Motor Cos (F.N) bestselling F-Series pickups and are paying ever higher prices to buy them.Joe Hinrichs, Executive VP and President, The Americas for Ford, introduces the 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor pickup truck at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, January 11, 2016.REUTERS/Mark Blinch The auto industry is at a crossroads, with the future of legacy automakers like Ford, General Motors Co (GM.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) uncertain as governments float proposals to ban internal combustion engines over the next two decades.But in the present, consumer enthusiasm for trucks and sport utility vehicles is strong, especially in the United States.And that is providing Ford, GM and other established automakers with billions in cash to mount a challenge to Tesla.Tesla has ambitions to boost annual sales to 500,000 vehicles a year.But it is wrestling with the sort of production problems that old-line automakers have largely put behind them, and has reported a net loss of $666.7 million through the first six months of 2017.Analysts expect the company to post a third quarter net loss of $380.4 million when it reports results next Wednesday.Electric cars are money losers, which explains why global automakers have been slow to roll them out until now.But regulatory and consumer pressures are forcing established automakers to put more electric vehicles in their fleets over the next several years.In a cash-intensive industry, profits from pickups and SUVs may give them a competitive edge.Ford said on Thursday that the average price of one of its F-series pickups rose $2,800 to an average $45,400 a truck in the third quarter.Sales of F-series trucks, which range from spartan work trucks to Platinum models with the features - and price tags - of a European luxury sedan, were up nearly 11 percent to 658,636 vehicles for the first nine months of this year.GM has driven its share price up nearly 30 percent so far in 2017 as Chief Executive Mary Barra has talked up plans for putting self-driving, electric Chevrolet Bolts into ride services fleets within a few quarters.Barra told investors on Tuesday improved profit margins on trucks were one of the big drivers of the overall 8.3 percent margins in the automakers North American business during the latest quarter.GM has forecast free cash flow for the full year of roughly $6 billion.That is $1 billion less than forecast earlier this year, but strong enough to fund the companys promise to develop 20 more electric vehicles by 2023 and send $7 billion back to shareholders.Tesla Model 3 cars are seen as Tesla holds an event at the factory handing over its first 30 Model 3 vehicles to employee buyers at the company's Fremont facility in California, U.S., July 28, 2017.Courtesy Tesla/Handout via REUTERS GM, which emerged from a government funded bankruptcy eight years ago, now has $31.4 billion in available funds, including $17.3 billion in cash.Ford lags behind GM in sales of battery electric models, but the company has said it will spend $5 billion developing battery electric and hybrid models.Fords new Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett has said the plans include shifting $500 million into electric vehicle development from internal combustion projects.Fords share price has been flat for the year as the No.2 U.S. automaker ushered out former CEO Mark Fields.Still, it had $28 billion in cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30.Automakers also are becoming more confident they can make money on electric cars as battery costs come down.Volkswagen AGs (VOWG_p.DE) Audi brand is gearing up a fleet of electric models that the company expects will account for 25 percent of sales by 2025.In the United States, Audi plans to launch an electric SUV in the sweet spot of the market in 2019, Scott Keogh, head of Audis U.S. operations, told Reuters on Thursday.Sales of Audis current lineup of SUVs pay for what we want to do, which is lead the future, Keogh said.Renault SA (RENA.PA) Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn expressed confidence earlier this month that electric cars will become a significant contributor to our performance.Tesla, by comparison to its legacy rivals, is market value rich, and cash poor.It had $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, and some analysts predict the automaker will have to raise more to cover the expected cash drain from the slow launch of the Model 3, which is lower priced than other Teslas and aimed at the market for $35,000 to $45,000 cars.Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has outlined ambitious plans to expand its network of factories and service facilities, including potentially an assembly plant in China and up to three more electric battery Gigafactories.He told investors in July the company could sell more shares to fund that expansion.Im sure there will be some funding rounds that happen in the future, he said.

team has determined to be a piece of debris from the spacecraft, possibly shed during the landing.Hide Caption 19 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity The rover's scoop contains larger soil particles that were too big to filter through a sample-processing sieve.After a full-scoop sample had been vibrated over the sieve, this portion was returned to the scoop for inspection by the rover's mast camera.Hide Caption 20 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity cut a wheel scuff mark into a wind-formed ripple at the "Rocknest" site on October 3, 2012.This gave researchers a better opportunity to examine the particle-size distribution of the material forming the ripple.Hide Caption 21 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity NASA's Curiosity rover found evidence for what scientists believe was an ancient, flowing stream on Mars at a few sites, including the rock outcrop pictured here.The key evidence for the ancient stream comes from the size and rounded shape of the gravel in and around the bedrock, according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/Caltech science team.The rounded shape leads the science team to conclude they were transported by a vigorous flow of water.The grains are too large to have been moved by wind.Hide Caption 22 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity completed its longest drive to date on September 26, 2012.The rover moved about 160 feet

Japan is building the world's fastest supercomputer:::::This feature is part of Vision Japan , a series about the visionaries who are changing Japan, and the places that inspire this innovation.See more here .(CNN) Japan is building the world's fastest supercomputer, which it hopes will make the country the new global hub for artificial intelligence research.The supercomputer is expected to run at a speed of 130 petaflops, meaning it is able to perform a mind-boggling 130 quadrillion calculations per second (that's 130 million billion).Once complete (the target date is April 2018), the AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure (ABCI) will be the most powerful supercomputer in the world, surpassing the current champion, China's Sunway TaihuLight, currently operating at 93 petaflops.What makes a computer 'super'?While the ABCI will not have a mouse or screen, it's not vastly different from a personal computer -- just souped-up, a whole lot faster, and much, much bigger."The current supercomputer system is one million times faster than your personal computers," explains Satoshi Sekiguchi, a director general at Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.Sekiguchi calculates that it would take 3,000 years for a personal computer to achieve what a supercomputer can do in just one day.In terms of size, Japan's supercomputer will be comparable to a parking lot with space for 30 to 40 cars."The supercomputer that is currently under development would take up about 1,000 square meters of floor space," says Sekiguchi.What will it be used for?The ABCI could help Japanese companies develop and improve driverless cars, robotics and medical diagnostics, explains Sekiguchi."A supercomputer is an extremely important tool for accelerating the advancement in such fields," he says.Its supersonic speed will also help Japan develop advances in artificial intelligence technologies, such as "deep learning."But supercomputers are to thank for smaller everyday inventions too."The initial design of paper diapers was actually done using a supercomputer," explains Sekiguchi."However, mothers continue to use them without knowing that fact."Photos: Supercomputers breaking barriers Sunway-TaihuLight Chinese supercomputer Sunway-TaihuLight is currently the fastest supercomputer in the world, operating at 93 petaflops.That means it's able to perform 93 quadrillion (million billion) calculations per second.China uses the supercomputer for weather forecasting, pharmaceutical research, and industrial design.Hide Caption 1 of 6

FCC Chief Urges Hold-Out Apple to Enable Radio Chips in iPhones to Save Lives:::::The U.S. military visited the city of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, as the area is dealing with massive damage to buildings and homes, as well as electrical and water infrastructure, from Hurricane Maria.Other US agencies like the Coast Guard, FEMA, Red Cross, the Puerto Rican Emergency Management Agency and Puerto Rican police are also making their way through Humacao, Puerto Rico, bringing aid, meals and water with them.(Published Thursday, Sept. 28, 2017) The iPhone is an incredibly advanced device, but some versions have a very old piece of technology embedded in it lying dormant: a radio receiver.Now, the chairman of the U.S. agency that regulates radio, phones and other forms of communication wants Apple to activate the FM chips in iPhones to help get information to Puerto Ricans, whose island is near-totally blacked-out after Hurricane Maria hit land with devastating force last week."When wireless networks go down during a natural disaster, smartphones with activated FM chips can allow Americans to get vital access to life-saving information," said Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai Thursday in a statement."I applaud those companies that have done the right thing by activating the FM chips in their phones.Apple is the one major phone manufacturer that has resisted doing so."Pai's call was backed by the National Association of Broadcasters, which also urged Apple to "light up the FM chip."President Trump to Visit Puerto Rico President Donald Trump will visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday to view the hurricane damage personally.Trump talked about the rescue and recovery efforts, and the challenges presented due to the island's location.(Published Wednesday, Sept. 27, 2017) "It is time for Apple to step up to the plate and put the safety of the American people first," Pai said in his statement.Puerto Rico is in the midst of what San Juan's mayor Carmen Yuln Cruz, House Speaker Paul Ryan and others have called a humanitarian crisis.Nearly half the island is without water and about all electricity customers without power as of Wednesday, according to federal agencies' most recent updates.About nine in 10 cellphone sites were still out of service by Wednesday, and residents have complained that there's no way for them to get vital news about where to get supplies.Many people continue to be unable simply to reach family members on the mainland.Usually, smartphones get data through the internet, but with so much of the island crippled, internet service is very hard to come by.But the FM chips that most phones are made with would allow them to tune into radio frequencies without anything other than power if the chips are activated, and users have an app downloaded that can access broadcasts.Pai has long identified this capability as being important option for smartphone owners to have when disasters hit, and the FCC has recognized that it's particularly useful in disaster situations when the internet is hard to access."I don't think people realize how vulnerable people get," said former FEMA Administator Craig Fugate, citing cell system overload during Hurricane Sandy and the Virginia earthquake, in an interview with NAB.FEMA urges people to have battery-powered radios in their disaster preparedness kits, but Fugate said in the 2014 interview, "If your radio's now in your cellphone, that's one less device that you have to have extra."Currently, the NAB-supported NextRadio app, which can broadcast from the FM chip, is available on a wide variety of Samsung, HTC, Moto and other smartphones.But not iPhones.Apple did not respond when Wired wrote about the issue of smartphones' FM chips last year.In a statement to NBC on Thursday, an Apple spokesperson said that its iPhone 7 and new iPhone 8 do not have FM radio chips in them "nor do they have antennas designed to support FM signals, so it is not possible to enable FM reception in these products.""Apple cares deeply about the safety of our users, especially during times of crisis and thats why we have engineered modern safety solutions into our products," Apple said in a statement."Users can dial emergency services and access Medical ID card information directly from the Lock Screen, and we enable government emergency notifications, ranging from Weather Advisories to AMBER alerts."Apple did not address the older models of iPhones, and the FCC declined to comment on the company's statement.Activating the FM chip wouldn't immediately help anyone in Puerto Rico without internet already.But advocates argue it would help Americans be prepared for the next disaster.'Tonight': Fallon Encourages Fans to Help Puerto Rico Jimmy Fallon takes a moment before his show to encourage his viewers to make donations to help Puerto Rico recover from the devastating effects of Hurricane Maria.(Published Tuesday, Sept. 26, 2017) Wireless companies have long urged Congress to let FM chip activation be up to individual carriers.Asked at a 2013 congressional hearing why cellphone providers are reluctant to activatation of the chips, then-executive vice-president of the wireless association CTIA, Christopher Guttman-McCabe, said, "we leave it up to that ecosystem, and the carriers will compete against each other as well as the handset manufacturers."In a recent statement, CTIA spokesman Nick Ludlum touted wireless providers' quick response to the three recent hurricanes that hit the United States, including by bringing in portable generators and cell equipment.NBC reached out to the CTIA for a response to Pai's statement.

APNewsBreak: Georgia election server wiped after suit filed:::::A computer server crucial to a lawsuit against Georgia election officials was quietly wiped clean by its custodians just after the suit was filed, The Associated Press has learned.The server's data was destroyed July 7 by technicians at the Center for Elections Systems at Kennesaw State University, which runs the state's election system.The data wipe was revealed in an email sent last week from an assistant state attorney general to plaintiffs in the case that was later obtained by the AP.More emails obtained in a public records request confirmed the wipe.The lawsuit, filed July 3 by a diverse group of election reform advocates, aims to force Georgia to retire its antiquated and heavily criticized election technology.The server in question, which served as a statewide staging location for key election-related data, made national headlines in June after a security expert disclosed a gaping security hole that wasn't fixed six months after he reported it to election authorities.WIPED OUT It's not clear who ordered the server's data irretrievably erased.The Kennesaw elections center answers to Georgia's secretary of state, Brian Kemp, a Republican running for governor in 2018 and the suit's main defendant.His spokeswoman issued a statement Thursday saying his office had neither involvement nor advanced warning of the decision.It blamed "the undeniable ineptitude" at the Kennesaw State elections center.After declining comment for more than 24 hours, Kennesaw State's media office issued a statement late Thursday attributing the server wiping to "standard operating procedure."It did not respond to the AP's question on who ordered the action.Plaintiffs in the lawsuit, mostly Georgia voters, want to scrap the state's 15-year-old vote-management system particularly its 27,000 AccuVote touchscreen voting machines, hackable devices that don't use paper ballots or keep hardcopy proof of voter intent.The plaintiffs were counting on an independent security review of the Kennesaw server, which held elections staging data for counties, to demonstrate the system's unreliability.Wiping the server "forestalls any forensic investigation at all," said Richard DeMillo, a Georgia Tech computer scientist following the case."People who have nothing to hide don't behave this way."STATE SECURITY The server data could have revealed whether Georgia's most recent elections were compromised by hackers.The plaintiffs contend results of both last November's election and a special June 20 congressional runoff won by Kemp's predecessor, Karen Handel cannot be trusted.Possible Russian interference in U.S. politics, including attempts to penetrate voting systems, has been an acute national preoccupation since the Obama administration sounded the alarm more than a year ago.Kemp and his GOP allies insist Georgia's elections system is secure.But Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a plaintiff, believes server data was erased precisely because the system isn't secure."I don't think you could find a voting systems expert who would think the deletion of the server data was anything less than insidious and highly suspicious," she said.NOW YOU SEE IT, NOW YOU DON'T It could still be possible to recover relevant information from the server.The FBI is known to have made an exact data image of the server in March when it investigated the security hole.The Oct. 18 email disclosing the server wipe said the state attorney general's office was "reaching out to the FBI to determine whether they still have the image" and also disclosed that two backup servers were wiped clean Aug. 9, just as the lawsuit moved to federal court.On Wednesday, the attorney general's office notified the court of its intent to subpoena the FBI seeking the image.Atlanta FBI spokesman Stephen Emmett would not say if that image still exists.Nor would he say whether agents examined it to determine whether the server's files might have been altered by unauthorized users.FAILING TO SERVICE THE SERVER A 180-page collection of Kennesaw State emails, obtained Friday by the Coalition for Good Governments via an open records search, details the destruction of the data on all three servers and a partial and ultimately ineffective effort by Kennesaw State systems engineers to fix the main server's security hole.As a result of the failed effort, sensitive data on Georgia's 6.7 million voters including Social Security numbers, party affiliation and birthdates as well as passwords used by county officials to access elections management files remained exposed for months.The problem was first discovered by Atlanta security researcher Logan Lamb while doing online research in August 2016.He informed the election center's director at the time, noting in an email "there is a strong possibility your site is already compromised."Based on his review of the emails, Lamb believes that electronic polling books could have been altered in Georgia's biggest counties to add or drop voters or to scramble their data.Malicious hackers could have altered the templates of voting machine memory cards to skew results.An attacker could even have potentially modified "ballot-building" files to corrupt the outcome, said Lamb, who works at Atlanta-based security firm Bastille Networks.THE BIGGER PICTURE Though striking, the wayward election server is seen as just part of a much larger problem.The Department of Homeland Security says 21 states had elections systems scanned or penetrated by Russia-backed hackers last year, though there's no evidence they altered voting outcomes.But computer security experts say it's possible Russians or other malicious actors have sown undetected booby traps in the highly decentralized U.S. voting landscape.In June, a leaked National Security Agency memo showed that 122 elections officials in various states were targeted with phishing emails crafted by Russian agents intent on stealing their passwords.CALL TO INVESTIGATE Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr was urged Thursday to investigate.GOP state Rep. Scot Turner: "They should go and look at who did it and why they did it and see ... whether there was criminal intent."Carr's office declined comment.Georgia U.S. Rep Hank Johnson, a Democrat, separately said the server wipe "appears to be a willful and premeditated destruction of evidence" by election officials, adding, "Georgia voters should be as outraged as I am."Sara Henderson, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, noted Kemp has repeatedly denied involvement in the university's decisions on voting machine security."Georgia is not creating a climate of voting integrity for our citizens by continuing to blame shift," Henderson said via email.Frank Bajak on Twitter: http://twitter.com/fbajak

Brown/AFP/Getty Images Tech analyst predictions [The iPhone X is] what all phones will be in the future.Im stopping short of calling it game-changing, said Patrick Moorhead, a tech industry analyst at Moors Insights Strategy.He said that the Samsung Galaxy 8 is a better phone but that from a consumer point of view, the iPhone X provides one of the best experiences, I would say the best experience.It has the highest speed LTE, but unfortunately, it doesnt support gigabit LTE that premium Android phones have.Gigabit LTE is the fastest cellphone service available.He sees one of the top-selling features of the phone as the size.It has the display size of the Plus but the pocket size of a regular iPhone, he explained.As for the design of the phone, Moorhead sees it as what all phones will be in the future.Before the phone went on sale, Moorhead had predicted that the iPhone X will sell out so fast that its not even funny and that people are hesitant to buy the iPhone 8 because of the X edition.Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images The iPhone X is an extremely sought-after product.Tech industry analyst Daniel Ives, the head of technology research at GBH Insights in New York, agreed, referring to the iPhone 8 as a placeholder for the iPhone X. I think presales going on Friday and this weekend could approach 40 million units, said Ives.To actually get your hands on an iPhone between now and the holiday season is going to be an impressive feat.The iPhone X is an extremely sought-after product.Unlike Moorhead, Ives sees the iPhone X as an industry game changer.From a product functionality standpoint, it is pure optic technology, Ives said.GBH Insights analysis showed that an estimated 350 million iPhone users are up for an upgrade or will be eligible within the next year, and Ives thinks that most of these users will want to spring for the X.The real success of [the iPhone X] is going to be during 2018, Ives predicted, but he questioned whether the sticker shock will be a deterrent for buyers.According to surveys by GBH Insights, fewer than 20 percent of surveyed users saw the price as a deterrent.
Russia's RT says Twitter pushed it for ads before election:::::Interested in Russia?Add Russia as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Russian state-owned television station RT says Twitter had pushed it to spend millions on advertising ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.The San Francisco company had announced Thursday that it would ban ads from RT and Sputnik, two state-sponsored Russian news outlets that the U.S. intelligence community has said tried to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.RT replied Thursday by publishing what it said were excerpts from Twitter's pitch made in April last year to get the TV station to spend millions of dollars on advertising, an offer that RT says it has turned down.RT's editor in chief, Margarita Simonyan, on Thursday tweeted to Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey, saying that she hopes he "won't forget" about the pitch when he testifies at congressional hearings next week.Twitter will be joined by Google and Facebook in testifying before U.S. lawmakers on Russian meddling in the 2016 election.Twitter also said this week it will disclose more information on political ads.Speaking about the ban on Friday, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters that the Kremlin is "sorry that Twitter seems to have fallen victim to profound prejudice against Russian media" and that Twitter's "discrimination of its clients" is worrisome.Peskov expressed hope that the company will revisit the situation and see that the activities of Russian media outlets "cannot be described as election meddling."Peskov's comments struck a reconciliatory note after the Foreign Ministry on Friday vowed a "response" to the ads ban.
Misplaced monarchs: Clusters of butterflies stuck up north:::::Monarch butterflies, those delicate symbols of spring and summer, should mostly be in Texas by now, winging their way to Mexico for the winter.But Darlene Burgess keeps seeing colorful clusters of them and she lives in Canada."As nice as this is to see, I really wish I wouldn't see it because they're running out of time," said Burgess, who does evening monarch counts at Point Pelee National Park in Canada."It's really not good for them."It's not just Canada.Swarms have been seen elsewhere, including near Cape May , New Jersey, at levels more normal for late September and early October.Scientists say tens of thousands of the butterflies are likely to be stranded far north of where they'd normally be this time of year because of the unusually warm weather and strong winds that have kept them from migrating south, said biologist Elizabeth Howard, director of the monarch tracking non-profit Journey North .Many of these butterflies might not even be alive if not for the warm weather.They are thought to be a sort of bonus generation they were able to develop and emerge late in the season because it's been so unusually warm.Monarchs typically arrive in Mexico around Nov. 1.This many "stragglers" in Ontario and elsewhere is "definitely new territory for us," said University of Kansas biology professor Chip Taylor, director of Monarch Watch.Some monarchs were born late, some didn't move south because temperatures were warm, and some couldn't move south because winds were coming from the south for weeks and they couldn't fly through them.Now they may be stuck because temperatures are starting to fall.Howard said their muscles don't work when temperatures dip into the 50s.And if they don't freeze, they are likely to starve to death because much of the plants they need to feed their long voyage south are already gone for the season, biologists said."What's really important is they've got to get out of town," Howard said.Burgess counted hundreds of them Sunday, watched several of them fight the strong wind on Tuesday and fall into the waves of Lake Erie.She saw at least 50 on Thursday."It's very strange," said Sweet Briar College biology professor Lincoln Brower, who has been studying monarchs since 1954.Monarchs stuck up north are one of many signs of climate change toying with the natural world's timing, such as delaying first fall freezes and bringing spring earlier, said Jake Weltzin, a U.S. Geological Survey ecologist who heads a national network which studies when plants and animals bloom, change colors, migrate and hibernate.Karen Oberhauser, a biologist at the University of Wisconsin, saw a monarch on Oct. 20 in Madison, and sees some hope for the butterflies if not for the planet.If not for the heat, some of these butterflies would have died as caterpillars, she noted, and some will beat the odds and make it to Mexico."It's not an ominous sign for monarchs, but it is ominous," Oberhauser said.Monarchs have had some very lean years lately, and there is a petition to make them a threatened species.They are battling a dwindling food supply, especially milkweeds which are the only thing they eat when in the caterpillar stage, habitat loss, climate change and pesticides, Brower said.Hopes that this would be a big bounce-back year have now dwindled.Taylor wouldn't say it's a good year, but it's not as bad as some others, especially a horrible 2013-2014 season."Not all is lost," Taylor said.Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .His work can be found here .
Trump opposes massive California water project:::::The Trump administration pulled support Wednesday from Gov.Jerry Brown's ambitious plan to build California's biggest water project in decades, casting the current form of the $16 billion proposal to build two giant tunnels as another unwanted legacy from the Obama era The comments from a U.S. Department of the Interior spokesman marked the first public statements by the Trump administration on the initiative and signaled the latest setback for the project that California's 79-year-old leader had hoped to see launched before he leaves office next year.The Obama administration gave millions of dollars for planning the tunnels, but "the Trump administration did not fund the project and chose to not move forward with it," Russell Newell, deputy communications director for the U.S.Interior Department, said in an email.Asked in an email exchange if his statement meant the Department of Interior "isn't going to be moving forward with California's tunnels project, is that right?The Trump administration has ruled that out?"Newell responded, "Yes."Newell later softened the statement, saying the Interior Departmenit shared California's goals for a more reliable and environmentally friendly water supply but "does not expect to participate in the construction or funding" of the project in its current form.Interior officials "will continue to work with the state and stakeholders as the project is further developed," Newell said.While the plan is a state initiative that was never slated to draw upon federal financing, it would intersect with existing state and federal water projects and would require approval from the Interior Department to move ahead.Brown wants California water agencies to pay to plan and build two, 35-mile-long tunnels to divert part of the state's largest river, the Sacramento, to supply water to the San Francisco Bay Area and central and Southern California.But the plan has hit its biggest obstacles yet in recent weeks, when two key water districts opted not to help fund it.In another setback, the Interior Department's inspector-general last month challenged the $84 million that the federal agency had contributed to the project under Obama, calling it an improper use of taxpayer funds.As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump called broadly for more projects to bring water to farmers in California, the country's leading agricultural state.Lisa Lien-Mager, a spokeswoman for the state Natural Resources Agency, said the statement Wednesday from the Interior Department was good news for the project."The statement provided by the DOI confirms what the state and its water project partners already knew; while the federal government does not intend to fund the construction costs of the project they will continue working with the state and stakeholders to facilitate and permit WaterFix," she wrote in an email, using the state's term for the tunnel project.Trump's administration had not previously taken a stand on the tunnels project pushed by California's Democratic governor, though federal wildlife agencies gave the green light in June.They found that the plan would not mean extinction for endangered and threatened native species, including native salmon.The Trump administration has targeted a number of projects supported by Obama, from immigration initiatives to international trade deals.Trump's policies also are at odds with many of those backed by Brown, who has referred to the president's supporters as cave-dwellers and called Trump's actions in office "stupid and dangerous and silly."Until now, however, Brown had avoided most public rifts with the Trump administration over federal decisions dealing with California.Brown's administration and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, with Brown one of the project's main backers, argued the two tunnels each the width of a three-lane highway would make for more reliable water supplies, especially for the more arid south.Supporters and opponents disagree on the effect on struggling native species.Opponents say the tunnels could be used to drain much of the water from the West Coast's largest estuary the San Francisco Bay and adjoining rivers."At a minimum, this announcement certainly complicates the state's chances of ever funding and permitting the massive twin tunnels project," said Doug Obegi, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which opposes the plan."It's yet another reason for the state to transparently work with all stakeholders to reconsider this proposal."Newell, with the Interior Department, made his statements in response to a request Tuesday by California's Democratic members of Congress for a new probe of U.S. spending on the project under Obama.Five Democrats, including opponents of the tunnels, asked the U.S. General Accountability Office to determine whether the planning payments were illegal."The $84 million spent in taxpayers' money without disclosure to Congress and kept hidden from the public were decisions driven and executed by the Obama administration and that team," Newell said.Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke "believes that using tax dollars wisely and ethically is a big responsibility and is at the heart of good government," Newell said.Federal and state authorities were discussing cooperation on the project since at least 2008, when George W. Bush was in office.Obama's administration pushed for the tunnels, including funding planning costs.
Science Says: Jack Frost nipping at your nose ever later:::::Winter is coming ... later.And it's leaving ever earlier.Across the United States, the year's first freeze has been arriving further and further into the calendar, according to more than a century of measurements from weather stations nationwide.Scientists say it is yet another sign of the changing climate, and that it has good and bad consequences for the nation.There could be more fruits and vegetables and also more allergies and pests."I'm happy about it," said Karen Duncan of Streator, Illinois.Her flowers are in bloom because she's had no frost this year yet, just as she had none last year at this time either.On the other hand, she said just last week it was too hot and buggy to go out in late October, near Chicago.The trend of ever later first freezes appears to have started around 1980, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of data from 700 weather stations across the U.S. going back to 1895 compiled by Ken Kunkel, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information.To look for nationwide trends, Kunkel compared the first freeze from each of the 700 stations to the station's average for the 20th Century.Some parts of the country experience earlier or later freezes every year, but on average freezes are coming later.The average first freeze over the last 10 years, from 2007 to 2016, is a week later than the average from 1971 to 1980, which is before Kunkel said the trend became noticeable.This year, about 40 percent of the Lower 48 states have had a freeze as of Oct. 23, compared to 65 percent in a normal year, according to Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the private service Weather Underground.Duncan's flowers should be dead by now.According to data from the weather station near her in Ottawa, Illinois, the average first freeze for the 20th century was Oct. 15.The normal from 1981 to 2010 based on NOAA computer simulations was Oct. 19.Since 2010, the average first freeze is on Oct. 26.Last year, the first freeze in Ottawa came on Nov. 12.Last year was "way off the charts" nationwide, Kunkel said.The average first freeze was two weeks later than the 20th century average, and the last frost of spring was nine days earlier than normal.Overall the United States freeze season of 2016 was more than a month shorter than the freeze season of 1916.It was most extreme in the Pacific Northwest.Oregon's freeze season was 61 days two months shorter than normal.Global warming has helped push the first frosts later, Kunkel and other scientists said.Also at play, though, are natural short-term changes in air circulation patterns but they too may be influenced by man-made climate change, they said.This shrinking freeze season is what climate scientists have long predicted, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado.A shorter freeze season means a longer growing season and less money spent on heat.But it also hurts some plants that require a certain amount of chill, such as Georgia peaches, said Theresa Crimmins, a University of Arizona ecologist.Crimmins is assistant director of the National Phenology Network .Phenology is the study of the seasons and how plants and animals adapt to timing changes.Pests that attack trees and spread disease aren't being killed off as early as they normally would be, Crimmins said.In New England, many trees aren't changing colors as vibrantly as they normally do or used to because some take cues for when to turn from temperature, said Boston University biology professor Richard Primack.Clusters of late-emerging monarch butterflies are being found far further north than normal for this time of year, and are unlikely to survive their migration to Mexico.Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said natural variability, especially an El Nino, made last year exceptional for an early freeze, but "it represents the kind of conditions that will be more routine in a decade or two" because of man-made climate change."The long-term consequences are really negative," said Primack, because shorter winters and hotter temperatures are also expected to lead to rising seas that cause worse flooding during heavy storms.In suburban Boston, Primack and his wife are still eating lettuce, tomatoes and green beans from their garden.And they are getting fresh figs off their backyard tree almost daily."These fig trees should be asleep," Primack said.AP data journalist Nicky Forster contributed to this story from New York.Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .His work can be found here .This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.The AP is solely responsible for all content.
Steve Jobs' sweet ride is part of high-end car auction:::::A sleek sports car once owned by Steve Jobs could sell for over $300,000 at a December auction practically pocket change compared to some of the million-dollar vehicles that will be offered alongside it.The Apple founder's 2000 BMW Z8 convertible is among about 30 sets of hot wheels that will be offered by a variety of consignors at the Dec. 6 sale in Manhattan.Bidders at the fantasy-fueled RM Sotheby's auction might steer toward a handsomely earth-toned 1961 Ferrari 250 GT Cabriolet Series II by Pininfarina, which has a pre-sale estimate of about $1.5 million to $1.8 million.They'll also have the chance to peruse a white, "ultimate street-legal" 1995 Porsche 911 GT2, which has a pre-sale estimate of about $1.1 million to $1.4 million, and a red 1952 Chrysler D'Elegance by Ghia, with a pre-sale estimate of about $900,000 to $1.1 million.But bidders may instead choose to geek out on Jobs' former ride a model that served as "a test bed for new engineering technologies," said the auction house."While not a car enthusiast per se," Jobs did have "a penchant for German design."The tech genius got his BMW in October 2000 in the minimalist style he is known for titanium over a black leather interior.He sold it about three years later.Although it's changed hands a couple of times, it's only clocked 15,200 miles (24460.89 kilometers).The car comes with a copy of its old California registration, under the name "Jobs, Steven P." It also comes with a hardtop, cover, manuals and a cellphone ironically, a BMW-branded Motorola.Out of garage space, but not out of bucks?A race suit and helmet might fit the bill.Steve McQueen wore them in the 1971 movie "Le Mans" and they're expected to sell for $400,000 to $500,000.
Misplaced monarchs: Clusters of butterflies stuck up north:::::Scientists say tens of thousands of monarch butterflies are far north of where they'd normally be this time of year because of the unusually warm weather and strong winds that have kept them from migrating south.Now they may be stuck because temperatures are starting to fall and food on their migration route is dwindling.Monarch butterflies should mostly be in Texas by now, winging their way to Mexico for the winter.Biologists and butterfly enthusiasts are seeing swarms of them as far north as southern Canada.Scientists say the changing climate is likely behind the unusual butterfly patterns.
Einstein's theory of happiness sells for $1.3M at auction:::::While Albert Einstein's theory of happiness may be relative, it fetched $1.3 million at a Jerusalem auction on Tuesday.The Nobel-winning scientist's musings, on a handwritten note, may not be as famous as his groundbreaking theory of relativity, but they still shed light on one of the great modern minds.Winner's Auctions and Exhibitions said Einstein was traveling in Japan in 1922 when he was told he would be awarded the Nobel Prize in physics.In Tokyo, Einstein scribbled the note in German to a bellboy after he did not have cash to give him a tip."A calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness," it reads.Gal Wiener, CEO of the auction house, said Einstein told the bellboy that because of his fame, the handwritten note "will probably be worth more than a regular tip."Wiener said bidding began at $2,000 and quickly escalated, with the bidding war lasting around 25 minutes.Another note Einstein gave the bellboy, which read "Where there's a will there's a way," was sold for over $200,000, Wiener said.He would not identify the buyer or seller of either note.Einstein was a founder of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and left it his literary estate and personal papers.He declined an invitation to serve as Israel's first president.Einstein died in 1955.
Twitter to ban ads from Russia's RT, Sputnik:::::Twitter says it will ban ads from RT and Sputnik, two state-sponsored Russian news outlets that the U.S. intelligence community has said tried to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.The San Francisco company also plans to donate proceeds from RT, formally known as Russia Today, and Sputnik ads to support outside research on Twitter use in civic engagement and elections.This amounts to $1.9 million the company expects to have earned since 2011.Twitter, Google and Facebook are scheduled to testify at congressional hearings next week on Russian meddling in the 2016 election.Twitter also said this week it will disclose more information on political ads.Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told state news agency RIA Novosti that Twitter's move is "another aggressive step" aimed at blocking RT.She also hinted at retaliation."Of course, a response will follow," she said.
EPA keeps scientists from speaking about report on climate:::::Interested in Climate Change?Add Climate Change as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Climate Change news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The Environmental Protection Agency kept three scientists from speaking at a Monday event in a move condemned by researchers and Democratic members of Congress as an attempt by the agency to silence a discussion of climate change.The scientists were scheduled to discuss a report on the health of Narragansett Bay, New England's largest estuary.Among the findings in the 500-page report is that climate change is affecting air and water temperatures, precipitation, sea level and fish.The EPA didn't explain why the scientists were told not to speak, but said in a statement that the agency supports the program that published the document, the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program, with a $600,000 annual grant.The EPA is the sole funder of the program."EPA scientists are attending, they simply are not presenting; it is not an EPA conference," agency spokeswoman Nancy Grantham said in a statement Monday.Several people involved in the report and members of the state's congressional delegation likened it to scientific censorship.They cited EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who has rejected the scientific consensus on climate change.During a news conference releasing the report on Monday, John King, a professor of oceanography at the University of Rhode Island and the chair of the science advisory committee for the estuary program, compared the decision to the opening move of a chess game."It's the opening gambit.Can we censor science and get away with it?I would say I hope not," King said, adding a message that he directed to Pruitt."Our job is to inform policy.Hopefully it becomes good policy.Let us do our job, without fear of losing our jobs."Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said it made him sick to his stomach that federal scientists would not be allowed to discuss climate change in public."Because this was going to be about climate change ... they simply don't want to allow those words to be said, and they don't want people from their agency to be caught saying them," he said."It's just been a constant effort at trying to silence conversation about climate change."Thomas Borden, program director of the estuary program, said Wayne Munns, director of EPA's Atlantic Ecology Division, called him Friday afternoon to say two staffers who work out of its research lab in the town of Narragansett had been advised that they could not attend.Munns did not give him an explanation, but Borden said he understood that the decision came from EPA headquarters in Washington.One of the staffers, Autumn Oczkowski, was scheduled to give the keynote at an afternoon workshop session.Another, Rose Martin, was scheduled to speak on a panel.After Munns' call, Borden said he checked with an EPA consultant, Emily Shumchenia, who King said was detailed to the estuary program and who wrote significant portions of the report.She was told she should not participate, Borden said.Shumchenia attended the workshop Monday, but she declined to comment.Two other EPA employees also attended: the acting regional administrator and another official who was involved in the report.King said he knew when they were organizing the speaking program that there might be an issue with the EPA, given the direction under Pruitt's leadership.But he said all three were excellent young scientists, and they were asked to participate so their work could be highlighted."It was always in the back of my mind that it could happen," King said.He said he reached out to Oczkowski and Shumchenia over the weekend, and they did not tell him much about the EPA's decision, which was first reported by The New York Times."They just were shaking their heads.The one theme was: We were given no explanation whatsoever, we were just told that we weren't permitted to do this," he said.Scientists from a variety of agencies and institutions had been working for years on the technical document, the purpose of which is to examine the condition of the bay and the trends with data on 24 different environmental indicators.Those include stressors such as population, and also climate change, such as warming temperatures, increased precipitation and increased sea level rise."It's a comprehensive scientific update of the status of the bay," Borden said."It's not a policy document.It's a scientific report.It doesn't propose policy changes."

around it 360.You can see behind me that's the Chicago river over here and that's Michigan avenue behind there is this Chicago Tribune so this is a very.In porn spot for the city of Chicago.And now

inside this store guy is literally the entire thing is blast 20000.Square feet.It is years upon years in the making in this is really apples.Re imagining of what resale store what that shopping experience can look and feel like and wonderment.Really interesting things here is now we walked only halfway down the store and you seem there you don't see any products.Have queen did this store there are no products how many stores can you think of where you literally walk in and you don't see products right away while they saying at apple that one of the reasons for that is they want this to be a place where people can come and spend time together in fact.They even built these stairs out on both sides so that they look identical outside to the way they look inside.And there's thinking behind Matt they tell me that it's because they want to be able to allow people.To hang out that they want this to be a place where people can spend times when he forced them and whether it's inside the store.Or spending time out here and why wouldn't you want to spend time I hear it's beautiful this is the Chicago river.There's Michigan avenue.So you get a real sense for the surroundings here it really is right in the heart of the city of Chicago I'm just gonna take a quick peek and see if anyone's written in any comments yet.I'm curious now I'm sure there are probably some cubs fans out there.I don't know I hope you're located A guys I know it's they know was a tough one last night.Irate let's see what are we have for questions.So this is 20000 square feet price tag estimated.Adds thirty million dollars.RA I don't see questions yet but feel redirect your questions in the comments section.So price say estimated at thirty million dollars Taylor can we see inside here is it easy to CN or is it isn't bad.Are right so the reason we're not inside at this point is that they are putting together right now all of the preparations for the big unveiled today which is at 5 PM when they opened their doors up.We you can see.In in that central section.That probably looks somewhat familiar to you it's the part where all of the products are on display but all around the edges of this Apple Store.Are different things that are interactive for people Wii game a number of these things a try for example.There's a section where you can learn to code and literally learn to code.How to make a robot move around we got to play with these robots yesterday when we were in the store with Angela our friends who is the woman behind this entire concept she's the former CEO burglary she came to apple about three years ago and this is years in the making this his term vision to really bring together people as not just.A store but a meeting place.And what things about retail for anybody who follows at retail in the whole shopping experience everyone.Understands that.The entire landscape a retail is changing.Today because stores are not exactly what they used to be an apple understands that they appreciate that more and more people now are shopping online so why would you go to a store.That's the question an apple is trying to answer that they're making this a spot.Where they believe people can come in and take classes there are classes that they offer here you can see a little bit behind the trees by the way.There are trees inside this store just like the trees outside.You can see this major screen here at the monitor an LCD monitor and on that monitor you can do everything from create a picture you can drop.Literally on a on iPad you couldn't created drying and it'll show up I'm not I did something where I created a song using beats on an iPad.And that'll show up on the screen as well and they have sound system where that'll show up as well.They teach a RT kids augmented reality classes which we had a chance to.To experience yesterday but the bottom line here is the mission of retail for the future and apple has been at the forefront of changing so many things in our lives.Literally things like this that have completely changed the way that we behave in the way that we interact with technology.And now they're trying to change this.The storefront because so many retailers are trying to figure out.How do we create a storefront that people want to spend time at that people want to come to you see up here.In here there's a waiting area.These steps here.That's the new genius bar that's where if you have a question.For somebody out apple you can come in and wait any CNN genius bar I don't know you guys can see it hopefully you can.But along and genius bar there are onions so that you can charge and I asked Angela aren't yesterday when we're walking through.The building.About those plug ins and she said you don't even have to necessarily have a question for our genius bar you could just come in off of Michigan avenue.And charger phone here if that's something that you needed to do.The main thing in Apple's mind is they want this to be a place for community and a place where people come together.And and one of the things.They probably know is that when you get a chance to test out products whether your kid carrier an adult.After you spend a little time with the product usually you enjoy it and you think about buying it so even if you're coming in just a given a test run.Try Molina find some interesting things here as a customer

Science Says: Jack Frost nipping at your nose ever later:::::Winter is coming ... later.And it's leaving ever earlier.Across the United States, the year's first freeze has been arriving further and further into the calendar, according to more than a century of measurements from weather stations nationwide.Scientists say it is yet another sign of the changing climate, and that it has good and bad consequences for the nation.There could be more fruits and vegetables and also more allergies and pests."I'm happy about it," said Karen Duncan of Streator, Illinois.Her flowers are in bloom because she's had no frost this year yet, just as she had none last year at this time either.On the other hand, she said just last week it was too hot and buggy to go out in late October, near Chicago.The trend of ever later first freezes appears to have started around 1980, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of data from 700 weather stations across the U.S. going back to 1895 compiled by Ken Kunkel, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information.To look for nationwide trends, Kunkel compared the first freeze from each of the 700 stations to the station's average for the 20th Century.Some parts of the country experience earlier or later freezes every year, but on average freezes are coming later.The average first freeze over the last 10 years, from 2007 to 2016, is a week later than the average from 1971 to 1980, which is before Kunkel said the trend became noticeable.This year, about 40 percent of the Lower 48 states have had a freeze as of Oct. 23, compared to 65 percent in a normal year, according to Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the private service Weather Underground.Duncan's flowers should be dead by now.According to data from the weather station near her in Ottawa, Illinois, the average first freeze for the 20th century was Oct. 15.The normal from 1981 to 2010 based on NOAA computer simulations was Oct. 19.Since 2010, the average first freeze is on Oct. 26.Last year, the first freeze in Ottawa came on Nov. 12.Last year was "way off the charts" nationwide, Kunkel said.The average first freeze was two weeks later than the 20th century average, and the last frost of spring was nine days earlier than normal.Overall the United States freeze season of 2016 was more than a month shorter than the freeze season of 1916.It was most extreme in the Pacific Northwest.Oregon's freeze season was 61 days two months shorter than normal.Global warming has helped push the first frosts later, Kunkel and other scientists said.Also at play, though, are natural short-term changes in air circulation patterns but they too may be influenced by man-made climate change, they said.This shrinking freeze season is what climate scientists have long predicted, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado.A shorter freeze season means a longer growing season and less money spent on heat.But it also hurts some plants that require a certain amount of chill, such as Georgia peaches, said Theresa Crimmins, a University of Arizona ecologist.Crimmins is assistant director of the National Phenology Network .Phenology is the study of the seasons and how plants and animals adapt to timing changes.Pests that attack trees and spread disease aren't being killed off as early as they normally would be, Crimmins said.In New England, many trees aren't changing colors as vibrantly as they normally do or used to because some take cues for when to turn from temperature, said Boston University biology professor Richard Primack.Clusters of late-emerging monarch butterflies are being found far further north than normal for this time of year, and are unlikely to survive their migration to Mexico.Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said natural variability, especially an El Nino, made last year exceptional for an early freeze, but "it represents the kind of conditions that will be more routine in a decade or two" because of man-made climate change."The long-term consequences are really negative," said Primack, because shorter winters and hotter temperatures are also expected to lead to rising seas that cause worse flooding during heavy storms.In suburban Boston, Primack and his wife are still eating lettuce, tomatoes and green beans from their garden.And they are getting fresh figs off their backyard tree almost daily."These fig trees should be asleep," Primack said.AP data journalist Nicky Forster contributed to this story from New York.Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .His work can be found here .This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.The AP is solely responsible for all content.
5 years after Superstorm Sandy, the lessons haven't sunk in:::::Five years after Superstorm Sandy was supposed to have taught the U.S. a lesson about the dangers of living along the coast, disaster planning experts say there is no place in America truly prepared for climate change and the tempests it could bring.That is true even in New York and New Jersey, where cities and towns got slammed by deadly floodwaters that rose out of the Atlantic on the evening of Oct. 29, 2012.While billions have been spent to repair the damage, protecting vulnerable infrastructure, people and property across the nation from the more extreme weather that climate change could bring is going to require investment on a staggering scale, easily costing hundreds of billions, perhaps trillions.Some coastal protection projects are moving forward, but the most ambitious ideas spurred by Sandy's onslaught are still in the design stage, with questions about whether they will ever be built.Some wonder whether the nation has the will to undertake such ventures, even after this past season brought more catastrophic storms, including Hurricane Harvey, which swamped Houston, and Hurricane Maria, which laid waste to Puerto Rico's electrical grid."It felt after Sandy as if we might have finally had our wake-up call.We'd start to take these things seriously," said Eric Klinenberg, director of the Institute for Public Knowledge, a think tank at New York University."We'd make the kind of investment in climate security that we made in homeland security after Sept. 11.But of course nothing of the sort has happened."Some experts worry also that the ascendance of a climate-change skeptic to the White House may put the brakes on coastal protection efforts.In August, President Donald Trump rescinded President Barack Obama's post-Sandy order requiring future sea level rise to be factored into federally funded infrastructure projects."Since the new administration is not using the CC word, the climate change word, it's very hard to instill this forward-looking kind of attitude where you have to take into account sea level rise and how the flood zones expand," says Klaus Jacob, a Columbia University scientist specializing in climate change adaptation.And yet, some planners still hope that Sandy created momentum for projects that could serve as national models.BIG IDEAS After Sandy, which was blamed for at least 182 deaths in the U.S. and Caribbean and more than $71 billion in damage in this country alone, a government-funded competition called Rebuild by Design produced audacious ideas for defending the coast.One concept, dubbed The Big U, would create 10 miles (16 kilometers) of floodwalls, berms and gates around lower Manhattan.Other ideas include erecting breakwaters around Staten Island that would double as oyster beds, and reconfiguring the Meadowlands, the polluted wetlands of urban New Jersey, with berms and marshes.The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development put up $1 billion to get those projects started, but construction hasn't begun on any of them.Amy Chester, Rebuild By Design's executive director, said it will take years to complete all the planning and gain government approvals and community support.And it's not clear how much these projects will ultimately cost.ONE CITY'S PLAN LaTrenda Ross gets teary-eyed recalling the days after Sandy flooded the streets of Hoboken, New Jersey, a city of 50,000 people across the Hudson River from Manhattan that has been her home for 40 years."To not be able to go to work, to sit there in the dark, no elevators, no way out, was devastating," she said.If something isn't done to prevent a repeat, "there won't even be a city of Hoboken.We might as well pack up and move now."New Jersey does, in fact, have a plan.Over the summer it hired an engineering firm to carry out one of the Rebuild by Design concepts: an anti-flood system for Hoboken.The $230 million project, funded by HUD, involves a series of floodwalls, pumping stations and water retention tanks.Construction is due to start in 2019 and take at least three years.Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer said the cost is worth it.Eighty percent of the city flooded during Sandy, she said, causing as much as $1 billion in damage.Buildings were ruined.Three of the city's four fire stations flooded.A vital commuter train station was knocked out for months.Laura Baird, an engineer who helped develop the plan, said had the system been in place when Sandy hit, 85 percent of the city would have been protected.PROGRESS AND DOUBT While the grandest ideas about post-Sandy protections are still far from reality, there has been progress .Communities on the New Jersey shore built sand dunes to hold back surf, or fortified existing ones.Power companies and New York's subway system have put flood protections around key infrastructure.Hospitals moved electrical equipment out of basements.The Army Corps of Engineers is scheduled to begin construction in 2019 on a 5-mile-long (8-kilometer-long), 20-foot-high (6-meter-high) seawall and promenade that would run along New York's Staten Island in front of the neighborhoods hit hardest by Sandy.The project, which is still being designed, has an estimated price tag of $600 million and is scheduled for completion by 2022.Michael Cappannari, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said the administration is committed to helping communities recognize the risk and defend against flooding.He cited several federally funded projects underway, including construction of boardwalks with seawalls hidden beneath them and flood-proofing of sewage treatment systems.It's not enough, said Jacob, the Columbia scientist."It's on a pace that's dictated by the funds that are available, politically made available," he said."And if that snail's pace continues, there's a good chance that we may have another severe storm in town or in the region that will outpace that slow pace of improving the systems."Politicians locally and in Congress appear reluctant to get behind enormously expensive and sometimes divisive projects to deal with a threat that often feels hypothetical.In Hoboken, for example, one proposal for a floodwall that would have protected more of the city was rejected because it would have blocked river views.Cities throughout the country have been reluctant to curtail building on the waterfront, because those spots are in such great demand from homebuyers.In New York City, FEMA redrew the flood maps after Sandy, nearly doubling to 71,500 the number of buildings deemed to be in high-risk zones.The city objected for fear that would raise flood insurance rates and stifle waterfront development, and last year FEMA agreed to roll the flood zones back.Bill Golden, president of the National Institute for Coastal and Harbor Infrastructure, said worrying about spending too much is shortsighted, and he blames the inaction on "a misunderstanding of the new reality that we face."A study released Monday by an international team of scientists predicted that between 2030 and 2045, New York City could experience storm surges of over 7.4 feet (2.25 meters) every five years, primarily because of sea level rise.That's up from every 25 years in recent decades.NO RETREAT After Sandy, New York and New Jersey bought and emptied 1,250 homes in areas it deemed too difficult to protect from floods.Patty Snyder, whose 53-year-old brother drowned when Sandy struck, was among the Staten Islanders who took a buyout."I knew I was never going back, because I felt the city, state and federal governments never were going to do what needed to be done to stop future flooding," she said.But most people in the wrecked communities did return, whether because they were skeptical of the risk, confident about the planned Staten Island seawall, or simply unwilling to say goodbye to their homes.Some homes were rebuilt on elevated foundations or pilings.Others were restored to the way they were before Sandy, leaving them just as vulnerable."I really don't think it will happen again," said Fred Steinfeld, a Staten Island resident whose basement filled with water during Sandy."I just think that storms like that don't happen that often."Dexter Dugan, whose Staten Island home got 9 feet of water, took steps to make it more storm-resistant, including putting heating and electrical systems on the second floor."You live near the water, it's going to flood," he said.For complete coverage of the five-year anniversary of Superstorm Sandy, go to https://www.apnews.com/tag/SuperstormSandy This story has been corrected to show that the damage is more than $71 billion, not $65 billion.
Facebook denies 'listening' to conversations:::::Image copyright Getty Images A Facebook executive has denied the social network uses a device's microphone to listen to what users are saying and then send them relevant ads.Rob Goldman, the tech giant's vice-president of ads, was responding to a tweet by PJ Vogt, the presenter of a tech podcast called Reply All.Anecdotally, many people report seeing adverts which appear to be related to recent, real-life conversations.Mr Vogt had asked for details of these specific occasions."I run ads product at Facebook.We don't - and have never - used your microphone for ads.Just not true," Mr Goldman wrote.When another Twitter user asked him if that included Instagram, which is also owned by Facebook, he replied, "Yes."PJ Vogt got hundreds of replies to his original tweet."A co-worker got an ad saying, "So you popped the question!"minutes after he proposed, before he told anyone it had happened," wrote Tori Hoover."At work, happened to me though earlier this year.Working as a barista, got a burn, talked to my partner in person about it, went to Target, bought the burn cream, and saw an ad on FB for the exact product I purchased.Never searched for product either," wrote Brigitte Bonasoro.In a statement on its website from 2016, Facebook denied the practice."We show ads based on people's interests and other profile information - not what you're talking out loud about," it said.One theory is that the ads and their connection to an individual are purely coincidental - that the ad may have appeared before but had not been noticed because it had no prior relevance."If you take something that has a tiny chance of occurring and give it enough opportunities to occur, it inevitably will happen," said mathematics professor David Hand from Imperial College London when the BBC investigated whether smartphones were "listening in" to conversations last year."We are evolutionarily trained to seek explanations."Do you have concerns about privacy and advertising on social media?Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk You can also contact us in the following ways:
Three criticised over £117 iPhone X monthly deal:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Dave Lee gets hands on with the new iPhone X Three has announced a 117 ($150) per month contract for the iPhone X.It's been described as "extreme" and "crazy" on social media.The two-year deal, which includes unlimited data and talk time, is for the largest version of the device.The same contract with an iPhone 8 costs 44 per month, plus a 99 upfront fee.The handset is sold by Apple for 1,149 but under Three's deal customers could end up paying more than 2,100, based on its current sim-only charges.Three's current all-inclusive sim-only deal is 29 per month.The firm said it had various tariffs to suit different customers."There are a small amount of people that prefer not to pay an upfront cost yet want access to all-you-can eat data, minutes and texts and this is aimed at them," Three told the BBC.There are cheaper alternatives, it added."If that was an electrical retailer's 'interest rate' there'd be outrage," tweeted Michael Firth."No phone is worth over 30 [per month] in my opinion," tweeted The Cyber Heartbeat.Smartphone price barriers Other operators are offering the device on a monthly contract ranging between 80 and 88 but are also often charging an additional upfront payment.O2 is charging 86 per month plus a one-off 119.99 for a similar deal with 50GB data on the larger phone.Vodafone does not offer unlimited data either but its most expensive tariff is 80 per month plus a 100 charge for 60GB per month of data.The phone is currently available to pre-order only.Apple's pricing for the iPhone X had already shifted smartphone price barriers, said analyst Kester Mann from CCS Insight."However, Three's bold move to break through the psychological 100 per month barrier is a huge ask even for its most dedicated and loyal fans," he added.Technology journalist Kate Bevan said it is generally cheaper to buy a handset upfront rather than as part of a contract deal."I'm sure the iPhone X will be a very good phone," she said."However, if I were going to buy one - which I'm not - I would hold off until the new year if possible, to give Apple a chance to iron out any wrinkles with it and to see if prices from mobile providers come down a bit."
Facebook to show who buys political ads:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption Tech giants are under pressure to improve transparency of political ads Facebook has announced measures to make political advertising on the social media platform more transparent.Political advertisers will have to verify their identity and location and their posts will carry a disclosure saying "paid for by".The steps come amid allegations that Russian-backed groups used social media ads to interfere in the US election.Executives from Facebook and other internet giants will testify before a Senate hearing on Tuesday."When it comes to advertising on Facebook, people should be able to tell who the advertiser is and see the ads they're running, especially for political ads," Rob Goldman, Facebook's vice president of ads, said in a blog post.By clicking on the "paid for by" disclosure, users would be able to see more details about the advertiser, he added.Facebook said it was expanding the transparency measures to all ads, and that they would all have to be linked to a page.Users would also be able to view the ads any page was running, it added.Tests for the new tools would start in Canada, with a goal of having them in place in the US ahead of the midterm elections, in November 2018.Tech giants are keen to show they can self-regulate after it was found that Russian-backed groups were exploiting their ad platforms.Image copyright EPA Image caption Mr Trump has denied that there was any collusion between his campaign and Russia On Tuesday, Twitter announced similar transparency measures, including labels for election-related ads and more details about who funded them.It also banned two of Russia's biggest media outlets - Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik - from buying advertising amid fears they attempted to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election.Russia has repeatedly denied claims that it interfered in the election, but the allegations have sparked an investigation into possible links between Russia and US President Donald Trump.He denies there was any collusion.
Google addresses Pixel 2 handset complaints:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Rory Cellan-Jones takes a tour of Google's Pixel 2 XL Google says it is doubling the warranty on its new flagship smartphones following complaints about the screens.Some reviewers have noticed screen "burn in" - a permanent mark of images that have appeared previously - after only a couple of weeks with the larger version of the new phone.The firm argued that the effect was "in line with that of other premium smartphones" using OLED screens.However it promised software updates to maximise the screen life."We use software to safeguard the user experience and maximize the life of the OLED display, and we'll make ongoing software updates to optimize further," wrote Mario Queiroz, vice-president of product management, in a Google message forum.The warranty for both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will now be two years instead of one, he added - although in Europe this is already standard.Mr Queiroz also said "a new mode" for saturated colours would be released in a separate software update in the next few weeks, following other complaints about dull visuals.The Pixel 2 XL, which appears to be the affected handset, is currently only available in the US.The handset reviewed by the BBC was one of those which suffered the mild burn-in first reported by the tech website Android Central.Speaking to the BBC at the time, analyst Carolina Milanesi, from Creative Strategies, said it was "not a great start" for the device.This was Google's big step into really going for the devices market, broadening the breath of the products," she said."It raises the question of whether they can actually take on this much."Google's previous device, the Pixel, had good reviews but accounted for just 0.5% of the global smartphone market in 2016.In a separate forum, Google advised those Pixel 2 users who said their device appeared to be "clicking", to switch off NFC (near field communication) - used to make contact payments - and said a software fix was being developed.The Pixel 2 costs from 629 in the UK (799 on pre-order for the XL).
Artificial intelligence smart enough to fool Captcha security check:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Computer scientists have developed AI algorithms smart enough to crack Captcha tests Computer scientists have developed artificial intelligence that can outsmart the Captcha website security check system.Captcha challenges people to prove they are human by recognising combinations of letters and numbers that machines would struggle to complete correctly.Researchers developed an algorithm that imitates how the human brain responds to these visual clues.The neural network could identify letters and numbers from their shapes.The research, conducted by Vicarious - a Californian artificial intelligence firm funded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg - is published in the journal Science.What is Captcha?The Captcha test, which means the "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart", was developed in the late 1990s to prevent people from using automated bots to set up fake accounts on websites.When logging into a website, users prove that they are human by solving visual puzzles, which requires identifying letters, digits, symbols or objects that have been distorted or animated in some way.Computers usually struggle to pass such tests, and Google says that its reCaptcha test is so complicated that even humans can only solve it 87% of the time.However, researchers from Vicarious claim that their computer algorithm can pick out distorted letters and digits from images.Neural networks To get computers to recognise images, computer scientists usually use neural networks, which are large networks of computers trained to solve complex problems.A neural network contains hundreds of layers, inspired by the human brain, and each layer examines a different part of the problem.Eventually, the answer from all the layers is combined together to produce one final result.However, neural networks have to be painstakingly trained using thousands of images that have been pre-labelled by humans, which makes it a very arduous task.The team from Vicarious developed Recursive Cortical Network (RCN), a software which mimics actual processes in the human brain while requiring less computing power than a neural network.The human brain has the ability to identify objects even if they are obscured by other objects, by recognising shapes and textures.Vicarious has been developing algorithms for RCN that aim to identify objects by analysing pixels in an image to see if they match the outline of an object.Captcha attacks In 2013, Vicarious announced that it had cracked text-based Captcha tests used by Google, Yahoo, PayPal and Captcha.com with a 90% accuracy.Since then, Captcha designers have made their tests more difficult to beat, but the researchers said in their new paper that the software was now able to pass Google's reCaptcha test 66.6% of the time.The RCN software was also able to solve reCaptacha tests from Captcha generator BotDetect at a 64.4% success rate, Yahoo Captchas at a 57.4% success rate and PayPal at a 57.1% success rate.Image copyright Vicarious / Science Image caption The computer algorithm could crack modern Captcha tests with success rates of more than 50% "We're not seeing attacks on Captcha at the moment, but within three or four months, whatever the researchers have developed will become mainstream, so Captcha's days are numbered," Simon Edwards, a cyber-security architect for data cyber-security firm Trend Micro Europe, told the BBC."The very nature of big data analysis and machine learning is that if you give it enough data to play with, it will eventually work out most things."Mr Edwards said that typically within two months of security flaws being discovered, have-a-go hackers will start attacking every publicly-visible web server they can find, and so it is likely that Captcha tests on websites will soon be under siege."The technology has been around for a long time - there needs to be a better version of Captcha," he said."In my mind, the best form of authentication is two-factor.It's the only real way of getting around these problems."
NHS 'could have prevented' WannaCry ransomware attack:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption WannaCry was the biggest cyber-attack that has affected the NHS to date NHS trusts were left vulnerable in a major ransomware attack in May because cyber-security recommendations were not followed, a government report has said.More than a third of trusts in England were disrupted by the WannaCry ransomware, according to the National Audit Office (NAO).At least 6,900 NHS appointments were cancelled as a result of the attack.NHS England said no patient data had been compromised or stolen and praised the staff response.The NAO chief said the Department of Health and the NHS must now "get their act together".WannaCry, which spread to more than 150 countries in a worldwide ransomware outbreak beginning on 12 May, was the biggest cyber-attack to have hit the NHS to date.The malware encrypted data on infected computers and demanded a ransom roughly equivalent to 230 ($300).The NAO report said there was no evidence that any NHS organisation paid the ransom - but the financial cost of the incident remained unknown.An assessment of 88 out of 236 trusts by NHS Digital before the attack found that none passed the required cyber-security standards.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption As a result of disruption caused by WannaCry, patients were turned away from appointments The report said NHS trusts had not acted on critical alerts from NHS Digital and a warning from the Department of Health and the Cabinet Office in 2014 to patch or migrate away from vulnerable older software.The Department of Health also lacked important information, the report said."Before 12 May 2017, the department had no formal mechanism for assessing whether NHS organisations had complied with its advice and guidance."Organisations could also have better managed their computers' firewalls - but in many cases they did not, it said.NHS organisations have not reported any cases of harm to patients or of their data being stolen as a result of WannaCry.NHS England has identified 6,912 appointments - including operations - that were cancelled as a direct result of the ransomware.But it estimated that about 19,000 appointments in total may have been affected.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware?Cases included at least 139 people potentially with cancer, who had urgent referrals cancelled.It is not known: how many GP appointments were cancelled how many ambulances and individuals were diverted from five accident and emergency departments unable to treat some patients how many trusts or GPs experienced delays in information, such as test results The NAO credits the widely reported work of cyber-security researcher Marcus Hutchins, who accidentally helped to stop the spread of WannaCry.His "kill switch" involved registering a domain name linked to the malware, which deactivated the program's ability to spread automatically.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption LISTEN: How 'Malware Tech' became an 'accidental hero' Home Office Minister Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government was "as sure as possible" that North Korea was behind the attack."This attack, we believe quite strongly that it came from a foreign state," he said."It is widely believed in the community and across a number of countries that North Korea [took on] this role".Speaking on the same programme, former chairman of NHS Digital, Kingsley Manning, said that a failure to upgrade old computer systems at a local level within the NHS had contributed to the rapid spread of the malware.He said: "The problem with cyber security for the NHS is [that] it has a particular vulnerability...It's very interconnected so if you get an attack in one place it tends to spread."Mr Manning blamed a lack of time and resources but also "frankly a lack of focus, a lack of taking it seriously" for individual NHS organisations' failure to keep up with cyber-security improvements."This was an extremely unsophisticated attack," he added.The NAO said the NHS "has accepted that there are lessons to learn" from WannaCry and will now develop a response plan.It will also ensure that critical cyber-security updates - such as applying software patches - are carried out by IT staff, the NAO said.WannaCry was "a relatively unsophisticated attack and could have been prevented by the NHS following basic IT security best practice," said Sir Amyas Morse, comptroller and auditor-general of the NAO."There are more sophisticated cyber-threats out there than WannaCry so the Department and the NHS need to get their act together to ensure the NHS is better protected against future attacks."Keith McNeil, NHS chief clinical information officer for health and care, said: "As the NAO report makes clear, no harm was caused to patients and there were no incidents of patient data being compromised or stolen."Tried and tested emergency plans were activated quickly and our hard-working NHS staff went the extra mile to provide patient care, keeping the impact on NHS services and patients to a minimum."Image copyright EPA Analysis - by Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent For many executives, a serious cyber-attack is now very high on their list of risks to their organisations and a priority for disaster planning.So what is most shocking in this report is the lack of planning at a local level in the NHS for such an event.To be fair, the Department of Health had developed a plan - it was just that it had not been properly communicated or tested in the NHS trusts.When disaster struck, nobody seemed to know who was in charge or what to do.Of course, all of this could have been avoided if security patches had been applied to protect the Windows 7 systems common throughout the NHS.Once again, there had been warnings sent out by NHS Digital, but many trusts failed to act upon them - though in that they were no different from many organisations around the world that were also hit.In one way, the NHS was lucky - if, instead of a Friday in May, the attack had taken place on a Monday in winter, with a week's appointments affected, the damage would have been far worse.Cyber-security experts will tell you that dealing with attacks like these is mostly a management rather than a technology problem.And in this case the NHS proved itself incapable of managing a speedy and effective response to its first major cyber-security crisis.
Hotel booking sites probed by consumer watchdog:::::Hotel booking sites are to be probed by the UK's competition watchdog to see if consumers are being misled by them.The Competition and Markets Authority is concerned that rather than helping consumers, the sites might actually be making it more difficult for them.The CMA said it was "concerned about the clarity, accuracy and presentation of information on sites".The investigation will examine areas such as hidden charges, search results, and discount claims.Leading booking sites include Expedia and Booking.com.In a statement, booking site Trivago, which is majority owned by Expedia, said: "Trivago will work with the CMA to explain the benefits it delivers to consumers looking for their ideal hotel."Booking.com said it would not be commenting at this time.According to the CMA, about 70% of people who shop around for accommodation use hotel booking sites.Nisha Arora, a senior director at the CMA, told the BBC's Today programme: "We are concerned about the clarity and accuracy of these sites.Rather than helping consumers they may actually be making it more difficult for them."She explained that the suggestions offered by such sites were not ranked solely on the preferences entered by the user."When you put in your criteria - which room you want, when you want to stay - they are listed in a certain order.This is not just influenced by consumer preference but by commission - commercial considerations - and consumers might not be aware of this."Image copyright AFP The British Hospitality Association (BHA) said it welcomed the probe as many of its members were concerned about the "vast power" of online booking agencies.It highlighted "high rates of commission, use of misleading information, pressure selling, and a lack of transparency"."In the process guests are paying more than they should for rooms."The BHA also said contract terms with some sites often included clauses that stopped a hotel offering a lower price on its own website than that offered to the online travel agent.Simon Calder, travel editor of the Independent, also highlighted commission rates: "The starting rate is 15%, which means that 15 out of every 100 stay is being taken by the intermediary."Hotels sometimes pay even more commission for increased visibility - i.e.giving the booking site even more in return for a higher profile on search returns."He says he tends to contact the hotel direct, to see if they will match the online rate and "perhaps provide a bonus such as a welcome drink or a free breakfast into the bargain".Image copyright Getty Images The CMA has written to companies across the whole sector.It is seeking evidence from both the websites and hotels, and would also like consumers to get in touch with it and share their experiences.It will look into how search results are ranked, and it also wants more information on whether extra charges, such as taxes and booking fees, are clearly displayed.Another area being looked at is the way sites display how many rooms are left, how many people are viewing a particular hotel and messages that claim to state the last time at which a similar room was booked.Ms Arora said the CMA wanted to hear how the sites gathered the information for these claims.The CMA is concerned this is used for "pressure selling", creating a "false impression of room availability or rush customers into making a booking decision".Social worker Valentin Danciu, from Ipswich, told the BBC that he had used a hotel booking website to reserve an apartment in Germany which was advertised at 31 per night.However, when the booking confirmation arrived it also included a 22 service charge and a 45 cleaning fee.Mr Danciu said he had been using hotel booking sites for years, but this time seemed to have missed the small print.He said until he received the email confirmation he had been given no indication that the total amount would be more than 90.The investigation into hotel websites follows a year-long CMA probe into price comparison sites.The CMA concluded that price comparison websites worked best for car insurance and worst for broadband.

Twitter bans RT and Sputnik ads amid election interference fears:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption Twitter is to donate all money earned from the outlets Twitter is banning two of Russia's biggest media outlets from buying advertising amid fears they attempted to interfere with the 2016 US election.The ban on advertising from Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik, and all linked accounts, was "effective immediately".US authorities say both act as "a platform for Kremlin messaging".The social media giant will donate an estimated $1.9m (1.4m) made from the outlets into research on Twitter's use in "civic engagement and elections".Twitter said the decision "was based on the retrospective work we've been doing around the 2016 US election and the US intelligence community's conclusion that both RT and Sputnik attempted to interfere with the election on behalf of the Russian government".The statement, published on the social media platform's blog, continued: "We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter."The decision has provoked an angry response in Russia, with the country's foreign ministry accusing Twitter of bowing to pressure from the US intelligence services, saying the move was "another aggressive step" aimed at blocking Russian media in the US.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation It added "retaliatory measures" would follow, according to RIA Novosti news agency [in Russian], Meanwhile, responding to the allegations, RT's deputy editor-in-chief Kirill Karnovich-Valua said the outlet "has never been involved in any illegal activity online, and that it never pursued an agenda of influencing the US election through any platforms".His comments followed those of RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan, who used Twitter's own platform to accuse the social network of pushing them to "spend big" during the election.Twitter did not comment when asked about the accusation, Reuters news agency said.Sputnik told news agency AFP it "has never used advertising on Twitter".Twitter is one of a number of companies keen to show they can self-regulate after it was found that Russian-backed groups were exploiting its ad platform.Its lawyers are due to appear before public hearings of the Senate and House intelligence committees to discuss possible interference on 1 November.Russia has repeatedly denied claims that it interfered in the 2016 elections.US intelligence services accuse the country of trying to sway the vote in Donald Trump's favour in various ways, including by spreading fake news and hacking the Democratic National Committee (DNC) networks in order to undermine rival Hillary Clinton.The allegations have sparked an investigation into possible links between Russia and Mr Trump, led by special counsel Rob Mueller, a former FBI director.Mr Trump denies there was any collusion.

Amazon and Alphabet report sales surge:::::Image copyright Getty Images Tech giants Amazon and Google's parent Alphabet have posted a surge in sales over the last three months.Shares in Alphabet jumped above $1,000 in after-hours trading after the company reported sales up 24% to $27.8bn.Amazon, the world's biggest e-commerce site, saw sales rise 34% to $43.7bn - nearly the size of Slovenia's economy last year.Meanwhile, Microsoft's profit beat estimates on gains from cloud services.Alphabet's profits for the three months to 30 September rose to $7.8bn, from $5.6bn for the same quarter last year.Analysis: Tech results bring sweet Valley highs The company's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, said the firm was delighted with the way it was performing."We had a terrific quarter, with revenues up 24% year on year, reflecting strength across Google and Other Bets," she said."Our momentum is a result of investments over many years in fantastic people, products and partnerships."Google continues to make up the vast majority of Alphabet's revenue and income.However the so-called Other Bets unit, which includes the Waymo driverless car business and the Project Loon WiFi-enabled weather balloon venture, saw revenue increase and losses fall.Total Other Bets revenue was up to $302m, from $197m last year.YouTube continued to see "phenomenal growth", said Google chief executive Sundar Pichai in a conference call, with more than 1.5 billion people spending an average of an hour a day watching videos there on mobile devices, and surging use on television screens in homes.Amazon Despite Amazon's sales growth, the firm's profits were nearly flat as it ploughed money into tech gadgets, streaming video, data centres and warehouses to support its growing empire.The firm said profits in the three months to the end of September were $256m, up from $252m in 2016.Shares surged in after-hours trade anyway, as investors, who had been expecting a smaller number after being warned to expect the reinvestment, cheered the firm's growth prospects.Chief executive Jeff Bezos said the Amazon sales increase was in part down to the growing demand for the firm's smart home products, which are powered by artificially intelligent assistant, Alexa."In the last month alone, we've launched five new Alexa-enabled devices, introduced Alexa in India, announced integration with BMW, surpassed 25,000 skills, integrated Alexa with Sonos speakers, taught Alexa to distinguish between two voices, and more," Mr Bezos said.Upmarket grocer Whole Foods, which Amazon acquired in August, brought in $1.3bn in sales in the quarter.Excluding Whole Foods, sales increased 29%, Amazon said.Sales were up 35% overall in North America, which accounts for the bulk of Amazon's business.They increased 29% in its international division thanks in part to a Prime Day surge, but the unit is still running at an operating loss.The firm also said it now has nearly 542,000 full and part-time staff, including workers from Whole Foods.It continues to look at ways to expand its physical stores as well.Microsoft Microsoft said it earned revenue of $24.5bn in the three months to end-September, up 12% year-on-year.The firm's profits were $6.6bn, rising 16%.Microsoft shares rose 3.1% after-hours to a record $81.2.Microsoft said growth was driven in part by its cloud computing products, which it has focused on in a bid to be less reliant on computer sales and older software.Amy Hood, executive vice-president and chief financial officer at Microsoft, called it a "strong start" to the year.The firm reported $6.9bn in revenue from its intelligent cloud unit, up 14% year-on-year.Its productivity and business processes division, which includes sales from Office 365, reported $8.2bn in revenue, up 28%.A fourth tech company, Intel, also posted a jump in revenues and profit.The world's largest computer chip maker said revenue rose 2% during the quarter to $16.1bn, with net income up 34% to $4.52bn.
Dell web address grabbed by third party:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The domain name was checked regularly by software installed as standard on many Dell PCs A web address used by recovery software on Dell PCs was taken over by a third-party after a contractor apparently failed to renew it.Dell's software checks in with the domain periodically, so whoever snapped it up could use it to distribute malware.Security expert and author Brian Krebs - who first reported the issue - believed there was a possibility that this had happened.Dell says no malware was transferred.Dell's Backup and Recovery Application software is installed by default on many of the firm's PCs and allows users to restore their computers to factory settings, in the event of problems.The software downloaded updates from dellbackupandrecoverycloudstorage.com.That web address used to be controlled by US-based tech firm SoftThinks, but was taken over by another party at some point between June and July this year."Approximately two weeks after Dell's contractor lost control over the domain, the server it was hosted on started showing up in malware alerts," Mr Krebs said in his blog.In a statement, Dell admitted it had lost control of the domain name but said the problem had been "addressed".Dell said: "We do not believe that the Dell Backup and Recovery calls to the URL during the period in question resulted in the transfer of information to or from the site, including the transfer of malware to any user device."A spokeswoman for Dell said that, on 9 July, the developer of the program bought the domain back from the third party that snapped it up - but she would not confirm how much this cost.The BBC has contacted SoftThinks for comment.
Nazi forums closed as Reddit purges 'violent content':::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Nazi rallies in the US have prompted counter-protests recently Reddit has closed down several extremist forums after updating its policy regarding violent content.The newly banned and removed pages include r/NationalSocialism, r/Nazi, r/whitesarecriminals and r/far_right.Reddit's new policy says: "Do not post content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people."One legal expert has said the policy may be difficult to enforce.The updated policy notes that violent content may sometimes be posted as part of educational, newsworthy or artistic material but adds that the context and reason for posting such content should be made clear.Material that glorifies or encourages the abuse of animals, such as bestiality, is also now being removed.In 2015, Reddit updated its policy to deter harassment - a move that resulted in the shutting down of forums including r/fatpeoplehate.However, Reddit has sometimes allowed material that would commonly be banned on mainstream social media sites.The new crackdown suggests the site is trying to position itself as a more mainstream business, said legal expert Prof Eric Heinze of Queen Mary, University of London.As companies grow, "they start caring about social norms, they care about PR, regardless of whether they had a more maverick origin," he told the BBC.Prof Heinze also said people with controversial views may find ways of dodging the crackdown."Instead of a gross attack against black people, for example, it'll just be things about 'preserving our identity'.They find a coded speech that everyone understands," he said.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In August, neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer was rejected by several web companies including Google But there is evidence that bans can dissuade explicit hate speech, according to Bharath Ganesh at the Oxford Internet Institute."I have been reviewing some [unpublished] research on whether or not these [Reddit] bans make a difference," he said."The researchers found that there was a reduction in terms of hate speech overall [on the site]," he told the BBC."So in that sense it was an effective move."In August, a neo-Nazi and white supremacist website called The Daily Stormer was rejected by several web companies and was forced to move to the dark web.This treatment was later criticised by civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which said it believed "no-one" should decide who is able to speak or not, including the government and private companies.
WhatsApp and Facebook to face EU data taskforce:::::Image copyright Getty Images WhatsApp and Facebook will be scrutinised by a data protection taskforce, after they were accused of "non-compliance" with EU laws.The regulators took issue with the messaging app's plan to share user data with parent company Facebook.A group of watchdogs and regulators from EU nations, known as the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, said WhatsApp had not fixed issues raised.WhatsApp and Facebook have yet to reply to the BBC's request for comment.Facebook bought the messaging app in 2014 and pledged to keep it independent from its social network.However, in August 2016, it announced plans to share user data with its parent company to offer up "friend suggestions" and "more relevant ads".At the time, the move was criticised by the UK's Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham, who said she did not believe the firm had obtained valid consent from its users.In its newest letter to WhatsApp chief executive Jan Koum, the Working Party said "the information presented to users was seriously deficient as a means to inform their consent".It said: the pop-up notice on WhatsApp did not make it clear that users' personal data would be shared with Facebook WhatApp gave a "misleading impression" to users by saying the privacy policy had been updated to "reflect new features" that using a pre-ticked check box to accept the new terms did not indicate "unambiguous consent" the company failed to offer "sufficiently granular user controls" to let people opt out of data sharing Both Facebook and WhatsApp have been invited to meet with the taskforce, which will be led by the UK's information commissioner.
Piccadilly Circus lights switched back on after renovations:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The new display has one of the highest resolution LED displays of its size in the world The billboard lights at Piccadilly Circus have been switched back on following major renovations.The sign, which has displayed electrical advertisements for more than a century, was switched off in January and replaced with a temporary banner.The new state-of-the-art screen is interactive and fully responsive allowing advertisers to include aspects such as live video streaming.About 100 million people pass the central London site each year.Before January it was the first time since World War Two the lights had been switched off, apart from during power cuts and special events.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A history of how the lights have changed at Piccadilly Circus The billboard's previous six individual LED screens have been replaced with the largest single display in Europe, measuring about 780 sq m (8,400 sq ft) in size.The screen has about 11.6 million bulbs, improving the quality of images on display.A cradle has also been installed on the roof to clean and maintain the LED panels which are expected to last the next 10 years.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Illuminated adverts like these in 1953 have been on display at the site for over a century Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The new screen has about 11.6 million bulbs, improving the quality of images on display Six advertisers are sharing the space and new technology allows them to change content based on the surrounding environment, according to site owners Land Securities.For example, if the temperature falls below a certain level, adverts for winter clothes can go on display instead of summer ones.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tests were carried out on the display before it was officially switched on A Land Securities spokeswoman said a "complex content management system" had been developed to "basically manage six live TVs that have the ability to move around the screen and change places".The first brands being displayed on the new billboard include Coca-Cola, which has been advertising in the space since 1954, and Samsung.Perrier was the first brand to ever be illuminated in Piccadilly while BP, Panasonic, Cinzano and TDK have also displayed adverts in the past.Image copyright PA Image caption The first brands being displayed on the new billboard include Coca-Cola and Samsung Light history
Twitter nears profit as it adds users:::::Image copyright Reuters Twitter said it may turn a profit in the fourth quarter as the tech company narrowed its losses and added users.The firm, which has not posted a profit since going public four years ago, said its losses narrowed from $103m (78m) to $21m in the third quarter.The number of monthly active users grew by four million to a total of 330 million at the end of September.Twitter said its revenue reached $590m, a 4% decrease compared with the same period in 2016.The social media company, which faces intense competition from the likes of Facebook and Instagram, said it had previously mis-stated the number of users, as it "had included users of certain third-party applications".It revised those figures down by two million users in the second quarter."This quarter, we made progress in three key areas of our business," Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey said."We grew our audience and engagement, made progress on a return to revenue growth, and achieved record profitability."The numbers come as Twitter ramps up efforts to boost engagement, following mounting criticism that it is not doing enough to tackle abuse on the social network and that its ads platform was misused.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chief executive Jack Dorsey has been taking action against abuse on Twitter Earlier this month, Mr Dorsey said Twitter would take a more "aggressive stance" against online abuse.The firm also promised to penalise users who post messages that glorify or condone violence and to review user complaints more quickly.Twitter has also been focusing on boosting engagement through video and live events.Many social platforms are adding millions a day by comparison and "Twitter is done growing," said Ross Gerber, chief executive of investment management firm Gerber Kawasaki.Video has not made much of a difference and its ad platform has made little progress, he added.
Porn-makers challenge Patreon's crowdfunding ban:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The letter claims Patreon had helped prevent some porn creators from becoming homeless Dozens of adult content creators have signed an open letter to Patreon challenging restrictions it has placed on the creation of pornography.The crowdfunding service updated its rules last week to explicitly ban the sale of pornographic content and provision of sexual services.It said at the time that it was clarifying an existing policy.But the firm has been accused of betraying some of its members who say their activity is not illegal."We know people who would be homeless if it wasn't for making porn on Patreon - and it's not a small number," the letter states."Your fuzzy position on 'adult content' versus 'porn' gives you the freedom to discriminate at will."And it makes content creators live in fear of that discrimination, itself leading to self-censorship of important viewpoints."Patreon's chief executive has said he intends to issue a "thorough response" later this Wednesday.Skip Twitter post by @jackconte Regarding changes to our content policy: I hear you, I read the open letter.I'm working with the team to have a thorough response by 2mrrow Jack Conte (@jackconte) October 25, 2017 Report 'Fringe content' Unlike most crowdfunding platforms - which focus on delivery of a single product or experience - Patreon provides its members with a way to charge a monthly subscription fee for an ongoing service, from which it takes a cut.In many cases, this involves the delivery of podcasts, music, training videos and artistic performances.But on 17 October, the site's legal chief said he had become concerned that "a small number of creators" were involved in the creation of what he termed fringe adult content.Image copyright Patreon Image caption Patreon says more than 50,000 creators use its platform to earn money As a result, the San Francisco-based firm's community guidelines were amended to state: "You can't use Patreon to raise funds in order to produce pornographic material such as maintaining a website, funding the production of movies, or providing a private webcam session."Prior to this the wording was less detailed, stating instead that "Patreon is not for pornography, but some of the world's most beautiful and historically significant art depicts nudity and sexual expression".It had added that "suggestive imagery" was permitted if marked NSFW (not safe for work).Billion dollar business Although Patreon has indicated there has not been a major policy shift, the letter references a blogger who claims there has indeed been a "substantial change after a long period of stasis"."Porn is a multi-billion dollar industry mostly in the hands of well-heeled men," the letter adds."You were helping us hold it in our own hands.We ask you to take a stand on behalf of the sex workers who use your platform, their fans, and everyone who supports freedom of expression."One academic said that Patreon might want to avoid the risk of being associated with "exploitation" but that censorship carried its own risks."There's a lot of amateur work on Patreon that blurs the line, including people who draw erotic images that are likely to be affected by this," commented Dr Bernie Hogan from the University of Oxford's Internet Institute."And for some people, the notion that there is a strong distinction between porn that is bad and other expression that is good is not as tenable as it used to be."But it makes sense that [Patreon] would try to get more conservative as it tries to scale up.And I imagine there has been a particular use case... that has been trouble for it."
Amazon service will let couriers open front doors:::::Image copyright Amazon Image caption The Amazon Key service uses the Cloud Cam camera Amazon is launching a service that will let couriers open people's front doors and put deliveries inside.Users of Amazon Key will need a smart lock and Cloud Cam camera.Couriers will scan a package barcode and once the delivery has been verified online, the camera will start recording and the delivery person will be able to unlock the door using an app.One analyst said consumers would have to be convinced the system was secure if they were to use it.Users will be able to choose to watch the delivery live or receive a short video after the drop-off.Compatible smart locks include models made by Yale and Kwikset.The system can also be used to give access to dog walkers, cleaners or visiting guests.The online shopping giant has long sought ways of improving delivery convenience for customers - including a trial with Audi in 2015 in which packages were deposited in car boots.'Unstoppable' "Amazon seems to be on an unstoppable mission to own every aspect of the home," said CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood.Mr Wood said he used a video doorbell and smart lock to give couriers access to his garage.He said asking customers to make their front doors accessible might be more difficult."My understanding is there's an awful lot of work being done to make connected locks secure," he said, in order to address security concerns."But it would only take a few incidents to stop this dead in the water - people wouldn't want to have something on their front door if they felt it wasn't secure."Image copyright Amazon Image caption Amazon Key works with a range of smart locks Last month, Amazon rival Nest launched new smart home products, including an internet-connected intruder alarm and a video-streaming doorbell that could be paired with a Yale smart lock.This too allows doors to be unlocked remotely, giving access to friends or couriers.Amazon Key will initially be available in 37 US cities where the firm's own courier, Amazon Logistics, will handle deliveries."These individuals are thoroughly vetted, with comprehensive background checks and motor vehicle records reviews," Amazon says.Users with home security systems will need to disarm them on delivery day in order to allow couriers access.Amazon also recommends not using in-home delivery if a pet can reach the front door.The Amazon-made Cloud Cam camera costs $120 (90) and a bundle with a smart lock and free installation will be available for $249.99.
Geordie Shore's Marnie Simpson broke ad rules on Snapchat:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Two images uploaded in June should have been identified as ads Two Snapchat posts by the reality TV star Marnie Simpson have fallen foul of the UK's advertising rules.The Geordie Shore and Celebrity Big Brother cast member uploaded images of products from two firms that she has business relationships with, without identifying them as adverts.This was judged to be a breach of the rules against "hidden" advertising on social media.It is the first case of its kind to have involved Snapchat.The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) normally deals with such matters by ordering offending posts to be deleted or amended.But since Snapchat Story posts automatically self-delete 24 hours after being added, Ms Simpson has not been ordered to take any action.The two companies involved, however, have agreed to ensure the hashtag #ad appears alongside adverts they produce in the future.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ASA chief Guy Parker: 'Rules apply equally to Snapchat' Ms Simpson could not be reached for comment.The 25-year-old has been a "brand ambassador" for tooth polish-maker Diamond Whites for nearly two years, while her management agency, Unleashed PR, began selling a range of coloured cosmetic contact lenses marketed as being "iSpyEyes by Marnie Simpson" earlier this year.On 20 June, Ms Simpson uploaded two images.The first showed her posing with a Diamond Whites case with the text "50% of [sic] everything" superimposed, and a link to the company's site.The second featured the celebrity wearing a grey lens on one of her eyes, with the words "mrs grey coming soon" placed alongside her.In both cases an unidentified individual contacted the ASA to complain the images had not been identified as ads.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Marnie Simpson was a Miss Newcastle finalist before joining MTV's Geordie Shore Diamond Whites tried to defend the promotion featuring its product on the grounds that Ms Simpson's followers would already be aware of her commercial relationship with the firm.But the watchdog did not accept that this would be known by everyone who saw the image.Unleashed PR suggested that in its case the wording featured was so vague that consumers would not know what product was being advertised or where to buy it.But the ASA said its code still required marketing promotions to be flagged as such."These might be our first Snapchat rulings, but the principle behind them is as old as the hills - ads, wherever they appear, must be obviously identifiable as ads," the authority's chief executive Guy Parker told the BBC."It's just not fair to expect people to play the detective, to work out the status of a tweet, post or story."Other recent cases where the advertising watchdog has intervened: a post by the make-up blogger Sheikhbeauty on Instagram promoting Flat Tummy Tea that did not make clear she was being paid by the drinks company a tweet by the TV presenter AJ Odudu that featured a photo of an Alpro dessert with text describing it as one of her favourite snacks, but without any acknowledgement that she was being paid to promote it on social media a video uploaded by Made In Chelsea TV star Millie Mackintosh advertising a Britvic drink that used #sp - referring to "sponsored post" - to identify its nature.The ASA said it did not think consumers would realise what the hashtag referred to The ASA does not have the power to impose fines itself, but can refer repeat offenders - whether they are brands or the celebrities endorsing them - to Trading Standards to take further action.However, it hopes that the negative publicity that arises from its interventions acts as deterrent enough.Even so, the ASA acknowledged earlier this month that an increasing amount of its time was being taken up policing "influencer marketing".And it urged marketers to put monitoring systems in place so that they themselves could spot and fix instances where celebrities had failed to use the #ad label.How lucrative is it to be a social media influencer?Image copyright Getty Images Marketers tend to be secretive about how much they pay specific influencers to promote their clients.But PMYB - a Nottingham-based agency that works with more than 10,000 influencers - told the BBC that campaigns could range from 5,000 to hundreds of thousands of pounds.It said that personalities that could deliver a YouTube audience had traditionally been able to charge the most - in part because people are likely to spend longer watching a video than reading a tweet - but Instagram fashionistas were also among the top earners.Managing director Rohan Midha added that the agency had been involved in a "surprisingly low number" of campaigns on Snapchat to date, and that when it was used it was typically in addition to other social networks.Although TV stars might seem an obvious pick, they can often be very expensive to employ because their agents inflate their prices.San Francisco-based Captiv8 - which has developed software to match brands with relevant ambassadors - suggests "micro-influencers" often have more impact.In other words, a financial tech specialist with tens of thousands of followers might be more valuable to a bank than a generalist with hundreds of thousands.Even so, reach still plays a role in calculating an influencer's worth.Last year, Captiv8 estimated that personalities with more than seven million followers could charge on average:
Apple hires ex-BBC and Channel 4 executive Jay Hunt:::::Image copyright Apple Image caption Jay Hunt will begin work at Apple at the start of 2018 Apple has hired Jay Hunt - the former controller of BBC One and chief creative officer of Channel Four - to join its video team.Ms Hunt was responsible for TV shows including Sherlock and Luther at the BBC before helping Channel 4 sign up the Great British Bake Off.Her title at Apple will be creative director, Europe, worldwide video.Apple has not specified what it involves, but she is expected to commission programmes on its behalf.Until now, Apple's own programming has served as an adjunct to its Music subscription service and included Planet of the Apps - a business reality TV competition - and Carpool Karaoke - a spin-off from James Corden's Late Late Show.However, the US firm has committed $1bn (754m) to acquire and produce further content over the coming months, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.Image copyright Love Productions/Channel 4 Image caption Ms Hunt helped Channel 4 take Bake Off from the BBC Earlier in the year, Apple revealed it had hired two Sony Pictures TV executives.Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg had overseen Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul and Rescue Me among other US shows.These developments have fuelled speculation that the company is preparing to launch a video subscription service to rival Netflix and Amazon Video, with original content, after failing to convince the US networks to let it sell bundles of their programming."It seems like Apple is going for a worldwide push already, even though it hasn't yet made much headway in the US," said Tom Harrington, an analyst at research firm Enders Analysis."Jay Hunt is exceptional in the commissioning space.She's exceptional at finding programmes that fit the outlet she's working at."She could have worked anywhere she wanted."Apple is not the only US tech giant investing in the TV industry.Facebook launched its Watch service in the US in August, offering cookery, fitness and travel-themed programmes among other content.Twitter is developing news programming in conjunction with Bloomberg and Buzzfeed, and has also acquired streaming rights to several sports events.Google continues to invest in its YouTube Red service, which produces ad-free films and shows for subscribers.Analysis Image caption Sherlock was one of Ms Hunt's most successful commissions at the BBC By Amol Rajan, media editor When Jay Hunt missed out on the job of chief executive at Channel 4, where as chief creative officer she had overseen a series of big hits and bought Great British Bake Off from the BBC, everyone in the industry asked the same question.What jobs in British TV might she actually now want?Answer: not many.As television is reinvented - from linear, scheduled programmes watched by families around a single television set, to on-demand shows watched largely on mobile phones and tablets, or sometimes through multiple screens - it is the big American technology companies that are driving innovation.Last week, Netflix showed impressive quarterly growth in subscribers.Many senior figures in the industry say Amazon is changing the rules of the game, by offering massive budgets for drama and documentaries.And there is talk aplenty about social media giants buying up live sports rights.In hiring Ms Hunt, Apple has reinforced the message that it is taking television and original content very seriously.At her leaving party in Channel 4's London headquarters recently, the universal feeling was that it would be to one of these big technology companies that she moved.That has now come to pass.Jay Hunt poached Bake Off from the BBC in a move that was met with widespread scepticism, and plenty of derision.Yet with six million viewers per episode, its switch has been a success.What show might she poach from another broadcaster next - perhaps even her former employers?Given Apple's market capitalisation of more than $800bn (603bn), I suspect money won't be an issue.Ms Hunt is going to enjoy her new budget.
Tesla solar power arrives in Puerto Rico:::::Image copyright Tesla Image caption The solar panel and battery storage will provide power to a children's hospital Entrepreneur Elon Musk has followed through on his plan to boost power resources in Puerto Rico after it was devastated by Hurricane Maria.Mr Musk's firm, Tesla, has set up solar panels and energy storage batteries at Hospital del Nino, a children's hospital in San Juan.The batteries will provide energy from the panels when sunlight is scarce.Tesla said on Twitter this was the "first of many" such projects going live.Mr Musk has also donated $250,000 (190,000) of his own money to support humanitarian efforts in Puerto Rico, where many people are still without electricity.Earlier this month, Tesla's co-founder offered - via Twitter - to help rebuild energy infrastructure.The US territory's governor, Ricardo Rossello, responded: "Let's talk."Mr Rossello has since thanked Tesla for its work at the hospital - also on Twitter (in Spanish).Contract controversy A $300m contract to repair the power grid was recently awarded to a small, two-year-old US firm with just two employees.Following criticism from US lawmakers, Mr Rossello defended the deal this week.He said the company, Whitefish Energy Holdings, was the only one that met Puerto Rico's requirements at a low enough cost.Tesla is known for its electric cars, such as the Model S, but the company is expanding into the renewable energy sector.It is installing a 100 megawatt set of its Powerpack batteries in Australia - the largest lithium ion battery storage project in the world.And last week, it won a $160m contract with wind turbine maker Vestas to place batteries at a new wind farm, also in Australia.The wind farm will feature solar panels as well as wind turbines and has been designed to provide power for more than 35,000 homes.
'Bad Rabbit' ransomware strikes Ukraine and Russia:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Two other ransomware outbreaks have made headlines this year - WannaCry and Petya A new strain of ransomware nicknamed "Bad Rabbit" has been found spreading in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere.The malware has affected systems at three Russian websites, an airport in Ukraine and an underground railway in the capital city, Kiev.The cyber-police chief in Ukraine confirmed to the Reuters news agency that Bad Rabbit was the ransomware in question.It bears similarities to the WannaCry and Petya outbreaks earlier this year.However, it is not yet known how far this new malware will be able to spread."In some of the companies, the work has been completely paralysed - servers and workstations are encrypted," head of Russian cyber-security firm Group-IB, Ilya Sachkov, told the TASS news agency.Two of the affected sites are Interfax and Fontanka.ru.Meanwhile, US officials said they had "received multiple reports of Bad Rabbit ransomware infections in many countries around the world".The US computer emergency readiness team said it "discourages individuals and organisations from paying the ransom, as this does not guarantee that access will be restored".Who was affected?By Ksenia Idrisova and Yaroslava Kiryukhina, BBC Monitoring Initial news reports mentioned Russian media websites, such as St Petersburg-based Fontanka.ru, as well as an airport in Ukraine's Odessa and a subway system in Kiev.Privately-owned Russian news agency Interfax was hit particularly hard, to the extent that 24 hours later its website still displayed a message reading "our service is temporary unavailable".On the morning of 25 October, it transpired that Russian banks had also been targeted but, luckily, were not compromised.The Russian Central Bank said in a statement that it had recorded a BadRabbit attack on Russian financial institutions, but that none of them had been compromised, as reported by RNS news agency on 25 October.Otkrytiye, formerly Russia's biggest privately-owned bank, was one of the Russian financial institutions that repelled the attack, according to RNS.Prominent Russian IT security firm Group-IB reported that BadRabbit had targeted several of the top 20 Russian banks but failed to penetrate their networks.Russia hit most "According to our data, most of the victims targeted by these attacks are located in Russia," said Vyacheslav Zakorzhevsky at Kaspersky Lab."We have also seen similar but fewer attacks in Ukraine, Turkey and Germany."Bad Rabbit encrypts the contents of a computer and asks for a payment - in this case 0.05 bitcoins, or about $280 (213).Cyber-security firms, including Russia-based Kaspersky, have said they are monitoring the attack.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware?The malware is still undetected by the majority of anti-virus programs, according to analysis by virus checking site Virus Total.One security firm, Eset, has said that the malware was distributed via a bogus Adobe Flash update.Researcher Kevin Beaumont has posted a screenshot that shows Bad Rabbit creating tasks in Windows named after the dragons Drogon and Rhaegal in TV series Game of Thrones.The outbreak bears similarities to the WannaCry and Petya ransomware outbreaks that spread around the world causing widespread disruption earlier this year.
TV news 'hack' sees bitcoins snatched:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A QR code leading to $1,000 sounded like an easy way to make money - but a French TV channel had blurred it out Two French hackers used their computer skills to reconstruct a blurred-out code on TV and claim bitcoins worth $1,000 (760).Michel Sassano and Clement Storck had seen an interview with entrepreneur Roger Ver on French television.Mr Ver had offered $1,000 to viewers - but a QR code needed to claim the money had been blurred out.The duo analysed a small part of the code that was visible, however, and managed to access the funds.When the France 2 channel broadcast its interview with Mr Ver earlier this month, he promised the money - just over three Bitcoin Cash coins, worth $1,000 - to whichever viewer was quickest to scan an on-screen QR code.However, the code had been blurred out by France 2 - Mr Sassano believes this is because of French broadcasting regulations that prevent news programmes from giving away prizes."The process to decode the private key from the moment we watched the show to when we entered it in the wallet took, I think, between 12 and 16 hours," Mr Sassano told the BBC.He and Mr Storck have explained the process in detail in a blog.Their fortune depended on a moment towards the end of the TV segment when a small portion of the QR code was actually shown unblurred.Image copyright Roger Ver Image caption Entrepreneur Roger Ver didn't think the money would ever be claimed after the code was blurred out - but he was wrong The keen-eyed pair also noticed that the top of the QR code and part of the key written in letters and numbers were also not blurred sufficiently, making them readable with software.They were able to plot what they knew for sure about the code's structure - amounting to roughly a third of it - in a spreadsheet.From there, the duo worked out as much as they could about the missing portions, based on their knowledge of how QR codes are designed.Finally, they calculated that there were about 2.1 million possible final combinations."We got down to two valid keys that would match bitcoin private keys," says Mr Sassano.One of these proved to be the answer they were looking for.They transferred the money on 17 October - an online bitcoin wallet shows the transaction."The money is the cherry on the cake but the most exciting was when we found the private key and the algorithm told us this was the one," says Mr Sassano, adding that he has not yet withdrawn the money.Image copyright Michel Sassano and Clement Storck Image caption The reconstruction process involved some detailed detective work Roger Ver described the work as "amazing"."With almost no information at all they were able to reconstruct the private key and claim the funds," he says."If you have time to read the blog it's absolutely incredible."He also reveals that he has been "inundated" with messages from viewers who watched the programme and wanted to know if he kept a copy of the QR code - but he had not."I deleted it," he explains."Now I have something to tell the French people [who contacted me] - somebody did manage to claim it."The BBC has contacted France 2 for comment.
How to 'deep clean' your online activity:::::Image copyright House of Commons Image caption Jared O'Mara made degrading jokes about pop stars Jared O'Mara is not the first person to have old comments he posted online come back to haunt him.The Labour MP resigned from the Women and Equalities Committee after misogynistic remarks and degrading jokes he posted more than 10 years ago resurfaced.The scandal raises the question: what steps can you take to avoid old online posts - that may no longer reflect your point of view - coming back to haunt you?But first a warning!Trying to hide your online history could draw more attention to it, than just leaving it alone - and an attempted cover-up could be a bigger scandal than the original posts.Search for yourself A good place to start is typing your name into a search engine and seeing what comes back.You may need to do a deep dive, several pages into the results to find old material you had forgotten was online.The easiest way to remove embarrassing posts from the past is to log in to the website you posted them on, and delete them at the source if possible.Revisit old haunts Check old message boards you used to frequent to make sure you did not leave any regrettable posts online.Your username may not have been your real name, but people may still associate it with you.Message boards often let you search for all the posts made by your account, allowing you to remove or edit anything you no longer want online.You could also run a web search on your old message board usernames to check you have not missed anything.Delete old social accounts Remember Myspace?Former Faceparty fan?Gone from Gaydar?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption What lurks on your Myspace account?The three networks - and several others - suffered a great exodus when newer social websites arrived.But did you deactivate your old account, or leave it to fester unattended?Old social network profiles can be a treasure trove of embarrassing photos and regrettable stories.It might be time to log in and erase any profiles you no longer use.Change your name Many comments sections on news websites are powered by bigger social networks such as Facebook and Disqus.If you had used your real name on these sites, you could change your name and photo on the associated accounts so that old embarrassing posts are instead attributed to a pseudonym.However, this does breach the terms and conditions of some social networks.Exercise your "right to be forgotten" EU citizens can ask search engines to remove results connected to their name, if they are judged to be irrelevant or outdated.This means news stories, old social media posts and blogs can be hidden from search results, making them less likely to resurface.Controversially, the right to be forgotten has been used by criminals and people involved in public scandals to hide news reports featuring their name, on the grounds that they are "outdated".Critics say people are able to censor search results in this way.But the EU ruling stands, and so Google, Bing and other search engines let citizens request the removal of certain results.As the ruling only applies to the EU, the "hidden" results may still appear for people using the search engine outside the EU.Wait for new laws in May The EU's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will give people more control over the data they have shared online.Under the new rules, people will have the right to order websites and social networks to delete embarrassing old posts.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption New laws will give greater control to citizens However, in some cases the websites will be allowed to reject the requests - for example, if a post was of scientific or historical importance.Despite Brexit, the UK is adopting the GDPR in its own Data Protection Bill.It will come into force in May 2018.Demand deletion Some social networks make it difficult for you to permanently delete your account, encouraging you to temporarily deactivate it instead.Facebook does provide a page where you can request a permanent account deletion, while Twitter's standard deactivation procedure deletes an account after 30 days.Deleting an account on Facebook and Twitter makes public posts disappear -

Hackers breach top plastic surgery clinic:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The London clinic says it is still determining what data was stolen A high-profile plastic surgery clinic has said it is "horrified" after hackers allegedly stole data during a cyber-attack.London Bridge Plastic Surgery (LBPS) said its IT experts and police found evidence of the breach.A group claiming to be behind the breach said it had "terabytes" of data, the Daily Beast news site reported.The Metropolitan Police is investigating the attack.The alleged hackers, using the pseudonym The Dark Overlord, said they had obtained photos showing various body parts of clients, including genitals.Some of these images have been sent to the Daily Beast.The hackers also claimed that the data contained information on "royal families" and added that they planned to distribute the patient list and corresponding photos online."We are still working to establish exactly what data has been compromised," LBPS said in a statement."We are horrified that they have now targeted our patients."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption One of the clinic's recent clients is model and TV presenter Katie Price A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said it was notified of a suspected breach on 17 October.She added that there had been no arrests and that enquiries by the Organised Crime Command were continuing.LBPS is known to have high-profile clients, including model and TV presenter Katie Price, who recently used her Instagram account to thank the clinic for her facelift.The Information Commissioner's Office said, "We are aware of this incident and are looking into the details."All organisations are required under data protection law to keep people's personal data safe and secure."The Dark Overlord has claimed to be behind high-profile data breaches before, including one at US media firm Netflix earlier this year.In April, 10 episodes of the new series of TV show Orange is the New Black were released online after Netflix refused to pay a ransom.
Brexit: MPs quiz Facebook over Russian-linked 'fake news':::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Vladimir Putin has denied that Russia interfered in the US elections last year - but questions continue to be raised about alleged meddling in other democratic processes British MPs have asked Facebook if it has evidence of paid-for activity by accounts linked to Russia at the time of the Brexit referendum.A letter addressed to Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg also asks about similar activity at the time of this year's general election.It was written by Damian Collins, chairman of the Digital, Media and Sport Committee.Facebook said it would respond to the request once it had been reviewed."Part of this inquiry will focus on the role of foreign actors abusing platforms such as yours to interfere in the political discourse of other nations," wrote Mr Collins.He said he wanted to know whether Facebook could provide: examples of adverts bought, and pages set up by Russia-linked accounts information on how these ads and pages were targeted how much money was paid to promote these ads or pages how many times they were viewed "We have received a letter from the Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Committee and will respond once we have had the opportunity to review the request," a spokeswoman for Facebook said.The committee's inquiry - which was put on hold during the general election earlier this year - aims to explore the impact of fake news.The closing date for submitting evidence is 7 November.Russia has consistently denied interfering in the democratic processes of other countries.
Equifax to be investigated by FCA over data breach:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption The massive data breach affects nearly 700,000 UK customers Credit rating firm Equifax is being investigated by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) over a large data loss.The FCA released a short statement announcing the investigation but did not provide further details.Equifax said it welcomed the opportunity to "learn the lessons from this criminal cyber-attack".Earlier this month, the firm admitted that more UK customers had been hit by a cybersecurity incident between mid-May and the end of July this year.It originally believed that fewer than 400,000 British people were affected, but it has now put the figure at 694,000.An estimated 143 million US customers also had their data compromised.Equifax has said that those affected may be at risk of "possible criminal activity".This may include identity theft and targeted scams."The FCA announces today that it is investigating the circumstances surrounding a cybersecurity incident that led to the loss of UK customer data held by Equifax Ltd on the servers of its US parent," the regulator said in a statement."This statement is made given the public interest in these matters."Equifax said: "We welcome this opportunity to learn the lessons from this criminal cyber-attack in order for all businesses to better protect consumers in the future."Four groups of UK customers have so far been detailed by the firm: 637,000 whose phone numbers were stolen 29,000 whose driving licence numbers were stolen 15,000 who had some of their Equifax membership details, such as usernames and passwords, stolen and 12,000 whose email addresses were stolen UK customers have been advised to phone Equifax for advice on 0800 587 1584.
Teenager's life 'ruined' by Live.me and Twitter 'trolls':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Victoria, whose full name the BBC has chosen not to use, says her face was superimposed on pornographic images shared on social media A teenager claims internet trolls "ruined her life" by superimposing her face on pornographic messages that were shared on social media.Victoria, from Leeds, was told to "go kill yourself" on the Live.me streaming app and her home address was shared on Twitter as a "house to burgle".Figures obtained by BBC Yorkshire show reports of malicious communication have almost doubled to more than 200 a day.There were 79,372 offences recorded in 2016, up from 42,910 the year before.Police forces in England and Wales were asked to provide the data, with 38 out of 43 responding.'Tip of the iceberg' Image copyright Getty Images Image caption West Yorkshire Police said investigations into Victoria's case were ongoing Victoria, 18, had open profiles on Live.me, Twitter and Instagram, where she had thousands of followers.She said she was sent pornographic images that featured her face and had photographs of her house shared online, while another message to her simply said "die"."I'm on anxiety tablets now.It's knocked my confidence.I don't even go out of the house that much," she said."There's still that thought in the back of my mind, where you never know if they are going to be there while you are out."At the end of the day, this has legit just ruined my life.I used to be an outgoing person.I'm just trying to get back to my old self."What is Live.Me?Fast growing Live video streaming application Has approximately 20 million users to date Users have no control over who shares their videos Likes and electronic gifts raise a users online ranking In August 2017 a man was convicted after forcing a nine-year-old child to expose herself in a video that has been viewed more than 200 times.Victoria went to the police about the malicious communication - defined as sending a letter or electronic communication with intent to cause distress or anxiety - but no arrests were made.She said: "Sometimes I feel like it's my fault.But it's easier for people to get targeted because they're putting themselves out there on the internet, which I thought was just fun, to make new friends."I never thought it would turn out like this."Supt Mat Davison said West Yorkshire Police was investigating Victoria's case and new lines of inquiry would be acted on."Officers have been in regular contact with the victim and members of her family and provided them with updates on the progress of the investigation," he added.The Times recently reported nine people are arrested each day for posting offensive material online, sparking criticism from human rights groups about "over-policing" of the internet.However, Essex Police Chief Constable Stephen Kavanagh said the rise in malicious communication was "the tip of the iceberg".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Twitter plans to impose new restrictions on pornographic and hateful imagery to tackle abuse The chairman of the Digital Policing Board, which deals with digital crime nationally, said social network providers should do more to protect online users."I think as policing and society changes in to the digital age this is only going to increase," Mr Kavanagh said."Providers, government, law enforcers and users all need to get ready how we protect people more effectively, and how we bring criminals to justice."Dr Michelle Newberry, senior lecturer in forensic psychology at Sheffield Hallam University, said there was a correlation between how much we use social media and the increase in trolling.She said: "It is very unusual for people not to have their phone with them.We just have that instant access these days."Twitter previously said it planned to impose new restrictions on pornographic and hateful imagery to tackle abuse.A spokesperson for Live.me said: "Our goal at Live.me is to create a safe and friendly environment for all of our users which is why it's always heartbreaking to hear stories of users being harassed or bullied."We have strict protocols for our moderators to address any community violations, and our automatic software detection and human moderators are on call 24-hours a day, seven days a week, working to combat cyber-bullying, indecent behaviour, or threats of self-harm."Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning
FBI failed to access 7,000 encrypted mobile devices:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Christopher Wray said more than half of the devices the FBI had tried to access in 11 months had been impenetrable Agents at the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have been unable to extract data from nearly 7,000 mobile devices they have tried to access, the agency's director has said.Christopher Wray said encryption on devices was "a huge, huge problem" for FBI investigations.The agency had failed to access more than half of the devices it targeted in an 11-month period, he said.One cyber-security expert said such encryption was now a "fact of life".Many smartphones encrypt their contents when locked, as standard - a security feature that often prevents even the phones' manufacturers from accessing data.Such encryption is different to end-to-end encryption, which prevents interception of communications on a large scale.Cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward at the University of Surrey said device encryption was clearly frustrating criminal investigations but it would be impractical and insecure to develop "back doors" or weakened security.Trade-off "Encryption that frustrates forensic investigations will be a fact of life from now on for law enforcement agencies," he said."Even if the equipment manufacturers didn't build in such encryption it would be possible to obtain software that encrypted data in the same way."Referring to the trade-off between cyber-security and investigative hacking, the FBI director said: "I get it, there's a balance that needs to be struck between encryption and the importance of giving us the tools we need to keep the public safe."Mr Wray was speaking at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in Philadelphia on Sunday.In 2016, the FBI asked Apple to unlock an iPhone used by San Bernardino killer Syed Rizwan Farook.Apple refused, explaining that its phones had been designed so that even their manufacturer could not access them once encrypted.The FBI later said a third party firm had discovered a way of breaking into Farook's device.Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that the FBI did not have to reveal the identity of the firm or how much the agency paid for its services.The ruling followed freedom of information requests filed by journalists.
UK to help CES tech start-ups after expo chief's criticism:::::Image copyright Doppel Image caption Doppel is one of the start-ups that will have space at the UK's pavilion The chief of the CES tech expo has revealed that the UK government is helping fund a selection of start-ups to attend its next event in January.The funding of a "pavilion" within the show's Eureka Park start-up zone represents a strategy shift for the UK.Gary Shapiro had previously said it was "a source of embarrassment" that small UK companies had not received such support at the 2017 show.Ministers had insisted that UK firms still had a "significant" presence.TechUK - an industry group that has partnered with the government to run the stands - acknowledged that Mr Shapiro's intervention had made a difference."It definitely helped," Paul Hide, TechUK's director of market engagement, told the BBC."We've been pushing the DIT [Department for International Trade] for some time to give us additional support."It gives us a stronger identity by having a hub of a number of UK companies and allows us to promote a central location."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Shapiro has welcomed the UK's decision to fund a start-up area More than 4,000 exhibitors and 180,000 people attended this year's CES expo.The event attracts both the media and retail buyers from across the globe, allowing manufacturers to attract publicity and strike business deals at the week-long event.Last time, 55 UK companies booked show floor space.France fielded 248 companies and mainland China 1,314.The Great Britain and Northern Ireland Pavilion will provide pods to about a dozen start-ups.The spaces will be smaller than a separate stand, but help is being provided to design the area and attract visitors.Mr Shapiro revealed the initiative at a CES preview event in London.He later told the BBC that the British government and TechUK had "stepped up, [by] having a presence that they did not have last year".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption UK start-ups did not receive the support France gave to its tech firms at the last show One beneficiary is Doppel, a five-person London-based firm that has created a wrist-based device designed to make wearers feel more alert or relaxed, depending on its setting.The company, which will pay its own travel and accommodation costs, said it expected its total bill to come to about 2,100."Without this support we definitely wouldn't have been able to exhibit," said Doppel's head of marketing, Georgina Orso."Saving thousands of pounds makes the difference between attending and not attending for a pre-revenue company like us."TechUK said that if the initiative was a success, it hoped to host an even bigger space in 2019.The DIT added in a statement: "We help exporters make the most of global opportunities... [including] trade missions for high value sectors like the tech sector and trade shows like CES, where we will be supporting a number of UK exhibitors next year."
Mini phone maker admits performance shortcomings:::::Image copyright Unihertz The Chinese firm behind a palm-sized 4G smartphone has admitted that the handset's performance may fall short of expectations in certain circumstances.Unihertz says the Jelly phone battery has up to three days of working time and lasts seven days on standby.But chief executive Stephen Xu told the BBC that "heavy use" could reduce battery life to three or four hours.This included keeping wi-fi and Bluetooth switched on all the time, he said."If you use a phone quite a lot even an iPhone can't last a day," Mr Xu said.The Jelly battery should last about a day with "normal use", he added.He said problems reported by some Jelly users with GPS functionality were down to a combination of hardware and software reasons.Unihertz hoped to issue an update soon, he said."[With Jelly,] we are trying to find a balance between bigger phones and smaller wearables," Mr Xu said.Stuart Miles, founder of review website Pocket Lint, said there was a market for small phones."As phones have got bigger and bigger there is an urge for people to just want something small to put in their pocket," he said."This phone is clearly trying to tap into that supposed need, but I do wonder whether a smartwatch with 3G calling would offer you the same, if not more functionality."The Jelly phone, which Unihertz calls the world's smallest 4G phone, was developed after its maker raised more than $1.2m (0.9m) in crowdfunding.It is available in the UK, US and in many other countries but it is not compatible with the CDMA mobile standard, which means it will not work with some mobile phone networks including Verizon and Sprint in the US.Unihertz also decided to stop providing plugs for the device, which now comes with a USB cable only."We realised that due to the different standards of the charger products, it's harder for us, so we have removed the plugs," said Mr Xu."I think most people already have a plug."
Netflix to raise another $1.6bn to finance new films and shows:::::Image copyright Alamy Image caption Netflix's Stranger Things has been one of the company's big hits Netflix is raising another $1.6bn (1.2bn) from investors to finance new shows and possibly make acquisitions.The video streaming service plans to spend up to $8bn on content next year to compete with fast-growing rivals.Netflix will issue bonds to investors, although the interest rate it will pay has yet to be decided, the company said in a statement.Netflix plans to release 80 films next year, but some analysts are wary about its cash burn and debt interest costs.The company's latest debt fundraising is its largest so far, and the fourth time in three years it has raised more than $1bn by issuing bonds.Earlier this month, Netflix said it would raise prices in countries including the UK and US for the first time in two years.The price rises come as Netflix faces growing competition from Amazon and other sites such as Hulu and Disney in the US.Netflix has spent heavily on original programming such as The Crown, Stranger Things and House of Cards.One movie, Mudbound, was described by Variety as "an epic about race and poverty in the 1940s Mississippi Delta", and stars Mary J. Blige and Carey Mulligan.Some critics say it is a contender for the Academy Awards and would be the first Netflix feature to be in the Oscars race.Netflix's share price has risen more than 50% this year on the back of subscriber growth that has beat expectations.The company now has more than 109 million subscribers globally, adding 15.5 million so far this year.The move to take on more corporate debt comes amid expectations that borrowing costs may increase in coming months.The US Federal Reserve is weighing another rate hike by the end of 2017.
Amazon receives 200-plus headquarters proposals:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amazon wants US cities to bid for its second major HQ Amazon says it has now received 238 proposals from places vying to be the home of its next employment hub.The bids come after the e-commerce giant said it was looking to build a "second headquarters" in North America, where it would invest $5bn (3.8bn) and hire as many as 50,000 people.The locations are vying on factors such as workforce talent, tax breaks, and proximity to an international airport.Amazon said it will decide on a location next year.Amazon has seen major growth.The firm had nearly $136bn in sales last year and employs about 380,000 people globally - adding about 39,000 since the start of 2017 alone.Politicians are eager to attract the economic engine to their home towns.The proposals come from all but seven US states, most southern provinces in Canada and three states in Mexico, as well as Washington DC and the territory of Puerto Rico, according to a map published by the company.The places competing include sites in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Newark and Toronto.
Project Loon restores web in hurricane-hit Puerto Rico:::::Image copyright Alphabet Image caption The balloons carry telecommunications equipment that allows them to form an airborne network Mobile phone data services have been boosted in hurricane-hit Puerto Rico by balloons provided by Google's parent company, Alphabet.The Project Loon devices beam signals between each other and to users on the ground.This extends communications networks in places where infrastructure is scarce or has been damaged.The balloons will allow residents with LTE phones to send and receive text messages and access the web.However, much of the country is still without electricity, and more than a quarter of the population lacks safe drinking water."This is the first time we have used our new machine learning-powered algorithms to keep balloons clustered over Puerto Rico, so we're still learning how best to do this," said head of Project Loon Alastair Westgarth."As we get more familiar with the constantly shifting winds in this region, we hope to keep the balloons over areas where connectivity is needed for as long as possible."Alphabet launched the balloons in collaboration with the government of Puerto Rico, the US Federal Communications Commission, Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency and telecoms firm AT&T.Earlier this year, Alphabet sent its balloons to Peru following serious floods.
Israel Facebook: Mistranslated post creates security alert:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The post that caused the alert has now been deleted Israeli police arrested a Palestinian man last week after a Facebook post he made saying "good morning" in Arabic was mistranslated to read "attack them" in Hebrew, local media have reported.Police confirmed that the construction worker was briefly held under suspicion of incitement but was released as soon as the mistake was realised.The post showed a photo of the worker next to a bulldozer in the West Bank.Such vehicles have been used to attack Israelis in the past.There is only one difference in lettering between the colloquial Arabic phrase for "good morning to you all" and "hurt them", pointed out The Times of Israel.No Arabic-speaking officer was consulted before the arrest was carried out, say reports, with officers wholly dependent on Facebook's automatic translation.The post in question has now been deleted.There were red faces at Google last year, when its online translation tool rendered the Russian Federation as "Mordor".Mordor is the name of a fictional region in JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books.In addition, "Russians" was translated to "occupiers".Google said at the time that Translate worked by looking for patterns in hundreds of millions of documents - but translation remained difficult as the meaning of words was tied to the context in which they were used.
Remove ads that appeal to children, gambling sites told:::::Image copyright Getty Images Online gambling companies have been urged to remove adverts featuring images likely to appeal to children.Regulators said the "unacceptable" ads and third-party media, which contain graphics and images that are likely to be attractive to minors, should be "immediately" removed or amended.They said this particularly applied to adverts for free and pay-to-play games.In a joint letter, the regulators said under-18s and other vulnerable people should be protected from exploitation.The Gambling Commission, the Advertising Standards Authority, the Committee of Advertising Practice, and the Remote Gambling Association said companies needed to advertise responsibly.Under the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) code, gambling activities must not be advertised in a way that could appeal to the under-18s.Peter Pan "The use of particular colours, cartoon and comic book images, animals, child- and youth-orientated references and names of games such as 'Piggy Payout', 'Fluffy Favourites', 'Pirate Princess' and 'Jack and the Beanstalk' are likely, alone or in combination, to enhance appeal to under 18s," the letter sent to more than 450 online gambling operators says.The letter warned that those who failed to adhere to Advertising Standards Authority guidelines could face sanctions.It follows an investigation by the Sunday Times that found gambling sites were using cartoons and characters including Peter Pan and Jack and the Beanstalk.The paper said the letter was sent to more than 450 online gambling operators.Tim Miller, executive director at the Gambling Commission, said new technology brought "opportunities but also new risks".In a letter to the Sunday Times he said: "Our rules require strong age-verification checks to prevent underage gambling.Where businesses fail to protect vulnerable people, especially children, we have and will continue to take firm action."
Tech firms to remove extremist posts within hours:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption IS militants have used social media to spread propaganda Tech giants Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter and Google have agreed to do more to remove extremist content within hours of it being posted.The accord was decided at a two-day meeting between the G7 nations and the tech firms, hosted on the Italian island of Ischia.The aim, according to officials, is to remove jihadist content from the internet within two hours.In a tweet, Twitter said the talks had been "important and productive".Twitter and Google declined to give further comment.Italy's interior minister Marco Minniti said they were "important first steps".In a statement issued after the meeting, the G7 said: "We underscore the challenge to industry and we urge it... to develop solutions to identify and remove terrorist content within one to two hours of upload, to the extent it is technically feasible, without compromising human rights and fundamental freedoms."It also urged the companies to develop better detection tools and to ensure all removed material is reported to authorities.In September, UK prime minister Theresa May said technology companies must go "further and faster" in removing extremist content.She said then that she wanted such content removed within two hours.MI5 head Andrew Parker said that allowing extremists "safe spaces online" made threats harder to detect.It is the first time that representatives from Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter have taken part in G7 talks.The G7 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US.
Bitcoin boom prompts growth of coin-mining malware:::::Image copyright Vichai Image caption Generating crypto-currencies involves lots of computer hardware The booming price of Bitcoin and other crypto-coins has kicked off a gold rush among malicious hackers keen to cash in, warn security firms.Many sites are now harbouring code that secretly uses a visitors' computer to mine the valuable e-cash coins.The code is inserted by hackers who exploit poor site security or web software bugs.The problem has led Google engineers to consider putting protections against mining in the Chrome browser.Freshly minted Earlier this month, hundreds of websites were found to be running code created by the Coin-Hive project.This let the web domains generate coins for the Monero crypto-currency by using the processing power of visitors' computers.While some sites had put the Coin-Hive code on their site themselves, many others had been hacked to host the short script.Bitcoin, and almost every other crypto-coin, works by using lots of different computers to log and verify who has done what with the electronic coins.In return for carrying out these computational tasks, called mining, users are regularly rewarded with new coins.Palo Alto Networks said it had found Coin-Hive on almost 150 separate domains.The most popular locations for the code were porn, video and file-sharing sites."The use of Coin-Hive or similar mining services is itself not a malicious activity," said Yuchen Zhou and colleagues at security company Palo Alto."It is how they are used that makes the sites malicious."The wide uptake of Coin-Hive and the surging price of Bitcoin, now worth about $5,630 (4,288) per coin, has led to the creation of many "copycat" coin-mining systems.Security news website Bleeping Computer has now found 10 separate "clones" of Coin-Hive that mine different types of coins for their creators."Most are behaving like malware, intruding on users' computers and using resources without permission," wrote Catalin Cimpanu on the Bleeping Computer site.On portable devices, the code can drain batteries very quickly.Some of the copycat coin-mining programs specifically target popular website creation and admin systems such as WordPress.Others, said Mr Cimpanu, are written in Javascript and their creators try to insert them wherever they can.Many anti-virus firms have updated their software so they now spot and disable mining software.Also, Coin-Hive has now launched an authorised version of its software which only mines coins if users give their explicit permission.Image copyright AFP Image caption Many people are looking to cash in on Bitcoin's growing value The growing number of coin miners kicked off a discussion among Google engineers working on the firm's Chrome browser about how to tackle it."Yes, we should do something about it," wrote Ojan Vafai, a Chrome engineer on the forums where browser changes are debated.Mr Vafai suggested getting the browser to watch for situations when mining software grabs lots of processing power from a computer or portable device.If the browser spots this activity it would "aggressively throttle" browser activity to limit how much number-crunching power can be grabbed.Users would also be warned about what was happening.The change would let users see when their browser was being used for mining and let them choose if it continued.Blocking the activity any other way would be difficult, he said."I'm effectively suggesting we add a permission here, but it would have unusual triggering conditions," he wrote."It only triggers when the page is doing a likely bad thing."
Middlesbrough modified Kodi box trader gets suspended jail term:::::Image caption Brian Thompson had previously said he wanted to know whether he was doing anything illegal A trader who sold TV boxes which allowed viewers to watch subscription films and football for free has been given a suspended jail term.Brian Thompson had denied breaking the law by selling the Kodi boxes, setting up the prospect of a landmark trial.But appearing at Teesside Crown Court he changed his plea to guilty.The 55-year-old, who runs Cut Price Tomo's TV store in Middlesbrough, was given an 18-month prison sentence, suspended for two years.Thompson, of Barnaby Avenue, Middlesbrough, admitted one count of selling and one count of advertising devices "designed, produced or adapted for the purpose of enabling or facilitating the circumvention of effective technological measures".The court heard Thompson had been selling "fully loaded" Kodi boxes - ones that had been installed with third-party add-ons that can access pirated content.He had previously claimed the law was a "grey area" and said he wanted to know whether he was "doing anything illegal".'No doubt' Thompson had sold an estimated 400 boxes, earning him about 40,000, and losses to Sky were an estimated 200,000 in subscriptions, the court heard.Judge Peter Armstrong said there could be no doubt now about the legality of the fully loaded boxes."Those who lawfully have to pay 50 a month or more on Sky or BT subscriptions, are done a disservice by people like you and those who buy these devices," he said.He said he was suspending Thompson's jail sentence but others in the future may not be so fortunate.Cameron Crowe, prosecuting, said streaming devices were not illegal if they were used to access free content.But he added: "If they are designed, produced or adapted for gaining unauthorised access to copyright content or subscription services - such as Sky and BT Sports - they become illegal."Image copyright Kodi Image caption Kodi turns compatible devices into a "media centre" What are Kodi boxes?Some shops sell ready-to-use set-top boxes or television sticks preloaded with the Kodi software.The developers behind Kodi say their software does not contain any content of its own and is designed to play legally owned media or content "freely available" on the internet.However the software can be modified with third-party add-ons that provide access to illegal copies of films and TV series, or provide free access to subscription television channels.Some traders sell Kodi boxes preloaded with third-party add-ons that can access pirated content.It is the sale of these "fully-loaded" boxes which was the subject of the case against Mr Thompson.Trading Standards officers made a test purchase from Thompson's Dundas shopping centre outlet in 2015 and a raid was carried out.He moved premises after the raid and advertised on Facebook claiming to have "every film and box set ever made, even ones at the cinema".Paul Fleming, defending, said his client was a hard worker who had succeeded and failed in businesses over the years.Kieron Sharp, the chief executive of Fact (formerly the Federation Against Copyright Theft), said one million illegal Kodi TV boxes had been sold in the UK in the past two years.He said the perpetrators were not "Robin Hood characters", but criminals."Selling pre-configured streaming devices that allow access to content you normally would have to pay for is illegal," he added.
Mobile companies overcharging customers after contracts end:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The government thinks mobile operators need to inform customers once the handset is paid off Vodafone, EE and Three are continuing to charge customers for the mobile phones they buy as part of a contract, even after the cost of the handset has been paid off, research suggests.Citizens Advice found that customers who do not take out a new contract are paying an average 22 extra a month.The government said the mobile firms needed to inform customers when they had paid for their handsets.The operators said that their billing systems were fair.Minister for Digital Matt Hancock said: "It's only right that mobile customers should be notified when they have paid off the price of their handset, and that their future bills should reflect this."I welcome Citizens Advice's call for better billing information for consumers, and hope that providers will now take the initiative by clearly separating the cost of handsets and tariffs in mobile contracts."Vodafone told the BBC it strives to give customers "the price plan that best suits them".Who's affected and what can you do?Anyone who purchased a mobile deal with the operators Three, Vodafone or EE, which included a handset, is being overcharged when their contract comes to an end Users can ask their phone company to swap them to a cheaper sim-only deal, or they can end the contract and find another provider No-one is automatically entitled to compensation - consumers can only make a claim if it wasn't made clear in their contract that the deal would continue at the same price Source: Citizens Advice The consumers who were overcharged "Wherever possible, we contact customers nearing the end of their contract to offer them a range of options.These include being able to upgrade their handset, receiving an extra allowance to enhance their existing plan or, if they choose, a sim-only plan," the firm said in a statement.Three said: "Whenever a new customer signs with us, we make the end-date of the contract term very clear.We also let them know that they can contact us at any time to discuss the range of options available should they wish to change their plan with us."And EE commented: "Separating phone and tariff doesn't always represent the best deal for consumers, it can sometimes result in them paying more."O2 does separate airtime and device costs and chief marketing officer Nina Bibby said: "Forcing customers to continue to pay for a phone they already own not only hits their pockets but undermines trust and the reputation of the industry."Are you paying extra?Vodafone, EE and Three customers after end of handset-inclusive two-year fixed term deal 22 average monthly cost if customers do not buy a new contract 36% of customers failed to change after their deal 23% of over-65s stayed on after their deal 38 average extra monthly cost of contracts with handsets like the Galaxy S8 or the iPhone 8 46 potential monthly over-charge for customers with a 256GB iPhone 8 Getty Images Exploiting customers The majority of those who take out a mobile phone contract with the cost of the new handset included in the price will have paid off the price of phone over a period of two years, the study found.The research suggested that users paying out for handsets such as the iPhone 7, the Galaxy S and Xperia XZ Premium, paid 38 extra a month, after the two-year period.According to the study, people aged over 65 were the most likely to be stung - with 23% staying on their contract past the end of the fixed deal period.Overall, 36% of people with a handset-inclusive contract failed to change it after the end of the fixed deal period.Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: "The cost of handsets are hidden within some mobile phone contracts giving phone providers a way to exploit their customers."It is clearly unfair that some phone providers are charging loyal customers for handsets that they have already paid for.It's especially concerning that older customers are more likely to be stung by this sharp practice."She called on the phone providers to make sure that any customers staying on a contract past the end of the fixed deal have their monthly bill reduced to reflect the fact they have paid for the handset."Providers could make it much easier for consumers to compare prices by separating out the cost of handsets from the cost of services like data and minutes for all contracts; that way it would be much clearer what they're paying for," she added.
Players ‘applaud’ Xi Jinping in Tencent game:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Users "clap" for Mr Xi by tapping their phone screen A smartphone game in which players can "applaud" Chinese president Xi Jinping has gone viral.The app, released in the week of the Communist Party Congress, lets users clap for Mr Xi by tapping their phone screen as many times as possible in 19 seconds.The game, from Tencent, has racked up 1.2 billion plays in three days.Public displays of loyalty to the president are commonplace in China and have intensified ahead of the congress.The closed-door summit, which ends on Tuesday, will determine who rules China and the country's political direction.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Xi gave a speech lasting three and a half hours to the Communist Party Congress Mr Xi, who is widely expected to be re-appointed as leader, opened the summit with a speech lasting three and a half hours, in which he said China had entered a "new era" and should "take centre stage in the world".In the Tencent game, users are shown extracts of the speech on topics such as regulating the housing market to protect young homebuyers, or improving the lives of poor farmers.They are then encouraged to tap the screen to see how fast they can "applaud".Many have challenged friends to compete and shared their scores on social media.On Thursday, Tencent said players had clapped over a billion times in total so far.'Cult of personality' It is not the first time apps have been used to encourage political loyalty in China.The Communist Party has released more than 100 for its members, featuring quizzes and classes that promote its values.Public displays of loyalty to the president are also commonplace in China, with Mr Xi's face appearing prominently on billboards and souvenirs sold in tourist areas.Top officials also often publicly praise his ideology - although this has led some to warn that Mr Xi is creating a cult of personality around himself to entrench his position.Since taking office in 2012, Mr Xi has taken steps to cement his leadership including a wide-reaching corruption crackdown, likened by some to a political purge.The Communist Party is widely expected to rewrite its constitution next week to enshrine his political ideology - dubbed "Xi Jinping Thought".The move would elevate him to the level of previous leaders Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping.
How the makers of Destiny 2 learnt from their mistakes:::::"Absolutely we took criticisms of the original Destiny to heart," Jason Jones, co-founder of Bungie, tells Newsbeat."We knew it had amazing parts... but we also saw the real mistakes we made."In a rare interview inside their Seattle offices, in the US, he says the experience shaped how they tackled Destiny 2."It was stuff we already knew but it was a sharp and clear message from our community - they expected better."Walking around the high-tech studios, where few journalists have seen the inner workings, it's clear there's a focus on righting those wrongs.Jason tells us: "The story for example, that was one of the big sources of negative reviews for Destiny."We weren't surprised by that feedback because, when you're a creator immersed in that work, you feel it."The narrative drew criticism for being dull and repetitive.However, the online-only science fiction game was still seen by some as ground-breaking - establishing the new genre of MMO shooter and winning a Bafta for Game of the Year in 2014.Jason says the studio have learnt their lessons, and judging by the reaction to the new title and the positive reviews he might just be right.The challenge now is keeping the players coming back for more.Speaking to Newsbeat, the game director of Destiny 2, Luke Smith, says: "For our game, quantity is a part of quality."Especially for our players who'll consume our content faster than we can build it.It takes months to make a cool adventure and players will go through it in 20 minutes!"Since being founded in the 1990s, Bungie has become one of the most influential games developers in the industry.It first became famous for making the early titles of the award-winning Halo franchise.Despite the console version of Destiny 2 being out since September, the studio is still a hive of activity.Many of the studio's 700 employees are busy keeping the game's online living universe going, working on extra content and developing a PC version.The franchise has never been playable off console before and adapting the game is the job of David Shaw.He tells us: "Making the mouse and keyboard really feel like Destiny has been one of the challenges."On consoles when you're firing certain weapons they'll kick and rise up quickly."That recoil is a integral part of making that experience feel good and heavy like you're actually there."But on keyboard and mouse it meant you were just chasing the barrel of the gun the whole time, just dragging the mouse."The team made a big effort to make sure it pushes the technical capabilities of expensive PCs.David says: "When someone spends several thousand pounds on a gaming rig, you want to make sure you're honouring that investment."Everything the team needs to make the game and all the upcoming extra content is all under one roof, from motion capture rooms to sound design studios.Award-winning composer Michael Salvatore tells us: "We had to make over 900 minutes of music for this game, that's 15 hours."We released the soundtrack a day before the game came out and it became the number one seller on Amazon, we knocked Taylor Swift from first place."I love Taylor Swift but enough is enough!"Keeping Desitny fans happy is the main job for people in the studio at the moment but Jason tells us that they have started thinking about what's next.He says: "We're starting in a small way to look at what's beyond Destiny."Every time you do a new thing to surprise and delight people you risk being ignored."So you could make your hand very tired writing down all the risks going into a new game project, but unless you're taking risks then you're not going to do something people care about."You can watch our behind the scenes at Bungie film on BBC Click on Saturday 21 October.Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat
Famous Irishmen subject of Westminster Wiki editing spree:::::Image copyright PA Image caption amon de Valera is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin, Republic of Ireland or just Ireland?Where did amon de Valera die?In Ireland or in the Republic of Ireland, or both?Earlier on Friday his Wikipedia entry said he died in Blackrock, Dublin, Ireland.As of lunchtime it was changed to say he died in the Republic of Ireland.Wikipedia showed the edits had been made from an IP address which could be traced to the House of Commons.Minutes later, it had been "restored", by another user.Changes to Wikipedia made from a Parliamentary IP address are published by a Twitter account, Parliament WikiEdits.However, it is not clear who the individual or individuals behind the edits are.The changes were first noticed by Irish language news site tuairisc.ie.Image caption Samuel Beckett died in France, but was born in Dublin in 1906, Ireland, then a part of the United Kingdom Novelist Bram Stoker's entry was also edited.The Dracula author's birthplace was changed from Ireland to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, both technically correct.Fellow novelist James Joyce's entry was changed to clarify that when he was born in 1882, in what is now the Republic of Ireland was then a part of the United Kingdom.He died in Paris, France.While the term Republic of Ireland is often used to distinguish the southern Irish state from Northern Ireland, the state's actual name is simply Ireland, or in the Irish language ire.Samuel Beckett, George Bernard Shaw, John Redmond, W.T.Cosgrave also had their place of birth clarified by the mystery editor or editors.What is an IP address?An Internet Protocol address is a number assigned to a particular internet connection It is a string of unique numbers In a multi-device household the IP address is assigned to a router and all the devices will use the same address IP addresses can be static, meaning a permanent internet address or dynamic - a temporary address that is assigned each time a computer or device accesses the internet Irish rebel leader, Michael Collins, was famously killed at Bealnablath in County Cork during Ireland's civil war.His place of death was changed from Ireland to Irish Free State.In actual fact, technically, the Irish Free State did not come into being until December 1922 despite Southern Ireland having split from the UK in 1921.A number of other edits on various aspects of Irish and British history were made from the same IP address on Friday morning.Most of those edits were then re-edited by another user, to their original wording.

Nintendo to release Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp on phones in November:::::Nintendo has announced that Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp for smartphones will be released in November.The move could increase profits from the Japanese company's mobile phone business.Although it is free to play, it will include an option to pay a small amount of money for in-app purchases.The game, which was first designed for the Nintendo 64 console, will now be available on iPhones and Android smartphones.People got a bit excited when they heard the news.Animal Crossing has been a real success story for Nintendo and has attracted younger gamers.The game is based around being the mayor of your own town and you can spend your time how you like.This can range from collecting items, planting things, selling stuff you've collected, customising your character's clothes, your home and some of the places around you.The characters are all cartoony animals with unique personalities.Gaming blogger Nick Hickman told Newsbeat: "Players of the game have reacted positively to the endlessly customisable nature of the towns you can create."There are lots of people who still play it even now, years after it first came out."Given the initial success of Pokemon Go and the financial success (although not quite breaking the zeitgeist like Pokemon did) of Mario Run and Fire Emblem heroes, people are excited for Nintendo to publish more games on mobile making them much more accessible."Nintendo usually only puts their games on their own machines, so breaking from that tradition and allowing games they've made on a platform that everyone has is quite a big deal."Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat

How Facebook saved a dying mill town:::::Image copyright Alan Brandt A mill town with high unemployment has seen its fortunes changed by Facebook's need for data servers.But will the town have to radically change to save itself?The people of Prineville live deep in a valley surrounded by dense forests.In the 1800s, it was the first place in central Oregon where white settlers drove out Native Americans to start a city.Steve Forrester's grandparents got here in 1902.When he was growing up in the 1970s, Prineville felt idyllic."It was a magical, magical place to grow up," he remembers."My dad worked in the sawmill industry as an electrician; my mom didn't work.We all learned to hunt and shoot a gun."We all learned how to drive in the forest before we were 16.In the spring, we could snow-ski in the morning and water-ski in the afternoon."And everybody had a job, and everyone did well."Prineville was the largest producer of ponderosa pine in the world.But when the federal government restricted logging and increased protections for animals like the spotted owl, the city's milling industry was decimated.As an adult, Forrester took a job with one of the few remaining mills, because he wanted to live in Prineville.Eric Klann was driven by the same devotion.He's the seventh generation of his family to live here.Out of college, he also took a job in Prineville that he knew wouldn't last."There was always a little voice in the back of my head saying, 'What are you doing - you want to be here, but you're in a dying industry,'" he says.A few years later, the US housing bubble burst and demand declined for parts made by the last mills.Lots of people lost jobs and left.It felt like Prineville couldn't catch a break.Image copyright Alan Brandt Image caption One of Prineville's new kind of "factory" - a data server farm Both Forrester and Klann felt lucky to land jobs at the city - Forrester as city manager, Klann as city engineer.Their chance to save Prineville arrived in 2009 in the form of a mysterious email from a company called Vitesse."For the longest time, we had no idea what Vitesse meant," he says.All Klann knew is that Prineville's natural resources made it perfect for a new industry - the information industry, created to save the massive amounts of information people post on the web.Vitesse wanted to build a big warehouse and fill it with rows and rows of servers - servers that tend to get hot.Central Oregon's cold nights could cool them naturally.Klann remembers the first in-person meeting with Vitesse, and how it felt like Prineville's last chance."Right before I walked into our conference room to meet with their nine lawyers, I got an email and our unemployment rate had peaked at 23%," Klann says."I got that email and I walked into that room, and I kept thinking, 'I better not screw this up.'"Klann and Forrester decided to outperform the other cities Vitesse was considering.They showed the company their small town could move at big-city speed, by responding to Vitesse's questions day and night."What we heard back is that other cities weren't doing that," Forrester says.Their strategy worked, and in 2010, Prineville finally learned who Vitesse actually was."They had the big finger with a thumb-up Facebook sign, and we all pressed the button and it lit up, et cetera," Mayor Betty Roppe says, recounting the new data centre's groundbreaking."That was the big announcement - it was Facebook."It was Facebook's first data centre of its own.Mark Zuckerberg was there, and Roppe had planned to give him a cowboy hat to show the city's pride in its cowboy culture."Cowboy hats are not cheap.They said, 'Do not get Mark Zuckerberg a cowboy hat.He does not want a cowboy hat.'OK.So, I got him a hoodie.He wears hoodies all the time," she says.When she presented the gift, Roppe gave Facebook's founder a kiss on the cheek."He just blushed like he wanted to have the floor open up and swallow him."Image copyright Rupa Shenoy Image caption Mayor Betty Roppe oversaw Prineville's transformation after data centres were built in the city Seven years later, Facebook has two more data centres in Prineville and six others across the world.Apple's moved into Prineville, too - it's built three data centres here.All of them sit high above Prineville's valley, in huge, long, flat buildings painted pale blue and gray so they blend in with the sky.About 500 employees work in the centres, most of them from Prineville.Security's tight, so few other people ever see inside.Despite their low profile, the data centres have had a profound impact.Roppe says the mills taught Prineville a lesson - not to rely on just one industry.So they're putting in things that appeal to lots of employers - like good roads, walking and biking paths, modern wastewater treatment, a new hospital and a state college outpost.But now that the city's successful, officials have a lot more to think about.Like, how do you slow success down?"We can keep the small-town feel.I'm sure of it," Roppe says."We don't want to be a big city."The cost of housing is up, so city officials know they have to build more affordable housing.And Mayor Roppe's own granddaughter, with a college degree, can't find a living wage job.So, they have to keep bringing in new employers.All city manager Forrester can do is calibrate the development carefully.He worries about Prineville changing too much, too."We are small-town people.We live the Western lifestyle," Forrester says."The quiet and peace of central Oregon is a beautiful, beautiful thing, and to be able to make a living here is tremendous."But Forrester says he's seen that central Oregon towns that don't adapt will die.And he knows they have to risk changing Prineville in order to save it.The World is a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH.This piece is part of the series 50 States: America's place in a shrinking world.
The flying drones that can scan packages night and day:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pinc's flying drone scans warehouse packages Flying drones and robots now patrol distribution warehouses - they've become workhorses of the e-commerce era online that retailers can't do without.It is driving down costs but it is also putting people out of work: what price progress?It could be a scene from Blade Runner 2049; the flying drone hovers in the warehouse aisle, its spinning rotors filling the cavernous space with a buzzing whine.It edges close to the packages stacked on the shelf and scans them using onboard optical sensors, before whizzing off to its next assignment.But this is no sci-fi film, it's a warehouse in the US - one of around 250,000 throughout the country, many gargantuan in size: retail giant Walmart's smallest warehouse, for example, is larger than 17 football fields put together.And these automated drones are now doing the jobs humans - on foot, or operating fork-lift trucks and mechanical lifts - used to do: and they're doing them more cheaply and more accurately."Every year companies lose billions of dollars due to misplaced items and faulty inventory records in their warehouses," says Fadel Adib, an assistant professor of media, arts and sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Image copyright Hardis Group Image caption Hardis Group's EyeSee drone can fly autonomously "Today's inventory management requires workers to scan items manually, which is a very time consuming and error-prone process.It's impossible to keep track of all items in the warehouse."Two drones can do the work of 100 humans over the same time period, according to supply chain specialist, Argon Consulting.This means they can do several tours of a warehouse - even at night - compare results, identify discrepancies, and build up a much more accurate picture much more quickly.Drone makers claim scanning accuracy of close to 100%.Matt Yearling, chief executive of Pinc, one of the firms offering such aerial robots, says they can save warehousing and logistics companies millions of dollars."Nobody has 100% accuracy - including Walmart and Amazon," he says."For a warehouse that is 95% accurate, it means that 5% is ambiguous.So if the warehouse is storing $100m [75m] worth of inventory, then $5m is uncertain."Typically the retailer will have more than one warehouse.So, if you multiply the problem across the warehouse network you are talking big dollars."Pinc's drones use hydrogen fuel cells, enabling them to fly for up to two hours - four times as long as some battery-powered drones.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images French firm Hardis Group has also launched an inventory-scanning drone - EyeSee - and emphasises how autonomous it is."Flight orders and flight plan execution are ensured by our Android application," says Stephane Cadenet, manager of the firm's drone programme."Our solution is simple to use: no installation, no infrastructure adaptation and no driver.The only thing to do is unpack the drone.The calculation of the flight plan is automatic."Other companies, such as Infinium Robotics, have also developed drone scanning systems.Of course, retailers have been using robots and automated systems in warehouses for some years.In 2012, fashion brand Net-A-Porter said its robot pickers were already 500% faster than humans, while online retailer Amazon's Kiva robots have almost become famous.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Instead of humans walking miles to pick goods, these robots take the shelves to the pickers "Innovators are working to make drones and robots an integral part of warehousing, inventory, and logistics," says JP Gownder, a principal analyst at research firm Forrester."Over the next 10 years, these technologies look set to revolutionise these spaces."But all this cost saving and efficiency comes at the expense of jobs for humans.The $2.3tn e-commerce industry is huge and growing, but almost 75% of e-commerce companies employ no more than four people.So it is no coincidence that in the US some 89,000 shop workers were laid off between October and April this year, while employment in New York City clothing stores has declined for three consecutive years.Forrester estimates that automation technologies, including artificial intelligence, will replace 17% of US jobs by 2027.And growth in new types of employment will not be enough to compensate."Automation does create opportunities for new jobs - equivalent to 10% of today's jobs," says Mr Gownder."But that still leads to a net 7% loss of jobs due to automation, which has to be made up by macro-economic growth, non-automation related jobs, and monetary policy."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Ocado warehouse run by robots Ryan Bax, industry analyst for mobility at research consultancy Frost & Sullivan, concedes that the use of drones and robotics in warehousing will lead to job losses, but believes growth elsewhere will compensate for this."As automation reduces the demand for lesser qualified jobs, the need for specialised skills within the logistics sector will grow," he maintains.And he thinks automation tech may even become mandatory once it has been shown to reduce accidents in the workplace."The use of automated technologies will permit warehouses to operate 24-hour days and improve stock management accuracy, but beyond this they will provide significant benefits to safety within the workplace."This will be small comfort for the thousands of warehouse workers displaced by drones and robots, but it is the inevitable consequence of our desire for online convenience, cheaper prices and faster deliveries.
How Australia's A$49bn internet network came to be ridiculed:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The rollout of Australia's National Broadband Network has been heavily criticised In 1872, rugged, frontier Australia was lauded for overcoming the tyranny of distance to connect itself to the world via the "bush telegraph", a two-year project stringing 3,200km (2,000 miles) of wire through the outback that became part of the nation's folklore.By contrast today, while striving to be seen as an "innovation nation", Australia stands condemned, even ridiculed, for its latest drive for connectivity: a modern, fast internet network.Three letters - NBN - have come to strike dread into the minds of consumers, with the National Broadband Network symbolising for many a template in how not to do things.Given Australia's large size and sparse population density of three people per square kilometre, the NBN is the country's largest ever infrastructure project.The total budget sits at A$49bn (29bn; $38bn).Of that budget, around 35% must be spent connecting the final 10% of users, including wiring to remote areas, erecting many of the required 2,600 wireless towers and, most expensively, putting two satellites in the sky.This week, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called the NBN a mistake and a "calamitous train wreck" by a previous Labor government.Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd hit back by saying the project's issues "lie all on your head" - meaning the current conservative government.The escalating blame game, the NBN's slow roll-out, and a switch to inferior technology midstream have combined with other factors to leave Australians frequently asking the question: Why is our internet so slow?In 2013, Australia ranked 30th for average internet speeds.The NBN was meant to improve that, but the most recent standings ranked Australia 50th.The State of the Internet survey by US internet firm Akamai put Australia - with an average of 11.1 Mbps (megabits per second) - behind countries including Kenya, Hungary and Russia.And while it promotes itself as part of go-ahead Asia, Australia sits only eighth in the region, behind neighbours such as Thailand (21st overall) and New Zealand (27th).Some comparisons are misleading.Only 1.75% of Kenyan homes have fixed-line internet, compared with 90% in Australia.For many, particularly inner-city Australians on the best NBN technology, fixed-line speeds are adequate, particularly if you pay more.But there's no escaping Australia has been overtaken by many countries on the internet table.What's worse is that with many of those connected to the NBN reporting no improvement over old ADSL connections, of the homes equipped to take the new service, only 40% have chosen to do so.In business, and international competitiveness, the fears are perhaps more serious.NBN by the numbers A$49bn The current estimated cost of building the network 2007 The year the project was announced 2020 When the rollout is expected to be completed A$91,196 The cost of connecting one remote property 159% The rise in complaints since last financial year Getty Images "Going lower in ranking is alarming, and just not acceptable," says University of Sydney academic Dr Tooran Alizadeh, who has researched the NBN extensively and, like others, worries Australia's best minds will be lost to countries with better technology."Australia wants to be in the first 10 or so economies in the world.Obviously if you want to do that your internet access cannot be ranked 50th."The history In 2007, Mr Rudd announced 98% of Australian homes would be on the NBN by 2020.It was a breathtakingly ambitious idea.It was also, according to critics, backed by inadequate research into logistics and costs, initially put at A$15bn.The natural starting point was Australia's oldest telecom company, Telstra.Elsewhere, countries like New Zealand simply used the infrastructure already laid by their major telecom company to install fast internet cabling.But Telstra, halfway privatised at the time, clashed with regulators over how it might onsell broadband access to its competitors, and so pulled out of the running to build the network.Eventually, the government announced it would simply start a whole new semi-autonomous company from scratch.Called the NBN, it would set up the infrastructure to connect Australians with state-of-the-art fibre optic cables to their homes, selling bandwidth wholesale to retailers.Progress was slow, sporadic, and expensive.With Australia's preference for underground wiring, often concrete driveways would have to be dug up and relaid.Costs thus blew out for connecting houses from an envisaged average of A$4,400 to, in some cases, more than A$20,000, an NBN spokesman says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A rocket carrying the NBN's first satellite is launched into space from French Guiana in 2015 Complaints soon arose over why some regions were connected before others, with schools and hospitals, for example, getting very unequal standards of internet quality.Accusations of government pork-barrelling, however, were wide of the mark."The government just wanted progress, so it became a matter of which places were easiest and quickest to connect," one source with intimate knowledge of the subject told the BBC."Often this came down to issues like basic geology - where was the rock easiest to drill through?"After the conservative government attained power in 2013, the NBN struck more upheaval, with copper wire ordered for the final stretches of connection, surrounding neighbourhood broadband nodes.This presents a slower connection to the twice-as-expensive fibre optics.It also means residents, say 400 metres from the node, will have slower internet than a neighbour a few doors away.Critics also charge it's a false saving, since copper wire needs replacing far earlier than fibre optics.Complaints and competition Then came the NBN's high pricing to retailers, who buy limited supply to pass on to consumers, which leaves so many Australians staring in frustration while buffering or, worse still, service drop-outs occurring each peak hour."NBN has worked hard to bring the cost of bandwidth down but we cannot fill the pipes ourselves - it is up to the retailers to make sure that they are buying enough capacity to deliver a good quality of service," an NBN spokesman told the BBC.Yet another complication is the number of retailers - 180 - making it hard for the NBN to police quality control for end users."We've had huge problems getting our house connected to the footpath node," says Matt Grant, a factory manager in suburban St Clair, just 39km from central Sydney."But when I complained to the retailer, they told me to talk to the NBN.When I talked to the NBN, they sent me back to the retailer."Image copyright Getty Images He was eventually connected, but said "it's no better than we had with ADSL, especially in peak times".Last week, Australia's Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman revealed there had been a 159% increase in NBN-related complaints in the last financial year.NBN chief executive Bill Morrow told the Australian Broadcasting Corp this week that it "turns [his] stomach" that some customers were being left behind, but he placed blame on retailers, and said the government would ultimately decide when to replace copper connections.He also noted increasing competition from mobile broadband technology."Look, it is a competitive environment, but I just want to repeat we are doing everything we can to ensure the NBN delivers a great service," he said.The network says it's still on target to have 98% of homes connected by 2020, but Australia's internet malaise will still take some solving.There's hope of improvement, but not until base prices can come down as the NBN gradually recoups its massive expenditure.And despite the political finger-pointing, Mr Turnbull's government insists the network will be "fit for purpose"."Australia needs a 21st Century broadband network and this is not being delivered," said Laurie Patton, executive director of consumer advocacy group Internet Australia."The way we're heading now, whoever is in office in 2020 will have to deal with our biggest ever national infrastructure debacle."
How you could be Postman Pat for a day and earn extra cash:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cartoon characters Postman Pat and Mr Plod represent a bygone era in deliveries A growing number of start-ups are trying to help retailers deliver goods to customers more quickly and at lower cost.But can they really compete with the big courier and postal firms?It was a road accident in the Norwegian mountains that inspired the idea for start-up delivery company Nimber.One of the founders was on his way to a ski-jumping competition near Lillehammer when he saw a postal truck had overturned on the road."No one was hurt, but all these cars were just passing by," says Nimber chief executive Ari Kestin, whose partner Knut Bjerke made the trip."He thought, why don't they stop and carry some of the parcels to their destinations?A light-bulb came on."Nimber was launched soon after, joining a wave of new apps aimed at shaking up the delivery market.The website connects people who want to send large, awkward-to-carry goods, with members of the public travelling in the same direction.These "crowdsourced couriers" name their own price, Mr Kestin says, but are usually cheaper than using a traditional courier service or postal firm, such as FedEx or Royal Mail.Image copyright Nimber Image caption Nimber's crowd-sourced couriers often transport large goods "If you're driving from London to Manchester anyway, you will probably accept a lower price to deliver a package than a big delivery firm would," he says."We are making use of spare capacity and allowing people to monetise their movements."The site, whose main markets are Norway and the UK, has more than 40,000 registered "bringers" and 80,000 senders.It handles hundreds of deliveries a day of things like bikes, car parts and furniture.So far it has focused on serving people selling second-hand goods on sites like e-Bay and Norway's finn.no, but it has just started working with several big retailers, including Norway's largest meat and eggs producer, Nortura."Nimber is a great choice because it is environmentally friendly and doesn't create more traffic or pollution," a Nortura spokeswoman tells the BBC.But using members of the public to deliver goods does have its drawbacks.Mr Kestin admits that his service may not be as economical as a traditional delivery service for smaller items.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Its crowdsourced couriers are not always available to handle deliveries, and, on occasion, pull out at the last minute - although "that's quite rare", he says.This isn't stopping other firms experimenting with the crowdsourcing model.Some, like Uber Rush, Deliveroo and Instacart are using crowdsourced couriers to deliver packages, groceries and hot food locally - often more cheaply and quickly than major couriers could.Belgium postal giant Bpost and DHL are among those to have experimented with crowdsourced couriers.And Amazon launched its "citizen delivery" service Flex in 2015.With global retail e-ecommerce sales forecast to rise 23% this year to $2.3tn (1.8tn), it's not surprising start-ups are trying to muscle in on a delivery market still dominated by national postal services and courier firms like UPS, DHL, FedEx, Blue Dart and PostNL.These account for more than 90% of e-commerce deliveries, not including food, estimates Alex le Roy, an analyst at consultancy Transport Intelligence."These start-ups are basically serving the needs that the larger delivery companies can't meet," he says."That's because typically, traditional postal companies can deliver packages more or less anywhere, but they can't do it quickly."And the big courier firms can deliver quickly, but charge much higher prices when they deliver to out-of-the-way places or carry awkwardly shaped goods."Nimbler start-ups can also help smaller retailers reach new markets.Image copyright Fetchr Image caption Idriss Al Rifai and Joy Ajlouny co-founded Middle East-based Fetchr Fetchr, for example, is a Dubai-based delivery company aiming to connect retailers with around four billion people worldwide who live in places without street names or house numbers."There is this huge demand for online shopping in emerging markets, but many big retailers are facing the same problem," says Fetchr co-founder Idriss Al Rifai."How can you grow if you can't deliver large numbers of parcels?"The firm uses a customer's smartphone GPS location as the address.As soon as one of Fetchr's couriers has picked up a package from a retailer, it notifies the customer, offering them a two-hour delivery slot.The customer then shares their location with Fetchr."Fifteen minutes before the firm delivers, we will ask the customer to share their location again - and if they have moved elsewhere, that's fine," Mr Al Rifai says."Even when there is an address, people don't want to be pinned down for hours to receive a package."The firm, which employs 2,000 of its own couriers, serves brands such as supermarket chain Carrefour and Gucci, in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.It hopes to expand internationally, having raised $41m (31m) in investment in May, but will face competition from the likes of the UK's What3Words and South Africa's WumDrop, which are also addressing the "lack-of-address" issue.Image copyright Weengs Image caption Weengs collects retailers' goods, packs and delivers them Some start-ups, such as Red Stag Fulfilment in the US and UK-based Weengs, are offering one-stop-shop services aimed at taking the delivery hassle away from small businesses."Shipping companies expect you to have packed your items properly, have done an analysis of your shipping costs, and prepared your customs paperwork," explains Weengs co-founder Alex Christodoulou."But many small businesses don't have the expertise to do this efficiently - it costs time and money."Weengs manages the whole shipping process from end-to-end, collecting your items unboxed and packing them at its warehouse in Kings Cross, London."We then measure your item with a laser and create a box exactly fitting the dimensions of your goods," says Mr Christodoulou.This reduces costs because some delivery companies charge by volume, not weight, he says.Big retailers sending lots of parcels can often negotiate bulk discounts on delivery costs.Smaller retailers can't.So Weengs pools its customers' orders and shops around between 10 to 30 courier firms to bring down costs, says Mr Christodoulou.His firm has handled 200,000 orders since launch in 2015, but faces competition from more established comparison services, such as parcel2go.com."These firms are already re-distributing the share of delivery volume from traditional delivery companies to smaller ones and individuals," says e-commerce consultant Kunle Campbell."I think more delivery companies will adopt their approaches, and it could cut the costs of delivery across the board."That will be music to the ears of all e-commerce entrepreneurs.
How can you help your local online business go global?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Online shopping has become a $2.3tn global business In 1995, someone sold a broken laser pen for $14 on a site called AuctionWeb.This was the rather inauspicious start for online shopping, an activity that now generates a colossal $2.3tn (1.75tn) in global sales.But these days, shoppers want to pay in any number of ways and this can cause headaches for retailers wanting to expand abroad; so what should they do?Nigel Whiteoak is the co-founder of LoveCrafts, a virtual hub for knitting and crochet enthusiasts to share their creations and buy supplies.Having a website rather than a bricks-and-mortar shop meant the team could sell their wares to the world.But taking payments for these international sales wasn't proving straightforward."One of the biggest realisations we had when looking to expand was that credit card penetration is generally much lower in most markets outside the UK and US," he explains."In Germany, open invoices are very common where you process the payment using a third party, deliver the goods directly to the customer, and then they pay that third party once we have delivered their crafts.Image copyright LoveCrafts Image caption LoveCrafts founder Nigel Whiteoak says selling abroad has significantly boosted sales "Whereas in Brazil and Turkey they tend to use local credit cards and pay in instalments."These regional quirks were difficult to cater for.But then he came across a Dutch payment company, Adyen, whose payment processing platform harnesses machine learning to customise the payment method depending on which country the buyer is in.Adyen's clients include heavyweights such as Netflix, Uber and Spotify, so Mr Whiteoak was surprised to find out how affordable its service was, with a minimum monthly invoice of $100 (75) and transparent per-transaction processing and commission charges."Before we started selling outside of the UK we had a turnover of around 6.5m," he says."Last year we posted 10.9 million, and with the bulk of our sales coming from overseas, this growth is directly linked to our ability to offer local payment methods."Sales have grown 125% over the last three years, he says, proving that knitting and crochet is big business.Image copyright LoveCrafts Image caption LoveCrafts has found that people in different countries like to pay in different ways Payment difficulties contribute to about 15% of online shoppers abandoning their virtual shopping baskets before completing the purchase, research suggests.That and difficult-to-navigate, fiddly websites.Research from Barclaycard finds that while customers demand faster, more innovative and mobile-friendly ways to pay, the reality is one of declined cards, verification delays and annoying hidden transaction fees."Remove the need for consumers to set up an account first," advises Greg Liset, Barclaycard's head of small business, "and partner with suppliers that have reliable payment systems that work first time."Also, with online cross-border sales expected to soar over the next few years, being able to offer multiple currencies is essential."Knowing what payment options locals prefer is crucial to e-commerce success.Research from 2Checkout finds that in the US, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and American Express still dominate the payments landscape.But in other countries different favourite payment methods have emerged.For example, in China Alipay now accounts for 54% of online sales.In the Netherlands the iDEAL payment system is used for 44% of sales.In Japan, JCB and Konbini are popular.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Shoppers in different countries have their own favourite ways of paying But in India many shoppers still prefer paying in cash.So Indian start-up BookMyTrain is aiming to simplify the online purchase of rail tickets by offering a cash-on-delivery payment option with its app, as many people in India don't have payment cards.It is also using chatbots to take customers through the booking process one step at a time.Simon Johnson, general manager at software provider Freshworks, the firm providing the chatbots for BookMyTrain, says: "Most customers today use messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger because they like how you can keep a conversation going with whatever device they are using."You don't have to be a massive company to personalise the experience more effectively and [smaller] retailers need to have that personal touch to compete with big e-commerce players."Other payment platforms besides Adyen helping online retailers sell globally with tailored experiences include 2Checkout (formerly Avangate), PayU, PayPal, Stripe and Braintree.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Costs are usually transparent and related to sales volume.With PayPal, for example, retailers can expect to pay 2.9 % of the transaction value plus about 23p per order.Similarly, Stripe doesn't charge extra for accommodating different cards or currencies with a flat rate of 1.4% plus 20p per transaction.But selling abroad isn't just about offering flexibility over ways to pay and support for multiple currencies, it's also about understanding local customs and cultures, argues Nir Debbi, co-founder of e-commerce platform Global-e. "A common pitfall for businesses marketing themselves abroad is a lack of awareness of the different cultural phenomena," says Mr Debbi.Planning for international shopping events such as Singles Day in China or Japan's "lucky shopping bags" at New Year "can improve international conversion rates dramatically", he says, "but you need the insight, local knowledge and access to these sales peaks to be able to plan and apply an appropriate strategy."Later in this e-commerce series we'll explore the best ways for online businesses to market themselves.
How do you build the next-generation internet?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Scientists are now developing an ultra-fast quantum internet that will be partly based on light Imagine super-fast computers that can solve problems much quicker than machines today.These "quantum computers" are being developed in laboratories around the world.But scientists have already taken the next step, and are thinking about a light-based quantum internet that will have to be just as fast.It's not easy to develop technology for a device that hasn't technically been invented yet, but quantum communications is an attractive field of research because the technology will enable us to send messages that are much more secure.There are several problems that will need to be solved in order to make a quantum internet possible: Getting quantum computers to talk to each other Making communications secure from hacking Transmitting messages over long distances without losing parts of the message; and Routing messages across a quantum network What is a quantum computer?A quantum computer is a machine that is able to crack very tough computation problems with incredible speed - beyond that of today's "classical" computers.In conventional computers, the unit of information is called a "bit" and can have a value of either 1 or 0.But its equivalent in a quantum system - the qubit (quantum bit) - can be both 1 and 0 at the same time.This phenomenon opens the door for multiple calculations to be performed simultaneously.However, qubits need to be synchronised using a quantum effect known as entanglement, which Albert Einstein termed "spooky action at a distance".There are four types of quantum computers currently being developed, which use: Light particles Trapped ions Superconducting qubits Nitrogen vacancy centres in diamonds Quantum computers will enable a multitude of useful applications, such as being able to model many variations of a chemical reaction to discover new medications; developing new imaging technologies for healthcare to better detect problems in the body; or to speed up how we design batteries, new materials and flexible electronics.Pooling computing power Quantum computers might be more powerful than classical computers, but some applications will require even more computing power than one quantum computer can provide on its own.If you can get quantum devices to talk to each other, then you could connect several quantum computers together and pool their power to form one huge quantum computer.However, since there are four different types of quantum computers being built today, they won't be all be able to talk to each other without some help.Some scientists favour a quantum internet based entirely on light particles (photons), while others believe that it would be easier to make quantum networks where light interacts with matter."Light is better for communications, but matter qubits are better for processing," Joseph Fitzsimons, a principal investigator at the National University of Singapore's Centre of Quantum Technologies tells the BBC."You need both to make the network work to establish error correction of the signal, but it can be difficult to make them interact."It is very expensive and difficult to store all information in photons, Mr Fitzsimons says, because photons can't see each other and pass straight by, rather than bouncing off each other.Instead, he believes it would be easier to use light for communications, while storing information using electrons or atoms (in matter).Quantum encryption Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Quantum encryption will make communications much more secure One of the key applications of the quantum internet will be quantum key distribution (QKD), whereby a secret key is generated using a pair of entangled photons, and is then used to encrypt information in a way that is impossible for a quantum computer to crack.This technology already exists, and was first demonstrated in space by a team of researchers from the National University of Singapore and the University of Strathclyde, UK, in December 2015.But it's not just the encryption that we will need to build in order to secure our information in the quantum future.Scientists are also working on "blind quantum computer protocols", because they allow the user to hide anything they want on a computer."You can write something, send it to a remote computer and the person who owns the computer can't tell anything about it at all except how long it took to run and how much memory it used," says Mr Fitzsimons."This is important because there likely won't be many quantum computers when they first appear, so people will want to remotely run programs on them, the way we do today in the cloud."There are two different approaches to building quantum networks - a land-based network and a space-based network.Both methods work well for sending regular bits of data across the internet today, but if we want to send data as qubits in the future, it is much more complicated.To send particles of light (photons), we can use fibre optic cables in the ground.However, the light signal deteriorates over long distances (a phenomenon known as "decoherence"), because fibre optics cables sometimes absorb photons.It is possible to get around this by building "repeater stations" every 50km.These would essentially be miniature quantum laboratories that would try to repair the signal before sending it on to the next node in the network.But this system would come with its own complexities.Land or space?Image copyright Johannes Handsteiner / AW Image caption Artwork: a ground station beams a message contained in a light signal up to the Micius satellite Then there are space-based networks.Let's say you want to send a message from the UK to a friend in Australia.The light signal is beamed up from a ground station in the UK, to a satellite with a light source mounted on it.The satellite sends the light signal to another satellite, which then beams the signal down to a ground station in Australia, and then the message can be transmitted over a ground-based quantum network or classical internet network to the other party."Because there's no air between the satellites, there's nothing to degrade the signal," says Dr Jamie Vicary, a senior research fellow at Oxford University's department of computer science and a member of the Networked Quantum Information Technologies Hub (NQIT)."If we want to have a really global-scale quantum internet, it looks like a space-based solution is the only way that will work, but it's the most expensive."Quantum teleportation via space has been conducted successfully, and scientists are currently vying to demonstrate longer and longer distances.Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences generated headlines in June when they succeeded in teleporting entangled photons between two towns in China located 1,200km apart.They used a specially developed quantum satellite called Micius.The same Chinese scientists recently topped their own record on 29 September, by demonstrating the world's first intercontinental video call protected by a quantum key with researchers at the Austrian Academy of Sciences - over a distance of 7,700km.The call lasted for 20 minutes and the parties were able to exchange encrypted pictures of the Micius satellite and Austrian physicist Erwin Schrdinger.Rupert Ursin, senior group leader at the Austrian Academy of Sciences' Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information believes the quantum internet will need land-based and space-based networks to operate in parallel."In the cities, we need a fibre network, but long haul connections will be covered by satellite links," he explains.How does quantum key distribution work?Image copyright AW Image caption The video call between Austrian and Chinese scientists on 29 September 2017 To understand how QKD works, let's go back to the video call made between the Austrian and Chinese scientists.The Micius satellite used its light source to establish optical links with the ground stations in Austria and the ground stations in China.It was then able to generate a quantum key.The great thing about quantum encryption is you can detect whether someone has tried to intercept the message before it got to you, and how many people tried to access it.Micius was able to tell that the encryption was secure and no one was eavesdropping on the video call.It then gave the go ahead to encrypt the data using the secret key and transmit it over a public internet channel.Routing messages Multiple groups of scientists are developing land-based networks by working on the technologies for quantum repeater stations, which are located every 50km, connected by fibre optic cables.These repeater stations, also known as "quantum network nodes", will need to perform several actions in order to route, or direct, messages around the network.First, each node needs to repair and boost the signal that was damaged from the previous 50km stretch of the network.Imagine that you're using an old fax machine to send a one-page document to someone else, and each time you send the page, a different part of the message is missing, and the other party has to piece the message together from all the failed attempts.This is similar to how a single message may have to be sent between different nodes on a quantum network.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fibre optic cables will be used for land-based quantum networks There will be many people on the network, all trying to talk to each other.So the node, or repeater station, will also have to figure out how to distribute its available computing power in order to piece together all the messages being sent.It will also have to send messages between the quantum internet and the classical internet.The University of Delft is building a quantum network using nitrogen vacancies in diamonds, and it has so far shown the ability to store and distribute the links needed for quantum communications over quite large distances.The University of Oxford and the University of Maryland are both currently building quantum computers that work in a similar way to a network.Their quantum computers consist of trapped ion nodes that have been networked together to talk to each other.The bigger the computer you want, the more nodes you have to add, but this type of quantum computer only transmits data over a short distance."We want to make them small so they can be well-protected from decoherence, but if they're small then they can't hold many qubits," says Dr Vicary."If we connect the nodes up in a network, then we can still have a quantum computer without being limited by the number of qubits, while still protecting the nodes."Quantum memory The repeater station will also need to have a quantum memory chip.The nodes create "links", which consist of entangled pairs of light particles.These entangled pairs are prepared in advance.While the node calculates the route across the network that the message will need to take, it needs to store the entangled pair of photons somewhere safe, so a quantum memory chip is needed.It has to be able to store the photons for as long as possible.Image copyright Stuart Hay, ANU Image caption Dr Rose Ahlefeldt and associate professor Matthew Sellars operate a high-resolution dye laser to study rare earth crystals at ANU Researchers from the Australian National University (ANU) have developed a telecom-compatible quantum memory chip using an erbium-doped crystal.This device is able to store light in the right colour and it is able to do so for longer than one second, which is 10,000 times longer than all other attempts so far."The biggest challenge is now to demonstrate a quantum memory with a large data storage capacity," associate professor Matthew Sellars, program manager in the Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology (CQC2T) at ANU tells the BBC."It will be the memory's storage capacity that will limit the data transmission rate through the network."I think it will take about five years before the technology [for the quantum internet] is practical."
'Tell me phone, what's destroying my crops?':::::Image copyright Peat Image caption Voruganti Surendra says farmers are finding pest and disease recognition apps "very useful" India's farmers have never had it easy; drought, crop failure, low market prices and lack of modernisation have taken their toll on the nation's population, about half of whom work in agriculture.Every year thousands of farmers take their own lives.So can crop management apps help?Voruganti Surendra is a farmer who grows paddy rice on an acre of farmland in Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh.He and hundreds of his fellow farmers are using a new app that can recognise a growing number of crop pests and diseases and give advice on how to treat them."It is very useful," he says."Farmers need it."The app, called Plantix, was developed thousands of miles away in Berlin, Germany, by a group of graduate students and scientists who came together to help farmers combat disease, pest damage and nutrient deficiency in their crops."It was really important for us to understand what farmers wanted," says Charlotte Schumann, co-founder of Peat (Progressive Environmental & Agricultural Technologies) the company behind the app, "so we did a lot of groundwork in India".Image caption Peat boss Simone Strey (left) and co-founder Charlotte Schumann created the Plantix app After months criss-crossing this vast country by train, conducting research in rural areas, the team concluded that a diagnostics app featuring image recognition would help farmers most, especially since smartphone prices were falling to affordable levels."The smartphones gave many of them access to the internet for the first time," says Ms Schumann.There are 500 or so farmers in Mr Surendra's village of Karlapalem in Bapatla Mandal, growing rice, maize, cotton, banana, chilli and a host of other crops.While just 20 own their own smartphones, these lucky few share them so that their fellow farmers can take photos of their crops and upload the images to the app.The farmer photographs the damaged crop and the app identifies the likely pest or disease by applying machine learning to its growing database of images.Not only can Plantix recognise a range of crop diseases, such as potassium deficiency in a tomato plant, rust on wheat, or nutrient deficiency in a banana plant, but it is also able to analyse the results, draw conclusions, and offer advice.Image copyright Peat Image caption The app can recognise different types of pest damage and suggest treatments These abilities rely on deep neural networks, or DNNs, which processes information in a way similar to how biological nervous systems operate."It works a bit like the human brain," says Peat's chief executive, Simone Strey.Initially, or if the image recognition software gets confused, pathologists and other experts will provide information about what the app is looking at."Obviously, it needs some backup from human experts," says Ms Strey.The app had to be multi-lingual because "the farmers often use different names for crop diseases than those used by scientists", she says."And if the farmers don't know the scientific name, they won't be able to search for solutions online."It is currently available in Hindi, Telugu and English in India, and in five other languages for use in other countries.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption About half of India's 1.3 billion people work in agriculture But Peat is not the only firm developing smartphone apps to help farmers.In Africa, for instance, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research - a body dedicated to food security - has just won a $100,000 (76,000) award to expand its research and bring a similar app to farmers across the continent.David Hughes of Penn State, who co-leads the project, describes it as "transformative" and says they "can amplify by 100 times what we have achieved so far".In fact, the number of digital helpers that can fit in farmers' pockets has grown dramatically in recent years.They include fertiliser firm Yara's ImageIT app, which uses photos to measure nitrogen uptake in a crop and offer recommendations to farmers.University of Missouri's ID Weeds app helps farmers identify unwanted plants.And John Deere's GrainTruckPlus app helps with grain harvesting storage and fleet logistics.Then there's PotashCorp's return-on-investment calculator, called eKonomics, and AgVault 2.0 Mobile's Sentera app, which controls drones that can systematically film entire fields autonomously and feed back the footage for analysis.Image copyright Yara Image caption Yara's ImageIT app aims to measure the nitrogen content in plants "Technological innovations play a very important role," says Harsimrat Kaur Badal, India's Minister of Food Processing Industries, in reducing waste, improving hygiene, creating jobs, and addressing "farmers' distress".Krishna Kumar, chief executive of CropIn Technology, a data-driven farming company, believes agricultural "start-ups [will] innovate fast and change every aspect of the industry".While such apps are practically useful to farmers now, it is the data they collect that is potentially more useful in the longer term, argues Peat's Ms Strey."Each farmer represents a data point, and it's really the data set that's valuable.Research on this scale in this field hasn't been done before by any global research organisation."This is why farmers don't usually have to pay to use such apps."If you want to collect data, you don't make the users pay," says Ms Strey.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Peat's database currently contains some 1.5 million images - up from 100,000 a year ago, with 80% of its 300,000 to 400,000 users currently in India.Geo-tagging offers insight into which plants are grown where, and whether or not they are healthy.Apps can record the weather, too, and build up a picture of the climatic conditions.Such knowledge is valuable not just to the farmers themselves but also to producers of fertilisers or pesticides, to the food industry which wants to source crops, and to governments keen to see the bigger picture in their countries.As such, the challenge, according to CropIn Technology's Mr Kumar, is not merely to gather the data, but to "make sense of it and present it as actionable insights to agri businesses".

curling up on your memory foam mattress and fluffy pillows - consider this: you could be helping to reduce climate change.This is because CO2 can now be captured from the air and stored in a range of everyday items in your home and on the street.It can be used to make plastics for a whole host of things: the insulation in your fridge-freezer; the paint on your car; the soles of your shoes; and the binding of that new book you haven't read yet.Even the concrete your street is made of could contain captured CO2.UK-based Econic Technologies has invented a way of encouraging CO2 - a typically unreactive gas - to react with the petrochemical raw materials used in the making of many plastics.In this catalysed form, the CO2 can make up to 50% of the ingredients needed for making plastic.And recycling existing CO2 in this way reduces the amount of new CO2 emissions usually resulting from the process."Our aim is that by 2026, the technology will be used to make at least 30% of the polyols [the units making up plastic] made globally, and that would reduce CO2 emission by 3.5 million tonnes each year," explains Rowena Sellens, chief executive of Econic Technologies."This is equivalent to taking more than two million cars off the road."Image copyright CarbonCure Image caption CarbonCure's Robert Niven thinks his firm's concrete is far more environmentally friendly The company is currently working with partners in industry to introduce its technology to market.Canadian company CarbonCure Technologies is recycling CO2 and putting it into concrete.CarbonCure takes waste CO2 from industrial emitters - such as fertiliser producers - and injects controlled doses of the liquid gas directly into the concrete truck or mixer.The reaction that takes place creates calcium carbonate particles that become permanently bound within the concrete - and make the concrete up to 20% stronger.Today, CarbonCure's technology is installed in more than 60 concrete plants across Canada and the US, supplying hundreds of construction projects.Another company, Carbon Engineering, captures CO2 and uses it to make diesel and jet fuel.While Carbon Clean Solutions, in the Indian port of Tuticorin, captures CO2 from a coal-fired power plant and turns it into soda ash (sodium carbonate), an ingredient in fertilisers, synthetic detergents and dyes.But will such carbon capture efforts really make much difference?Simply put, levels of "greenhouse gases" - CO2, methane and nitrous oxide are the main ones - have been rising rapidly because we've been burning fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - to make electricity and power our transportation, amongst other human activities.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Should we be reducing the amount of CO2 used in making plastics, or simply using less plastic?At the 2015 Paris climate conference, 195 countries agreed to try to keep global temperatures to within 2C of pre-industrial times by reducing emissions.But to achieve this target by 2030, the world needs to cut emissions - CO2 accounts for about 70% - by 12 to 14 gigatonnes per year, says John Christensen, director of a partnership between the UN Environment Programme and the Technical University of Denmark.A gigatonne is a billion tonnes.Econic, by contrast, hopes that by 2026, its technology will be responsible for reducing CO2 emissions by 3.5 million tonnes each year.And CarbonCure has demonstrated that its technology can help a typical medium-sized concrete producer reduce CO2 emissions by 900 tonnes a year.Globally, the concrete industry could reduce CO2 emissions by more than 700 million tonnes a year, the company believes."It's great to have these options coming up," says Mr Christensen, "but there's no silver bullet, no single solution."Image copyright Ashley Cooper Image caption Greenpeace's Doug Parr thinks renewable energy is a better way to reduce CO2 emissions Environmentalists are also concerned that such carbon capture technologies merely delay the fundamental shift society needs to make to become a low-carbon economy.A plastics factory producing less CO2 is still environmentally unfriendly, the argument goes."Research into new technologies and approaches that can help reduce carbon emissions is vital, but it must not become an excuse to delay action on tackling the root of the problem - our dependence on fossil fuels," says Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK."A process that appears to reduce emissions or increase efficiency can lock us into maintaining industries that could be replaced with much greener options."In addition, Mr Christensen points out that these carbon capture technologies tend to be very costly because they are so small-scale.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "The advances are positive but it's far from what is needed," he argues.Another challenge is what to do with the recycled carbon.Some have suggested burying it in the ground or deep under the ocean, but the consequences of this are not fully understood.So it's better to reduce the amount of emissions we produce in the first place through increased use of renewable energies, such as wind, hydro and solar power, environmentalists argue.This could reduce emissions by up to 50% of the amount needed."Use all the technologies available to bend the [emissions] curve down.Then carbon capture can come in," says Mr Christensen."It could have an important role to play."
