Trump slams Michael Moore for Broadway 'bomb':::::President Donald Trump has mocked left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore, tweeting Saturday that the director's one-man Broadway show was "a TOTAL BOMB".Moore, the director of several documentaries including "Roger and Me," "Bowling for Columbine," and "Farenheit 9/11," responded later Saturday with a tweet of his own.Moore's show, "The Terms of My Surrender," ended its 13-week run Oct. 22.The website BroadwayWorld.com reported that it took in $4.2 million at the box office, less than half of its potential take.The show, which combined Moore's autobiography with calls for political action against Trump and other Republicans, was a critical disappointment as well.The New York Times described "Terms of My Surrender" as "shaggy and self-aggrandizing.""You dont have to disagree with Mr. Moores politics to find that his shtick has become disagreeable with age," wrote reviewer Jesse Green, who compared the show to "being stuck at Thanksgiving dinner with a garrulous, self-regarding, time-sucking uncle."Moore has been an outspoken critic of Trump.In August, Moore led the show's audience to Trump Tower to protest the president's reaction to deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. That same night, he compared the president's supporters to accomplices in a rape during an interview with CNN."If you hold down the woman while the rapist is raping her, and you didn't rape her, are you a rapist?"Moore said at the time."Let's cut the BS and start speaking honestly."This week, Moore told the Wall Street Journal in an email that the show was "the most artistically gratifying experience of my life" and said there were "talks happening about taking this show on the road."The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Mark Halperin: 'I apologize sincerely to the women I mistreated':::::Political journalist Mark Halperin released a letter of apology Friday evening from his Twitter account following the bombshell sexual harassment allegations against him while he was employed with ABC News.Halperin, 52, who left his positions at MSNBC and NBC following the allegations this week, wrote that he felt profound guilt and responsibility for his conduct.I am profoundly sorry for the pain and anguish I have caused by my past actions, Halperin wrote.I apologize sincerely to the women I mistreated.MARK HALPERIN OUT AT NBC, MSNBC AND HBO AMID SEX ASSAULT ACCUSATIONS Halperin continued that he was aware he was part of the problem at ABC News and recognized that he had a problem.No one had sued me, no one had filed a human resources complaint against me, no colleague had confronted me.But I didnt need a call from HR (human resources) to know that I was a selfish, immature person, who was behaving in a manner that had to stop, Halperin wrote.Halperin said he went to counseling to work on his issues and he did not engage in the same behavior while he was employed at Time, Bloomberg, NBC News and Showtime.MARK HALPERIN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BY TWO MORE WOMEN Halperins apology was released near the time CNN, which first published a report Wednesday detailing the sexual harassment allegations, came out with another article of four more women coming forward with new accusations, The Washington Post reported.CNN reported one woman claimed Halperin masturbated in front of her while another woman said the Game Change co-author threw her against a restaurant window and threatened to derail her career after she rebuffed him.Some of the allegations against him claim that, while working at ABC News, he grabbed a womans breasts without consent and pressed his clothed and erect penis against three of his co-workers.Several employees suggested that his behavior was common knowledge, including former ABC correspondent Clarissa Ward who described it as an open secret.Following the allegations, Penguin Press canceled a planned book by Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2016 election and HBO called off a miniseries that would have been based on the book.Halperin and Heilemann had collaborated on two previous books, including "Game Change," a best-seller about the 2008 race that almost single-handedly revived the campaign book genre and was the basis for an award-winning HBO adaptation.Halperin joins the list of powerful men who have been accused of sexual misconduct in various industries in recent weeks.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

New Harvey Weinstein sexual assault accusations emerge:::::New allegations from at least two actresses came out Friday alleging sexual assault by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.In a story by the New Yorker, actress Annabella Sciorra claims that Weinstein violently raped her, and actress Daryl Hannah says her career suffered after encounters with Weinstein.In the early 1990s, Sciorra alleged that after dropping her off from a party, Weinstein went uninvited into her apartment and proceeded to start undressing himself as he walked around.He shoved me onto the bed, and he got on top of me.I kicked and I yelled, she said.Weinstein reportedly then held her arms up and forced her to have sex with him."He shoved me onto the bed, and he got on top of me.I kicked and I yelled."- Actress Annabella Sciorra, describing an encounter with Harvey Weinstein When he was done, he ejaculated on my leg, and on my nightgown.He said, I have impeccable timing, and then he said, This is for you, she told the magazine.HARVEY WEINSTEIN SEX SCANDAL: DETAILING THE ALLEGATIONS And then he attempted to perform oral sex on me.And I struggled, but I had very little strength left in me.Weinstein eventually left her after she began compulsively shaking, she said.Sciorra told the New Yorker that she never told anyone what happened, including the police, saying that she felt so ashamed and disgusting.In 1997, Sciorra recalled another encounter with Weinstein during which they had neighboring hotel rooms.She said he knocked on her door early one morning and she opened it without thinking.Theres Harvey in his underwear, holding a bottle of baby oil in one hand and a tape, a movie, in the other, she said.And it was horrific, because I'd been there before.Sciorra, 57, has had film roles in "Jungle Fever" and "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle," and also appeared on HBO's "The Sopranos."ROSE MCGOWAN TO MAKE FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE SINCE WEINSTEIN ACCUSATIONS Hannah said that when she first met Weinstein, she didnt know about his reputation.So when he asked her hotel room number to schedule a meeting, she didnt think much of it.Later she heard incessant knocking on her hotel room door.She said she got so scared she eventually snuck out the back.The following day, the knocking began again, the report said.The knocking started again and again.And I was like, oh s---, Hannah recalled.We actually pushed a dresser in front of the door and just kind of huddled in the room.HARVEY WEINSTEIN ACCUSED OF RAPE BY ACTRESS NATASSIA MALTHE Several years later, Hannah allegedly encountered Weinstein again when he somehow got a key to her hotel room and let himself in.He came through the living room and into the bedroom.He just burst in like a raging bull, she told the New Yorker.And I know with every fiber of my being that if my male makeup artist was not in that room, things would not have gone well.It was scary.Weinstein reportedly tried to get her to leave and go to a party with him downstairs.When she eventually got dressed, she said the party room was completely empty.As a result of her encounters, Hannah told the New Yorker that her career suffered substantially.And when she told people what happened, it didnt help.I did tell people about it, she said.And it didnt matter.Hannah, 56, has had roles in "Blade Runner, "Wall Street," and "Steel Magnolias."
Mark Halperin accused of sexual assault by two more women:::::The latest accusations of sexual assault against journalist Mark Halperin came Friday from a former college student and a journalist, who was seeking a job when she met him.Halperin, who until recently worked for NBC and MSNBC as an analyst, has been accused by several women of alleged sexual assault.Some of the allegations against him claim that, while working at ABC News, he grabbed a womans breasts without consent and pressed his clothed and erect penis against three of his co-workers.Several employees suggested that his behavior was common knowledge, including former ABC correspondent Clarissa Ward who described it as an open secret.Halperin later apologized for his behavior and claimed that it ended after he resigned from the company.But one woman who interacted with him while she was in college told The Daily Beast a different story.MARK HALPERIN OUT AT NBC, MSNBC AND HBO AMID SEXUAL ASSAULT ACCUSATIONS Katharine Glenn, who was then a junior at Tulane University, reportedly met Halperin while he was a guest speaker at the school in February 2011.Glenn told The Daily Beast that she and Halperin were seated next to each other at the table and he got very friendly and put his hand on my upper thigh.[He] was talking to me about helping me with my career, and that I shouldnt go to law school and should come to D.C. and be a journalist or work on the Hill, Glenn said.He offered that I should come back to his hotel room [that night] so we could talk more about my career and at no point did I think that is what he meant, and the touching under the table did not suggest that, either.Glenn described his alleged behavior as lecherous and gross, especially considering his age, The Daily Beast reported.While she said she was not at the time afraid of Halperin, she wanted to tell her story to make sure he never gets near [female] college students ever again.MARK HALPERIN ACCUSATIONS: FORMER ABC EMPLOYEES INSIST THE NETWORK KNEW ABOUT ALLEGATION Halperin also allegedly made inappropriate sexual advances on two other students during his time at the university, during one of which an adjunct professor reportedly intervened, according to people there at the time.On a separate occasion, an unnamed woman claimed that she was following up with Halperin in regards to a job on the 1996 campaign trail, The Daily Beast reported.In the exchange, she alleged Halperin invited her to meet him at his hotel room.Not at the hotel, it was specifically in my hotel room, the woman explained.She said she pretended to not get what he was insinuating and replied, Why do you want to meet me in a hotel room?The woman said he didnt answer and she did not get the job.He knew how valuable these jobs were and used his position to pimp for himself.
Alejandro Iñárritu, 'Revenant' director, to receive special Oscar for virtual reality installation:::::An Academy Award-winning Hollywood director will receive a special Oscar for his virtual reality installation focused on the travels of refugees and immigrants, the Academys board of governors announced Friday.Alejandro Irritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki will receive a special Oscar for CARNE Y ARENA, a virtual reality installation in recognition of a visionary and powerful experience in storytelling, the board said.ASHLEY JUDD SAYS SHE FEARED WEINSTEIN WOULD RAPE HER SO SHE MADE A DEAL WITH HIM Currently on display at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), CARNE Y ARENA tells the story of immigrants and refugees as they make their way across the American southwest desert.In the six and a half minute experience, the superficial lines between subject and bystander are blurred and bound together, allowing individuals to walk in a vast space and thoroughly live a fragment of the refugees personal journeys, according to the LACMAs website.Irritu said he met with Mexican and Central American refugees who helped him create the backbone of the project.SEX AND THE CITY STAR KIRSTIN DAVIS GIVES HOPE FOR A THIRD MOVIE My intention was to experiment with VR technology to explore the human condition in an attempt to break the dictatorship of the frame, within which things are just observed, and claim the space to allow the visitor to go through a direct experience walking in the immigrants feet, under their skin, and into their hearts, Irritu said on the site.Irritu is best known for directing movies like Birdman and The Revenant, the latter of which nabbed him an award for best director in 2016.The award will reportedly be presented at the Academys 9th Annual Governors Awards on Nov. 11.

Megan Fox's 'lowest point' in her career was when she was fired by Michael Bay:::::Megan Fox felt like a martyr when Michael Bay fired her from the third installment of Transformers.Fox, 31, got the boot from the franchise after claiming the filmmaker wants to be like Hitler on his sets in an interview with Wonderland magazine in 2009.That was absolutely the low point of my career, Fox told Cosmopolitan UKs November issue.But without that thing I wouldnt have learned as quickly as I did.All I had to do was apologize and I refused.I was so self-righteous at 23, I couldnt see [that] it was for the greater good.I really thought I was Joan of Arc.It hurt me and a lot of other people, she continued.However, that darkness that descended caused enormous and brisk spiritual growth.Once I realized I [had] brought it on myself, it was an invaluable learning experience, looking back on it.The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles star isnt too enthusiastic about many of her movie offers, in part because they dont line up with her feminist beliefs.Im not going to be an actress forever.Ive always known I have another calling, she said.I still get offered a lot of genius strippers and funny escorts by guys in the business, but I dont want to be involved with something genuinely degrading or that [which] encourages negative sexual ideals about women.Old-school male attitudes towards women its still in all the [advertising] When my kids grow up, hopefully that attitude will be gone.Still, the lingerie model admits that she understands some of the motivations behind Hollywoods objectification of women.Im not ashamed of sexy poses or parts.Its just a biological fact: sex does sell.But I wish it was more gender equal, she explained.Im happy to buy some sex, too.Its not wrong, it just needs to go both ways.Women shouldnt have to carry the burden.And I think we have so far.A post shared by Megan Fox (@the_native_tiger) on Sep 11, 2017 at 7:27pm PDT The mom of three also opened up about her marriage to Brian Austin Green, from whom she filed for divorce in 2015, but reconciled with less than a year later when she became pregnant with their third son.If you want it to last, you just have to stick it out, she said of her tumultuous marriage to the former 90210 star.I know my karma isnt done.And so were in it until the universe releases us.Were not completely in control of it.And he is a hunk.This article originally appeared in the New York Post.
Joy Villa mulls a run for Congress: What to know about the pro-Trump singer:::::Move over, Kid Rock: Pro-Donald Trump singer and performer Joy Villa may be entering the world of politics.Villa, who famously wore a Trump-themed dress to the 2017 Grammy Awards, announced on Fox and Friends Friday morning that shes considering a run for Congress.If I run, Im going to win, she said, adding that shes looking at Florida, California or New York because those are places I live and work and have grown up in.Villa, 26, said she would focus on tax reform, legal immigration and helping American families -- much like the president's current platform.Villa said current congresswomen like Maxine Waters, D-Calif., Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., are ruining this country and its time we have strong women who step up, run, win and support the president.Villa also said she would be running as an outsider, but definitely running as a Republican.Shortly after her announcement, President Trump tweeted his support.Villa is now asking fans for donations as shes testing the waters.But before she officially runs for Congress, heres what you should know about the singer.Who is she?Villa, who was born in Burbank, Calif., is a recording artist who was relatively unknown before she rocked her Make America Great Again"-themed dress at the Grammys.Shortly after, her EP I Make the Static jumped to the No.1 spot on iTunes and Amazon, beating out well-known artists like Beyonc, Adele and Lady Gaga.Additionally, her Twitter followers increased by 11,000 following her debut at the Grammys, according to Quartz.Villas interest in music and theater sparked when she was just 5 years old, according to her website.Her music is a blend of alternative rock, soul and pop.Villas father was Italian and her mother is African-American and Choctaw.Villa grew up as a Pastors kid, according to her website.Her father, the late Joseph Villa, was a reverend and her mother, Angela Villa, sang gospel.Her mixed life helped to shape her unique perspectives on politics, society, education and Black American culture, according to her website.In addition to being a musician, Villa is also a vegan health coach, model and author, and a scientologist -- a decision she made after going through a hard time.Now, I feel like theres nothing I cant tackle, Villa said in the video that details her decision to become a scientologist.Scientology gave me tools to survive, tools to create, and thats what I feel like -- a creative person who is full of power and there is no stopping me.What about her support for Trump?Villa, who describes herself as an unabashed Conservative and Trump supporter was appointed to the presidents Campaign Advisory Board -- a part of Trumps 2020 campaign which is run by Lara Trump.Shes also been a distinguished speaker at a GOP event in Tucson.Villa, a Republican Millennial, according to her website, speaks proudly on topics ranging from Trump's policies and actions to the current social climate in pop culture and Hollywood, as well as race relations as a conservative woman of color.She has also tweeted that shes pro-life, pro-Trump, and supports tax reform, religious freedom and the Constitution.During an interview in February, Villa told Fox Business that she and a lot of her friends voted for Trump in the 2016 election.We felt like we had to be closeted, we had to be quiet about it or we would face a backlash and bullying, and I just got tired of the narrative of hate.You know, youre a racist, youre a bigot, youre this, youre that -- people losing jobs, all because they voted for our now elected president, Villa told Maria Bartiromo.Its currently unclear when Villa would run.In the meantime, she has another album coming out in January and plans on returning to the Grammys this year, she said Friday.
Review: Onstage Jay-Z Forgoes Distractions, Drilling Down to the Message:::::Thats how they look at you, Jay-Z said.Thats exactly how they feel about you.So much of 4:44 is about the power and urgency of black economic self-sufficiency, and Jay-Zs conversational asides only spotlighted it more intensely.But though its among his strongest work in the last decade, 4:44 hasnt generated a true breakout hit.It is an album of warm, gentle gestures, not easily translatable to a large space.The moments where he performed songs from the new album were the quietest here.These songs gain their power from close attention, not ecstatic release, and would benefit from a more intimate setting.(This show did not appear to be sold out, with many seats in the upper level empty throughout the night.Also, on Friday, a concert scheduled for early November in Fresno was canceled; The Fresno Bee speculated it was because of slow ticket sales.)Moonlight and Caught Their Eyes were unbalanced and muddy, and much of the detail of Marcy Me felt flattened.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Louder Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.Often in the past, Jay-Z would end his concerts with an extended musical outro during which he scanned the crowd and shouted out individual fans.It was a way to make an impossibly grand night feel small.Here, he achieved that effect, though perhaps inadvertently, by different means.He closed his set with Smile, one of the most serene productions on his new album.No drums!No drums!he told his band, as he began rapping.The mood was mellow, the room was decelerating.After the first verse, Jay-Z looked around and snickered, I have no idea how to get off this stage.After a few seconds, he sorted it out, descending into one of the pits, but decided to stand there and rap for a moment.Then he walked out of the pit and into the crowd, rapping all the way to the exit as hundreds thronged around him.
Review: All Life’s a Swirling Proscenium in ‘The Red Shoes’:::::Smooth flow and swirling action are also the strengths of Mr. Bournes choreography and direction.This production moves.But besides the set, its chief cleverness lies in its choice of music, a collage clipped from various film scores by Bernard Herrmann.Its the sound of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Alfred Hitchcock, of high anxiety and romantic melodrama, with string sections desperately scaling musical cliffs and orchestral waves crashing.Photo The deftness with which Mr. Bourne (aided by the arranger Terry Davies) makes Herrmanns musical moods and cues serve his story gives sustained delight.The shoe keeps fitting.The productions achievements, though, are tangled up with its flaws.Crucial plot points can get lost in the bustle and detail.And Mr. Bournes push for efficiency making a dance number work both as period flavor and plot advancement, quickly slipping in a dramatic turning point in the middle of something else can shortchange or skirt character motivation and decision making.Mr. Bourne is a master of surface style, and the abundance and variety of pastiche dance from the stiff, hoppy ridiculousness of aristocrats to awful music hall numbers to an ample survey of between-the-wars ballet is another pleasure, especially for connoisseurs.Yet all this affectionate parody leaves him without much of a straight mode.The anguished danced monologues share the atmosphere of parody.Photo Meanwhile, the story has been streamlined and simplified, transformed into a standard love triangle.The tension in the film between Lermontovs personal involvement and his principled objection to a ballerinas marrying is absent.So is his religious devotion to ballet.Admittedly, these are difficult layers to convey without dialogue, but when Mr. Bourne has Lermontov moon over a statue of a shoe, the spiritual pursuit of beauty has been reduced to a foot fetish.The shows conception of Lermontov is characteristic of its swerving from the challenge of the films indelible performances.Anton Walbrooks flamboyant portrayal of the impresario is, along with the saturated colors, the movies greatest glory.Sam Archer, who plays Lermontov in every New York performance of Mr. Bournes show, is dashing but subdued, buttoned-up British instead of larger-than-life Russian.Despite Mr. Bournes tidying, he doesnt take the opportunity to flesh out the love story between Vicky and Julian.As in the movie, it basically comes out of nowhere, though the thinness is more of a problem without a complicated Lermontov.Mr. Gomes, imparting Julian with his usual warmth and charisma, helped, but couldnt redeem the roles histrionic conducting.Ms. Mearns, out of her usual element, fit in fine, her sense of drama proving equal to the roles acting demands, her performance only a tiny bit rougher than that of the first-cast Vicky, Ashley Shaw.(Ms. Mearns and Mr. Gomes, by the way, make an excellent couple: Company directors and casting agents take note.)Where Mr. Bournes show most successfully breaks free of the original is in the Red Shoes ballet, the allegorical work that Lermontov and Julian make for Vicky.In a reverse homage to the movies surreal colors, Mr. Brotherston sticks to black and white and gray, and Mr. Bournes choreography finds its own stylized nightmare.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As for the rest, it can feel as conflicted as Vicky, not sure what movie it wants to be.Mr. Brotherstons rotating set adroitly mixes up performance and rehearsal, art and life.When it stops spinning, it leaves you impressed and a little dizzy and not very moved.
Review: If You See One Opera This Year, Make It ‘The Exterminating Angel’:::::In a way, this production dares to confront audience members in the moment.Are we somehow complicit when we encounter art in a safe, gilded house?Or, in fact, can grappling with the arts, including this powerful opera, be a way to take action and exert will?Photo In this audacious opera for which Tom Cairns, the director of the production, wrote the libretto in collaboration with Mr. Ads the music digs deep.Mr. Adss wild, searing score explores the emotional undercurrents of the story and fleshes out the horror of the characters situation.My one reservation about the opera when I first heard it was that to some degree, Mr. Ads explored the dark side of Buuels tale, which has been seen as a bitter critique of elite classes during Francos regime in Spain, at the expense of its bizarrely comic elements.But after hearing it at the Met, I feel different.Mr. Adss thorny, modernist music, played with crackling precision and color by the orchestra, bristled with manic, almost madcap, energy.Take the crucial opening scenes, which hew pretty closely to the film.The servants of the house, who somehow sense disaster coming, have fled; and the hostess, Luca de Nobile (the bright-voiced soprano Amanda Echalaz) is frantic with embarrassment.Her prickly husband, Edmundo (the suave tenor Joseph Kaiser), is also utterly indignant.But Mr. Ads captures both the tension and absurdity of the crisis in a complex ensemble.The hosts greet their guests with unctuous exchanges, while the visitors, in overlapping and comically elongated phrases, voice refrains of Enchanted, enchanted, as the orchestra erupts with jumpy outbursts.Video The effect here is compounded by a prankish yet gripping touch in Mr. Cairnss brilliant staging.The set (by Hildegard Bechtler, who also designed the costumes) shows a salon, with fine couches and glittering tables, framed by a large wooden structure that resembles an opera house proscenium.Only when the guests arrived onstage did the chandeliers in the Mets auditorium start rising to the roof.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Though The Exterminating Angel is a true ensemble piece, Mr. Ads gives distinct character traits and defining musical moments to most of the 15 solo roles.The coloratura soprano Audrey Luna, whose stratospheric upper range was put to use by Mr. Ads in his previous opera The Tempest (presented at the Met in 2012) excels as Leticia, an opera singer who had starred in the performance the guests have attended: The dinner party is in her honor.But as hours and days go by, and everyone becomes increasingly confused and degraded, Leticia unravels, dispatching accusations in vocal bursts that reach screechy highs, yet somehow sound angelic.Another guest, Blanca, a pianist (the mezzo-soprano Christine Rice), agrees to play something.In the film, the character performs a snappy 18th-century keyboard piece.Mr. Ads substitutes his own haunting variations on a song from the Ladino tradition of Sephardic Jews, music that captures the ambiguity of the moment.Its as if Blanca is searching through musics past for clarity and willpower, yet speaking in a confused modern voice.Blanca arrives with her husband, Alberto (baritone Rod Gilfry), a conductor, and Leticias colleague, who proceeds to fall asleep on a couch while confusion reigns.Photo The soprano Sally Matthews brings a radiant voice and natural allure to Silvia de vila, a young widowed aristocrat who has a strangely close relationship with her prissy brother, Francesco (the vibrant countertenor Iestyn Davies).Two tragic guests, in the face of unreality, seek solace together.Beatriz (the soprano Sophie Bevan) and Eduardo (the tenor David Portillo) are engaged and utterly absorbed in themselves.But Mr. Ads enshrouds them in the operas most rapturous music, an extended duet with sighing vocal lines and quizzical orchestral sonorities.In a suicide pact, the couple enjoy their first night of love in a closet, where they are later discovered dead.The veteran bass John Tomlinson commands the stage as the elderly Doctor Conde, who is accompanied by his terminally ill patient Leonora, a needy woman obsessed with the occult, here the compelling mezzo-soprano Alice Coote.As an opera composer, Mr. Ads often has the orchestra hug every note and syllable of a vocal line.This stylistic trait could easily be overdone.But the chords and sonorities he comes up with at once buttress and shake up vocal lines, so the effect, in his hands, lends intriguing dramatic complexity.Over all, this riveting, breathless, score full of quick-cutting shifts, pointillist bursts, and episodes of ballistic intensity may be his best work.The anguished scene that will stay with me for a long while came late, a moment of motherly longing, when Silvia, now grimy, haggard and delirious, thinks about her little boy.She sings a fractured lullaby while caressing the head of a dead sheep (and how actual sheep come into the picture, I wont give away).Silvia sounds as if she is recalling some distant, old hymn tune.Yet the disjointed orchestra grumbles ominously in its depths while miniature violins play weirdly high, skittish sounds.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a timid Met season very heavy on the staples, The Exterminating Angel is the companys one bold offering.If you go to a single production this season, make it this one.
David Harbour of ‘Stranger Things’ Never Wants to Play the Dad:::::Mr. Harbour, 42, spoke by phone from Sofia, Bulgaria, on a bad-weather break from shooting Hellboy.These are edited excerpts from the conversation.What sort of emotional arc can we expect for Chief Hopper this time?The first season was such a classic heros journey.What I started to realize with the new one is, once somebody has this heroic moment, this kind of savior moment, the danger then becomes: What are the limits to your heroism?Maybe you start to try to control things that you cant control, or you start to think that you have powers beyond what you really have.I think thats where were going to find him in Season 2, sort of coming up against that reality.Whats the dynamic between the kids and the adults on the show?Are the boys coming to you for life advice?Advertisement Continue reading the main story [Laughs] Occasionally.And I will say, occasionally its super embarrassing.Theyre becoming teenagers now theyre like 14 and 15 and so of course there are girl issues and body issues.They want to know about girls or a little bit about sex.Theyre hormonal teenage boys, and I get it, I was that way, too, but I dont feel like its appropriate that I have those conversations with them.So I offer them little bits of advice and then generally go off and get a cup of coffee and wait until it dies down.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Youre like a cool uncle.Sometimes when they get a little out of hand, I also am the guy whos able to be on set saying, All right, come on kids, lets get down to work.So in some ways Im a cool uncle, and in some ways Im like a nasty physics teacher.Did you have any initial trepidation about playing a supporting role on a show focused on kids?No, from reading the pilot I knew that Hopper was a great, great character that they would do justice to.One of the things going into Season 2 is there is a father aspect to Hopper, but I certainly didnt want to become the dad on Full House, or whatever, whos just a dad.Hopper gets to go do very heroic things, and he gets to have this relationship with Joyce you get to see him as full-fledged human being, and that was really important to me.Youve said that you were once told that you were too fat to play the Blob.Now youre playing a shirtless superhero.How hard is it to maintain a healthy body image as a man in Hollywood?The interesting thing about my career is for years I was trying to do that thing of getting in shape and looking cool I would look at myself in camera angles and think how my chin looked the best and all this stuff.And I really couldnt get that much work.Then Stranger Things came along, and I had to really reinvest and go back to acting class and say to myself, O.K.Im going to throw my heart and my soul into this piece.And part of that was letting go of a lot of my narcissism.In that first scene [in Season 1], where hes shirtless, I had wanted to get all in shape, and this acting coach was like: Come on, this guy doesnt work out.Play the character.Dont play the five roles in front of the character, just play that actual character.And that was where things turned around for me.It was like, Oh, people want to see real human beings, and Ive been cynical about that, and here I have this opportunity.And I really took it.

‘Frog and Toad’ Are Memes:::::I was going to say that it just reinforces my belief that the internet is a dark and horrible place but really, thats not fair, he added.The internet is a fine and impressive culmination and convergence of technology and art and science and information.Its humanity that just stinks.Needless to say, I felt terrible.I grew up reading and loving the Frog and Toad books, and yet, I found many of these images hilarious.Was there something wrong with me?Luckily, Mr. Lobel, 58, a video editor who lives in Los Angeles, agreed to talk on the phone, where he was slightly more forgiving.Some of these are cute, he allowed, surfing the images while we spoke.Some of them are in tune with the originals friendship and its camaraderie.And some of it is like, Toad is waiting for the roofies to kick in.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Lobel also said that I should talk to his daughter, who was well aware of the memes, to get a different perspective.Lena Lobel, 25, grew up with her grandfathers books and loves them as much as anyone.But her attitude toward the memes was similar to mine.While we were on the phone, she burst out laughing at one that repurposed an image of Toad in a sinister way.Good, Toad says.Frog is not home.A Reddit user added: Toad finally found an opportunity to move the bodies.Photo Ms. Lobel suggested that our nonchalance toward the memes was generational.Dark humor, the abasement of familiar characters these qualities were inevitable when something fell into the hands of redditors armed with Photoshop."Im able to see these as a part of meme culture rather than a comment on the books, she said, adding that her parents are only able to see it as blasphemy against Frog and Toad.Ms. Lobel lives in New York, where she works in the same industry as her father.She calls him one of the best people she knows and says that the two text all the time, about new cellphone games and television shows like Breaking Bad and Futurama.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The way I think about the world, see the world, is like my dad, she said.But the darker memes are never going to compute with him.He agreed.But he said that his own father, who died in 1987, might feel differently about seeing what had happened to the characters he created.Frankly, he would be shocked and amused that there would be all this hubbub and furor, he said.I mean I guess, at a certain point, theres no such thing as bad P.R.
Weinstein, Hefner and the Poor Excuse That Explains a Lot:::::Everybody rolled their eyes because its the sort of rationale that deserves an eye roll.Great.The Mad Men defense.Yet, if taken at its word, there is something clarifying about an explanation like that.It suggests that his behavior belongs to some time when it was common for, say, a female co-worker to be treated like an item in the supply closet.Help yourself.Photo Mr. Weinsteins social diagnosis successfully invoked the era that we had just memorialized after Hugh Hefner died.Mr. Hefner invented the Playboy ethos that Mr. Weinstein used like a get-out-of-jail-free card.The culture then encouraged men to loosen their libidos and women were expected to tolerate it.Playboy operated with a patina of civility that granted the average man a presumption of pleasure that went one way his.And that permission flourished in the psyches of all kinds of men.When Oliver Stone and Woody Allen came forward to express sympathy for Mr. Weinstein, everybody rolled their eyes at them, too.More defensive insult, and from men seemingly indifferent to an internet that swiftly dredged up trouble from their own sexual histories.That both directors felt a need to speak up illustrates an enduring, but misguided, myth of the sexual revolution.We romanticized Mr. Hefners empire as a revolutionary force lovers gonna love, and all of that but it was actually just a popularization of entitlement.Photo In the wake of the Weinstein news, as more women detail unwanted encounters with colleagues and bosses, were seeing how common it was for men, indeed, to help themselves.Were seeing how the personal Playboy fantasy, benign as it might have looked, could spread into the workplace.Mr. Hefners disdain for sexual limits fueled fantasies and shaped self-images.He was the Walt Disney of lust and had his own set of seemingly innocuous iconic animal ears.You didnt have to read Playboy, visit the mansion, wear pajamas or even be straight: The effects of its ideas about women on the American psyche were totalizing.Women were inferior to men because, for Playboy, they were scenery pretty, passive, usually white, often blonde, there.The Playboy doctrine would mutate into the darker, more explicit realm that is spooling out on The Deuce.Pornography gave us a framework for understanding sex as both an act and a state of mind that was similar to Hollywoods imposition of ideas about romance.The stories that get repeated in plot after plot have become a kind of erogenous pop-culture value system: women as prey, as parts (boobs, bottoms, lips, legs) as often as wholes; leading women but also the final girl.A search for full female humanity in Hollywood movies turns up a lot of dolls and dream girls.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The culture now seems eager to challenge some of those values or at least to restage, unpack and reckon with, in Mr. Weinsteins words, the culture then.The journalistic depiction of prostitution and a burgeoning porn cinema on The Deuce is grim and queasy and morally suspenseful.Not even the wiliest, most enterprising female characters fare well.But the shows most exhilarating moments are on the faces of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Dominique Fishback, as they come alive with plans of self-determination, of power-sharing.But it feels as if it might take forever for their dreams to come true.The other night I saw Battle of the Sexes, which recounts that time in 1974 when the former tennis champ and self-styled chauvinist clown Bobby Riggs baited Billie Jean King into playing a match that became a national political spectacle.Its not a great movie.Things get logy anytime it goes near a hotel room.(Why dont moviemakers know that hotel air isnt quite the same as oxygen?)But I went home happy, anyway.Thats because the movie takes a rollicking, triumphal approach to the feminism of its day.(It was also known as womens lib back then.)The men sit around in locker rooms and lounges grinning and grunting and slurping beer.Howard Cosell says about Ms. King, Should she ever let her hair grow down to her shoulders, took her glasses off, youd have somebody vying for a Hollywood screen test.Photo Its true that no one is bragging about how easy it is to grab a woman by her vagina.And Riggs, courtesy of Steve Carell, is a cartoon: loud, bawdy, shameless, mildly pathetic, opportunistically insincere, a little desperate, a jester in misogynist drag.Hes like the villain in an episode of Scooby Doo before Scooby and the gang yank off his mask.I wouldve gotten away with it, if it werent for you meddling feminists!And yet the old Riggss chauvinism is still out there.Earlier this month, Cam Newton, the Carolina Panthers quarterback, was asked by a sports reporter, Jourdan Rodrigue, a standard professional question about his receivers and their routes.He didnt notice her professionalism.He noticed something else: Its funny to hear a female talk about routes.(The lassitude in his response acquires some lasciviousness for that last word.)This is to say that the Playboy-era myths are hard to shake.Battle of the Sexes and The Deuce, especially, show how resistant we are to real equality.One dead pimp on The Deuce doesnt end male-controlled prostitution.Systemic inequity is harder to kill.So is the misogyny that fuels it.The disentanglement of Harvey Weinstein from Hollywoods institutions has, so far, culminated in the termination of his membership in the Motion Picture Academy, the outfit whose duties include handing out the Oscars.His eviction might address an aspect of the Harvey Weinstein problem.But it doesnt do much to reverse the absence of women from all kinds of craft jobs; nor does it end the drought of best picture winners that feature two or more women in major speaking roles who also speak to each other.In the last 34 years, thats happened twice, with Terms of Endearment and Chicago.Were talking about a phallocentrism thats baked into movies and television.Its the reason we have the Bechdel Test, which asks whether female characters, among other very simple things, meaningfully communicate with each other about something other than a man.Almost no movies pass.Photo Theres power in turning to the past to illuminate the current state of things.But theres different power in the culture now looking at the culture now or now-ish.The second-season dismount of the Amazon show One Mississippi involves a womans reaction to an important, sexually creepy male producer.A sensationally complex episode of Girls from February American Bitch puts its protagonist, Hannah Horvath, inside the apartment and on the bed of a famous writer and notorious harasser whom she had visited in order to confront.The best thing about the HBO show Westworld is the struggle of female androids to extricate themselves from the limiting fantasies for which theyve been created.And a major Emmy winner this year was HBOs Big Little Lies, in which a group of frenemies wind up training their focus on an abusive husband.Another was The Handmaids Tale, on Hulu, about life for women under patriarchal totalitarianism.An idea associated with that show was the same as a hashtag that showed up during the womens march in January: Resist.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Before this month, I had heard Beyoncs Formation as a song about, more or less, united, self-protective black feminism.But since the Weinstein news, the chorus sounds more than ever as if it could double as a gender-wide war command: O.K., ladies now lets get in formation or lets get information.Either way, now I can hear a call for action and solidarity, to be seen and believed.Still, the persistence of all this combat can leave you weary.That accounts for the mixed emotions of my night at Battle of the Sexes.This is a movie about a tennis match that really happened, yet it feels like a fable.When Billie Jean King, whos played by Emma Stone, wins the first set, cheers broke out in the theater.Actual cheers.I turned around to see who clapped, and one section was filled with women who seemed old enough to remember seeing the match.Celebrating it felt good; it felt just.It also felt dismayingly recurrent.The movie is called Battle of the Sexes but only because somebody already took Groundhog Day.And Ms. King is very much a civil rights legend.But, here, shes also Sisyphus.So what now?If the entitlements of the Playboy era have suffused our lunch breaks and boardroom meetings and subway rides home, and porn has evolved into something elemental, like fire and water, how do we prevent their personal encroachments and abuses, along with every other important but less salacious imbalance, like for instance, with salaries?How do we reconcile all the complications?Resist is one thing.Change is something else.Beyonc is sending that solidarity cry out for ladies.But to get anything meaningful done, more than a few good men are going to have to answer it, too.
Review: ‘M. Butterfly’ Returns to Broadway on Heavier Wings:::::Still reading?O.K.In M. Butterfly, our not-so-bright Gallimard a French embassy official stationed in Beijing in the 1960s falls head over heels for Song, who he thinks is a woman but is really a fetching young dude in Suzie Wong drag.That Gallimard (and his real-life prototype, Bernard Boursicot, whose case became an international scandal in the mid-1980s) failed to register the imposture has been the subject of much bewildered speculation and many jokes.(Check out the priceless Forbidden Broadway parody of the show.)Photo In the latest incarnation of the tale, Song is not merely a man pretending to be a woman.Hes a man pretending to be a woman pretending to be man who is pretending to be a woman.Got that?Never mind.Well get back to it later.This extra turn of the screw of pretense is also directly from the case history of Monsieur Boursicot (the subject of a fascinating book by The New York Times columnist Joyce Wadler).But for audiences who must digest an already complex story (did I mention that Song is a spy for the Chinese government?)within less than three hours of stage time, its a lot to assimilate.There is another, even more distracting problem.Once weve seen Mr. Ha who has a distinctly masculine cast of a jaw in boys clothes early on (thats when he says hes a man who works in drag as an actor in a Beijing opera house), its impossible to unsee him as that boy.Which makes Gallimard, our deluded protagonist, appear even more mentally challenged than usual.You could argue that such obtuseness is appropriate for a play that considers the blindness not only of love, but also of cultural and sexual imperialism.Yes, Gallimard, who has never had much luck with women before, is responding to the novelty of a beautiful actress improbably finding him attractive.But more important to the plays intriguing and ever timely central thesis is the fact that Song is Asian, perceived as a fragile lotus blossom waiting to be plucked by virile white hands, like the doomed heroine of Puccinis Madama Butterfly, Gallimards favorite opera.Such, it seems, is the Wests vision of the East.Mr. Hwang more than implicitly compares Gallimards dim vision regarding his love object to the unrealistic beliefs that Western countries hold about the East.That includes the presumption that Vietnam would fall in a swoon before the manly forces of the United States.Song, whose mission as a spy is to elicit information from Gallimard about Frances involvement in Vietnam, speaks scornfully of a Western self-image involving big guns, big industry, big well, you know your own fantasies.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But for M. Butterfly to have emotional impact, it must make its audiences uneasily complicit in that fantasy.In this version, you always maintain the distance sometimes amused, sometimes appalled thats generated by your awareness of theatrical machinery churning away.Photo Dont blame Mr. Owen, who works skillfully and, well, manfully at becoming a wimp in a part memorably originated by John Lithgow (and played by Jeremy Irons in the 1993 film).Though he has established himself on screen as a thinking persons hunk (Children of Men, The Knick), Mr. Owen is surprisingly convincing here as someone who could never get a date in high school.The shows broken master of ceremonies, whom we meet in a French prison cell many years after the events recounted here, Gallimard does his best to frame the story of his relationship with Song as a love story worthy of tragic opera.As Mr. Owens Gallimard struggles to make facts succumb to romantic fiction, his discomfort in his own skin glistens like flop sweat.If only this production trusted more in its reliably unreliable narrator, and let us see a bit more through his bedazzled eyes.Instead, the show has a grinding Brechtian self-consciousness throughout, which calls harsh attention to its less than subtle ironies.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Has arch Song seems to be all too demonstratively in on the cosmic joke being played on poor old Gallimard.Building up the role of Songs shrill Communist party liaison (Celeste Den) was a mistake.Though Enid Graham is fine in the thankless part of Gallimards wife, the character of his macho best friend (Murray Bartlett) remains an annoying device.Most disappointing for Ms. Taymors fans is the productions lack of the ravishing visuals she brought to The Lion King and her more recent A Midsummer Nights Dream.The tall, painted Chinese screens that frame each scene are alarmingly clunky and unsteady.(Paul Steinberg did the sets.)The two centerpiece dance sequences, choreographed by Ma Cong, feel scrappy, like numbers from a pared-down touring production of Miss Saigon.And Elliot Goldenthals original music and soundscapes are usually more intrusive than evocative.Such clumsiness sadly undermines a play that remains urgently relevant.Anyone doubting that Gallimards pipe dream of masculinity is still with us need only consult recent reports of the behavior of Hollywood moguls and American presidents or daily accounts of the United States military in quagmires on foreign soil.But even if the romance at the heart of M. Butterfly is toxic, we still need to be swept up by the tide of this crazy infatuation.In this incarnation, were not being seduced, but preached at.And Gallimards grand self-sacrifice seems more pathetic and unnecessary than it ever did before.
Review: ‘Stranger Things’ Returns, More Familiar but Still Fun:::::The new season, arriving Friday, picks up just before Halloween 1984, and it spends its first half creating new versions of the first seasons conflicts.Will is back in our world, but tormented by visions of the Upside Down, which, as the first-season epilogue suggested, still has a hold on him.Eleven, who went missing at the end of Season 1, is still in hiding.So Wills D&D buddies Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) find a new cool girl to be group-infatuated with, Max (Sadie Sink), and a new creepy-crawly menace to battle.As a new extradimensional threat arises, Mr. Modines conspiracist scientist is replaced by Dr. Owens (a credibly straight-faced Paul Reiser).The new seasons biggest strength is how it deals with Wills trauma.Hes a frail kid whos survived a horrifying experience, and Noah Schnapp, in a bigger role, doesnt let you forget it.His lingering feeling of being unsafe in his own body is the shows most effective chiller.Ms. Ryders role gets a little smaller as the story expands, but her fear of losing her son again, this time before her eyes, is just as convincing.For a breakout hit, Stranger Things 2 mostly refrains from milking fan-favorite elements.The death of Barb (Shannon Purser), who became a viral obsession, has continued repercussions (which occupy the shows teen characters for much of the season), but theyre grounded in the story and characters.And while keeping Eleven separate from the action may be frustrating, credit the Duffers for resisting the temptation to turn the series, on the strength of Ms. Browns transfixing stare, into The Eleven Show.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Stranger Things has a solid ensemble (Sean Astin joins it, as Joyces amiably clueless new boyfriend), but its real star is the world it creates.Hawkins, Ind., feels genuine even though its made out of movies.Parts of the new season recall Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Gremlins, The Empire Strikes Back and, naturally, the Reeses Pieces sequence in E.T.For one unfortunate episode, the show becomes The Outsiders, complete with apocalypse-chic street-punk gang.When the boys agree to go as the Ghostbusters for Halloween, theres even a sly comment on the racial dynamic of that movie and of 80s pop culture.Lucas, who is African-American, refuses to go as Winston, the black Ghostbuster.No one wants to be Winston!he says.He joined the team super late, hes not funny and hes not even a scientist.The new season jokes about its own referentiality later, when Lucas fills Max in on the adventures of a year ago.She, of course, thinks hes made up a story.I really liked it, she says.I just felt it was a little derivative in parts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That would be a fair critique of Stranger Things 2, which reprises many of Season 1s arcs and twists.(The ingenious device of having Will speak from the Upside Down via Christmas lights is replaced by well, youll see.)Im not sure Stranger Things creatively needed a second season, and for several episodes it seems like Stranger Things 2 isnt convinced of it either.But its a still a good time, its nicely paced at nine episodes and it blends the suspense of 80s horror with the heart of an 80s teen romance.It may be last years Halloween candy, repackaged.That doesnt mean it cant still be sweet.[ Read our refresher on where Stranger Things Season 1 left off. ]
Refusing Weinstein’s Hush Money, Rose McGowan Calls Out Hollywood:::::She said she told her lawyer to pull the offer within a day of The New York Times publishing an article that detailed decades of Mr. Weinsteins alleged sexual harassment, aggression and misconduct toward women, as well as at least seven other settlements he had reached with accusers.After that, the dam burst, with The New Yorker, The Times and other news outlets reporting on dozens of other womens experiences with Mr. Weinstein.Photo Mr. Weinstein, his accusers say, built his long history of abusing women on a risky gamble that worked for him over and over the assumption that money or threats could buy womens silence on a subject so intimate and painful that most would prefer not to go public anyway.While Ms. McGowan was the rare voice suggesting that the cover-up was not fail-safe, even she considered not naming him, having already, she believes, paid a career price for that long-ago episode and its aftermath.A Weinstein spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said that Mr. Weinstein unequivocally denies any allegations of nonconsensual sex.Ms. McGowans lawyer, Paul Coggins, confirmed that Ms. McGowan received the offer.By 2015, Ms. McGowan, who felt alienated by the industry, started using her sizable platform on Twitter to maximize her status as both insider and outsider someone with enough Hollywood experience to speak with authority about sexism within it, and someone liberated enough from its compromises to unleash the fury in her that had been building for years.Only now does the scope of the news about Mr. Weinstein and the public conversation about whats wrong with Hollywood seem to match the scale of her outrage, giving her the clout of a contrarian at last proven right.On Friday, at the inaugural Womens Convention in Detroit, she was a featured speaker a new, combative face of feminism, endowed with Hollywood charisma yet anything but slick.I have been silenced for 20 years, she told the gathering.I have been slut-shamed.I have been harassed.I have been maligned.And you know what?Im just like you.A Crusade Gathers Strength As other women told their stories in recent weeks, Ms. McGowan not only addressed what happened to her but also attacked those she considered complicit.Photo When the actor Ben Affleck claimed he never knew of Mr. Weinsteins history, she wrote in a tweet: GODDAMNIT!I TOLD HIM TO STOP DOING THAT you said that to my face, adding, The press conf I was made to go to after assault.You lie.(Mr. Affleck declined to comment.)She called out the larger apparatus of Hollywood, criticizing talent agencies you are guilty of human trafficking, she wrote and a film studio that she believed knew of Mr. Weinsteins alleged misconduct.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When Twitter suspended her account the company said that it was because she had published a private phone number users retaliated with a boycott that drew support from celebrities such as the actress Alyssa Milano and the writer Cheryl Strayed.The actor and filmmaker Jordan Peele tweeted, in response to Ms. McGowans blistering attacks, a moody still of her from Grindhouse in which she surveys burning wreckage her character has wrought.Get em, Rose, he wrote.On Oct. 13, the day of the boycott, Ms. McGowan retreated from Los Angeles, where she had been working on her memoir, to a beach cottage in Hawaii, safely ensconced behind two gates, near a park locals call the City of Refuge.I wanted to come to a place that had so much power to it, that it could hold a lot at bay a lot of monster energy, said Ms. McGowan, sitting at a picnic table near the ocean.I came to a place that almost has a protective zone around it.Her hair was short, but not shaven, as it had been in the past.Once featured on the covers of Maxim and Rolling Stone as a longhaired, barely dressed object of desire, Ms. McGowan seems to have settled on an aesthetic of chic simplicity.If not a time of celebration, this moment could be perceived as a moment of vindication for Ms. McGowan.Yes, she said, she sometimes feels like laughing kind of like a witchs cackle, she clarified.But at other times she feels emotionally raw, just knowing that a click on her phone would bring her to conversations others were having about her assault allegation.The phone had come to feel too powerful: Its like a live wire that youre holding in your mouth, and it goes directly to your brain, she said.The Meeting and the Aftermath Her story of assault, although uniquely her own, shares some of the now familiar hallmarks of a Weinstein encounter.Ms. McGowan, then 23, was in Park City, Utah, in early 1997 to attend the Sundance Film Festival and the screening of a film in which she appeared, Going All the Way.She had also recently appeared as a smart-mouthed beauty who dies a gruesome death in the blockbuster film Scream, on which Mr. Weinstein was an executive producer.Got a confidential news tip?The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.Ms. McGowans manager then, Jill Messick, told her to meet Mr. Weinstein at the restaurant in the Stein Eriksen Lodge for a 10 a.m. appointment.On her arrival, the matre d directed the actress upstairs to Mr. Weinsteins suite, she said.Ms. McGowan remembers passing two male assistants on the way in.They wouldnt look me in the eye, she recalled.She sat at the far end of a couch as Mr. Weinstein sat in a club chair, and they had a brief business meeting.But on their way out, she said, he interrupted himself to point out that the hotel room had a hot tub.And then what happened, happened, said Ms. McGowan, who has described her experience, on Twitter, as rape.Suffice it to say a door opened and my life changed.She declined to share the details of the encounter.Thats my story to tell, she said emphatically.But she said that she walked out of the hotel suite and directly into a press event.She remembers fighting back tears, and the conversation with Mr. Affleck.She said she told Ms. Messick, then of Addis-Wechsler & Associates, what had occurred.She held me, Ms. McGowan said.She put her arms around me.But in the months to come, Ms. McGowan did not feel supported by her management team.She was referred to a lawyer specializing in sexual harassment and assault cases who, Ms. McGowan said, gave her the impression that filing a criminal charge was hopeless.She was like, Youre an actress, youve done a sex scene, youre done, she recalled.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Anne Woodward, now a manager herself, was a young assistant in Ms. Messicks office at the time, and was in on many of Ms. Messicks calls.I remember that Rose was extremely upset and did not want to settle, Ms. Woodward said.She wanted to fight.No one around her, as Ms. Woodward recalls, supported that instinct.It was an emotionally shocking way to see a woman being treated, Ms. Woodward said.Thats what stuck with me.Photo Nick Wechsler, then a principal at Addis-Wechsler & Associates, said that he and his partner, Keith Addis, met with Mr. Weinstein at Ms. Messicks request and confronted him with Ms. McGowans claim.I remember Harvey saying he was going to get psychiatric treatment or some kind of therapy for his sexual behavior, Mr. Wechsler said.Ms. McGowan initially asked for about $25,000, enough money to cover her therapy; by the time she signed the settlement, the amount had been raised to $100,000.Both Ms. Woodward and Ms. McGowan were shocked when, only a few months afterward, Ms. Messick accepted a job working as vice president for development at Miramax, then run by Mr. Weinstein.Ms. Messick did not respond to a request for comment.At the time of the alleged assault, Ms. McGowan had finally been emerging from the trials of an insecure childhood, with loving but unconventional parents: Her father, said his sister, Rory McGowan, Roses aunt, almost certainly had undiagnosed manic-depressive disorder.He was the leader of a religious cult in Italy, from which Roses grandmother extracted her before she reached middle school.Both parents were hippie intellectuals, members of the counterculture who taught their children to prize independent thinking and buck the system.Maddie Corman, an actress who befriended Ms. McGowan in the mid-90s, perceived a change in Ms. McGowan after the 1997 episode (she says she was aware of the settlement, but could not recall if she learned it directly from Ms. McGowan or from others).Rose was never this sweet, simple soul there was always something ferocious about her, Ms. Corman said.After that assault, a light dimmed.I remember her souring on the powers that be.And she became very protective of us.It was sometimes cryptic: Keep your guard up.Ms. McGowans friends watched as she made choices that surprised them, including beginning a relationship with Marilyn Manson, a controversial rock star and ordained Satanist who has called himself the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles.(I ran away for three years and joined the circus, Ms. McGowan said of that romantic involvement.)She showed up for the red carpet at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1998 in a dress made of tiny beads that left her nearly nude.That was my first big public appearance after being assaulted, she said.And I thought you want to see a body?I did it with a giant middle finger.Photo Camilla Rantsen was also a young actress in Los Angeles who was close to Ms. McGowan, and was aware, only through friends, of what had transpired.I think some of the people she started surrounding herself with werent as great as the people she had before, said Ms. Rantsen, who is now a writer.Plenty of young actresses with promising starts see their careers founder for one reason or another.But Ms. McGowan believes that after she finished up work on Phantoms, a 1998 film produced by Miramax, her career suffered because collaborations with Weinstein productions were for many years off the table.And they were doing the kinds of movies that I would be doing, she said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She continued to work, on Charmed until 2006, but also in independent films.Eventually, she appeared in both of the two films packaged as Grindhouse, directed by Robert Rodriguez, with whom she was romantically involved, and by Quentin Tarantino.It was distributed by Dimension, run by Bob Weinstein, Harveys brother.As the film critic David Edelstein put it in New York, Ms. McGowan played the ultimate abused-and-fetishized action-movie femme.The experience, Ms. McGowan said, left her shattered.I was really lost at that point, she said.I was damaged.Shunning Celebrity It is impossible to predict how Ms. McGowans career path in film would have proceeded had the episode with Mr. Weinstein never occurred.She is an unconventional figure, occasionally provocative and profane, but also sometimes old-fashioned and even formal in spirit.I never considered myself a celebrity, she said at one point.I hate that word.Its tawdry.Ms. McGowan became an increasingly outspoken voice for women mistreated by Hollywood.In 2015, she was dropped from her agency after mocking a casting call that encouraged women to wear push-up bras in auditions.(Her agent had been fired a few days earlier, but the agency did not fight to retain her, as agencies typically do of valued clients.)Photo In The Hollywood Reporter, she passionately defended Rene Zellweger last year from what she perceived as sexist comments in Variety about the actresss plastic surgery.How dare you bully a woman who has done nothing but try to entertain people like you?she wrote, in a direct accusation of the pieces writer, Owen Glieberman.It was startling and inspiring to see someone who was willing to put herself out there in support of other women/actresses, said the actress Molly Ringwald in an email to The Times.Her tenacity is something that you would hope for in an union leader but of course never really get.And Ms. McGowan spoke, in veiled terms, to the Buzzfeed reporter Kate Aurthur in 2015 about her experience as an assault victim.You are taking part of someones soul, she said.Its happened to me.Last year, during a Twitter campaign called #WhyWomenDontReport, she all but named Mr. Weinstein as the perpetrator of the violence against her that she had mentioned in the past.During her recent visit to Hawaii, Ms. McGowan, over a day and a half in Kona, revealed a person much more playful than her fierce Twitter persona.She would interrupt a thought to smile and smell a flower that caught her eye; she could not resist a swing hanging from a large tree, and enjoyed twirling an umbrella the same blue as her sundress while walking on the beach.She seemed free, in some ways, from both a long-kept secret and a labor of love that had occupied her for the last year and a half her book, Brave, which will be released by Harper One early next year.To some degree, she had shielded herself from the news.But when she learned how many women had stepped forward to complain of assault or harassment by Mr. Weinstein, she said: I knew we are legion.We are legion.She had been corresponding lately with Asia Argento, an Italian actress who also accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual assault (and was subsequently shamed by the Italian press).It feels, Ms. McGowan wrote to Ms. Argento, reading from her text, like toxic slime going out of a spiked birth canal.Thats what the whole experience feels like to me.Its an intense process.Sometimes she feels fresh rage.But Ill tell you what I dont feel anymore, she said.Despair.
Art Galleries Rethink Their Strategies as Art Fairs Proliferate:::::Were like a Silicon Valley start-up, said Adam Sheffer, the president of the Art Dealers Association of America, speaking of gallerists generally.Were going to try some things, and some things will work, but you cant adhere to the same principles of sitting in your gallery like a garage attendant waiting for people to buy art.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Sheffer, a partner in the New York gallery Cheim & Read, noted how the galleries P.P.O.W.and Galerie Lelong last year joined forces in representing the artist Carolee Schneemann and how David Zwirner and the Maccarone gallery now share representation of the sculptor Carol Bove.We are embracing the change as opposed to being afraid of it, Mr. Sheffer said.Similarly, the longtime dealer Andrea Rosen shocked the art world this year by announcing that she was closing her Chelsea space and would share representation of Felix Gonzalez-Torres with Zwirner.Photo To some extent, the art world is responding to the kind of consolidation that is occurring in other creative fields, like the music industry, and scrambling to adjust.Several Latin American galleries, for example, have come together to form Ruberta, a collaborative exhibition space in the Glendale section of Los Angeles:Galera Agustina Ferreyra (Mexico City and San Juan), Lodos (Mexico City), Proyectos Ultravioleta (Guatemala City), Carne (Bogota) and Bwsmx (Mexico City).What galleries need at this point is a more varied ecosystem for exhibiting internationally, connecting with curators and collectors, said Brett W. Schultz, who helped organize Ruberta after closing his Mexico City space Yautepec (which he ran with Daniela Elbahara since 2008) and before opening Bwsmx.Art fairs are very important, but theyre gutting the small to midsize gallery sector; its stressful, its tiring, its expensive, Mr. Schultz said.Hopefully we can demonstrate that there are different approaches to promoting ourselves and connecting with others and encourage other people to try new models and keep experimenting.Ruberta, which operates in a converted three-car garage owned by the adjacent gallery the Pit on Ruberta Avenue, will host one group exhibition that involves all of the participating galleries, followed by five two-month residencies, one for each gallery.Photo There is something to be said for smaller galleries finding new ways to work together and hoping that can give us some kind of advantage in whats becoming a difficult environment business-wise for us all, Mr. Schultz said.Mr. Schultz, who is also a founder of the Material Art Fair in Mexico City, said the economics for this new approach were compelling, given that five galleries would be sharing a monthly rent of $700 as opposed to each spending (on top of rent) $15,000 to $20,000 on an art fair considerably more for larger galleries and theres no guarantee youll see a penny of that back.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The numbers make more sense to us, he added.Ceci Moss, a curator who started out at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in Manhattan, in September created the itinerant art space Gas in a converted truck in Los Angeles.Starting a brick-and-mortar space did not really seem to make sense, Ms. Moss said.So she cleaned out the truck in time to present her first group show, which opened in September and looks at the concept of hope in the Trump era, featuring work that was almost all produced since the election.Im interested in a conversation about mobility in contemporary art obviously this is a mobile space, she said.Its an opportunity to reach a lot of different audiences.Photo Ms. Moss said she planned to mount three shows a year, each of which would be on view for three months, with some of the artworks existing only online.Just as artists will make work regardless of the challenges, Ms. Moss said, people who organize shows will also find ways to do them.This summer marked the first Condo New York, a collaborative exhibition by 36 galleries across 16 New York spaces, organized by Nicole Russo of Chapter NY and Simone Subal of the Simone Subal Gallery.Galleries dont dream of doing art fairs, Ms. Russo said.They dream of doing exhibitions.Photo The event was modeled after Condo London, started by Vanessa Carlos of the London gallery Carlos/Ishikawa in 2016 to offer international galleries a site for collaboration and exchange.The visitors hail from Shanghai, Detroit and Los Angeles and cities in Latin America and Europe, wrote Roberta Smith in The New York Times, a kind of art gallery Airbnb or decentralized underground fair.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Adam Lindemann has turned over the programming of his Los Angeles space, Venus Over Los Angeles, to the Lower East Side gallery Ramiken Crucible, run by Blaize Lehane and Mike Egan.The smaller galleries, they want to keep their artists, Mr. Lindemann said.This is a way for them to keep their artists and not have everyone they represent get stolen from them.Photo To be sure, many of these collaborative enterprises are borne out of struggle an attempt to stay in the game and continue to engage with art, even as the economics have made operating galleries prohibitive for smaller operators.But Mr. Sheffer said people in the art world were accustomed to the ups and downs of the art market and were innovative by nature.Its not the first time they have seen some broken glass on the ground theyve seen the ebbs and flows over time and have a longtime perspective on the market, he said.Rather than bemoaning the state of the art business, Mr. Sheffer suggests that the art world needs to stay nimble and keep adapting; the Saturday gallery crawl that galleries used to be able to count on is a thing of the past.Its up to the dealers to understand that times have changed and their ways of maintaining relationships with collectors is different you can no longer talk about art for an hour on a Saturday morning over cup of coffee, he said.Sometimes, if Mohammed is not coming to the mountain you have to bring the mountain to Mohammed.
Oh, the Things You Can Find at Swann’s Illustration Auction:::::At the very beginning, when were putting a sale together, were depending on what people offer us, Ms. von der Linn said.As the artwork comes in, if themes or patterns develop, the auction house will put feelers out for similar work.But the results can be varied, she said: People will offer us individual pieces or some will call and say: I have 20 pieces.What do you want?Advertisement Continue reading the main story Sometimes, the choice can be easy.You ideally want the ultimate example of what that illustrator is known for.I always give the example of someone giving you a Charles Schulz that isnt Peanuts or a Bemelmans that isnt Madeline, she said.What they are known for is whats going to bring in the money.Pricing is a recipe that includes gut instinct, the quality of the work and market strength, Ms. von der Linn said.Another determining factor is whether the illustration was published.A proposed New Yorker cover could be great, but a published cover is a big deal.The goal is to offer a broad range of pieces and prices.We never want to veer from that, she said.We always want to make it appealing and affordable.These considerations factored into a discussion in late September with Ms. von der Linn and Arielle Bremby, a junior specialist at Swann, about the works in the auction on Dec. 14.The talk showed their discerning eye for quality work, their detective skills (looking for clues to help identify and verify the authenticity of the pieces) and their deep knowledge of art (providing insight into the significance of the work).Photo Some of the works up for sale along with their opening estimates include three animation cels (transparent sheets typically used for traditional, hand-drawn animation) from Yellow Submarine ($2,000); a Peanuts strip by Charles M. Schulz ($8,000), a cover for TV Guide ($2,000); and a sketch and watercolor combination by Maurice Sendak ($15,000).Each of these pieces provokes discussions large (What is their cultural significance?)and minute (In which category should it be placed?).There is often serendipity in these moments.When were laying out the catalog, we sometimes notice visual themes, Ms. Bremby said.This time, it was lots of images with crowds.One of those human clusters is evident in Movie Scream ($12,000), a classic Charles Addams cartoon depicting the audience at a horror film casting a worried look over their shoulders.That Addams cartoon is a good example of what draws potential buyers: a sense of familiarity.People are just charmed or tickled by the material that we handle, Ms. Bremby said.A sense of humor also comes through in groupings like the whimsical Man-cave-iana category, a catchall for sports, weird Americana, beefcake and genre art.This time, it includes The Raid ($1,200), by Victor Prezio, a boldly cheesy image of damsels in distress under desert surroundings that are an eye-popping orange.Having the specialists discuss the artwork provides insights that are not obvious in casual observation.A Four Roses whiskey advertisement by John Philip Falter features two gentlemen having cocktails in a well-appointed apartment and a view of a bright sun setting in the distance.The 1942 work is titled Strictly Off the Record ($15,000).The need for discretion becomes obvious when attention is given to some of the details: The men are gay.Once you know background and social cues, you can read into it, Ms. von der Linn said.He has his green tie and green sock showing.That was a quiet hint to those in the know.Photo Another stand out is Aprs la Tempte, by Georges Lepape, which was used as a cover for Vogue in April 1919.The opening estimate is $25,000.The watercolor, ink and graphite drawing depicts and is inscribed to Clarisse Coudert, the wife of Cond Montrose Nast, who took over the magazine in 1905.Advertisement Continue reading the main story This is one of those pieces that hits all cylinders, Ms. von der Linn said, summing up its appeal.A famous artist, a surviving work and beautiful original color.One of the showstoppers is a copy of Dr. Seusss ABC ($8,000), which has an original drawing by Theodor Geisel, along with a personal inscription.In the note, Geisel apologizes to a boy named William for holding onto his book for so long.To atone, he included a lush drawing of a smiling Suess-ian beast called A Great Gallumphing Galoot!The auction house gets counterfeit Seusses all the time.We can spot a fake a mile away, Ms. Bremby said.But this one was a revelation.There is no way that is a fake Dr. Seuss.No one could get that detail, Ms. von der Linn said.And Gallumphing is a direct reference to Lewis Carroll, who uses galumphing in Jabberwocky, and who was Seusss favorite muse.In his excitement, Geisel uses two ls in gallumphing, whereas the poem uses only one.That was a great day, Ms. Bremby said.Ms. von der Linn added, And I happened to answer the consignor in a Suess-ian poem.
With ‘The Dress That Eats Souls,’ Toni Dove Erases Boundaries:::::Ms. Dove chuckled when it was pointed out that the title of the artwork sounded a bit like a Dementor from Harry Potter.I think of her as chick Pacific Rim, she said, referring to the monster movie.Theres a sense of having created these deranged pets.Photo But, jokes aside, Ms. Dove has a serious purpose with the piece, adding, Shes the wreck of the ship of progress.Technology is the delivery system and the subject of her work, and she has been exploring the nexus of interactive machines, performance and installation art since the 1990s.That zone has recently become popular among artists, but Ms. Dove was arguably one of the first.I am interested in dissolving the boundary between audience and performer, she said.The Dress takes that to an extreme.Depending on the movements Ms. Dove made, a different one-minute film would appear on the screens, tailored to one of 10 different decades.Depending on the users movements, the robot cues up a dark, neutral or more lighthearted story.Of 30 possible stories, a viewer can experience five.In one, set in the 1940s, a woman goes to the movies and becomes immersed in a Gregory Peck picture, losing track of whats real.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a story set in the 2040s, the protagonist can download her memory into a chip embedded in her hip, she said.Everything is recorded, each moment.But you cant stop it or turn it off.She collaborated with the novelist Rene Steinke on the narratives.At the end, the dress captures your image, and you show up over the dress, Ms. Dove added.It says, Im done, Ive consumed, now you go away.Photo Ms. Dove, 71, was raised in New York, and she attended the Rhode Island School of Design.She comes from an artistic family: Her grandfather was the painter Arthur Dove (1880-1946), one of the most important American Modernists, whose work is in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art and other major institutions.In the same way that he pioneered abstraction with his suggestively simple shapes on canvas, pushing art forward at a time that his technique was considered avant-garde, Ms. Dove has had a similar role with interactive automation.Im kind of a geek, she said.Her studio seems to have more screens, cords and power strips than your average P.C.Richard & Sons outlet.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Though Ms. Dove works independently as an artist she is not represented by a gallery, relying on grants to produce her work she enlists various expert teams to help her create her works.Students from the Parsons School of Design helped her configure the vinyl underskirts of Dress, for instance.She often has a software designer on the project, Tommy Martinez, in her studio manning the control panel for the Dress.And the company Brooklyn Research created the robotics.Ms. Dove usually takes three to four years to finish a major work.This is less a Rembrandt and more a limited-edition Porsche, Ms. Dove said.It requires maintenance and upkeep, and it could become obsolete.Her previous works show just how fast the technology landscape has changed.The Ringling show includes her 1998 work Artificial Changelings, an interactive piece that links 19th-century shoplifting to 21st-century computer hacking.Photo It originally traveled in four large road cases that weighed a thousand pounds, with laser discs Ms. Dove said.Now its run on a small laptop.Everything gets smaller and faster.Advertisement Continue reading the main story According to Matthew McLendon, the former Ringling curator who organized the show, Ms. Dove was an early adopter among artists.Toni is a major influence on the younger new-media generation, Mr. McLendon said.Thats why its time for this show.Ms. Dove, though, he added, was not a captive to her medium.Toni is at her heart a storyteller, he said.She doesnt let tech define her practice.She has a concept, and then finds the tech to meet it.The Ringling, the state art museum of Florida, was founded by John Ringling, one of the five brothers who established the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey circus and his wife, Mabel.The museum has two very unusual specialties a strong old master collection, including five canvases by Peter Paul Rubens, and a circus-related collection.Ms. Dove, who referred to herself as a cinema director, but cinema on Mars, said she identified with the idea of a big show for everyone.I felt a complete affinity with the Ringling, I love the circus context and the populist side of it.But unlike a trapeze artist or lion tamer, Ms. Dove has some thorny issues on her mind.I use spectacle as a seduction, hopefully to draw people in to spend time with complex ideas, she said.At this point, Dress was silent and powered down.But there was an uncanny feeling that she was watching all the while.

Yves Bouvier Sells His Geneva-based Art Storage Company:::::Photo Yves Bouvier has sold off his familys Geneva-based art storage and transport company, a business that has been one of the largest tenants of the freeport there and one that helped him become a high-profile figure in the international art market.Franco Momente, the director of the company, Natural Le Coultre, confirmed the sale Friday.No price was disclosed.Mr. Bouvier, who is Swiss, made his reputation as a businessman involved with freeports, the largely tax-free storage depots where wealthy collectors now store so many of their treasures.In addition to operating in Geneva, where his storage spaces have been filled with many of the worlds most famous and expensive masterpieces, he also opened new facilities in Luxembourg and Singapore where his businesses continue to operate.Photo But in the past few years Mr. Bouvier has been battling legal cases in courtrooms in Monaco, Paris, Singapore and New York, and has likely been facing mounting legal bills as part of that effort.
Fragments and Elephants: Howard Hodgkin’s Eclectic Art Collection Is Sold:::::Sothebys presale exhibition recreated the ambience of Mr. Hodgkins studio and home in the Bloomsbury district of London, allowing people to see the relationships between the artists vibrant paintings and prints and the Indian miniatures, Turkish tiles, Persian carpet fragments and other antiques that surrounded him.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hes unique, said the London-based artist Nicholas Hatfull, 33, at the preview, describing Mr. Hodgkins art.Hes a sort of English Cy Twombly.No other artist has his depth of color, or warmth, he added, referring to the American abstract painter, who was also a collector.By any measure, Mr. Hodgkin had unusually eclectic taste, beyond the comfort zone of many of todays investment-minded collectors.This was duly reflected in what was, in pure financial terms, a relatively modest return for a lifetime of collecting.The final total of $6.8 million was less than a tenth of the current auction high for a single painting by Mr. Twombly.Photo Had Mr. Hodgkin collected international contemporary art or held on to more of his own paintings an early 1980s Hodgkin sold at Christies earlier this month for $2.2 million that total would have been far higher.Proceeds would also have been boosted if the sale had included the artists renowned holdings of museum-quality Indian miniatures.Comprising some 130 drawings, the collection is being treated as a separate, single entity and will be available for sale privately at a price to be decided after the auction, according to Mr. Peattie.However, Sothebys auction did include two paintings by Mr. Hodgkin from the 1960s that he had retained.These earlier, more figurative works are not from the most coveted phase of the artists career, as was borne out by the below-estimate 248,750, or about $330,000, given by a British private collector for Bedroom (1960-61), and the failure of Travelling (1961) to attract any bids.But 20 proofs of prints by Mr. Hodgkin all soared above their estimates, led by a 32,500 (about $43,000) offer given by a bidder in the room for a proof of the large blue-and-white Frost (2000-2).Photo The prices of the prints were three or four times retail, said the London-based dealer Offer Waterman.But we werent treated to any of his first-rank paintings.They were transitional works.The most hotly contested artwork at the auction was instead the 1972 painting De-Luxe Tailors by the Indian modernist painter Bhupen Khakhar, who was a friend of Mr. Hodgkins.The bidding on this piece, which shows two tailors in their shop, soared to 1.1 million, or about $1.4 million, three times the estimate and an auction high for the artist.Sweet Bowl, the much-admired 1966 painting by the British artist Patrick Caulfield, also a lifelong friend, was another standout lot, selling for 524,750, or about $690,000.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The commercial appeal of the collection was further complicated by Mr. Hodgkins enthusiasm for fragments rather than objects in complete condition.Fragments were more potent than entire panels, because they freed the imagination, explained Mr. Peattie in his catalog foreword.These included a fragment of 17th-century Persian carpet, formerly owned by the legendary collector Robert von Hirsch, which sold for 224,750, or about $295,000.But there were also items like the bottom half of a 13th-century Persian Kashan luster pottery tile that failed to sell against a low estimate of 2,000, or about $2,600.In all, 14 percent of the lots were left unsold, a relatively high figure for the collection of a prominent private individual.Photo And then there were the elephants, featured in at least 40 of the Indian drawings included in the sale.Mr. Hodgkin regarded Rajasthans Kota-style portraits of elephants in particular as my downfall my Waterloo as a collector, according to the catalog.Yet all but one of his elephant drawings sold, with a Kota image of an elephant stampede from the late 18th or early 19th century selling for 32,500, more than 20 times the estimate.In the pure financial terms of the top end of the auction market, the sale of Mr. Hodgkins collection could not be regarded as serious or important.Yet the connoisseurial refinement and curiosity of Mr. Hodgkins taste served as a timely reminder of just how homogeneous the buying habits of todays investment-minded collectors have become.Last month Artnet News revealed that in the first six months of this year just 25 artists (Twombly comes in at No.5) accounted for almost half the $2.7 billion of sales at the worlds contemporary art auctions.During that same period, premodern works represented just 17 percent of the global auction turnover of fine art, according to a report published by Artprice, the lowest share yet recorded by the French website.It was a wonderful old-fashioned collection, said Ted Few, a London-based dealer, who bought a 17th-century German lime-wood relief sculpture for 1,500, or about $2,000, at the Hodgkin sale.Its very different from so many of todays collections.People are obsessed with specializing and are much more minimal in their approach.Admittedly, Mr. Hodgkin became wealthy enough not to have to worry about overspending on Indian drawings of elephants.But in todays finance-obsessed times, collectors have become much more reluctant to lose money and a lot less curious about art history.As a result, the wealthy now buy art like Mr. Hodgkin used to read Agatha Christie novels.They always begin at the end.
Fay Chiang, 65, Poet Who Championed Asian-American Culture, Dies:::::And she recalled how hard her father, Bay Doc Chiang, had to work.He had cleaned other peoples clothes since immigrating to the United States as a boy in the 1930s from Sunwei, in the southern coastal province of Guangdong, working in the laundry 16 hours a day six days a week while her mother, the former Hop Kun Leo, who was also from Sunwei, ran their modest home.In Parents, Ms. Chiang wrote about her father: hey!That dude was some snappy dresser.during the war, they let him work the navy yards as an apprentice steelwelder but when the soldiers came home laundry customers called him Charlie.(Charlie was almost certainly a reference to the fictional detective Charlie Chan, who was considered by many a racist Chinese stereotype.)Fay Ping Chiang was born in the Bronx on Jan. 27, 1952.While attending Hunter College in Manhattan, she became active in the movement against the Vietnam War and worked with student groups to establish Asian-American studies courses and programs at Hunter and other colleges in the City University of New York system.But she left college; as the eldest daughter, she was expected to care for her father, who was dying of cancer, and run the laundry.She eventually graduated from the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan with a degree in illustration.In the mid-1970s, Ms. Chiang took the first of what would be a series of jobs with nonprofit groups when she became executive director of the Basement Workshop in Chinatown, a social and cultural organization that mainly served the Asian-American arts community.She was a steadfast believer that cultural and educational work was the key to activism, John Kuo Wei Tchen, a historian at New York University and founding director of the universitys Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program and Institute, wrote in an email.She always talked about people needing to realize they had choices and could get unstuck in their lives.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After a dozen years with the Basement Workshop, Ms. Chiang worked at the Henry Street Settlements outreach program; in New York Newsdays public affairs department; at Project Reach, a youth program based in Chinatown; and Poets & Writers, a readings and workshop program.In recent years she had painted dozens of portraits of people, many of them youngsters, who were killed by law enforcement.I think people need to see the faces of these young people, Ms. Chiang told the news website DNAinfo in 2015 when she exhibited the portraits at the Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts on West 39th Street in Manhattan.In addition to her daughter, Ms. Chiang is survived by her sisters, Jean and Janice Chiang.She never married.Her brother, Peter, died in 1982.Ms. Chiang documented the toll that metastatic breast cancer had taken on her in Landmarks and Geography, a 2012 poem that opens with a list of each surgery and each tumor, node and breast that had been removed from her.Despite three tumors still in one lung, sciatica coursing from her spine to her toes and pain from scars, she wrote that she felt joy at still standing and still walking all hours of the day the streets of this city of my birth; Chinatown, the Lower East Side, And East Village my home.wind, sun, rain, snow sleet elements against my open face still alive.
‘Stranger Things’ Season 2 Premiere Recap: Lingering Effects:::::All of this amounts to the most encouraging thing about the season premiere.(Rebel Billys starter stache being a close second.)For all of the tres-80s trappings, Reeses Pieces and paranormal pyrotechnics, the creators Matt and Ross Duffer have kept Stranger Things grounded in the story of a bunch of relatively normal people who went through an extraordinary and cataclysmic experience.Stranger Things was a kick thanks to its (exhaustively documented) references and Goonie thrills.But it resonated because its tale of monsters and plucky outsiders channeled the heart as well as the aesthetics of its influences.Market demands aside, it wasnt clear that the show even needed a second season, and the Duffers silly insistence that it be called Stranger Things 2 like a real movie sequel!suggested the sort of showrunner overreach that scuttled the sophomore seasons of other recent summer sensations, like True Detective and UnREAL.So it comes as a nice surprise that the second season instead evinces the best of serial television, expanding the story and moving it forward while honoring the characters and the often traumatic paths that brought them here.Photo On the expansion side we have the aforementioned Billy (Dacre Montgomery), who brought his bitchin Camaro, snug Canadian tuxedo and stink of adolescent danger to town from California.His sister (maybe?)Max (Sadie Sink) is a Dig Dug savant, and the obsession of Lucas and the newly toothed Dustin.(Gaten Matarazzo continues to steal every scene hes in.)The always great Brett Gelman (Twin Peaks: The Return, Eagleheart) is on hand as an investigator whos possibly fleecing Barbs folks, but who also has legitimate-sounding intel about Eleven.The season actually began with a broadening of the story, tracking a robber gang fleeing the police through the streets of Pittsburgh.After one of them mentally tricks a cop into crashing his and the other cars in pursuit, a 008 tattoo on her wrist reminds us that, oh right, there are potentially at least 10 other Elevens running around to spark telekinetic mayhem and future subplots.Well return to Eight at some point, presumably, but after the brief introduction we landed back in Hawkins, Ind., a few days before Halloween, 1984, not quite a year after the events of Season 1.The boys are budding video junkies, dumping too many quarters into the then-revolutionary but actually pretty lame animated game Dragons Lair.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Soon the Upside Down beckons, and Will beholds a fiery storm in the gloom.This becomes a talking point for his next exam at the Hawkins National Laboratory, the source of all the trouble last year, but thats all transdimensional water under the bridge now, apparently.(That was one thing that didnt scan for me.)Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get expert TV and movie recommendations from the Watching newsletter The best of what to watch and where to watch it, delivered to your inbox twice a week.Paul Reiser, riffing on his duplicitous Aliens character, has replaced Matthew Modine as the master of Upside Down ceremonies.He explains that although Will thinks, 1.)hes dimension-hopping; and 2.)that a malevolent force is saying it wants to kill everyone, what hes really experiencing is post-traumatic stress.I need you to realize Im on your side, he tells a skeptical Joyce.(Note: He is probably not on her side.)With its tendril-like limbs and leafy face flaps, the Demogorgon had a botanical quality: Last year, I called it a monster mash-up of Alien, Predator and a Venus flytrap, and I stand by the description.This time around the menace seems even more explicitly vegetal.Work in the lab involves a lot of pruning via flamethrower while, on the outskirts of town, the pumpkin patches have begun to resemble Civil War battlefields.You dont have to be Sheriff Hopper to see a connection.What you do have to be him to see, at least for now, is Eleven.Youll recall that at the end of last season, he was leaving out Eggos for her apparently at some point he made contact and was able to take her in.The arrangement offers a poignant second chance for Hopper, who lost his own daughter to illness, even as Mike and perhaps Eleven suffer from the separation.Well see how long it lasts.Stranger Things 2 (sigh) deserves credit for not immediately defaulting to Eleven and the Nerds Ride Again, but you can bet it will get there before long.A Few Thoughts While We Crank It Up The premiere did a decent job of mixing in less played-out 80s hits, like Oingo Boingos Just Another Day, with the more obvious ones (Whip It, Talking in Your Sleep).But sometimes the most obvious option is the best one: Rock You Like a Hurricane is the only choice for a denim-clad cheese ball like Billy.Nancy switched up her hairstyle, but the thing she really needs to change is sitting next to her, bungling his college admissions essay.That would be Steve, whos already envisioning working for his dad and settling down.Run, Nancy!Its too late for Barb save yourself!Disclosure: I havent accepted Samwise Gamgee romancing Winona Ryder.

OESTREICH Read our review of John Eliot Gardiners Monteverdi trilogy.And our conversation with Mr. Gardiner.AT 2 MINUTES 23 SECONDS Gripping Grief Appreciative audiences packed Alice Tully Hall for all three nights of John Eliot Gardiners magnificent survey of Monteverdis three surviving operas with his Monteverdi Choir and the English Baroque Soloists.It was hard not to wonder, though, about the Monteverdi operas lost to us, maybe seven or more.All we have of Arianna, for example, is the title characters sublimely tragic lament.Here is the great Italian soprano Anna Caterina Antonacci in a gripping semi-staged performance of the lament from Amsterdam in 2007.I love the moment when this abandoned Arianna rises slowly to her feet to convey her grief directly to all who will listen.Imagine hearing the entire opera.ANTHONY TOMMASINI AT 12 SECONDS Lust Rewarded Orfeo was groundbreaking, and Il Ritorno dUlisse in Patria suffused with warm humanity.But LIncoronazione di Poppea is the surviving Monteverdi opera thats most startlingly contemporary, that most dazzles and seduces.A tale of lust rewarded, of immorality triumphant, it closes with the sublime Pur ti miro, which here, sung by Rachel Yakar and Eric Tappy and directed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, is a love duet as much between a woman and her new crown (watch Ms. Yakars eyes flash in an orgasm of ambition) as between two lovers.ZACHARY WOOLFE AT 1 MINUTE 5 SECONDS Breathlessly Fast Talk about truth in branding.The invaluable organization Young Concert Artists opened its New York season on Tuesday with a recital at Zankel Hall by Nathan Lee, a precocious pianist from the Seattle area who is just 16.With a fluid technique and good musical instincts, he gave lively, articulate accounts of works by Bach and Mozart, and showed a flair for jazz in a piece by the 20th-century Russian composer Nikolai Kapustin.Mr. Lee is still maturing, of course.He was more comfortable tossing off the virtuosic challenges of Grnfelds concert paraphrase of Die Fledermaus than exploring the depths of Chopins complex Sonata in B minor.Still, listen to his fearless performance of Ravels daunting Alborada del gracioso during a competition in 2016, when he was still 14.Check out those breathlessly fast repeated notes.ANTHONY TOMMASINI AT 2 MINUTES 24 SECONDS Bach Unadorned The Iranian harpsichordist Mahan Esfahani, who appeared in New York earlier this year for an adventurous program that juxtaposed Steve Reich and Baroque classics, returned this week to play Bachs Goldberg Variations at the Miller Theater.Mr. Esfahani is constantly making a case for the harpsichord, and his recent Goldbergs recording for Deutsche Grammophon is no exception.With surprising tempos and thoughtful phrasing, the album assertively justifies its place in a crowded field of piano versions.(The Goldbergs, for the record, were originally written for harpsichord.)Mr. Esfahani often distills the piece to its purest form, such as in the opening Aria: Gone is the French-inflected ornamentation, though he brings it back when the passages repeat.Its jarring to hear for the first time, but Mr. Esfahanis unpretentious approach has a kind of grandeur as it unfolds over the course of Bachs 30 variations.JOSHUA BARONE AT 1 HOUR 4 MINUTES 48 SECONDS The Tension Breaks Listeners who heard the Emerson String Quartets tautly sustained reading of Shostakovichs funereal Quartet No.15 in Lincoln Centers White Light Festival on Tuesday may have found the work daringly modernist, with its seven conjoined movements all marked adagio.Daring and discomfiting it is, but Haydn did something similar in his Seven Last Words of Christ, which exists in quartet and oratorio versions as well as the orchestral original.But Haydn provides relief (if that is the word) at the end, unleashing the earthquake after Jesus death.Jordi Savall and Le Concert des Nations produced an elaborate video of a performance in 2009, for the 200th anniversary of Haydns death.Be warned: For full effect the ending requires the preceding hour of adagios.JAMES R. OESTREICH AT 30 MINUTES 50 SECONDS Timeless Wishful Thinking At the Metropolitan Opera recently, Mozarts reliably charming The Magic Flute had audience members laughing often in particularly at the comic sidekick Papageno, sung by the Austrian baritone Markus Werba.In the operas opening scene, three women sent by the Queen of the Night seal his mouth with a padlock for telling self-aggrandizing lies.When they remove it later, the ladies sing a cautionary number, as if they were Willy Wonkas Oompa Loompas.Their message: If only all liars got locks upon their mouths, then hate, slander and rancor would be replaced by love and brotherhood.The Met audience, perhaps worn down by a year or more of bitter post-truth politics, let out a long and knowing laugh.JOSHUA BARONE AT 5 MINUTES 20 SECONDS A Glimpse of the Cosmic The duet Je viens solliciter, from Verdis masterpiece Don Carlos, always strikes me as perhaps the saddest in opera.Carlos and lisabeth are betrothed when a peace treaty suddenly marries her to his father, the king of Spain.She could protest, but only at the expense of the masses suffering in the war her marriage would end, and she chooses civic duty over personal happiness.By this duet, Carlos has become her stepson; catching a rare private moment, they sing of regret, longing and impossible love.Here are Sonya Yoncheva and Jonas Kaufmann in a passionate yet controlled recent new production at the Paris Opera, directed by Krzysztof Warlikowski.In this moment, lisabeths reserve drops as she admits that to have been able to be with Carlos would have been paradise.As he answers, the best orchestral renditions Philippe Jordans here is excellent give a glimpse of the cosmic, as if were seeing spread out before us the possible lives these two vexed people could have had together.ZACHARY WOOLFE Read our review of the new Don Carlos production in Paris.
What Are the Billboard Charts Really Measuring?:::::Photo The Popcast is hosted by Jon Caramanica, a pop music critic for The New York Times.It covers the latest in pop music criticism, trends and news.Earlier this month, Billboard announced that it would alter the formulas it uses to build its singles and albums charts, moving to a weighted system that will favor streaming plays on paid subscription services (Amazon, Apple Music, the paid tier of Spotify) over plays on free or ad-supported streaming services (like YouTube).What Are the Billboard Charts Really Measuring?This marks a shift in what the charts particularly the Hot 100 represent.It is Billboards belief that assigning values to the levels of consumer engagement and access along with the compensation derived from those options better reflects the varied user activity occurring on these services, Billboard wrote.Which is to say, how many people listen to and engage with a song matters, but how much money a song earns matters as well.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Louder Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.This announcement follows a surprising and exciting year for the Hot 100 singles chart, which included the meme-driven ascent of Rae Sremmurd and Gucci Manes Black Beatles and Migoss Bad and Boujee, the lengthy conquest of Despacito, and the breakout success of Cardi Bs Bodak Yellow (Money Moves), which even Taylor Swift couldnt halt.The current No.1 on the Hot 100, Post Malone and 21 Savages Rockstar is a unique case, too: a cut of the song appears on YouTube that features the songs hook looped over and over again, and plays of this version of the track count toward its streaming totals.On this weeks Popcast, Mr. Caramanica discusses the text and subtext of the Billboard Hot 100, and how the rule changes might punish certain audiences and genres, with Joe Coscarelli, pop music reporter for The New York Times, and David Turner, senior staff writer at Track Record.Email your questions, thoughts and ideas about whats happening in pop music to popcast@nytimes.com.
Motion Picture Academy Moves to Institute Code of Conduct:::::Photo Nodding to critics who contend that the movie industry hasnt done enough to fight sexual harassment, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Thursday that it would be establishing a code of conduct for its members.According to an email sent to members by the Academys chief executive, Dawn Hudson, the new rules will include a policy for evaluating alleged violations and determining if action regarding membership is warranted.This comes on the heels of the Academy, which is the de facto governing body of the movie industry, expelling Harvey Weinstein two weeks ago, breaking with 90 years of precedent.At the time, the Academy said in a statement that it would, work to establish ethical standards of conduct that all academy members will be expected to exemplify.But still, it has faced criticism in recent weeks, given that Roman Polanski, who pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor in 1977, and Bill Cosby still remain members.Ms. Hudson said in the letter that the Academy would consult experts in law and ethics to gain a better understanding of what more we can and should be doing.She added, Although we have no intention of functioning as an investigative body or moral court, we do have a right and duty as a voluntary association to maintain clear standards of workplace behavior for those we accept as members.

Snoh Aalegra Featuring Logic, Sometimes The slow-and-low hip-hop-soul saunter of 1995-97 finds new life in Sometimes, one of the standout songs from the impressive new Snoh Aalegra album FEELS.On this song, she floats somewhere between neo-soul its original incarnation and trip-hop, singing breathily and with purpose.A slickly sneering verse from Logic adds acid and bite.J.C. Sleigh Bells, And Saints So long, power chords.And Saints, from a coming EP titled Kid Kruschev, sets aside Sleigh Bells usual drums-and-guitar bravado for a different minimal configuration: just motoric bass notes and high, filmy synthesizer tones enfolding Alexis Krausss distraught voice and elusive tidings: Temple throb, dust lakes/Black gold, tigers and saints.Whatever she's going through is more than a headache.J.P. Kap G Featuring Lil Baby, Pull Up Kap G is one of hip-hops underrated melodists.He sing-raps with a slur, leaving his vocals round and a little fuzzy.Pull Up plays to his strengths he sounds woozy, sweet, a little distant, easing between tight clusters of words and dreamy smeared syllables.Behind him, the beat produced by Young TT & Squat Beats tinkles and creeps while Kap G elegantly swerves.J.C. John McNeil and Mike Fahie, Can Do Heres an item on the list of things we dont see a lot of anymore in jazz: a close rapport between two musicians, forged on the jam session stage, week after week over a series of years.But thats what John McNeil, a trumpeter, and Mike Fahie, a trombonist, have developed.They spent roughly a decade leading sessions at watering holes around New York, mentoring younger musicians and deepening a repertoire.Still, for their debut album together, Plainsong, theyve put the focus on their original compositions, not standard fare.The tunes are harmonically snaked and rhythmically relentless; they highlight the horn players teasing interplay, and keep the stellar rhythm section the pianist Ethan Iverson, the bassist Joe Martin and the drummer Billy Hart on the move.Mr. McNeil and Mr. Fahie wrote the uptempo Can Do together, and its a highlight.G.R.
The Women Behind ‘Good Girls Revolt’ Think the Time Is Right to Revive the Feminist Show:::::Now, fans of the series are wondering whether it might have survived under different leadership.Dana Calvo, the shows creator and executive producer, said in a phone interview that when she went to pitch a second season of Good Girls Revolt to Mr. Price on Nov. 30, 2016, she learned that he had never watched the first.He confirmed that by having us refer to the characters by the actresses names, she said.He was unfamiliar.Still, she was surprised to learn the very next day that it would not be picked up for a second season.It didnt line up.It was confusing.It just didnt make sense, she said.The series was inspired by a nonfiction book, The Good Girls Revolt, by Lynn Povich, a journalist who worked at Newsweek during the 1960s.She was one of dozens of women who filed a sex discrimination lawsuit against the newsmagazine in 1970.The actor Joy Bryant played Eleanor Holmes Norton in the series, a character named for the real-life lawyer who represented the women suing Newsweek.All the actors who worked on the show understood the importance of what we were doing, and how we really needed to honor the story and honor these women, Ms. Bryant said in a phone interview.She spent time getting to know Ms. Norton, who became the first woman to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1977 and is now the District of Columbias delegate to the United States House of Representatives.Ms. Bryant said she was blindsided when the show was not picked up for a second season, and the drama was heightened by real-world events.Season 1 began streaming on Amazon in late October, just before Donald J. Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I know were talking about TV, but it was sort of a microcosm of what was going on, she said.We thought we had it in the bag.Theres no way hes going to win.Theres no way were getting canceled.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.That happened, and that happened, and it was like were really operating against some crazy forces right now, she said.Anna Camp, who played the strait-laced magazine researcher Jane Hollander, said she was shocked when the series was not renewed.Then she heard about Mr. Prices resignation.It was just so meta, or twisted, when we found out Roy Price had been accused of sexual harassment, she added.So many frustrated fans were reaching out and saying, Now that hes gone, maybe the show could come back.Ms. Povich said the outcry reminded her that there is power in numbers, a lesson she learned at Newsweek during the 1960s and 1970s.It was a complicated time, Ms. Povich said, adding that the newsmagazine resisted hiring permanent female writers even after the 1970 complaint.A second lawsuit in 1972 laid out more concrete goals and seemed to achieve better results, including Ms. Povichs appointment to a senior editor position in 1975.Ms. Povich worked with Ms. Calvo to shape the show and said she was sorry to see it end.I cannot tell you how many young women I heard from who loved the series, and who also had no idea what my generation or their mothers generation or their grandmothers generation went through, she said.Ms. Calvo said the series got a warm reception from fans and good reviews on the website Rotten Tomatoes, where it has a 96 percent general audience approval rating.(The sites approved critics gave the show a rating of 71 percent.)In a review last October, The New York Times called the series well-timed, well-meaning, with a few smart takes, but added that it just misses the nuance and rounded characters that separate timeless fiction from the news of the week.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Amazon Studios, the companys original programming division, does not release viewership data.We had high hopes for Good Girls Revolt when it was green-lighted, but it had a low season completion rate, and did not perform well on the service, the company said in an emailed statement.A spokesman would not speculate on whether the company might consider signing on for a second season, and declined to confirm who made the decision not to renew in 2016.Ms. Povich said that in light of the harassment allegations against Mr. Price, Amazon should look at the series again with a much more objective point of view.Ms. Camp agreed.To have our voices taken away from us so abruptly, and to have it all unfold the way it has, has been incredibly frustrating, she said.I miss Jane, and I really want to play her again.

A New London Theater Aims to Stage a Revolution:::::Part of a glossy new development, the theater looks on to two of the citys most recognizable landmarks: Tower Bridge and the Tower of London.Photo Its two miles to the east of Londons Theaterland but it is a world away from the cramped facilities of the West Ends Victorian venues, with their restrictive proscenium arch layouts.The Bridges auditorium is fully flexible.The stage for Young Marx extends into the audience; the audience sits on three sides, with seats raked over four tiers.Yet the space feels remarkably intimate, and even the cheap seats costing under $20 have decent sightlines.Critics, lukewarm about the play but effusive about the venue, have been quick to point out the irony of opening Londons first wholly new, large-scale commercial theater in 80 years with a play about an critic of capitalism.Yet the theater is attempting to, well, bridge the usual approaches of the commercial and subsidized sectors in the UK.For starters, its largely dedicated to new writing a notoriously tricky sell at the box office.Few untested plays open in the West End.New writing can also suffer from a reputation for dry worthiness, a notion Mr. Hytner aims to dispel.New writing doesnt have to be a ghettoized, virtuous thing, he said.These are new shows that aim to communicate widely.And if were ever going to find a Curious Incident or The History Boys, theyre going to be new things.Mr. Hytner also insisted that there is a big audience out there.They flock to the shows they want to see, he said.A lot of them musicals, quite a lot of them not.Indeed, a raft of plays have transferred from subsidized theaters to the West End in recent years including new writing from venues such as the Almeida (Ink; King Charles III) and the Royal Court (The Ferryman; Hangmen) as well as the National.Advertisement Continue reading the main story New writing is always risky, but the work has been so good, audiences are more receptive now, said Nica Burns, a West End producer who credits the increasing collaboration between subsidized and commercial theaters.This is why we have such a healthy theater, with so many plays in the West End compared to Broadway.Photo The Bridges investors seem convinced that if an appetite for bold new plays has been nourished by thriving government-funded theaters and a culture of transfers, they can be originated in a commercial venue in the first place.The 12 million, or about $16 million, construction costs were raised upfront from venture capitalists.But the model is based on the two Nicks experience running a building, and theyre deliberately swerving away from the more usual path of renting a theater.A West End producer puts up all the money, takes all the risk, and because there are so many fighting for relatively few theaters, they have to take the terms youd expect, Mr. Hytner said.He added that they dont get the revenue from the bars, the programs, the ice creams.I know from the National that the profit margin on ice-cream is something you want to keep!Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Owning the Bridge means Mr. Hytner and Mr. Starr have the opportunity to rake those retail profits in.But crucially, it also means theyll avoid the particular pressure of budgeting on a show-by-show basis.We dont have to show a return on every single play, Mr. Hytner said.Its a cash-flow business.That graph can go up and down quite considerably, but if we play at over 75 percent were doing brilliantly.Thats not even really a target because if, say, Julius Caesar plays to 95 percent it doesnt really matter what the plays either side of it do.Such long-view financial flexibility will allow Mr. Hytner and Mr. Starr to program the work they like: theater which is ambitious, as Mr. Hytner defines it.And theres surely another lesson from the subsidized sector: To be ambitious, you have to be able to afford to fail sometimes.Mr. Hytner is evidently relieved to have shrugged off the burden of overseeing a national institution, however.Everybody knows what a National Theater should be, what the repertoire should be, he said.The fact is that everyone, of course, knows differently.Now, he is free to do as he pleases just so long as what pleases him pleases the audience.
‘Terry Richardson Is Just the Tip of the Iceberg’:::::Porter, the Net-a-Porter magazine, also said it was no longer working with Mr. Richardson.So did Hearst magazines, which owns Elle, Harpers Bazaar, Esquire and Marie Claire.Mr. Richardson had already been commissioned to shoot the January cover of Elle and had recently done so.It is now being redone by another photographer.Bulgari, Diesel and Valentino, all brands that recently worked with Mr. Richardson on their ad campaigns, issued statements stating that they had no plans to work with him in the future.It all sounds very responsible.But some industry insiders have begun to question whether fashions efforts to distance itself from Mr. Richardson is an attempt to Band-Aid over a deeper crisis, to make a public example of an offender already accused in order to appear to be taking action, when a much broader and more systemic approach needs to be adopted.Photo Edie Campbell, a model who has been featured in campaigns for Chanel and Dior, among others, said: The reality is that the floodgates are already open regarding Terry Richardson.Hes been blacklisted once before, and its not that much of an emotional, psychological or commercial leap to blacklist him again.The difficulty is addressing the other people the ones who are celebrated by the fashion industry, and who are still at the very heart of it.This will not be solved simply by banning the use of one photographer.While there are many creative and morally reputable professionals in the industry, it is also rife with reports of lines being crossed.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The problem is much larger than Terry, who has become the scapegoat, and the quickest means for this industry to absolve itself from any responsibility, said David Bonnouvrier, the co-founder of DNA Models.Katie Grand, the editor of Love magazine and a stylist who works with brands including Marc Jacobs and Miu Miu, and who earlier this week reposted a statement from Ms. Campbell on Instagram to the same effect, wrote in an email: I dont want to sound like Im defending him, but I thought it was important to put into perspective that every model has a story of a photographer, client, art director, stylist behaving inappropriately.Mr. Richardson was widely pilloried in 2014 when allegations of behavior that included cavorting naked on shoots and forcing his penis on models surfaced in the news media.Mr. Richardson has not denied his behavior but has always maintained that any sexual activity was consensual, and no criminal charges were ever filed.No major new allegations have appeared since 2014, and he had reportedly gone through therapy.He recently had twins and got married.Photo Numerous magazines cut ties with Mr. Richardson around 2014, though he had gradually returned to the industry, working with celebrities including Miley Cyrus and Beyonc as well as magazines and brands.When Roberta Myers was the editor of Elle (she recently stepped down), she had forbidden the magazine to work with Mr. Richardson, but after Nina Garcia was appointed as Elles new editor, he was commissioned to photograph the actress Zo Kravitz for the January 2018 cover.After The New York Times published its account detailing allegations of Harvey Weinsteins sexual harassment and abuse, Joanna Coles, the chief content officer of Hearst, and Ms. Garcia decided to cancel the Elle cover photographed by Mr. Richardson and to reshoot it, a Hearst spokeswoman confirmed.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.American Vogue stopped working with Mr. Richardson in 2010, when the first public statements about his behavior appeared, but in the last two years he had done shoots for Vogue China, Vogue France, Korean W, German GQ and Italian GQ, among others.Recently he shot a story for the November issue of W, a Cond Nast magazine, for the first time since 2011.(Mr. Richardsons photographs have also appeared in T: The New York Times Style Magazine, but not since 2012.)A Cond Nast spokeswoman said that Stefano Tonchi, the editor of W, was not available for comment.But according to a person familiar with the shoot who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media, the magazine had decided it was time to give Mr. Richardson another chance.Editors were on set during the shoot and also handled the model casting.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the wake of the current revelations about the behavior of men in power, including Bill OReilly and Leon Weiseltier, however, Mr. Richardsons past behavior once again made news.The Sunday Times of London revisited the story (the day before Cond Nast International sent its memo).A petition was started on Change.org asking magazines and other brands to stop using Mr. Richardson; it has over 42,000 signatures.The designer Prabal Gurung posted on Instagram: It is important that we hold everyone accountable who worked with Terry Richardson.Not to shame them, but to understand the intention & motive behind their decision to turn a blind eye to his horrific actions.Clearly they cannot say they didnt know, because we all knew.The question now becomes: What else does fashion know?Trish Goff, a former top model who has spoken about her experience with Mr. Weinstein, said that during her modeling years, there were other girls and agents who would warn you about a photographer.Theyd say, Be mindful of him, or Dont let him convince you to take off your clothes.Athena Currey, who modeled from 1993 to 2008, said that when she was a 19-year-old working in Paris, her agency sent her on a shoot with a photographer who called her later that night at her hostel to describe how much he wanted to make love to me.The next day, she told her agent, a woman, that the conversation made her very uncomfortable and that she did not want to work with him again.Everyone said, Of course, of course, Ms. Currey said now.Then a week later, my agent called me and said: I have a really important job, and I really think you should do it.Only its with that photographer.And then she put a huge amount of pressure on me to get over it and do the job.And I know they sent other girls to him afterward.The agency, which was a minor presence in the industry, appears to have closed.None of the models who discussed their experiences for this article said their agents ever talked to them about how to handle unwanted advances from photographers, even if they knew their clients were likely to encounter them.Carolyn Kramer, a former co-director of Marilyn Models and a former casting director at Self magazine who currently owns an art gallery in Provincetown, Mass., said: It all came back to the money.If an agency sees potential in a 15-year-old girl, then it doesnt matter to them what may be happening behind the scenes if the girl can get a campaign.I give myself a C- for what I was able to accomplish to protect my girls.We all sold our souls to the devil so the model could become famous.Photo Amber Valletta, a model, actress and activist, said she was asked to take her top off during her first modeling summer in Italy when she was 15 and, on another occasion, was asked by a model booker at a magazine to disrobe.When Ms. Valletta was 18 or 19, she said, a photographer came to her hotel room, asked to give her a massage and began rubbing her breasts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She said she thought the most important next step was putting structures in place throughout the industry to protect all involved, from garment workers to models.My experiences were so minor compared to stories I have heard, she said.You start taking one person down, and the skies are going to fall.Cond Nast is aware of the risk.On Thursday, in a email to internal management as well as outside contractors, Bob Sauerberg, the chief executive of Cond Nast, and Jonathan Newhouse, the chairman, wrote: All employees, freelancers and independent contractors must understand the companys expectations of appropriate behavior and treatment of others.Cond Nast also expects the agencies that represent hired talent to develop, circulate and reinforce with their clients what is and is not acceptable behavior in interacting with others, with particular emphasis on protecting people who are in vulnerable positions in their professional relationships.Ms. Kramer said, Terry Richardson is just the tip of the iceberg.If magazines distanced themselves from everybody that has been implicated in this kind of behavior, there would be a lot fewer contributing photographers in their pages.
It’s Always Fishnets Season Somewhere:::::That look is dated, for sure, bearing little resemblance to what many prostitutes actually wear, but those images have proliferated just the same, a common sight this fall at concerts, on theater screens and in a flurry of luxury ad campaigns.Seedily costumed streetwalkers are a magnet to fans of The Deuce, about 1970s-era Times Square and the rise of its infant pornography industry.A leather-clad vixen grinds her stilettos into a fleshy male torso in one of the Steven Klein videos on display this month in Fetish, an exhibition organized in partnership with Visionaire magazine at the venerable Sothebys auction house.And a manga-inspired old-school prostitute, resplendent in shrill fuchsia fur, is among the vivid attractions of Blade Runner 2049.The very prevalence of such images, overworked as they may be, is a testament to their durability.It is reason enough to look more closely at a position advanced by scholars and style arbiters alike: that the clothes we wear, or might like to wear, owe a very real debt to the worlds most ancient profession.Fashion right now is influenced by hookers, said Anna Terrazas, the costume designer of The Deuce.Its not the other way around.In a sea of eye-numbing conventionality, a maverick appearance is their signature.For someone employed on the busy streets, Ms. Terrazas said, the point is to be seen.Not a groundbreaking concept, exactly.There is an untold history of the relationship between sex workers and fashion, said Rebecca Arnold, a fashion historian and lecturer at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London.As fashions early adopters, working women routinely took up what their respectable contemporaries shunned as too showy, tasteless or new.Photo The dubious woman could be more outlandish in her dress, and more experimental, Ms. Arnold said.She is allied with the idea of fashion as linked, not necessarily with the avant-garde, but with the beginning of new dress trends.Among the more fashionably progressive were the grandes horizontales of the 19th century, courtesans like Cora Pearl, a client of Charles Worth, the eras first celebrity designer; and Catherine Walters (Skittles to her public), riveting on horseback as she paraded through Hyde Park sewn into her riding ensembles.Her style was much copied by noblewomen of the day.Advertisement Continue reading the main story More recently, to hear it from the prostitutes themselves, down-market variations on that patrician theme have been reduced to a series of musty clichs.Fashion doesnt produce a vast range of ideas of what female sexuality looks like, said Annie Sprinkle, a writer, sex educator and former prostitute.Stereotypes abound, she noted, with the upper echelons of the profession embodied by the aspirational up-and-comer cloaked in cashmere and silk and the role-play specialist dressed in pinstripes or a schoolgirl smock.The more down-market variations flaunt fishnets, kinky boots, hot pants, fur chubbies and harnesses.Its a visual code dating at least from the 70s, tatty and archaic even then.Yet it is routinely resurrected by top-tier designers including Marc Jacobs, John Galliano and Alexander Wang, each gussying up his offerings in sumptuous fabrics or in a mash-up of fetish, athletic and military gear, to tamp down the steamy aggression and make the look palatable to an affluent clientele.Photo The gambit works.In the disco era, fashion was inspired by drag queens and prostitutes, said Tom Fitzgerald, one half of Tom & Lorenzo, an opinionated fashion blog.Fashion in general is always borrowing from street wear, and it doesnt get more street wear than hooker.Those references, fixtures in the lexicon of style, are mainstream now.Is there a specific sex worker look anymore?Mr. Fitzgerald said.Or does it all get pulled from the sexy pile at Forever 21?Like hip-hop and grunge, the look has been normalized, he said.Its never been more respectable.Or apparently more covetable.In The Deuce, Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the prostitute Candy, swivels her hips in a working-girl wardrobe of short shorts, skimpy tops and lightly soiled coats.The actress reminisced the other day about her fixation with its centerpiece, a boxy fur chubby, a down-market variation on a famously scandalizing look introduced in the 70s by Yves Saint Laurent, one inspired by the wartime prostitutes of the Rue Saint-Denis.Photo Seemingly unaware of its provenance, Ms. Gyllenhaal went on, I wanted to wear that jacket in every scene.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She wasnt alone.It became such an iconic piece on the set, Ms. Terrazas said.All of the girls were, like, I want a jacket like that.Pop performers like to tap the look as an assertion of power, often treading a fine line between owning their sexuality and trading on it.Cardi B, a retired stripper-ho, as she boasts, has been accused of glamorizing prostitution.She makes no apology.Nor does Nicki Minaj, who turned up at a fashion show this fall wearing lace-up hot pants, over-the-knee boots and an ermine stole, her image an echo of Julia Robertss pre-makeover turnout in Pretty Woman.
Rosie O’Donnell Joins Cast of David Rabe Play:::::Photo Rosie ODonnell will return to the stage in the New Group production of David Rabes Good for Otto this spring.She will join Ed Harris and Amy Madigan in a cast that, according to an announcement on Thursday, will also include F. Murray Abraham, Rileigh McDonald and Michael Rabe, the playwrights son.A former talk-show host and self-proclaimed theater fanatic, Ms. ODonnell played Golde in Fiddler on the Roof on Broadway in 2005, and had parts in the musicals Seussical and Grease, but this will be her first steady role in an Off Broadway production.(She was part of the rotating cast in Love, Loss and What I Wore.)Good for Otto tells the story of the doctors, patients, and families connected by a rural Connecticut mental health clinic.Ms. ODonnell is slated to play Nora, the foster mother of a daughter, Frannie, who suffers from serious depression.The productions director, Scott Elliott, explained in an interview that the casting of Ms. ODonnell was a result of their friendship and mutual desire to work together.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Ive asked her to do some readings over the years, he said.I just think shes an amazing actress.When I read this play, which really speaks to the human condition, I thought this was a role shed really relate to because shes a thoughtful and compassionate person.I didnt think shed do it, he added, but I sent it to her and in less than 24 hours she responded and said she would.The play premiered in 2015 at Chicagos Gift Theater.In a New York Times review, Charles Isherwood wrote: Mr. Rabe digs into his subject with a depth that almost feels bottomless.The New York production will begin previews Feb. 20 for a March 8 opening at the Pershing Square Signature Center.
A Dutch Treasure Trove Returns to New Amsterdam:::::The European Fine Art Fair, known as TEFAF and held every March in the southern Dutch city of Maastricht, had a reputation for stability: the same dealers year after year, bringing their choicest paintings, furniture, and diamond brooches to a well-heeled collector base.But a roiling art market, and increasingly eclectic tastes, led the Dutch fair to set out for New York and to establish a pair of satellite events, spring and fall, that brought the gentility of Maastricht to a new American crowd.The autumn fair, whose second edition opens this weekend at the Park Avenue Armory, stretches from the dawn of time to around World War I.Even if youre not in the market for Flemish tapestries, Chinese porcelain or a mourning angel by Antonio Canova, the 95 exhibitors here offer a bounty of surprises for connoisseurs and amateurs alike.And a mini-show of pinhole photography by Vera Lutter, displayed by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, brings this showcase of the past right up to the present day.Here are a few prizes that caught my eye during a preview.CHARLES EDE Photo TEFAF includes a hefty sampling of Greek and Roman art, but this London dealer has brought something older and from further afield: a Persian rhyton, or ceremonial drinking vessel, that dates to around 1000 BC.The terra cotta vessel takes the shape of a zebu bull, and though it would have served a ritual purpose, its simplified forms curve with the easy elegance that Picasso would lavish on bovines nearly 3,000 years later.Hundreds of decorative scratches run from his horns to his hindquarters, and two metal earrings, on either side of the vessels spout, make this an uncommonly punk antiquity.VANDERVEN ORIENTAL ART Photo Within a diverse and sumptuous display of Chinese porcelain and statuary, this Dutch specialist gallery has brought an alluring pair of Tang dynasty stone lokapalas, or tomb guardians.These sentries between this world and the next wear ornate body armor frond-shaped helmet crests and flaming epaulets and raise their legs to stomp on ill-fated evil ghouls.Now they appear the color of coral, but look closely at their breastplates and spaulders, and you can still see traces of green and red paint that would have made these sentinels appear even more fearsome.Advertisement Continue reading the main story DANIEL CROUCH RARE BOOKS Photo In the late 18th century, about a thousand years after an anonymous Chinese sculptor carved those tomb guardians, the mapmaker Huang Qianren completed a stunning map of the world for the Qianlong Emperor.The edition here, more than seven feet long and printed in a brilliant blue, depicts the Middle Kingdom as a dynamic network of cities and town hooked up by waterways, and cradled by bumpy seas.China takes up nearly all the surface of this world map, and the Qing dynastys trading partners of Britain and the Netherlands are nearly forgotten in a corner; for this mapmaker, as for his imperial patron, anything beyond China barely counted as civilization at all.
Politicians Are Bad at Podcasting:::::There is plenty of like-minded confabbing Mr. Sanders interviewing Elizabeth Warren, Mr. Duffy interviewing fellow Republican members of Congress that makes everybody look right and good.And in Chicago Stories, with Mr. Emanuel, this combative mayor recasts himself as a kinder, gentler interlocutor of anodyne local figures, like brewery owners and spoken-word poets.Its working.The Chicago Tribune has praised the podcast for showing what can happen when a control-the-narrative mayor loosens the reins just a little.You know, on the podcast he controls completely.Excepting Mr. Duffy, this is largely a Democratic phenomenon, and not because people who listen to podcasts are more liberal.Podcast listeners are only a little more left-leaning than America at large: According to Edison Research, 27 percent of Americans identify as Republicans, compared with 24 percent of adult podcast listeners.And conservative figures like Sean Hannity, Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro all run successful podcasts with sizable audiences.But as President Trump (and before that Candidate Trump) has conquered the media landscape, commanding the agenda on issues big and very, very small, it makes sense that Democratic lawmakers would be most eager to seize alternate outlets to promote their political priorities.(Off the Sidelines from Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Off the Cuff from Representative Jared Huffman of California popped up last year; We the Podcast from Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, begun in 2015, was ahead of its time.)All of these Democrats have taken a page from Mr. Trump himself.The president doesnt have his own podcast (yet), but no other lawmaker has so successfully leveraged the internet to push out his own version of the news, whether through his Twitter account or through his weekly self-branded Facebook video news report, the Real News Update hosted by his daughter-in-law Lara Trump.Traditional news media might be politically polarized watch Fox News or MSNBC for different versions of the days events but the internet has allowed for platforms focused on even more granular political preferences.Now, you dont have to stop at supporting Mr. Sanders as a political candidate; you can get your news filtered through The Bernie Sanders Show, in your podcast feed or on Facebook Live.The lawmaker podcast boom is just another way that our political news is becoming less accountable to the public and more personality driven.But thats not the only thing wrong with it.The podcasts are also boring.Efforts to showcase the lighter side of politicians rarely reveal the most interesting things about them.Mr. Emanuels podcast would probably be more captivating if he werent so focused on seeming supremely relatable and chill.And Im sure Mr. Duffy has some interesting stories about what its like to be in Congress right now, under this president, but hes instead ceding his time to interviews with other lawmakers about their educational and work backgrounds and what kinds of cheese they like best.Advertisement Continue reading the main story None of these shows are the optimal conduit for understanding the political issues of the day, unless youre a big nerd for Congress or really hate conflict.Mr. Duffy has expressed interest in having the liberal California Representative Maxine Waters on as a guest in the future, telling the conservative website The Daily Caller: Maxine and I dont agree on much of anything, but I think Maxine is a nice person, I think Maxine is a good person.Hopefully, theyll get into those disagreements instead of just talking about how nice the other person is.Part of the problem is that for lawmakers, podcasting is obviously a side gig.In the first episode of Canarycast, Mr. Brown tells his guests a trio of Whirlpool workers that he has to end the interview to cast a vote.Ms. Gillibrands podcast unexpectedly went silent in January after only six episodes.I guess shes been busy.The political figures with podcasts actually worth listening to are the ones who have left office.These are people who have relevant inside information about how our government works but who are now in a position to pull back the curtain.They also have more incentive to produce something truly interesting, as opposed to simply politically advantageous.Hillary Clintons campaign podcast, With Her, became instantly more compelling after her loss; the two episodes she recorded in September reflecting on the election are riveting, even for those with Election 2016 fatigue.Freed from being vice president, Joe Biden is now lending his brand to an experimental audio news curation project, Bidens Briefing, which is billed as a skillcast for devices like Alexa and Google Home but is also available to download as a regular podcast.The highlight of the category is Stay Tuned With Preet, starring Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney fired by President Trump.Some speculated that Mr. Bharara might seek elected office, but instead hes teamed up with his brother, an internet entrepreneur, and created a podcast that takes the contours of a thrilling and urgent civics lesson.If politicians really want to excel at podcasting, maybe they should quit their day jobs.For lawmakers, the podcast is rarely undertaken in the legitimate pursuit of good content but is instead a dull, modern version of constituent outreach.These shows are an attempt to signal that they are listening to us.But that doesnt mean that we should listen to them.

Dicks circle in California.After Even a Tree Can Shed Tears, Light in the Attic plans further volumes focusing on ambient music and the 1980s genre known as city pop.Its an entire kingdom of music, said Devendra Banhart, one of the handful of Westerners who has championed these artists.Light in the Attic, which specializes in deeply researched reissues of offbeat material like Rodriguez, the songwriter at the center of the Oscar-winning documentary Searching for Sugar Man is hoping to find an audience of open-minded listeners by wrapping the music in explanatory context.For American indie-rock fans whose exposure to Japan began with noisy exports like the Boredoms, it may be a totally new territory to explore.The history can be traced to the aftermath of World War II, when occupied Japan was drenched in American pop culture, and a generation was reared on the jazz and rock n roll broadcast by the American military.I grew up with American culture, Haruomi Hosono, a founder of Happy End and one of the architects of modern Japanese pop, said in an interview at the Red Bull Music Academy in Tokyo in 2014.I even regretted that I wasnt American.In the 1960s, collegiate folkies and Beatles-inspired guitar bands swept the country.But by the end of the decade, a circle of ambitious songwriters who were obsessed with American roots music started to emerge.Many were associated with a small record label, URC, that evaded the Japanese music industrys strict censorship rules by selling records through the mail.On its surface, much of Even a Tree Can Shed Tears can seem like an uncanny simulacrum of vintage Californian folk-rock, an alternate universe in which Buffalo Springfield and the Grateful Dead sprouted in Tokyo.But the album also shows the musicians efforts to forge a new kind of Japanese rock even while borrowing so heavily from the West.
Stephen Petronio’s ‘Bloodlines’ to Honor Merce Cunningham:::::Photo Bloodlines, the Stephen Petronio Company series that revives works by titans of American postmodern dance, will return for a fourth season with a tribute to Merce Cunningham.The Petronio Company, which unveiled the season on Friday, said that dates for Bloodlines, to be performed at the Joyce Theater, would be announced soon.The Petronio dancers will perform Cunninghams Signals, a 1970 work for six dancers originally set to multiple scores by David Tudor, Gordon Mumma and John Cage.This will be Cunninghams second appearance in Bloodlines; the first season included RainForest (1968).With Signals, Mr. Petronio said in a statement, we deepen our commitment to Merce Cunningham as the essential game changer in the evolution of modern dance and the Judson movement that followed.The season will also include Wild Wild World (an excerpt from Mr. Petronios 2003 dance Underland) and a world premiere: Hardness 10, also by Mr. Petronio and set to music by Nico Muhly.Bloodlines is a five-year project that began in 2015 to celebrate the Petronio Companys 30th anniversary.Previous seasons have included works by Yvonne Rainer, Steve Paxton and Anna Halprin as well as Trisha Brown, whose company Mr. Petronio danced with from 1979 to 1986.
Making Room for Deaf Performers in Hollywood:::::Millie Simmonds plays Rose, a lonely deaf girl in 1927 New Jersey enamored of silent movies and of one star in particular (played by Julianne Moore, the hearing actress who also plays the grown-up Rose).Roses story alternates with that of Ben (Oakes Fegley), a Minnesota boy who becomes deaf when he is struck by lightning in 1977.In Brian Selznicks best-selling book, which he adapted for the screen, Roses story is conveyed wordlessly in pencil drawings; Bens is shared entirely in words.In the movie, her story unfolds without speech in black and white, his with blazing 70s pop color but for nearly an hour no dialogue.I was completely shocked by how little dialogue there was in the film, Mr. Haynes said in a phone interview.To approximate a nearly soundless world before production, he and Oakes wore noise-canceling headphones as they walked around New York City one day.He became aware of acute shards of visual information, he said, though he wasnt kidding himself that he had any idea what it was like to live deafness: This was a thumbnail version of anything close to life.Like Rose and Ben, Carol Padden and her husband, Tom Humphries, who both teach at the University of California, San Diego, represent different deaf experiences.Ms. Padden, a MacArthur Fellow for her research in world sign languages, was born deaf to deaf parents and grew up in deaf culture.Mr. Humphries lost his hearing when he was 6, had no deaf family and did not learn sign language until he went to college.The couple were advisers for Wonderstruck, both the book and the movie.Ms. Padden and Mr. Humphries would like to see more deaf actors in film and not just as deaf characters.Deaf actors played nonspeaking hearing roles a policeman and a maid, among others in Wonderstruck, and as a fun exercise, Ms. Padden said in an email, she tried to figure out who was deaf in the movie.There was one I missed, she said, which is a good sign of his acting.I heard that as they prepared to play their roles, they were told to look less intently at others so they would seem more hearing.But authenticity works both ways.Its hard for hearing actors to look deaf to deaf viewers, Ms. Padden said, since American Sign Language is not just a finger alphabet but a system of expression employing the whole body.For hearing viewers, she said, being deaf is about signing, or seeming silent, but for deaf viewers, its the entire embodiment of that life: the eyes, the shoulders, the hands, the walking and of course the looking.Until hearing viewers see deaf actors playing them, they may not realize entirely the hard work of embodying an entire different kind of life.Mr. Haynes said there was discussion about hiring a deaf actor for the adult Rose, but he said the film needed stars to get financing and the only role that offered itself that kind of status was the role of Rose.He turned to Ms. Moore.She took on the responsibility of that character and the research with great seriousness.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Humphries, in an email, said that the movie succeeded way better than most, but he also said that you cant achieve authenticity without much more participation of deaf people in all aspects of a movie about deaf people.Even films with deaf involvement can misstep by putting the hearing point of view first.In the summer hit Baby Driver, for example, the deaf actor and comedian CJ Jones is a scene stealer amid some Hollywood heavyweights.But Mr. Humphries pointed out that the editing cut into CJs signed lines so much we often couldnt see his signing and added, Thats reality, audiences are overwhelmingly hearing.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Matlin said that not so much has changed since Children of a Lesser God when it comes to studio movies.In independent films, where budgets are smaller, she said, risks can be taken, and there has been some progress.A recent Ukrainian film, The Tribe, has gone further than any Hollywood movie.It was filmed entirely in Ukrainian Sign Language, with a cast of deaf actors, and no subtitles or voice-overs.Still, Ms. Matlin pointed out that on TV and streaming services, there are many, many deaf actors, writers, directors and producers and lots of stories to tell.Chief among those stories may have been the cable series Switched at Birth, which ran for five seasons, featured multiple deaf actors and included an episode shot almost entirely in A.S.L.A current example is the ABC series Quantico, now shooting Season 3 in New York.Ms. Matlin (who had a recurring role in Switched at Birth) joins the cast as an ex-F.B.I.agent who lost her hearing in a bomb blast.They just put me in and have had no qualms about How do we do it?she emailed from the set.In films, by contrast, there isnt much nuance in telling the story of a deaf character, she said: Usually theyre victims, or their deafness creates some sort of jeopardy.Ethan Sinnott, director of the theater and dance program at Gallaudet University and a set designer, said that deaf theater professionals like him were not waiting for hearing Hollywood to call but taking matters into their own hands.Deaf filmmaking is ascendant, he said in an email, likely due to the ease of communication afforded by a common language between deaf actors, creatives and techies.He also said that he was gobsmacked by the success of Switched at Birth, adding, I never thought I would ever see this in my lifetime.Millie Simmonds has seen neither The Tribe nor Children of a Lesser God (they both have very adult themes), and she never, never never dreamed of being an actress.I always wanted to be a cop or a fireman or do something dangerous, she said.But here she was in Poughkeepsie, already at work in her second movie, A Quiet Place, with John Krasinski and Emily Blunt.She has no time to watch noisy scary movies anytime soon, even if she wanted to.
Your Week in Culture: Steve Reich, Grizzly Bear and the Bass’s Reopening in Miami:::::This tour gives Grizzly Bear fans a chance to revisit some of their favorite musical moments of the late 2000s and, with any luck, celebrate a few new ones, too.SIMON VOZICK-LEVINSON Photo Art: The Bass in Miami Beach Oct. 29; thebass.org.After a two-year renovation and a three-week weather delay (though Hurricane Irma luckily didnt damage the building), Miami Beachs Bass Museum of Art, newly rebranded as the Bass, reopens on Sunday, Oct. 29 with a pair of mordantly cheery shows: a retrospective for the Swiss-born, New York-based Ugo Rondinone, who creates whimsical sculptures with pointed subtext; and a solo show for the mixed-media artist Pascale Marthine Tayou, who works between Belgium and his native Cameroon.Mr. Rondinones gallery-filling Vocabulary of Solitude which comprises 45 life-size, foam-white clown figures in loud boiler suits and brightly colored ruffs, thinking, sleeping or brooding on the floor will be complemented by Mr. Tayous constellations of wall-mounted alabaster eggs (Pascales eggs) and tall columns of Arabic pots (Colonnes Pascale).WILL HEINRICH Dance: Eiko Otake at the Met Nov. 5, 12, 19; metmuseum.org.Whether drifting through rush-hour crowds in Manhattans Financial District or lying still on the floor of an East Village bookshop, the choreographer and dancer Eiko Otake can transform everyday spaces into eerie sites of ritual.In 2014, after decades as half of the husband-and-wife duo Eiko and Koma, Ms. Otake branched out on her own with A Body In Places, a series of site-specific solos that has taken her around New York City and the world.Vulnerable, alert and exquisitely patient, she treats each place like a partner, sensitive to its pulse.Beginning Sunday, Nov. 5, the series continues with daylong performances at the Metropolitan Museum of Arts three locations.First up is the Met Cloisters, followed by the Met Breuer (Nov. 12) and the main branch on Fifth Avenue (Nov. 19).Its not easy to match the grandeur and history of these landmarks, but if anyone can, its Eiko.SIOBHAN BURKE Photo TV: H Is for Hawk Sequel on PBS Nov. 1; pbs.org.A decade ago, not long after her father died unexpectedly, Helen Macdonald the historian, illustrator, poet and falconer retreated to an English cottage to train a ferocious goshawk she named Mabel, recounting her experiences in H Is for Hawk, her prizewinning 2014 memoir.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Now Ms. Macdonald is taking on what she calls the raging wild challenge of my future: a hawk that wont be a solution to grief, but my wings to somewhere new.H Is for Hawk: A New Chapter, presented by Nature on Wednesday, Nov. 1, on PBS (check local listings), watches Ms. Macdonald as she methodically molds Lupin, a warily majestic goshawk hatched in an aviary, into a trusting free flyer with murderous impulses intact.It also follows Ms. Macdonald into the woods bordering England and Wales to glimpse these phantom predators prowling the forest canopy like stealth bombers.Looking for goshawks is like looking for grace, she says in the show.It comes but not often, and you dont get to say when or how.KATHRYN SHATTUCK Film: The Light of the Moon Opens Nov. 1.After a night of drinking with co-workers, Bonnie, a Brooklyn architect, is grabbed from behind while walking home with her headphones on, dragged into a basement and raped.And soon the trauma from what she initially passes off as a mugging has fractured her stoicism and her life.The Light of the Moon follows Bonnie, devastatingly portrayed by Stephanie Beatriz (Brooklyn Nine-Nine), from assault to examination and even into her bed.Her confident ebullience withers into guilt and shame, as she deals with her boyfriend, Matt (Michael Stahl-David), whose inattention morphs into overprotectiveness, and the oblivious colleagues she yearns to impress with her first solo project.I just felt so powerless, really nauseous and on edge the whole day, Ms. Beatriz said in a New York Times interview about shooting the rape scene in this first feature by Jessica M. Thompson.And I thought, These are all the feelings anyone going through this would be having, only a hundred million times worse.KATHRYN SHATTUCK Photo Theater: The Art of Clowning in Brooklyn Through Nov. 19; tfana.org.If youre trying to attract a sophisticated crowd, there are words it is wise to stay away from.Clown, for instance, comes freighted with associations: red noses, fright wigs, face paint, fear.So Theater for a New Audience is sagely touting Jos Houben and Marcello Magni, the European stars of its season opener, as physical theater artists.But these two original members of Simon McBurneys company Complicit and trained by the mime master Jacques Lecoq are exquisite clowns.A few seasons back, when Peter Brook and Marie-Hlne Estienne wanted to coax the humor from Samuel Beckett shorts in Fragments, they recruited Mr. Houben and Mr. Magni to the cast.Now the double bill of Marcel and The Art of Laughter in previews for a Nov. 1 opening at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center in Brooklyn promises poignant and probing comedy: The first piece is a silent showcase for the supple Mr. Magni; the second, Mr. Houbens examination of the things that reliably make us laugh.LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES
‘La Bohème’: Should Opera’s Most Beloved Classic Be Changed?:::::Mr. Gelbs tenure at the Met has brought a new Carmen, Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, Madama Butterfly, Barber of Seville, Rigoletto, Cav/Pag and Ring cycle.A new Aida is coming in a few seasons (starring Ms. Netrebko).The central repertory has been, for better and worse, almost entirely overhauled over the past 10 years.La Bohme alone remains untouchable.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It occupies a position in the canon that is unusual even by operas stubbornly backward-looking standards, particularly in Europe.The Vienna State Opera and the Teatro alla Scala in Milan both still use Zeffirelli stagings from 1963, and the Bavarian State Opera in Munich continues to present an Otto Schenk one from 1969.But this fall brings a highly unusual coincidence: new productions of the opera at two of Europes most important houses.At the Royal Opera in London, Richard Joness fresh version the companys first since 1974 recently finished its premiere run here and will return in June.And on Dec. 1, the Paris Opera will unveil Claus Guths provocative staging, set a century from now.These new takes on this classic of classics raise the question of whether La Bohme should be messed with at all.We seem to have an almost instinctive desire for this piece to remain the same, to be the opera we encountered as children.Is that something we should resist or accept?Photo And if its indeed fair game for new approaches: How?When a director sets Wagners Ring cycle at, say, the dawn of industrialization, it illuminates new aspects of a deep, ambiguous work.But while doing Bohme in the 1950s or, la Rent, in the AIDS-era East Village may involve a change of clothes, its still the same, simple love story.So forget should you do a new Bohme: Can you do a new a really new Bohme?Is there an approach to this work that isnt just moving the attic stove, a fixture of the libretto, from stage right to left to center?Mr. Joness strong, even hyperbolic, Royal Opera production tries diligently to bridge old-fashioned and progressive.It begins with the element perhaps most associated with the piece: snow, already falling gently onstage in front of the curtain as the audience enters.The Victorian-era costumes are detailed and elaborate, a contrast with the austere settings, often flooded in harsh frontal lighting.There is hardly any furniture in the young bohemians Paris garret, making the space resemble an empty stage.The audience can see the backstage workings throughout: the lighting rigs, even the snow machine tube rotating overhead in the flies.The sets of previous acts are visible just offstage; scene changes take place in full view.You can see stagehand markings in chalk on the back of the set pieces; the characters then make their own charcoal drawings musical notes and all in the final act.We are in a theater, Mr. Jones is at pains to remind us, and this is an opera.Photo Within this lightly Brechtian frame, the acting is more or less naturalistic, with a few cartoonish touches.In the first act, when she comes upstairs to light her candle, the already ill Mim faints dead away; rather than being concerned, Rodolfo is almost amused, tapping her with his foot.In the second act, at Caf Momus, the hellcat Musetta doesnt just flirt with the crowd but pulls off her underwear and throws it; she and her estranged lover, Marcello, boisterously kiss the same woman.(Suffice to say a bit of casual bisexuality isnt on offer in most Bohme productions.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story The staging manages to infuse the old war horse with a genuine mood a real, if occasionally exaggerated, melancholy without alienating those looking for hoop skirts and a parade at the end of Act 2.But in the end, its more or less just a shift of the stove.The coming Paris production, the details of which are being closely kept, will not be nearly so indulgent of audience expectations.The second the curtain opens, you have a fist in your face, Mr. Guth, the director, said in a phone interview.Mr. Guth, acclaimed for stylized, even surreal productions that nevertheless remain moored to reality, hadnt thought his style was a good match for Puccini, and he didnt like the clichs about artists endemic to Bohme stagings.But listening to the music alone and brainstorming conceptual approaches brought him to the 1851 Henri Murger book on which the libretto is based.In the end, he said, it turns out that these men meet again.They look back, and they are not now artists.They are now established bourgeoisie.They remember their youth, when they were doing wild stuff.Photo So his Bohme, which will star Sonya Yoncheva and Atalla Ayan and be conducted by Gustavo Dudamel, takes the form of a kind of flashback to a lost time much as Paris today, he observed, is a kind of fantasy of what the city once was.He wants to put La Bohme at the end of the 21st century, in the future, Stphane Lissner, the general director of the Paris Opera, said in an interview in his office.To speak about what is the artists situation, what is the memory we have of the past.The marketing image on the companys website is a futuristic-looking pod, which is apparently where at least some of the action will take place.This radical intervention replaces Jonathan Millers staging from 1995, which updated the opera to the 1930s Left Bank but otherwise left it mostly alone.That staging has, Mr. Lissner said, not one idea for me.The Jonathan Miller is for me absolutely nothing.So its time to try.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Guths concept bears some similarity to the director Stefan Herheims, unveiled in Oslo in 2012 and available on a crucial DVD.That production uses the traditional storybook sets of the Norwegian National Operas 1963 Bohme, but begins with a bleakly modern scene: a hospital room in which a mans lover has just died of cancer.The La Bohme we know then emerges as his fantasy of her recuperation, though a fantasy shot through with intimations of darkness and death.As in The Wizard of Oz, the doctors and nurses from the hospital also populate this Rodolfos dream world; it is one of the saddest, loveliest spectacles Ive ever seen.Photo Mr. Herheims staging is about loss and denial.Its also about what we seek from opera, the kind of escape into an idyllic past our cultures and our own that we get from productions like Mr. Zeffirellis, which over the past 35 years at the Met has played nearly 500 performances and sold 650,000 tickets.I would not want to be without Mr. Herheims vision, which celebrates, without undue indulgence, the sentimentality that permeates La Bohme.But Ive lately been more than reconciled to the Zeffirelli, the age and familiarity of which have added a poignancy that enhances the piece that, in some sense, completes it.I felt differently about the Mets ancient production of Strausss Der Rosenkavalier, finally replaced last season.The old staging had grown dull and dowdy and besides, Rosenkavalier is not just a simulacrum of 18th-century Vienna but is also about what the new version, set on the cusp of World War I, made more vivid: the change of generations, the war of the classes, the end of a world.The old Rosenkavalier didnt evoke any of those depths; the Zeffirelli Bohme, on the other hand, really does give us La Bohme, in all its shallow brilliance and beauty.The nostalgia we feel for it has become as much a part of the opera as Puccinis score.I look forward to the avant-garde iteration of the staging that will commence in a few decades, when the singers will need to negotiate a literally decomposing set; what better symbol of Mims fatal consumption?But, until then, why move the stove merely to move it?Whether you like them or dont like them, we have changed the core repertory at the Met, Mr. Gelb said.This is a piece that just defies that agenda.
Contemplating a Mystically Charged Two-Hour Piano Epic:::::Photo One of todays foremost interpreters of the mystically charged music of Olivier Messiaen is Steven Osborne, a Scottish pianist.On Tuesday, Lincoln Centers White Light Festival will present him in a complete performance of Messiaens two-hour solo epic Vingt regards sur lEnfant-Jsus (roughly, 20 Contemplations of the Child Jesus).Over a Skype call, Mr. Osborne discussed how the opening of the first movement, Regard du Pre (Contemplation of the Father), sets the entire work in motion.Here are edited and condensed excerpts from the conversation.I was somewhat surprised that you chose the very first page of the score as your favorite.This opening page captures one of the things thats so special in Messiaens music: the way that time expands.Its an incredibly extended sense of how a melody could work.At first, when I was trying to engage with that kind of time, I found it almost impossible to sustain.But you gradually sort of work your way into I dont know if youd call it a meditative state of mind, but such profound calm about it.You can see some repetition clearly, on the page.But theres also a lot of activity.Exactly.Theres a lot of semiquavers.And at first glance you might think that it goes rather quick.I was once playing it, and the page-turner turned after the first bar, because I think he was so freaked out by the difference between what he saw on the page and what he heard.He just couldnt process.Again, it just brings out how odd it is.The concept of the music is so extreme.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The concept is extreme, but the execution has to be very subtle, right?The crucial thing in terms of looking at the score is this pianissimo for the bottom two staves.And this triple-p for the top stave.Thats really hard to do, because its hard to control.If they all sound roughly the same dynamic, you could lose the timelessness of it.Then its just, like, lots of slow notes.Whereas if you have that melody and then this space where those higher notes just fill in the resonance, then its profoundly different.Much more spacious.
Gary Hume Loves His Mother. His Art Is a Valentine to Her.:::::His mother, Jill Henshaw, 85, has dementia.She raised five children pretty much on her own after his father abandoned the family when Mr. Hume was an infant, he said.Mr. Hume described the relationship with his mother in only the most loving terms, emotions that made the painting process challenging.The artist found he was incapable of producing a portrait that objectively captured his mother, either as the vital young woman he remembered managing a doctors office or in her current condition.Photo Even though I wanted to honor her, theres a selfish paradox where I cant see her as a person, I can only see her as my mum, Mr. Hume said, stating that the paintings turned out to be mainly about his relationship and feelings for his mother, rather than a snapshot of her appearance or personality.The series is divided into two parts: works that reflect the artists point of view as a child looking at his mother, based on family photographs and memories; and paintings that capture his mother from his more adult perspective, based on recent visits.One painting, Mum Twisting, 2015, was inspired by a photograph taken by Mr. Hume in 1968 during a summer outing in Cornwall.The resulting painting is a swirl of lines circling above the viewer, mirroring the patterns of his mothers dress as she twirled about in the wind, standing above her son on a grassy hill.Photo Another painting, Mum in Bed, 2017, solemnly conveys the outlines of his mothers face in a steely shade of blue against a background of institutional green.Here, the artist is looking downward from the standpoint of an adult.Mr. Hume said there was one work, Grandma Looks at the Garden, 2017, that presented his mothers world from the perspective of her grandchildren, but nothing in this striking composition of silhouettes of flowers revealed this back story.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In fact, the true innovation of this latest body of work is not the subject matter, but Mr. Humes new approach to paint on paper, allowing the material to pucker and curl under the weight of the slick enamel house paints he employs.He is best known for his glossy paintings on aluminum, creating reflective planes by sanding down layers repeatedly until achieving a flawless sheen.But in this new work, the surface of the paper is as crimped as a seersucker suit, defying standard techniques for sizing paper to avoid just such an effect.Photo I love the waviness.Without the waviness, forget it, Mr. Hume said, explaining that all of the paintings that approach his mother from the perspective of a child were created this way.The fragility of the paper and the reflection of light created by the wobbly effect seem perfectly suited to such subjects as Mums Cardigan, 2015, a line of white, oversize buttons against a pale mauve background, or Rain, 2017, a pattern of yellow dripping lines against an orange sky.Inspiration is an uncomfortable term for Mr. Hume, who recoils at any interpretation that reduces the work to merely being a response to his visits with his mother.He prefers to think about the relationship to subject matter as a process of permissions, or, as he explains, the subject of a painting allows him to explore aesthetic choices that may seem unusual or out of character for him.He points to a large work on paper, a field of purple, pink and green stripes, titled Windbreak, 2016, recalling a picnic at the beach and all the families huddled behind lengths of fabric to protect them from the wind.Photo I love stripy paintings, he said.I think stripy paintings are lovely.But, I cant make stripy paintings.There are already great stripy paintings out there.But when Im thinking about this holiday with my mum and thinking about the windbreak and how she acted as the windbreak, I can make a stripy painting.The permission is the windbreak.He tears up at times when talking about his mother, but eschewed overt sentimentality when creating these paintings.That may be why so many people have described his work as cool, a label that he said was a misnomer.Ive never thought of my work as cool, he said.I think all my work is hot, but maybe Ive got a lower boiling point.Indeed, he said that all of his work, not just the series about his mother, had something to do with love.I think if you dont love the moment you are doing it, if you dont love the line, if you dont love the brush with the paint on it, it doesnt work, Mr. Hume said.I have to love it while Im doing it.If Im not loving it, I dont like it.
For Claes Oldenburg, a Departure From His Own Tradition:::::When I was a kid, I had my own country that I made up, he said in a recent interview.The fantasy helped him work through the uncertainty of World War II, he said.It was a way for me to react to the world and be myself in a strange world.Mr. Oldenburgs latest exhibition, Shelf Life, is on view until Nov. 11 at Pace Gallerys 24th Street branch in Chelsea.The relatively small works are made of cardboard, plaster, steel and wood.They depict assemblages of objects some familiar to Oldenburg fans, like a saw, a basketball hoop and a paintbrush on gray shelves made to look just like the storage units Mr. Oldenburg has in his studio.Photo His longtime dealer, Arne Glimcher, the founder of Pace, noted that this was a significant departure for the artist.Previously, the work was about a single image, Mr. Glimcher said.Mr. Oldenburg sat down in his New York studio, accompanied by Mr. Glimcher, to talk about making art and where his ideas come from.These are edited excerpts from the conversation.Its been awhile since we saw new Oldenburgs, correct?MR. GLIMCHER Except for the paintbrush in Philadelphia, this is his first new body of work in six years.MR. OLDENBURG Is that right?A.G.Yes, youve been focusing on the big public projects.C.O.Whats wrong with that?A.G.Nothing!A lot of people know you from large pieces like Spoonbridge and Cherry in Minneapolis.How do you feel about them?Advertisement Continue reading the main story C.O.Public things take two or three years, theyre made out of heavy stuff, which is also very costly.Thats what the big projects are: working in architecture.You need someone who backs it and who trusts you, and whom you trust.You need to be more than yourself.For example, I had Coosje van Bruggen, my late wife, and she was very smart, and very good and kind, and we worked together on them.How long do the two of you go back?C.O.The beginning of the 60s.After a couple of years in New York, I started to go into something different than painting.Why?C.O.Everything changed.You could paint a very beautiful picture of somebody and nobody would care.Everybody was doing something different.It was explosive, and it was the beginning of a new period of art.You could do almost anything.Photo A.G.There were very few revolutions in sculpture, and Claess soft sculptures made up one of the great revolutions.It was the antithesis of what sculpture previously was about.Sculpture was hard.But you didnt start with soft sculptures, right?C.O.I came to New York in 56, and I didnt have very much money.I started to buy Life magazines, and I started to cut things out of the magazines, and that was my first American statement, these collages.Theyre kind of scary, some of them, and theyre definitely hard to interpret.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Perhaps your work has a darker undercurrent than some realize?C.O.Oh yes, I totally agree with you.That was a period when I made a lot of dirty work.I did a lot of erotic drawings.A.G.The Museum of Modern Art just recently bought the biggest, most explicit, erotic drawing actually.That brings up the fact that you once depicted the human figure, but not for decades.Why not?C.O.People have become objects.I think theres a point at which you choose between a person and things.And I chose things.And you can express just as many things about persons by using things.Did the softness of bodies somehow transfer to sculpture?C.O.Yes.I spent a lot of time painting human beings, especially nudes.And you might say thats a source of the interest in soft things.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The works in Shelf Life are relatively small.How long does it take to make them?C.O.It takes as long as it takes.I would say you put things together in maybe a week or two, and then pull them apart for a week, and then you find another idea that sneaks in and so on.But do you work most days?C.O.Of course.I try to anyway.Some days are wonderful, and some days are awful.Thats how things go.This group of things was started earlier this year.Part of the reason its on a small scale was because I wasnt exactly sure where I was going at that point.Photo A.G. Each of these shelves is a store of ideas.Theres a kind of nostalgia in the best sense about these works.The history of your whole visual vocabulary is here.C.O.Yeah.I havent been showing that kind of work.This will be the first time.A.G. Claes, you said something touching to me: You have to decide at some point what youre going to keep and what youre going to throw away, and obviously these are things that you kept.Is there something that inspires that decision?C.O.I want to be working all the time.Why suddenly I should go into this?I havent quite figured that out yet.I sort of like the scale of this work, because I can handle the scale at my age.I like small things.Thats a fact.I like big things, but I also like small things.What small things have your attention now?C.O.I have a fly on this table; hes here all the time.I dont know where hes gone now.A real fly?Oh I think I just saw him buzzing around.C.O.I dont think Ive seen anything much more interesting than that in some time.You know, when I grew up in Chicago, there were so many flies you could hardly see anything.The world was all flies.But now theyre just not like that anymore.There are maybe one or two or three flies that take a liking to you.I hate to see people go and smash them.Advertisement Continue reading the main story So will we see a sculpture of a fly?C.O.I havent done anything on the subject of flies.Its the sort of thing that could interest me.Anything could interest me, actually.

A Provocative Museum Places African Art on the Global Stage:::::But some question the large sums spent on a private museum while the countrys public museums languish, as well as its location on one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in South Africa the sprawling V & A Waterfront complex of shops and restaurants, much visited by tourists.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What they see inside is the representation of one mans taste in contemporary art although that man is not Mr. Zeitz.He is Mark Coetzee, the Cape Town-born curator who Mr. Zeitz hired to help him form the collection, and who is now the museums chief executive and director.Leading early visitors on a hard-hat tour of Zeitz MOCAA in the spring, Mr. Coetzee explained that its mission is cutting-edge contemporary, so the work is all made after 2000.He added that the focus was large-scale and in-depth: The one rule we made was to buy bodies of work.With very few exceptions, we have 40, 50, 60 pieces of every artist whose work we acquired.A sampling can be seen in the opening exhibition, All Things Being Equal, which is mostly a demonstration of some of the museums headliners: Wangechi Mutu (Kenya), Zanele Muholi (South Africa), Chris Ofili (United Kingdom), Glenn Ligon of the United States, and El Anatsui (Ghana) whose bold installations made from bottle caps, aluminum, copper and other discarded materials of trade alludes to the scars of Africas colonial history.Photo Mr. Coetzee, 53, has also staged early career retrospectives of the Zimbabwean-born artist/activist Kudzanai Chiurai and of the South African artist Nandipha Mntambo, known for her cowhide-covered human figures, molded from her own body.Outside of the white-cube galleries, in the soaring atrium, a giant rubber dragon made from tubing, multicolored ribbons and an animal skull, by the South African Nicholas Hlobo, references Xhosa myth.In the underground tunnels that transported grain, the photographer Edson Chagas has recreated the Angola Pavilion that won the Golden Lion award at the 2013 Venice Biennale.The prominence of photography and video in the collection Isaac Juliens nine-screen Ten Thousand Waves is also on display has drawn criticism.Mr. Coetzee said he was aware that there were imbalances, as well as omissions, but that the museum needs time to develop a comprehensive collection Over breakfast recently in London, where Mr. Zeitz lives part of the year, he described meeting Mr. Coetzee in Miami in 2007 when the curator was working for the Rubell Family Collection.Puma SE sponsored Mr. Coetzees show, 30 Americans, featuring work by African-American artists of the last three decades.We had a pizza together and I asked him why artists from Africa are so little represented, and why there is no significant cultural institution in Africa.I said, why dont we do it?A year later they began forming a collection of contemporary African art.This is not a private collection that I purchased for myself, said Mr. Zeitz, 54, who looks more like a rumpled game ranger than a C.E.O.We collected on a scale that you wouldnt do privately because we always had the idea there would be a place somewhere in Africa where we would exhibit.Photo Asked whether he had a budget, Mr. Zeitz laughed.I had to somehow still be able to pay my bills, he said.But no, there was no budget in mind.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The mission, Mr. Coetzee said, was to allow Africans to tell their own story.He acknowledged that there were still large gaps in the collection.There are countries and areas where there are no art schools, no infrastructure and its hard, he said.He added that another goal was to make the work accessible to people who didnt usually see art, with free entrance for visitors under 18 and, each Wednesday, for anyone with an African passport.Our public museums, through no fault of their own they have no money have not been accessible to people, even postapartheid, Mr. Coetzee said.What we have decided to do is to think very carefully about work that is experiential and evocative and really engages a broad spectrum of society.I do believe its possible to do that and still have brilliant work.Still, the tension between the founders philanthropic goals and the corporate reality is palpable.The museum sits in the newly developed Silo District at the Waterfront, which boasts apartment blocks, offices and shops.A luxury hotel (not designed by Mr. Heatherwick) sits above the museum itself.As The Guardian noted, For an institution that is trying to be open and accessible to all, its upstairs neighbor is a painful reminder of the extreme inequality that still racks this city a luxury playground for some, an impoverished slum for others more than two decades after apartheid.Photo Mr. Coetzee and Mr. Zeitz looked at spaces in other parts of Africa for their museum.When David Green, the chief executive of the V & A Waterfront, approached them, it was actually ready made: They had a building and an architect; we had a collection, Mr. Coetzee said.Mr. Heatherwick, though not a licensed architect, was well known internationally for the British pavilion at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai, and his flaming caldron for Londons 2012 Olympics.(Several recent projects, including Pier 55, a $250 million project for Barry Diller along the Hudson River, and the Garden Bridge in London have since flamed out.)He had first visited the silo unused since 2001 10 years ago.I spent two days crawling through the silo, which had a monumental amount of bird poo, Mr. Heatherwick, 47, recalled in an interview at his spacious London headquarters near Kings Cross Station.Nothing came of a development idea the Waterfront had at the time, but I was fascinated by the place.The hollowed tubes were rubbish for showing art in, he noted, but it was so idiosyncratic, such a spectacular tube-tastic thing, that we felt we shouldnt knock this building down and land a modern art spaceship.He added, It felt like our role should be to amplify the power of that building.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A deal was struck: The V & A Waterfront would provide the building and pay for the renovation and Mr. Heatherwicks fees.Mr. Zeitz would give his collection as a lifetime loan, and contribute half to the initial costs of staffing and offices.The billionaire, who currently oversees a nonprofit foundation with Richard Branson to support the clean energy economy and the Zeitz Foundation for Intercultural Ecosphere Safety, will also provide an unspecified annual contribution for acquisitions over the next 10 years.The renovation budget of $37.6 million, is high for South Africa, but small compared to new museums internationally.Mr. Coetzee did not disclose the operating budget, but said it would be comparable to a midsize American museum.Photo Even before Zeitz Mocaa opened last month, dissenting voices were raised.In a 2015 article in Art Africa magazine, the journalist Matthew Blackman wrote an open letter to Mr. Coetzee and Mr. Zeitz, complaining that the collection reflected Mr. Coetzees tastes, rather than those of an acquisition committee with rigorous selection criteria.Another worry, he wrote, is the power of the museum to skew the choices made by local galleries, which he suggested are developing their stables purely to fit the buying habits of ZMocaa.Joost Bosland, a director of the Stevenson Gallery in Cape Town and Johannesburg, which represents Mr. Hlobo, Penny Siopis and Kemang Wa Lehulere (all are in Zeitz Mocaas collection) wrote in an email that while there was a basis of truth to this criticism, it was hard to predict what the new museums influence would be on the market for African art until its acquisition budget was known.However, the best African artists have a deep, global collector base, and it is hard to imagine a single actor determining the direction of their market.Most artists and gallerists contacted for this article were reluctant to voice their reservations about the museum on record, saying that they had too much at stake.Artists are criticizing it privately, but saying, how do I get my work into the museum?said Sue Williamson, a Cape Town-based artist who is currently part of a group show at Axis Gallery in New York.Mr. Coetzee said he and Mr. Zeitz had consulted extensively with museum curators around the world while building their collection and had tried to put protocols in place as fast as possible.We have boards of trustees and advisers, governance boards, 20 curators on staff, and two acquisition committees.He added, Do I have influence?I hope so.But I dont have a final say over what should be bought.Even where the issues simmer, however, reaction has so far been largely positive.I put the criticisms down to a very reductive identity politics, said Ashraf Jamal, the former editor of Art Africa magazine, referring to a tendency for Afro-centric art fairs to emphasize black empowerment rather than focus on the quality of the work.Its an international museum, its not a provincial or national concern, but people lose sight of that, Mr. Jamal added.Right now, the collection needs more painting and more sculpture; its dominated by photography and video art, but this is such a young initiative.Its a major phenomenon globally, and a heartfelt attempt to place the African aesthetic on the global stage.
Trading Sports Memorabilia, Not Just for Love but for Money:::::I feel fortunate because its like having your cake and eating it, too, Mr. Shanus said.You get a lot of pleasure in holding it, but if you sell it, its an appreciating asset.Photo Unlike, say, fine art or coins, the growth in sports memorabilia collecting has been a function of a collision of demographics, economics and technology.For decades, players routinely gave away their autographs and their gear, including balls, bats and jerseys.Babe Ruth, baseballs biggest titan, signed his name for almost anyone who asked.Trading cards were mostly collected by children, though starting in the 1930s, visionaries like Jefferson Burdick created a cataloging system that became the foundation of the industry years later.It wasnt until the go-go years of the 1980s, when the first baby boomers were reaching middle age, that large amounts of money poured into the sports memorabilia market, especially for baseball-related items, which make up about 70 percent of the vintage market.The value of trading cards for the most famous players including Mickey Mantle and Hank Aaron jumped.So did autographs and signed photographs.Serious collectors began paying five-, six- and even seven-figure sums for scarce items, like jerseys worn by Ruth, Joe DiMaggio and others, and ballplayers like Pete Rose were paid thousands of dollars to appear at autograph signings.But like any unregulated market, the risk of fraud was ever-present.To the unsuspecting buyer, an autograph could be forged and an ordinary ball substituted for a rare one.And the internet, which helped match buyers with sellers, was also used to pawn off fakes.Photo So in time, insurers started writing policies that covered sports memorabilia and authenticators began to verify the legitimacy of cards and other items.Sports leagues, sensing a chance to enhance interest in their games, have also been authenticating game-used bats, balls, jerseys and other items.And while authenticators have not been above reproach, their entry into the market has generally reassured buyers.Any industry where authentication has been introduced, the market has flourished, whether its baseball cards, comic books or game worn jerseys, said Troy Kinunen, who is in charge of consignments, sales and purchases at Mears Online Auctions in South Milwaukee.Authentication created consumer confidence and consumer confidence create higher prices.Higher prices, he added, have also attracted thieves, the ultimate backhanded compliment.In recent years, a rash of sports museums have been pilfered, with thieves getting away with Yogi Berras World Series rings, Roger Mariss most valuable player plaque from 1960, the 1903 Belmont Stakes trophy, and a replica of an alligator-skin belt with a solid gold buckle given to the golfer Ben Hogan.None of the items have been recovered.Photo Perhaps the most brazen theft occurred this year, when a journalist and memorabilia collector from Mexico stole the jersey worn by Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback, out of his locker soon after the Patriots Super Bowl victory.After an investigation spanning two countries, the jersey which some experts said was worth about half a million dollars was recovered about a month later.Advertisement Continue reading the main story People are realizing the value and demand of it, said James Spence, the founder of JSA, a company that verifies the legitimacy of sports memorabilia.The demand, it seems, is insatiable, at least for the most coveted items, the values of which have risen so reliably in the past several decades that some people are investing in sports memorabilia to diversify their portfolios, according to Chris Ivy, the director of sports collectibles at Heritage Auctions in Dallas who is currently selling the only known jersey worn by Jackie Robinson in 1947, his rookie season.(The auction will last until mid-November.)Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Theres only so much you can put in real estate and Wall Street, said Mr. Ivy, whose company handles about $60 million in auction sales annually.Collectibles in general are seeing a lot of growth and sports is seeing most of that.But for every investor looking to make a buck, there are hundreds if not thousands more who collect because they love a sport, team or player.The great thing about sports compared to, say, stamps, which younger people rarely use now, is there is always another generation of fans who turn into collectors.I see it like art, something we grow up with and at the end of the day, evokes passion in us, Mr. Ivy said.Anything that does that will hold a special place.
Remembering Jacqueline du Pré, an Icon of the Cello:::::Mr. Barenboim acknowledged that Ms. du Prs knowledge of music theory left a bit to be desired, to be quite objective.But she more than made up for that with an extraordinary intuition and sensitivity.I have never encountered somebody like this.The greatest musical joy was to play together with her, he added.I think we complemented each other.She had an abandon that was very contagious, and I loved it.The tribute concert will be performed by the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, an ensemble co-founded by Mr. Barenboim.It will open with Richard Strausss Don Quixote.The cello soloist will be Kian Soltani.If this was the last concert I would ever play, I would die happy, Mr. Soltani, 25, said.He remembered being overwhelmed as a teenager when he first saw a video of Ms. du Pr.It was like I was watching some old master, although she was in this young body, he said.In 300 years, people will still be talking about her.Ms. du Pres legacy owes much to the fact that she grew up in the television age.Her smiling, telegenic face and passionate playing became familiar to audiences far and wide, thanks to recorded performances and documentaries.Her uniqueness really projected itself to the audiences.It projected itself even more so on the videos, because she had such a physical way of playing the cello, Mr. Barenboim said.A deaf person watching them would immediately know what a high degree of intensity there was in her, he added.Photo Ms. du Pr also set an example for other British musicians.She was like a goddess for us, said Steven Isserlis, a renowned cellist.She was just this force on stage, and that of course always stays with you.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What also made her stand out was her destiny so tragic that it doubly fixed her in our hearts, Mr. Isserlis said.Shes an icon twice over.Ms. du Pr was born in Oxford, England, in January 1945.At the age of 4, she heard the cello on a radio program about orchestral instruments, and told her parents she would like to have one of those.Backed by her mother an accomplished pianist and teacher she began learning at age 5.At 11, while studying at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, Ms. du Pr won the first of many prizes.She made her debut at Wigmore Hall in the British capital at 16.She was already a sensation, recalled the pianist Stephen Kovacevich, who was there.I was just blown away.The two later became close friends, playing and recording together.In 1965, age 20, Ms. du Pr made a recording of the piece she is best known for: Elgars Cello Concerto.Her debut at Carnegie Hall in New York also came that year.In January 1966, she arrived in Moscow to study with the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich.There, she became friends with a fellow British cellist, Elizabeth Wilson, who later wrote a biography of her.In 1966, in London, came what Ms. Wilson called Ms. du Prs big moment: meeting Mr. Barenboim.He became a guide for her and a support in her musicality, but at the same time she absolutely remained herself, Ms. Wilson said.Ms. du Pr and Mr. Barenboim, both former child prodigies, were married in 1967, and they performed and recorded together extensively.Richard Morrison, a music critic at The Times of London, said they were a potent combination.They came from exact opposite backgrounds geographically, socially and religiously, and yet they were very matched as personalities, he said.They had a very intense sexuality about their relationship, as well.I think that was mirrored absolutely by the sort of music they made together.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.There was a strong bond that you couldnt help but be swept along by, he added.The dream union, however, was soon clouded by Ms. du Prs illness.She could sometimes play and sometimes not, because she lost her feeling in the arms and in her fingers, Mr. Barenboim recalled.She didnt know what was wrong.Nobody could tell her.When Ms. du Pr arrived at the Philharmonic Hall in New York for a performance in February 1973, she found herself suddenly not being able to open the cello case, she later recalled.I walked on stage not knowing what G was, where C was, and not knowing what sounds were going to come out, or how Id find them.She never performed again, and took up teaching instead.Mr. Isserlis took private lessons with her in 1978, arriving once with a sonata by the Soviet composer Aram Khachaturian, a work that Ms. du Pr did not know.She was fascinated, and she was so helpful, he said.In March 1977, before illness overtook her completely, Ms. du Pr appeared on the BBC radio program Desert Island Discs.She admitted she had been very frightened by her disease when it was first diagnosed.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But then I can say that in a sense Im lucky, she said.Because the cello repertoire is small, I had done most of what I loved, and I can look back on a full musical and solistic life.

Weinstein Sues Weinstein Company, Demanding Access to Records:::::Photo LOS ANGELES Weinstein v. Weinstein has commenced.Harvey Weinstein, who was fired by the studio he had helped found after The New York Times revealed decades of sexual harassment allegations against him, sued the Weinstein Company on Thursday to demand access to records and emails.The complaint, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, said Mr. Weinstein needed the materials to defend himself.More than 50 women have come forward in recent weeks to accuse Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment or rape.Mr. Weinstein believes that his email account which is the primary, if not only, account he used during the term of his employment by the company will contain information exonerating him, the complaint said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Weinstein also wants access to his former email account and other company documents, including his personnel file, to pursue a claim of wrongful termination against the Weinstein Company, according to the complaint.He also wants to pursue legal action against the studio for mismanagement by leaking confidential company information saying that certain news reports about his behavior could have only come from his personnel file.
Talk of Weinstein Dominates Women’s Ceremony in a Hollywood ‘Unmoored’:::::These last couple weeks have unmoored the industry, Ms. Silverstein said in a somber tone during her opening remarks.But the revelations about Mr. Weinstein and others, she quickly added, should be seized upon as a real opportunity to push for systemic change.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A global conversation about sexual harassment, toxic masculinity and the institutional sexism that envelops the industry is much needed, she said.Some women in the audience raised a fist in solidarity.One shouted, Topple the patriarchy!A few men shifted uncomfortably in their seats.During a cocktail hour before the ceremony Women and Hollywood held a similar event in New York last week and will host one in London next month honorees like Lenora Lapidus, director of the Womens Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, networked over coconut chicken skewers and cilantro steak empanadas.Photo Theres a teeny silver lining, Ms. Lapidus said about the deluge of allegations.Its reached such a crescendo that theres no going back.A spokeswoman for Mr. Weinstein, who was fired by the studio he co-founded, has repeatedly denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex.The ArcLight, an upscale movie theater and event space in the heart of Hollywood, was simultaneously hosting a premiere for Jigsaw, which Lionsgate hopes will restart its Saw franchise.As women at Ms. Silversteins gathering cited statistics about gender inequality in moviedom women buy 50 percent of movie tickets in the United States, but only 7 percent of the 250 top-grossing films in 2016 were directed by women several dryly noted that it seemed appropriate to have a torture-themed horror movie as a backdrop.One honoree, Stacy L. Smith, an associate professor at the University of Southern California and author of damning reports about gender discrimination in the movie and television business, called Hollywood a cesspool of humanity.But Ms. Smith had high praise for Ms. Silverstein, whom she referred to as the entertainment industrys chief agitation officer.Ms. Silverstein, who grew up on Long Island and works from her Brooklyn apartment, has long focused on womens causes.After graduating from Brandeis University in 1989 and earning a masters degree from Columbia University in 1993, she worked for organizations like the Ms. Foundation and the White House Project, a now-defunct nonprofit dedicated to increasing female representation in business and government.Photo In 2007, she started a blog to push for gender diversity in the global film industry.She called it Women and Hollywood.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I didnt trust my voice at first, but I slowly put myself out there and started to get noticed, Ms. Silverstein said.Now Im kind of a rabid dog, she added with a chuckle.On Twitter, where Ms. Silverstein has 33,500 followers, she has been encouraging abused women to come forward.On Thursday, she tweeted #catchthebastards and #BelieveWomen.Although it has evolved into a larger organization, Women and Hollywood is still mostly known as a blog.Ms. Silverstein has a small staff of editors, and the site publishes articles by a range of freelancers.She does not sell advertising and depends on funding from sponsorships and people like Barbara Dobkin, a philanthropist dedicated to womens issues.Ms. Silverstein is also artistic director and co-founder of the Athena Film Festival, which programs films, like Suffragette and Hidden Figures, that highlight women in leadership roles.The eighth annual festival will take place at Barnard College in February.I do this work because movies are our cave paintings, Ms. Silverstein said.And there are still so many stories that are missing.We are desperate for diverse stories from diverse points of view.

Lee Ann Womack Returns to Her Roots, Singing ‘to the Common Man’:::::At a young age, when many of her peers were taken with televisions chipper singing characters, Ms. Womack gravitated to the country records by Jones, Ray Price and Dolly Parton that her radio D.J.father brought home.When I heard her sing, I might not have understood what she was singing about, but something, the quiver in her voice, the emotion in her voice, sucked me in, she said of Ms. Parton.Photo Ms. Womack started recording during a decade ruled by megawatt divas, and shes fond of pointing out that she insisted on a debut single, Never Again, Again a rueful, waltz-time ballad with robust, bluegrass-style harmonies that conveyed her artistic inclinations.Aubrie Sellers, Ms. Womacks daughter by a previous marriage who is carving out her own career as a recording artist, said that growing up, she came to understand her mother as a modern woman who sang traditional country music.Ms. Womack credited her former label Decca Nashville with allowing her the leeway to go against the formats glossy grain, but also recognized her responsibility to give them something they could work with.Her 2000 blockbuster album contained the billowy inspirational ballad I Hope You Dance and the country rock of Ashes by Now, along with Does My Ring Burn Your Finger, a searing, Appalachian-sounding number by the future Americana luminaries Buddy and Julie Miller.I Hope You Dance became her biggest hit, a country chart topper that also crossed over to the pop Top 20, though its message-driven appeal was a departure.I told Frank one time, I think they expect me to be Billy Graham now.And I wasnt comfortable with that, Ms. Womack said.Much of Ms. Womacks catalog has pushed against the perception of countrified emoting as a maudlin affair, but shes never been one to intellectualize her approach.She gave a characteristically concise summary of her vision for The Lonely, the Lonesome & the Gone: Country music to me was always music that spoke to the common man, and in earlier times, people who were going through hard times and troubles, she said.What is called country music today to me has gotten quite a bit far away from that, especially on the emotional end.So I wanted to do that.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Louder Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.In the elegantly brooding title track, she laments, I dont know why no one sings/about drowning in pitchers and half-priced wings/and trying to wish back everything theyve lost.Ms. Womack has called the new album country blues, but thats as much a tonal description as a stylistic one.She spends 14 tracks embodying the most delicate and desperate extremes of melancholy, inscribing countrypolitan and torchy pop arrangements with sighing silences, and launching into anguished, note-bending runs during the roiling, down-home numbers.The liberal use of reverb, particularly on the steel guitar and her voice, has a haunting effect.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Im not the one that goes, Heres the mic we need to use, or Heres where we need to put it, but I know who to hire that will understand what Im going for, Ms. Womack said.Mr. Liddell added, I think this particular time, we just did our best to let her sing and find some things and not worry so much about Glossin over things, Ms. Womack completed the thought.Thats what the other music makers in her family are aiming for too, in their own ways.An independent spirit, she said, is a big part of who we are.As a producer, Mr. Liddell has contributed to the singularity of Miranda Lamberts albums.While making Beginning of Things with Charlie Worsham, he captured un-self-conscious performances.Mr. Worsham said that when he catches himself thinking he should record something with radio in mind, Im like, I cant do that and then go see Frank and feel good about myself.As a publisher, Mr. Liddell has signed some of Nashvilles country-tweaking songwriters, including his stepdaughter, Ms.Sellers.She spent half a decade fleshing out a sound she termed garage country before releasing her first album, New City Blues, which Mr. Liddell produced, last year.I took all the things that I loved and tried to create my own identity, she said, adding that shes careful to separate her career from her mothers.Ms. Womacks youngest, Ms. Liddell, currently splits her time between writing and assisting in an East Nashville recording studio.She envisions making her own albums, but only after shes found a sonic stamp.If I just put on a personality, I wouldnt feel it and Id be worried that other people werent feeling it, she said.

Protesters Deface Roosevelt Statue Outside Natural History Museum:::::Photo Protesters splattered red liquid onto the base of the bronze statue of Theodore Roosevelt outside the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, and later published a statement on the internet calling for its removal as an emblem of patriarchy, white supremacy and settler-colonialism.Now the statue is bleeding, said the statement Thursday from the protesters, who identified themselves as members of the Monument Removal Brigade.We did not make it bleed.It is bloody at its very foundation.The group said the museum should rethink its cultural halls regarding the colonial mentality behind them.City workers using a power washer, a sponge and soapy water later began cleaning the statue, the latest focus of debate over statues or monuments around the country that celebrate figures like Robert E. Lee and Christopher Columbus.In Pittsburgh this week, the citys arts commission recommended the removal of a statue of Stephen Foster, the composer.The statue shows Foster standing above an African-American man playing the banjo.Photo The statue of Roosevelt, a conservationist, has stood outside the museum since 1940.Created by James Earle Fraser, and owned by the city, it depicts Roosevelt astride a horse and flanked by a Native American man and an African man.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Long regarded as a politician who battled corruption, challenged monopolies and championed Civil Service, Roosevelt has also been criticized for his views of certain peoples as inferior and his defense of colonial expansion.
A Provocative Museum Places African Art on the Global Stage:::::But some question the large sums spent on a private museum while the countrys public museums languish, as well as its location on one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in South Africa the sprawling V & A Waterfront complex of shops and restaurants, much visited by tourists.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What they see inside is the representation of one mans taste in contemporary art although that man is not Mr. Zeitz.He is Mark Coetzee, the Cape Town-born curator who Mr. Zeitz hired to help him form the collection, and who is now the museums chief executive and director.Leading early visitors on a hard-hat tour of Zeitz MOCAA in the spring, Mr. Coetzee explained that its mission is cutting-edge contemporary, so the work is all made after 2000.He added that the focus was large-scale and in-depth: The one rule we made was to buy bodies of work.With very few exceptions, we have 40, 50, 60 pieces of every artist whose work we acquired.A sampling can be seen in the opening exhibition, All Things Being Equal, which is mostly a demonstration of some of the museums headliners: Wangechi Mutu (Kenya), Zanele Muholi (South Africa), Chris Ofili (United Kingdom), Glenn Ligon of the United States, and El Anatsui (Ghana) whose bold installations made from bottle caps, aluminum, copper and other discarded materials of trade alludes to the scars of Africas colonial history.Photo Mr. Coetzee, 53, has also staged early career retrospectives of the Zimbabwean-born artist/activist Kudzanai Chiurai and of the South African artist Nandipha Mntambo, known for her cowhide-covered human figures, molded from her own body.Outside of the white-cube galleries, in the soaring atrium, a giant rubber dragon made from tubing, multicolored ribbons and an animal skull, by the South African Nicholas Hlobo, references Xhosa myth.In the underground tunnels that transported grain, the photographer Edson Chagas has recreated the Angola Pavilion that won the Golden Lion award at the 2013 Venice Biennale.The prominence of photography and video in the collection Isaac Juliens nine-screen Ten Thousand Waves is also on display has drawn criticism.Mr. Coetzee said he was aware that there were imbalances, as well as omissions, but that the museum needs time to develop a comprehensive collection Over breakfast recently in London, where Mr. Zeitz lives part of the year, he described meeting Mr. Coetzee in Miami in 2007 when the curator was working for the Rubell Family Collection.Puma SE sponsored Mr. Coetzees show, 30 Americans, featuring work by African-American artists of the last three decades.We had a pizza together and I asked him why artists from Africa are so little represented, and why there is no significant cultural institution in Africa.I said, why dont we do it?A year later they began forming a collection of contemporary African art.This is not a private collection that I purchased for myself, said Mr. Zeitz, 54, who looks more like a rumpled game ranger than a C.E.O.We collected on a scale that you wouldnt do privately because we always had the idea there would be a place somewhere in Africa where we would exhibit.Photo Asked whether he had a budget, Mr. Zeitz laughed.I had to somehow still be able to pay my bills, he said.But no, there was no budget in mind.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The mission, Mr. Coetzee said, was to allow Africans to tell their own story.He acknowledged that there were still large gaps in the collection.There are countries and areas where there are no art schools, no infrastructure and its hard, he said.He added that another goal was to make the work accessible to people who didnt usually see art, with free entrance for visitors under 18 and, each Wednesday, for anyone with an African passport.Our public museums, through no fault of their own they have no money have not been accessible to people, even postapartheid, Mr. Coetzee said.What we have decided to do is to think very carefully about work that is experiential and evocative and really engages a broad spectrum of society.I do believe its possible to do that and still have brilliant work.Still, the tension between the founders philanthropic goals and the corporate reality is palpable.The museum sits in the newly developed Silo District at the Waterfront, which boasts apartment blocks, offices and shops.A luxury hotel (not designed by Mr. Heatherwick) sits above the museum itself.As The Guardian noted, For an institution that is trying to be open and accessible to all, its upstairs neighbor is a painful reminder of the extreme inequality that still racks this city a luxury playground for some, an impoverished slum for others more than two decades after apartheid.Photo Mr. Coetzee and Mr. Zeitz looked at spaces in other parts of Africa for their museum.When David Green, the chief executive of the V & A Waterfront, approached them, it was actually ready made: They had a building and an architect; we had a collection, Mr. Coetzee said.Mr. Heatherwick, though not a licensed architect, was well known internationally for the British pavilion at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai, and his flaming caldron for Londons 2012 Olympics.(Several recent projects, including Pier 55, a $250 million project for Barry Diller along the Hudson River, and the Garden Bridge in London have since flamed out.)He had first visited the silo unused since 2001 10 years ago.I spent two days crawling through the silo, which had a monumental amount of bird poo, Mr. Heatherwick, 47, recalled in an interview at his spacious London headquarters near Kings Cross Station.Nothing came of a development idea the Waterfront had at the time, but I was fascinated by the place.The hollowed tubes were rubbish for showing art in, he noted, but it was so idiosyncratic, such a spectacular tube-tastic thing, that we felt we shouldnt knock this building down and land a modern art spaceship.He added, It felt like our role should be to amplify the power of that building.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A deal was struck: The V & A Waterfront would provide the building and pay for the renovation and Mr. Heatherwicks fees.Mr. Zeitz would give his collection as a lifetime loan, and contribute half to the initial costs of staffing and offices.The billionaire, who currently oversees a nonprofit foundation with Richard Branson to support the clean energy economy and the Zeitz Foundation for Intercultural Ecosphere Safety, will also provide an unspecified annual contribution for acquisitions over the next 10 years.The renovation budget of $37.6 million, is high for South Africa, but small compared to new museums internationally.Mr. Coetzee did not disclose the operating budget, but said it would be comparable to a midsize American museum.Photo Even before Zeitz Mocaa opened last month, dissenting voices were raised.In a 2015 article in Art Africa magazine, the journalist Matthew Blackman wrote an open letter to Mr. Coetzee and Mr. Zeitz, complaining that the collection reflected Mr. Coetzees tastes, rather than those of an acquisition committee with rigorous selection criteria.Another worry, he wrote, is the power of the museum to skew the choices made by local galleries, which he suggested are developing their stables purely to fit the buying habits of ZMocaa.Joost Bosland, a director of the Stevenson Gallery in Cape Town and Johannesburg, which represents Mr. Hlobo, Penny Siopis and Kemang Wa Lehulere (all are in Zeitz Mocaas collection) wrote in an email that while there was a basis of truth to this criticism, it was hard to predict what the new museums influence would be on the market for African art until its acquisition budget was known.However, the best African artists have a deep, global collector base, and it is hard to imagine a single actor determining the direction of their market.Most artists and gallerists contacted for this article were reluctant to voice their reservations about the museum on record, saying that they had too much at stake.Artists are criticizing it privately, but saying, how do I get my work into the museum?said Sue Williamson, a Cape Town-based artist who is currently part of a group show at Axis Gallery in New York.Mr. Coetzee said he and Mr. Zeitz had consulted extensively with museum curators around the world while building their collection and had tried to put protocols in place as fast as possible.We have boards of trustees and advisers, governance boards, 20 curators on staff, and two acquisition committees.He added, Do I have influence?I hope so.But I dont have a final say over what should be bought.Even where the issues simmer, however, reaction has so far been largely positive.I put the criticisms down to a very reductive identity politics, said Ashraf Jamal, the former editor of Art Africa magazine, referring to a tendency for Afro-centric art fairs to emphasize black empowerment rather than focus on the quality of the work.Its an international museum, its not a provincial or national concern, but people lose sight of that, Mr. Jamal added.Right now, the collection needs more painting and more sculpture; its dominated by photography and video art, but this is such a young initiative.Its a major phenomenon globally, and a heartfelt attempt to place the African aesthetic on the global stage.
Everyday Horrors: Art in the Age of Terror:::::Photo LONDON The artist James Bridle remembers the first time he heard of military drones.Back then, some seven years ago, it took intensive online searching to track down an image of one.As reports of drones as weapons of war and instruments of surveillance became more common, he wanted to understand them better.For him, they were an idea without a physical reality.Mr. Bridle found and downloaded the plans for a type of drone used by the United States Air Force and, using string and chalk, drew a full-size outline of the aircraft on the tarmac of the parking lot behind Bridles London studio.Seeing the form sketched out as if the drone were casting a full-scale shadow over an urban setting revealed that this previously unseen combat apparatus had a wingspan about the length of a bus.Photo As an artist, Mr. Bridle is interested in the relationship between the digital and physical world, in how the former changes the way we think about the latter.Drones are one of those technologies that seemed to go from science fiction to completely mundane without going through a critical-thinking stage, he said.It seemed to stand for so much: war, crime, violence and technology.He has since realized versions of the work, called Drone Shadow, in locations from Washington to Istanbul.The latest version of Drone Shadow falls across the atrium of the Imperial War Museum London as the first work in the exhibition Age of Terror: Art Since 9/11.Curated by Sanna Moore, the show explores how artists have responded to conflict since those calamitous events.Taking the attack on the World Trade Center as a cultural turning point, the exhibition reflects on the continuing state of emergency weve been in and how the world has changed: mass surveillance, civil rights, detentions without trial, Ms. Moore said.Photo The scale of Age of Terror the largest contemporary art exhibition ever staged by the Imperial War Museum reflects the increase in the number of artists responding to conflict in recent years, Ms. Moore said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The show opens with works that respond directly to Sept. 11 before moving on to consider how the attacks have permeated daily life, in the United States and beyond.Some began in the immediate aftermath: Tony Oursler started filming the footage used in his work 9/11 in Lower Manhattan soon after the second plane hit.The piece 9/12 Front Page by the German artist Hans-Peter Feldmann assembles 151 newspaper covers from around the world from the following day, many carrying the same photograph.
Club 57, Late-Night Home of Basquiat and Haring, Gets a Museum-Worthy Revival:::::At any given time, the club was a dance hall, a screening room, a watering hole, a theater lab, an art gallery, or a self-styled let it all hang out encounter group, Ann Magnuson writes in MoMAs Club 57 exhibition catalog.Sometimes it was all those things at once.Photo That interdisciplinary spirit had painters making music, musicians making sculptures, sculptors acting in plays, and actors tossing their scripts in favor of improvised performances, or as Keith Haring called the evenings he organized, Acts of Live Art.Case in point: Min Thometz, a freshly arrived graduate of a high school in Minnesota, who began bartending at Club 57 when she wasnt also stepping out mid-shift to act in a play or perform in Pulsallama, an all-female 13-member percussion ensemble.We were all about being very silly at Club 57, she said in a recent phone interview, which made for a purposely stark contrast with the similarly artist-heavy crowd at TriBeCas Mudd Club, which was more about fashion, about being cool.We were about wearing costumes and having theme parties.Indeed, her own Bongo Voodoo party ended with dead chickens being flung around, a raging bonfire in the middle of the clubs floor, and her future husband Oliver Sanchez passing out on her turntables as she was D.J.-ing, a novel twist on a meet-cute story.Yet indoor fires and flying poultry were the least of the worries for a club that never had a liquor license.Letters from Mr. Strychackis archives show the Holy Cross parishs bishop, John Jakubik, tirelessly intervening on Club 57s behalf with a string of judges and government agencies.In 1981, when frustrated neighbors finally hired a lawyer to help shut down the club after repeated police summons for noise violations, Bishop Jakubik patiently informed him that Club 57 is the youth circle of our church Please try to understand that the East Village is not the best of areas and our parish hall is the only place where our youth can socialize under supervision.Photo Sleep-deprived neighbors on St. Marks Place werent the only ones fixating on Club 57.The art world was taking notice as well.New collectors began arriving, pumping money into a previously moribund market.With them came a burst of fresh galleries throughout the East Village a handful in 1981, over a hundred by 1985.The downtown art world, centered around academia and small government grants, had previously seemed separated by a chasm from free-spending buyers.No longer.As checkbooks opened and media attention skyrocketed, it suddenly looked like artists could have it all.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ill never forget what Jean-Michel said to me one night, Mr. Sanchez said, recalling a walk home from the club.Ill learn to draw later.First I want to get famous.His work was already good, but he was so astute in his strategy.His plan was to charm his way into the right circles.And it absolutely worked!There was this mad rush to cash in, Mr. Scharf said.It stopped being as fun as people became competitive with each other.He includes himself.For the 1983 Whitney Biennial, Keith and Jean-Michel were in it, and I wasnt.Which freaked me out!Part of his solution was a pre-internet social media campaign: I started spray painting my Hanna-Barbera post-nuclear-holocaust mutant characters like Wilma Flintstone with a snake body all up and down the East Side, from the 59th Street Bridge to the East Village.I had no idea who the curators for the 1985 Whitney Biennial were, but I figured they would at least know my work.
Yves Bouvier Sells His Geneva-based Art Storage Company:::::Photo Yves Bouvier has sold off his familys Geneva-based art storage and transport company, a business that has been one of the largest tenants of the freeport there and one that helped him become a high-profile figure in the international art market.Franco Momente, the director of the company, Natural Le Coultre, confirmed the sale Friday.No price was disclosed.Mr. Bouvier, who is Swiss, made his reputation as a businessman involved with freeports, the largely tax-free storage depots where wealthy collectors now store so many of their treasures.In addition to operating in Geneva, where his storage spaces have been filled with many of the worlds most famous and expensive masterpieces, he also opened new facilities in Luxembourg and Singapore where his businesses continue to operate.Photo But in the past few years Mr. Bouvier has been battling legal cases in courtrooms in Monaco, Paris, Singapore and New York, and has likely been facing mounting legal bills as part of that effort.
Wartime Quilts Honor Battles and Leaders, but Mostly Art:::::Photo Theres plenty of visual heat to be had in New Yorks galleries and museums this fall, but nowhere more than at the American Folk Art Museum.The radiance shines forth from the bold geometries in War and Pieced: The Annette Gero Collection of Quilts From Military Fabrics.This ravishing exhibition features 29 sturdy, intricate wartime quilts dating from the Napoleonic and Crimean Wars and also the British colonies, made by soldiers, sailors or regimental tailors in Europe or India.The military fabrics used here are scraps of soldiers uniforms, that is, felted wool in strong, clear colors: predominantly red, black, cream and gold.The show initially resembles an array of extra-large game boards, and the checkered center of one quilt was indeed intended for playing chess, another pastime of enlisted men.Photo The exhibition reminds us that while war is never less than hell, some of its byproducts can be breathtaking and, in their soul-nurturing beauty, the very antithesis of war.But these textiles are also freighted with patriotism, male bonding and commemoration.In addition, wartime quilts were sometimes a means of behavior modification.In Britain at least, quilting was encouraged by the military and temperance organizations alike; they gave idle hands something to do between military engagements, staving off the temptations of drink and gambling.They also occupied the time of wounded soldiers recovering in military hospitals and prisoners of war.Some were made for families back home, others to be sold and a few by orderlies as gifts for their commanding officers.Photo With their pulsating squares, diamonds and triangles of color, these works attest to the expansiveness of geometry, as well as its use in flags, banners and coats of arms.The unusual quatrefoil motifs of some individual quilt blocks are based on the four-pronged footprint of battlements known as star forts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Interspersed among their patterned borders and fields are beaded crowns, embroidered portraits of monarchs, and dedications to siblings.A quilt made by Samuel Sadlowski, a tailor in the Prussian Army taken prisoner during the Napoleonic Wars, is dated 1806; it includes among its many fort blocks, a lovely pastoral frieze in appliqu illustrating the folk tale of a goose-stealing fox pursued by a hunter.In a quilt from 1766, the central medallion features profile portraits of King George III and Queen Charlotte of Britain, but perhaps most riveting is the thick border distinguished by large appliqu blocks with propeller-like designs.Photo Some quilts are influenced by cultures under occupation, especially Britains greatest colony, India, where tailors sometimes outlined the composition with rows of tiny glass beads, to spectacular effect.
After a Late Start, an Artist’s Big Break: Michelle Obama’s Official Portrait:::::The Obama commission is likely to catapult her into another league.There is going to be a spotlight on her, said Paul Staiti, a professor at Mount Holyoke College who is an expert on portraiture.She should fasten her seatbelt.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A tall, athletic woman in white-framed glasses who lives with her Pekingese-Jack Russell terrier, named August Wilson, Ms. Sherald said she is not allowed to speak about the commission until it is unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery early next year.Nor would Mrs. Obama comment.Kim Sajet, the Portrait Gallerys director, would only divulge that Mrs. Obama and Ms. Sherald have already met about the portrait, that the paintings typically involve multiple sittings and that this years subjects chose the artists from about 20 portfolios submitted by the curators.The first lady has to personally approve the finished work, as does the Portrait Gallerys advisory board.Photo The Smithsonian plans to pay for both works with $500,000 in private donations of which $300,000 has been raised so far.This amount covers everything including each artists fees, which Ms. Sajet would not specify.Ms. Sheralds paintings typically sell for $15,000 to $25,000.There is no prescribed format for an official portrait, Ms. Sajet said, except that it be a painting not a work on paper and that the artists be respectful of both the person and the position they hold.Official portraits have ranged from highly formal to much more relaxed, Ms. Sajet added, citing as examples Ron Sherrs 1994 portrait of George H. W. Bush standing in a suit and tie at the White House and Robert Andersons 2008 likeness of George W. Bush in an open-collared shirt on a couch at Camp David.The selection of Ms. Sherald, who typically depicts African-Americans doing everyday things two women in bathing suits, a man holding a child has historical significance.Its as if shes saying, Lets be clear: the President and I are African Americans and proudly so, Mr. Staiti said, and these portraits are going to have an African-American vibe theyre going to break out of that rather staid tradition.I think its important and I think its political, he added, referring to Mrs. Obamas choice.Photo While Ms. Sherald could not discuss her interactions with Mrs. Obama, the way she generally works offers clear insights into her likely process with the former first lady.She invites her subjects to her studio here, where she photographs them in an outfit she has selected for them.Or, she said, she may go to their homes to shop from their closets and photograph them there.Ms. Sherald always shoots her subjects outdoors with natural light.I like the way it highlights the textures of the skin, she said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The commission represents something of a departure for Ms. Sherald; she usually chooses subjects who arrest her attention on the street, in an airport.She literally approaches strangers.I would wonder how shed feel about this leading to commissions of other prominent people, Mr. Staiti said.Shes interested in the exact opposite; shes interested in ordinariness.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.Ms. Sherald said how much the selection means to her, how Mrs. Obama loomed large in her life, though they had not previously met.Weve been on a first-name basis for eight years, she said jokingly.Seeing her made my world better.Shes an archetype that a lot of women can relate to no matter shape, size, race or color, Ms. Sherald added.We see our best selves in her.Ms. Sherald has yet to start the Obama portrait, though it is due to be finished by years end.Im not going home for the holidays, she said with a laugh.Yet sitting among her paint tubes their colors smeared on paper plates with three canvases-in-progress leaning against the walls, Ms. Sherald seemed remarkably calm in the face of such a daunting deadline, perhaps because she has confronted far tougher challenges.Photo Ms. Sherald is a survivor of congestive heart failure, diagnosed at age 30 just as she was earning her masters degree at the Maryland Institute College of Art and was training for a triathlon.She received a transplant at 39.She interrupted her career again, taking a four-year break to care for two ailing relatives back in her hometown Columbus, Ga.

J.C.C. Manhattan Gets $20 Million Gift and Jenny Holzer Artwork:::::Photo The J.C.C.Manhattan on the Upper West Side will be renamed the Marlene Meyerson J.C.C.in honor of a $20 million gift from the Meyerson Family Foundation, which is believed to be one of the largest donations ever made to a Jewish Community Center in the United States.The foundation which made the donation in the name of Marlene Meyerson, a philanthropist who died earlier this year has also commissioned a site-specific artwork for the J.C.C.by Jenny Holzer.Photo To create the installation, the J.C.C.will ask its members over the next several months to share their own words or quotes by others that address the question: What does community mean?Ms. Holzer will choose a handful of these to chisel onto marble benches and stone plaques throughout the building on Amsterdam Avenue at 76th Street.Ms. Holzer will also incorporate hundreds of other such word contributions into a virtual piece of art that will map the buildings interior and exterior, as well as an augmented-reality smartphone app that will allow users to see the words as if they, too, were actually engraved.The artwork will be unveiled at a naming ceremony in the spring.The naming rights will revert to the J.C.C.in 30 years.Ms. Meyersons daughter, Marti, has supported the J.C.C.for more than 20 years as a founder, board chairwoman and as an active member.The building opened in 2002.This gift enables us to secure our foundation, said Joy Levitt, the J.C.C.s executive director.Were going to begin now to talk with our community about what their dreams are for the next 15 years.
Design for London’s New Holocaust Memorial Is Unveiled:::::Peter Bazalgette, chairman of the U.K.Holocaust Memorial Foundation, was the head of the jury.In a news statement, he praised Mr. Adjayes team for creating an emotionally powerful experience and for their understanding of the complexity of the Holocaust and their desire to create a living place as well as a respectful memorial.Photo The location of the project, which will receive 50 million pounds, or about $66 million, of public funding, has drawn criticism from neighboring institutions, local residents and government officials, however.This month, the Imperial War Museum, which is about a mile from the memorials proposed site, called for a reconsideration of the plans for the education center.The museum expressed concern that the center would compete with its own Holocaust gallery, due to open in 2020.The plans for the memorials learning center include the recorded testimonies of 112 Holocaust survivors.As well as commemorating the victims of the Holocaust and addressing anti-Semitism, the subterranean center would also examine hatred and prejudice in other forms, including racism and Islamophobia.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.This year, a letter was sent by critics of the plan to all members of the House of Lords, the upper house of Parliament, saying that the gardens where the memorial is to be located would cease to be an amenity for ordinary people if it went ahead.The gardens are extensively used by residents, visitors to London, and the many thousands who work nearby, including those working in the Palace of Westminster, the letter said.They are an oasis of calm, enjoyed as a place of exercise, play, picnics, sunbathing and dog walking.Peter Bottomley, a Conservative lawmaker who was a signatory to the letter, said in a telephone interview that, while he supported the idea of a prominent memorial, he questioned the chosen site.If everyone saw the information, everyone would agree that the Imperial War Museum is the better proposal, he said, referring to his preferred location.If you combined the elements of both, thats a very good idea.Citing security concerns and the impact on the park of additional visitors, Mr. Bottomley said he was calling for a review of how the site came to be selected.The memorial is scheduled to open in 2021, although it is yet to receive approval from building regulators.
The Newseum Is Increasingly Relevant, but Can It Survive?:::::But just as the profession it celebrates is in distress struggling financially in the internet age and attacked as purveyors of fake news so, too, is the Newseum.The Newseum has run up deficits every year since it opened a grand new home in 2008.Though it attracts a respectable number of visitors (820,000 expected this year) who pay top dollar ($24.95 for adults) in a city filled with free museums, the institution is simply not taking in enough money to cover its bills.It still owes roughly $300 million on its new building, and the interest rates on the loans spiked last year.Its fund-raising has long been sluggish for a museum with a $61 million operating budget.It relies each year on large infusions of money from the Freedom Forum, the foundation that created the museum and has given it more than $500 million over the last 20 years.Photo They have one significant donor, and thats a risky proposition, said Susie Wilkening, an independent museum consultant.Because what happens when that significant donor decides, This may not be what I want to be doing with my assets?In fact, the Freedom Forum, which champions the First Amendment and whose own endowment has shrunk since the recession, now says it cannot continue to support the Newseum at the same level.In 2015, the most recent year for which financial statements are available, the Forum provided $21.4 million, or more than a third of the museums budget.It also took in $7.5 million in admissions.Still, the museum ran up a $2 million deficit.We have not been successful in closing the gap, Jan Neuharth, the chief executive officer of the Forum, said.All of which has put the museums future in doubt.Jeffrey Herbst, who served as the Newseums chief executive officer and president for two years, stepped down from his post at the end of August.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We had different visions of how to address the Newseums financial challenges and at the end of the day, decided to separate amicably, Mr. Herbst said in a phone interview.He declined to elaborate.The museum has just begun an in-depth review to try to right the ship.Everything is on the table, museum officials say, including selling the building that houses the Newseum.That would be an ignoble fate for a structure borne of such ambition.The concept for the museum was hatched by the Freedom Forum, which was started in 1991 by Al Neuharth, Ms. Neuharths father and the founder of USA Today.In 1997, the Newseum opened in a smaller location in Rosslyn, Va.But Mr. Neuharth had a bolder plan to build a palace to journalism on a piece of prime real estate in downtown Washington.The gleaming building overlooking the National Mall covers 643,000 square feet and has seven floors of gallery space and two floors of conference space.All 45 words of the First Amendment are etched into a 74-foot-tall marble tablet on the buildings facade.Photo Its a great venue.Ms. Neuharth said, before acknowledging, its very expensive to run the museum here.It didnt help that the museums new home opened just after the recession hit.News organizations who were generous supporters at the outset found themselves contending with their own financial challenges.Journalists, who do not have the deep pockets of some professions, were not a particularly bountiful source of money.Unlike other museum boards, the Newseum did not require its members to donate to the institution until 2015.The Newseum would not say how much its trustees are expected to give.Bob Schieffer, the retired CBS anchor and author of a new book Overload: Finding the Truth in Todays Deluge of News, said he wasnt surprised that the Newseum had struggled to raise funds from news organizations and journalists.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I think its probably more difficult now than ever because you have these big newspaper chains, their revenues are down, Mr. Schieffer said.In 2015, the last year for which figures are available, the Newseum collected $6.3 million in donations, or about 10 percent of its budget, a small amount for a museum of its size.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That has put pressure on the Freedom Forum to make up any shortfalls.In 2007, the Freedom Forums endowment was at a little more than $550 million.Two years later, in the Newseums first full year of operation in the new building, it shrunk to below $400 million.That same year, it provided $52.4 million of the Newseums $92 million budget.For large, mature museums, Ms. Wilkening, the consultant, said, very few are likely to have a single donor or foundation contributing even five percent of their operating budget.That budget has been trimmed significantly in recent years, and there have been four rounds of layoffs.Photo In addition, the museum has boosted its revenue from other sources and took in $21.4 million in 2015 as an event space for conferences and weddings, up from $12.1 million in 2011.Ms. Neuharth and Mr. Williams said that the financial review was in the early stages and could have initial findings by the end of the year.As part of the review, the officials will convene a team that includes real estate experts, financial advisers, senior staff and trustees, among others, to try and make the Newseum and the Newseum Institute, its related educational center, sustainable over the long term.Wayne Reynolds, a Washington-based philanthropist and a former Newseum board member, said he did not expect the review would find some miracle cure.Theyve known for years that their institution is unsustainable, Mr. Reynolds said.To have a strategic review at this point seems ludicrous.Mr. Reynolds said he was a museum trustee for about a year before resigning in 2015.Among the reasons he cited for leaving: Their unwillingness to change their direction.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Among his objections: the size of the admission fee, which he said was an obstacle to building attendance.Its the fact that theyre charging $24 a person to go through a place, Mr. Reynolds said.Every other place that they are competing against along the Mall is free.Though the Newseum is listed as a popular attraction on TripAdvisor, attendance is still meager compared with other top museums in the area, many of which are federally funded.The National Air and Space Museum, for example, a division of the Smithsonian that charges no admission, has already taken in 5.8 million visitors this year, according to data reported through September.Will President Trumps attacks on the news media spur attendance, or hurt?So far, the museums popularity seems to be on the upswing.But admissions, even at the most popular museums, typically offset only a fraction of an institutions operating budget.So the solutions will need to be much broader, museum officials agree.Our advocacy is more important than ever, Ms. Neuharth said.We need to get a handle on the finances so that going forward for generations to come we can continue that advocacy.
Fragments and Elephants: Howard Hodgkin’s Eclectic Art Collection Is Sold:::::Sothebys presale exhibition recreated the ambience of Mr. Hodgkins studio and home in the Bloomsbury district of London, allowing people to see the relationships between the artists vibrant paintings and prints and the Indian miniatures, Turkish tiles, Persian carpet fragments and other antiques that surrounded him.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hes unique, said the London-based artist Nicholas Hatfull, 33, at the preview, describing Mr. Hodgkins art.Hes a sort of English Cy Twombly.No other artist has his depth of color, or warmth, he added, referring to the American abstract painter, who was also a collector.By any measure, Mr. Hodgkin had unusually eclectic taste, beyond the comfort zone of many of todays investment-minded collectors.This was duly reflected in what was, in pure financial terms, a relatively modest return for a lifetime of collecting.The final total of $6.8 million was less than a tenth of the current auction high for a single painting by Mr. Twombly.Photo Had Mr. Hodgkin collected international contemporary art or held on to more of his own paintings an early 1980s Hodgkin sold at Christies earlier this month for $2.2 million that total would have been far higher.Proceeds would also have been boosted if the sale had included the artists renowned holdings of museum-quality Indian miniatures.Comprising some 130 drawings, the collection is being treated as a separate, single entity and will be available for sale privately at a price to be decided after the auction, according to Mr. Peattie.However, Sothebys auction did include two paintings by Mr. Hodgkin from the 1960s that he had retained.These earlier, more figurative works are not from the most coveted phase of the artists career, as was borne out by the below-estimate 248,750, or about $330,000, given by a British private collector for Bedroom (1960-61), and the failure of Travelling (1961) to attract any bids.But 20 proofs of prints by Mr. Hodgkin all soared above their estimates, led by a 32,500 (about $43,000) offer given by a bidder in the room for a proof of the large blue-and-white Frost (2000-2).Photo The prices of the prints were three or four times retail, said the London-based dealer Offer Waterman.But we werent treated to any of his first-rank paintings.They were transitional works.The most hotly contested artwork at the auction was instead the 1972 painting De-Luxe Tailors by the Indian modernist painter Bhupen Khakhar, who was a friend of Mr. Hodgkins.The bidding on this piece, which shows two tailors in their shop, soared to 1.1 million, or about $1.4 million, three times the estimate and an auction high for the artist.Sweet Bowl, the much-admired 1966 painting by the British artist Patrick Caulfield, also a lifelong friend, was another standout lot, selling for 524,750, or about $690,000.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The commercial appeal of the collection was further complicated by Mr. Hodgkins enthusiasm for fragments rather than objects in complete condition.Fragments were more potent than entire panels, because they freed the imagination, explained Mr. Peattie in his catalog foreword.These included a fragment of 17th-century Persian carpet, formerly owned by the legendary collector Robert von Hirsch, which sold for 224,750, or about $295,000.But there were also items like the bottom half of a 13th-century Persian Kashan luster pottery tile that failed to sell against a low estimate of 2,000, or about $2,600.In all, 14 percent of the lots were left unsold, a relatively high figure for the collection of a prominent private individual.Photo And then there were the elephants, featured in at least 40 of the Indian drawings included in the sale.Mr. Hodgkin regarded Rajasthans Kota-style portraits of elephants in particular as my downfall my Waterloo as a collector, according to the catalog.Yet all but one of his elephant drawings sold, with a Kota image of an elephant stampede from the late 18th or early 19th century selling for 32,500, more than 20 times the estimate.In the pure financial terms of the top end of the auction market, the sale of Mr. Hodgkins collection could not be regarded as serious or important.Yet the connoisseurial refinement and curiosity of Mr. Hodgkins taste served as a timely reminder of just how homogeneous the buying habits of todays investment-minded collectors have become.Last month Artnet News revealed that in the first six months of this year just 25 artists (Twombly comes in at No.5) accounted for almost half the $2.7 billion of sales at the worlds contemporary art auctions.During that same period, premodern works represented just 17 percent of the global auction turnover of fine art, according to a report published by Artprice, the lowest share yet recorded by the French website.It was a wonderful old-fashioned collection, said Ted Few, a London-based dealer, who bought a 17th-century German lime-wood relief sculpture for 1,500, or about $2,000, at the Hodgkin sale.Its very different from so many of todays collections.People are obsessed with specializing and are much more minimal in their approach.Admittedly, Mr. Hodgkin became wealthy enough not to have to worry about overspending on Indian drawings of elephants.But in todays finance-obsessed times, collectors have become much more reluctant to lose money and a lot less curious about art history.As a result, the wealthy now buy art like Mr. Hodgkin used to read Agatha Christie novels.They always begin at the end.
A Dutch Treasure Trove Returns to New Amsterdam:::::The European Fine Art Fair, known as TEFAF and held every March in the southern Dutch city of Maastricht, had a reputation for stability: the same dealers year after year, bringing their choicest paintings, furniture, and diamond brooches to a well-heeled collector base.But a roiling art market, and increasingly eclectic tastes, led the Dutch fair to set out for New York and to establish a pair of satellite events, spring and fall, that brought the gentility of Maastricht to a new American crowd.The autumn fair, whose second edition opens this weekend at the Park Avenue Armory, stretches from the dawn of time to around World War I.Even if youre not in the market for Flemish tapestries, Chinese porcelain or a mourning angel by Antonio Canova, the 95 exhibitors here offer a bounty of surprises for connoisseurs and amateurs alike.And a mini-show of pinhole photography by Vera Lutter, displayed by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, brings this showcase of the past right up to the present day.Here are a few prizes that caught my eye during a preview.CHARLES EDE Photo TEFAF includes a hefty sampling of Greek and Roman art, but this London dealer has brought something older and from further afield: a Persian rhyton, or ceremonial drinking vessel, that dates to around 1000 BC.The terra cotta vessel takes the shape of a zebu bull, and though it would have served a ritual purpose, its simplified forms curve with the easy elegance that Picasso would lavish on bovines nearly 3,000 years later.Hundreds of decorative scratches run from his horns to his hindquarters, and two metal earrings, on either side of the vessels spout, make this an uncommonly punk antiquity.VANDERVEN ORIENTAL ART Photo Within a diverse and sumptuous display of Chinese porcelain and statuary, this Dutch specialist gallery has brought an alluring pair of Tang dynasty stone lokapalas, or tomb guardians.These sentries between this world and the next wear ornate body armor frond-shaped helmet crests and flaming epaulets and raise their legs to stomp on ill-fated evil ghouls.Now they appear the color of coral, but look closely at their breastplates and spaulders, and you can still see traces of green and red paint that would have made these sentinels appear even more fearsome.Advertisement Continue reading the main story DANIEL CROUCH RARE BOOKS Photo In the late 18th century, about a thousand years after an anonymous Chinese sculptor carved those tomb guardians, the mapmaker Huang Qianren completed a stunning map of the world for the Qianlong Emperor.The edition here, more than seven feet long and printed in a brilliant blue, depicts the Middle Kingdom as a dynamic network of cities and town hooked up by waterways, and cradled by bumpy seas.China takes up nearly all the surface of this world map, and the Qing dynastys trading partners of Britain and the Netherlands are nearly forgotten in a corner; for this mapmaker, as for his imperial patron, anything beyond China barely counted as civilization at all.
Art and Museums in NYC This Week:::::Photo Our guide to new art shows and some that will be closing soon.DRAWN TO GREATNESS: MASTER DRAWINGS FROM THE THAW COLLECTION, at the Morgan Library & Museum (through Jan. 7).This major group drawing show constitutes a grand summing-up of a career, of an art form and of an institutions holdings.During the past 60 years, the New York art dealer Eugene V. Thaw and his wife, Clare Eddy Thaw, amassed a phenomenal drawing collection notable for its chronological breadth, running from the early Renaissance to the near present.This year they gave more than 400 items outright to the Morgan, expanding and deepening its range.The 150 works on view include a super-rare Andrea Mantegna, an unearthly Samuel Palmer and a soulful Vincent Van Gogh.(Holland Cotter) 212-685-0008, themorgan.org LAUREN GREENFIELD: GENERATION WEALTH at the International Center of Photography (through Jan. 7).They that will be rich fall into a temptation and a snare, warns the Book of Timothy.For 25 years, this Beverly Hills-born photographer has been shooting brand-obsessed, money-addled Americans rich and poor alike whose moral rot is expressed through hot-pink Birkin bags, Versace-upholstered furniture and McMansions the size of a small principality.The result is a tasteless show for a tasteless time.Some of Ms. Greenfields photographs have a moral passion that exceeds distaste.But most of these shots are dismissive and shallow, and imply that vulgarity is a greater crime than economic unfairness.(Jason Farago) 212-857-0000; icp.org THE VIETNAM WAR: 1945-1975 at the New-York Historical Society (through April 22).In contrast to the stately PBS series The Vietnam War, this jammed exhibition delivers historical data, and a lot of it, quick-and-dirty, through labels, film clips, audio bytes and objects, some of which fall under a broad definition of art.Along with paintings by contemporary Vietnamese artists, theres graffiti-style drawing on combat helmets and Zippo lighters, and period design in the form of album covers and protest posters.Words and images work together in illustrated murals labeled Home Front and War Front that put you right in the middle of the wars primary issues and events.(Cotter) 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org AI WEIWEI: GOOD FENCES MAKE GOOD NEIGHBORS at Washington Square Park, Doris C.

Anatomy of a Scene | ‘The Square’:::::Film directors walk viewers through one scene of their movies, showing the magic, motives and the mistakes from behind the camera.
The Man Designing Spaces for the Instagram Age:::::In the kitchen, the appliances are hidden in twin blue cabinets; the faucet and sink have been powder-coated the same hue.In the airy front room, the low-slung sectional sofa is nothing more than blue vinyl cushions topped with blue cotton pillows.The adjacent blue coffee table is one of the three-legged stainless steel pieces, 1 on 2 and 2 on 1, for which Nuriev is known, and which are sold by Not So General in West Hollywood.In the dining room, there are six chairs of the same color and design where one leg is an arch that ingeniously doubles as the back set around a long, blue-flecked marble table.In both the dining room and the kitchen hang pendant lamps Nuriev created out of blue-capped Bic pens.Why these particular pens?he asks rhetorically.First of all, all Soviet kids had pens like these in school.Second, its my color.Advertisement Continue reading the main story MANY OF US, lets admit it, have gone to a museum or ordered dessert simply to post the experience on social media.Likewise, many interiors on Instagram seem to have been created with a future photo in mind.But these spaces frequently feel inert, overly composed; there is none of the sense of life, of organic coherence, that accrues over time in a place thats actually been inhabited, not just arranged for a picture.Nurievs apartment is certainly photogenic he has a knack for dividing spaces with color-blocking, essentially creating areas made to be framed but it also radiates an air of imperfect coziness.That human touch is evident in the black plastic hand-shaped chair he found on the street, or the bowl of McIntosh apples that sits on his desk because their scent reminds him of growing up in Stavropol, an agricultural hub in the Caucasus.Even as his apartment serves as his showroom its not like a website where you go and see pictures, he says.Its honest.For Nuriev, honesty that intangible virtue is fundamental to good design.This sofa, he continues, pointing to the blue sectional, which is easy to imagine as the site of drunken late-night hangouts, its pure function, but its still beautiful.His goal when designing a room, he says, is to leave only whats only useful.He cites as his influences Japanese architecture (especially Tadao Ando and the firm Sanaa), Scandinavian design and Le Corbusier, who famously called a house a machine for living.These are often the references for Nurievs cohort of global minimalists, even if they dont always realize it.So many people are riffing on things they dont know about, says Patrick Parrish, Nurievs New York gallerist, nodding to the fact that young designers are bombarded by so many digital images that they often lose sight of where an idea begins.Harrys not like that.He knows exactly what hes referencing.Photo Photo This style, in part, follows last decades midcentury modern craze, though softens those hard edges, making a space more inviting.Its also an outgrowth of market forces: The popularity of midcentury furniture rendered the classics too costly for young designers, who were forced to look for more obscure vintage inspiration.Of course, it takes a new generation of designers to see old decades with fresh eyes: Often, theyve been exposed to only its most superlative examples, and only in magazines and books, as opposed to, say, their Great-aunt Margs apartment.And then theres the fact that simpler forms, like the arch, dont require the craftsmanship of more complicated designs.Nuriev, who had six years of training at the Moscow Architectural Institute, says he was first drawn to the arch because it was very classic Roman, Italian, Greek, and he wanted to figure out how to use it in real life, to make it sexy.He says that when he first started using them, back in 2014, it looked weird.The pink, likewise, looked girlish, and people would ask him why he was using it.Its not that everybody copied me, he says.Its just that I sensed something.Whats difficult to spot are references to Nurievs Russian upbringing, but theyre in fact there, if quietly.On the back wall of the kitchen hangs a blue-framed poster of Viktor Tsoi, a Soviet-Korean singer popular in the 1980s whom Nuriev calls the Patti Smith of Russia.Above the sofa, hes taped a small pamphlet, depicting the reformer Sergius of Radonezh, from his neighborhoods Russian Orthodox Church: In Russia, he says, its as customary to hang a gilt-framed icon in the house as it is to hang a painting over the sofa in American homes.His version glances at both traditions, while adhering to neither.
What to See in New York City Art Galleries This Week:::::The Peter Blum Gallery has moved to a space on the Lower East Side that is so much like its previous one, on 57th Street, that it seems simply to have slightly expanded its space in all directions.The architectural resemblance can make you laugh, but Stars Without Distance, John Zuriers show of new paintings here, may take your breath away.Mr. Zurier has devoted over two decades to making increasingly engaging monochromatic paintings that are not quite monochromes.Their delicate fields of blue, mint green, pink, yellow or smudgy white are airy and semitransparent.Their brushwork is thin-skinned, and there is much else going on: thin lines often border these fields or cut through them.Small boxy marks dabs from a narrow brush pace off distances at the sides or sneak into the fields where they sometimes resemble stars in the firmament.The paint moves into corners, creating irregularities that reveal other colors.These elements are especially clear in Taktur, a deep blue surface edged in lighter blue, with a wire-thin line crossing the field top and bottom.Each line has a white mark above and below it.These arrangements add intimations of quietly sparkling moonlit views at sea.Photo Mr. Zuriers paintings are acts of full disclosure; you see every decision, gesture and mark that went into their making.This is true of many foundational postwar painters, especially Jackson Pollock and Robert Ryman.But Mr. Zuriers process is more intuitive and personal.No detail of a painting determines any other; you absorb each, oddity by oddity, fitting them into the whole, and into the experience of really looking.ROBERTA SMITH Genesis Belanger Through Nov. 4.Mrs., 60-40 56th Drive, Maspeth, Queens; 347-841-6149, mrsgallery.com.Surrealism and Pop Art were concerned with mass production, consumerism and the psychic impact of living in a world flooded with objects.Genesis Belanger picks up this thread in Cheap Cookie and a Tall Drink of Water at Mrs. Photo Ms. Belangers sculptures, made with stoneware, porcelain and concrete, allude to recognizable objects and yet blur their references.Cheap Cookie (all works are from 2017) is an Oreo grasped between two human fingers, rounded into a nearly abstract circle.Dog in Heels is a hot dog eased into a sandal and Big Yummy looks like a minimalist concrete slab, but actually represents a piece of chewing gum wrapped in foil paper.Photo Part of the attraction of Ms. Belangers work is how it conjures art history: Salvador Dals lobster phone; Meret Oppenheims fur-covered teacup; Claes Oldenburgs soft sculptures; Man Rays objects wrapped in felt; and pieces by Evelyne Axell, Marisol, Niki de Saint Phalle, Tom Wesselmann, Brian Calvin, Al Hansen and many others working in the Pop idiom.Photo Where earlier artists were focused on the uncanniness of new electronics and mass-produced food, however, or stripped them down to a midcentury malaise, Ms. Belanger takes a middle path.Her sculptures, with their rounded surfaces and pastel hues, reflect an era of postmodern design, of so-called user friendly electronics and relatable experiences.Gadgets have become more prosthetic than ever and everything from hot dogs to cigarettes can be organic.Rather than filling us with Freudian angst or existential terror over this situation, Ms. Belangers sculptures feel like emotional support animals: comforting creatures (or biological interfaces) that ease our way through a difficult and confusing world.Advertisement Continue reading the main story MARTHA SCHWENDENER Craig Kalpakjian Through Nov. 5.Kai Matsumiya, 153 Stanton Street, Manhattan; 646-838-9595, kaimatsumiya.com.In the early days of digital photography, Craig Kalpakjian was among the first artists to make images that depicted entirely artificial spaces: rooms and structures that did not exist anywhere except as pictures or in software programs.Now that these phenomena are commonplace particularly in video games, but also in architecture, design and other fields Mr. Kalpakjian has moved on to thinking about the digital in other ways, like surveillance and control, as he does in this show at Kai Matsumiya.In one series of images here, Mr. Kalpakjian remakes Josef Alberss famous Homage to the Square paintings, giving them depth and an eerie feeling of space but also basing his images on the temperature of light rather than using Alberss focus on the interaction of color.Mr. Kalpakjians latest project, Intelligence (2016-2017) ratchets up these stakes even higher.In a series of black and white images with text, he juxtaposes excerpts from a manual for the Sony AIBO robotic dog with declassified C.I.A.and Army Intelligence interrogation manuals.Psychology (or affect, to use a current art buzzword) is paramount in both how humans can be cracked to how they can bond with a robot animal companion programmed with feelings and a personality (according to the Sony manual).Elsewhere in this dense and potent exhibition are mirrors and a robotic arm suspended from the ceiling, which suggest both how we view ourselves and are viewed by others in a technology-saturated world (or what the philosopher Vilem Flusser called the photographic universe).For some, the mirrors are clearly a selfie-op; for others, theyre a reminder of how cameras, software and digital imaging have altered our way of being in the world, and perhaps our very existence.MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Women Accuse Knight Landesman, Art World Mainstay, of Sexual Harassment:::::For decades, Mr. Landesman, 67, had been a pillar of the international art scene, a man-about-town known from the galleries of Manhattan to the Art Basel fair in Switzerland for his primary-colored suits and deep connections in the industry.The brother of the renowned Broadway producer Rocco Landesman, who once served as the head of the National Endowment for the Arts, he started at Artforum in the 1980s and until Wednesday had run the magazine with his three co-publishers, Anthony Korner, Charles Guarino and Danielle McConnell.Photo The lawsuit that preceded his departure was filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan and included accusations that he had harassed nine women, groping them, attempting to kiss them, sending them vulgar messages and, on occasion, retaliating against them when they spurned his advances.The accounts were from both former employees at the magazine and women Mr. Landesman met at art events, all of whom said he took advantage of them at the start of their careers when they were economically and professionally vulnerable.The suit also accused the owners of Artforum, one of the art worlds premier publications, of being aware of his behavior but doing little to stop it.The only named plaintiff in the suit is Amanda Schmitt, a New York curator who started working at Artforum in 2009 when she was 21.Shortly after Ms. Schmitt took the job, the suit contended, Mr. Landesman singled her out for unwelcome sexual attention, subjecting her to questions about her sex life while touching her, uninvited, on her hips, shoulders, buttocks, hands and neck.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Schmitt left Artforum in August 2012, but two weeks later, after she had started a new job in sales, Mr. Landesman sent her an email, reviewed by The Times, in which he praised brown nosing as a sales technique before veering off into a different and sexually explicit description of the practice.Not long after, Mr. Landesman invited Ms. Schmitt to tea, ostensibly to discuss her career, and grabbed her by the shoulders, trying to kiss her, the suit said.It also cited another incident in which Mr. Landesman is said to have told Ms. Schmitt that she needed to be more open to physical contact to succeed and demonstrated by running his finger down her body.In December 2012, while both were attending Art Basel Miami, Mr. Landesman barraged Ms. Schmitt with text messages asking that she meet him alone and kiss him for three seconds, the suit claimed.When Ms. Schmitt refused, Mr. Landesman sent an email saying: Give yourself to me!ALL of you = to all of me.Although Ms. Schmitt tried to cut off contact, Mr. Landesman continued sending notes, asking if she was making herself climax and was ready to make it a bit physical.Over the next two years, when he saw Ms. Schmitt at art events, the suit said, he would often whisper to her about masturbation and spanking, and touch her without consent.In May 2016, Ms. Schmitt met with Mr. Landesman, pleading with him to stop.But according to the suit, he responded by reaching his shoeless foot out to caress her.The following month, Ms. Schmitt sent him a text message saying: You have been sexually harassing me since 2012 and continue to do so.I want it to stop.Mr. Landesman wrote back promising professionalism in the future, but then asked if they could get on the same page, adding, Id like to be an ally.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.On June 15, 2016, Ms. Schmitt met with two of Artforums other publishers, Ms. McConnell and Mr. Guarino, showing them some of the messages Mr. Landesman had sent.That same day, Mr. Guarino sent Ms. Schmitt an email promising he was taking action to insure that whatever may have transpired never happens again.But according to the suit, Mr. Landesman continued sending messages, and Artforum stopped inviting Ms. Schmitt to its events.Then in May, the suit said, Mr. Landesman accosted Ms. Schmitt at a restaurant while she was eating with her romantic partner and an art critic.Sitting at the table uninvited, Mr. Landesman claimed that Ms. Schmitt had unfairly accused him of harassment and demanded she discuss it with him in front of her guests, the suit contended.Ms. Schmitt walked off, but then returned and listed for Landesman his many acts of harassment.Three months ago, Ms. Schmitts lawyer, Emily Reisbaum, sent Artforum a letter detailing those acts as well as the accounts of other women who claim Mr. Landesman harassed them.The letter demanded that the harassment stop and that Artforum pay Ms. Schmitts legal and therapy bills.Negotiations broke down last week, Ms. Reisbaum said, partly because Artforum demanded that Ms. Schmitt not speak to the media.Her lawsuit includes the other womens accounts, although none of them joined it as plaintiffs.While their stories suggest a pattern of harassment, it remains unclear if they can be considered as corroborating evidence since some of the accusers never worked for Mr. Landesman.One of them, Elisabeth McAvoy, did work at Artforum on and off from 2010 to 2013 and described how Mr. Landesman often subjected her to unwanted touching.Ms. McAvoy, who was in her 20s then and shared a bedroom with her sister, said that Mr. Landesman once encouraged her to get her own apartment so that her sister could masturbate herself to sleep.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Jordana Zeldin, a former Manhattan gallery owner, met Mr. Landesman at an art opening in 2012 and said that when he saw her boyfriend giving her a back rub, he began to pressure her for back rubs in a series of emails over the next several weeks.When Ms. Zeldin finally put her foot down, Mr. Landesman sent her an email saying she should ask for forgiveness.How about a small apology, the email said.Knight I feel a little guilty that somehow I may have lead you on into thinking Id give you a great backrub.Valerie Werder, who worked in a gallery, said that Mr. Landesman groped her after introducing her to one of her favorite art writers at an industry gala last year.Another gallery worker, Alissa McKendrick, said he did the same to her at the Whitney Biennial in 2012.In an interview this week, Ms. Schmitt said that she never wanted to sue, but that she did so not just to protect herself, but also the countless young men and women starting out in the art world.I had no power and no voice then, she said.I dont feel that way anymore.
For the Chef Daniel Humm, Less Is More. On His Wall, Too.:::::So for the new Eleven Madison Park, he hung an Ackermann chalkboard painting an incredible platform for learning, creating, erasing and new beginnings, he wrote on Instagram.And he welcomes visitors with an installation by Mr. Turner, who melted down about 1,000 pounds of the restaurants old kitchen fixtures and turned them into a step on the entry staircase.Mr. Humm got a takeout version, which he keeps on his dining table at home: a solid metal bar made of melted knives, pots, stove and meat grinder, he said.He moved into the rental apartment stark white walls, lovely moldings at the beginning of the year.I never thought in a million years that I would live on the Upper East Side, but I love it, Mr. Humm said.Its easy to go for a run.Hes participating in the TCS New York City Marathon in November.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Before he headed down to Eleven Madison Park for the day, Mr. Humm talked less-is-more philosophy at home.These are edited excerpts from the conversation.Is there an explicit link between art and food for you?My dad is an architect.I was always drawn to Minimalism, and that really has affected my cooking.One of my most important art moments came when I was 20.I saw a series of drawings Picasso did of a bull, a study in subtraction, and in the end you have just four lines.That changed my life, seeing that.How does that translate to the plate?Ive been cooking for 26 years, and it was only two years ago that I created a dish that made me feel, I did it.It was a dish of two ingredients, celery root and truffle.[Its cooked in a pigs bladder.]Any other artists who are influential?I know youre famous for white dishes.I love the monochromatic.Lucio Fontana, when I saw his retrospective at the Guggenheim, that was moving.One of my favorite artists is Robert Ryman his whole life he was troubled by using color.He tried to figure out a way not to use it.This Daniel Turner glass piece has pride of place in the living room.He inspires me a lot.Hes based in Brooklyn, but I first saw him when I was in Berlin at a gallery show.For one work [Particle Processed Cafeteria], he bought a cafeteria, ground it into a powder, dissolved the powder into liquid, and then he sprayed that liquid onto the floor.It left a beautiful rust stain.Is it awkward to collect him and be his close friend, too?The thing that interests me most is artists who are alive, and I dont collect from a living artist that I dont really like, as a person.Life is too short.
A Textile Designer’s Calming, Sunlit Life:::::While it has become ordinary for Western designers to jet to the East for inspiration (and the less-expensive work of skilled craftsmen), Barkowski approaches her work differently: Having embedded herself deep in Southeast Asia and Northern Africa, she doesnt merely infuse her designs with exotic elements.She begins with the techniques themselves, whether stitching or motifs or fabrics.To my mind, this only works if you live in the place, she says.Otherwise it shows in what you make.Her cotton bedsheets, for example, are trimmed with tiny pompoms secured with a sewing technique from northern Morocco that ensures they dont fall off.WHEN BARKOWSKI IS in Marrakesh, she spends most of her time at Dar Kawa, built in the early 1700s.She bought the riad a wreck in 1996, after first visiting the city five years earlier, when it was far less tourist-friendly.I developed a crush on this place, which was so wild compared to where I had grown up, she says.To restore the 1,950-square-foot courtyard home, she hired the modernist Belgian architect Quentin Wilbaux, who has won acclaim for his reimaginings of Moroccan riads and his meticulous cataloging of the citys houses.Together, they created a dramatic yet inviting whitewashed oasis that Barkowski outfitted sparely with sculptural furniture in black metal and cedar, paired with her own charcoal linens.Photo For much of the previous decade, she lived in this riad.The artists residency she ran, Sahart, meant the house was often full of painters, photographers and sculptors who stayed for 2-month-long stints in a nearby house and at her desert camp near the Algerian border; in exchange, they were asked only to leave behind a piece of work.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In 2008, she converted the riad into a four-bedroom hotel.Though its not rentable through the usual online booking sites, it has become particularly popular among like-minded Scandinavian, Swiss and Japanese travelers who want a minimal take on Marrakeshs maximal charm.(Theres a tribe who finds out about it through word of mouth, she says.)Barkowski and her husband now live in a modest, simply renovated home near the Palmeraie, a desert oasis about a 30-minute drive from the medina.Like Scottsdale, Ariz., the area is carved from a once-glorious landscape thousands of date palms were planted during the 11th century but has since become a showplace for fortresslike mansions and private golf clubs.Photo But Barkowskis house is from an older time, she says of the 1,900-square foot, 30s-era French colonial bungalow.When the couple moved in, she brought some raw wood packing pallets to use as bed-frames, a stopgap until she bought real furniture.But she has instead kept them, adding flea-market finds, including tables made from old doors, and textiles in a subdued pale-earth palette, flecked with red accents.What sold her on the place was the tree: a 50-foot Pistacia atlantica is the propertys dominant feature, planted about 300 years ago.With deep roots that ferret out water, such trees were once common in North Africa, but most have been lost to deforestation.From its darkly fissured boughs, Barkowski has hung simplified versions of typical Moroccan tin lanterns.Below them is a seating area and a table draped in No-Mad fabrics, where she serves guests dishes like aubergine salad with pomegranate seeds and yogurt.Otherwise, the propertys main features are sunlight and space: a luxury in busy Marrakesh or anywhere.The city is a madness of color and shape, and my mind never stops with ideas, Barkowski says.When I come here, I want a void.Her goal was to create a home so balanced that, with little more than a mattress on the floor covered in good linens, of course there would be a sense of arid beauty and timeless serenity.In Europe its cold and you are surrounded by elaborate elegance, she says.Here, how much do you really need?
Philadelphia Contemporary Hires Artistic Director From Creative Time:::::Photo The fledging art institution Philadelphia Contemporary may not yet have a home, but it now has an artistic director: Nato Thompson, currently the artistic director Creative Time.Mr. Thompson, who has been with Creative Time for a decade, will assume his new position in November, and aim to guide the institution as it moves from pop-up projects into a permanent building in Philadelphia.Philadelphia Contemporary was founded last year by Harry Philbrick, who was previously the director of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.It has hosted various events and installations around the city, including poetry readings, midnight vigils, sculptures and an interactive art project with Emma Sulkowicz.Were working on what the mission is, Mr. Thompson said in a phone interview.Certainly we know it will be a noncollecting institution.It will be multidisciplinary and civically-driven.He said he does not yet have any projects planned, or even a proposed budget to work with.The organization aims to move into a space in 2021 or 2022, and produce site-specific works around the city until then.Mr. Thompson hopes to showcase both local and international art, and contribute to a growing Philadelphia art scene to complement pillars like the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.This is a city where its very important to support the local arts community, Mr. Thompson said.Its got a great underground arts scene.But that said, I dont want to become provincial.Mr. Thompson wont have to move far: He already lives in Philadelphia, and had been commuting to Creative Time in Manhattan.While there, he oversaw projects like Kara Walkers A Subtlety in 2014.I was eager to make a change, Mr. Thompson said.Ive been doing public art for quite some time: its really, really intense work.For Creative Time, this represents yet another turnover in leadership.Its longtime executive director, Anne Pasternak, moved on to the Brooklyn Museum in 2015; her successor, Katie Hollander, stepped down this year.The organization will now search for an executive director and an artistic director at the same time.Amanda Weil, a Creative Time board member who served as board chairwoman for nine years, said Mr. Thompsons departure was part of a natural progression of the organization, and that the health of the organization is strong.This is yet another example of the degree to which our Creative Time people move on to other institutions and become thought leaders, she said.
Shopping for Wingback Chairs:::::For relaxing by a fire, almost nothing is cozier than a wingback chair.They are extremely comfortable, said Shawn Henderson, an interior designer in New York.And with sides that wrap around to cradle the body, they create this sense of being in a cocoon.But comfort isnt the only reason to have one.I love the sculptural form that they bring to a room, said Mr. Henderson, who puts wingback chairs in most of the homes he designs for clients and has many in his own weekend house in Hillsdale, N.Y.I have one in almost every room guest bedroom, master, living room and family room.Used alone, a wingback chair can be that single interesting chair in a room, he said.And multiples can make an even stronger statement: A pair of wingback chairs flanking a fireplace is awesome.Advertisement Continue reading the main story How relaxed should it be?Consider how you want to feel, Mr. Henderson said.There are upright ones that sit a little more proper, but if you want lounge-y and laid-back, there are others that fit that requirement.
Tragedy and the Will to Live: The Obsessive Art of Charlotte Salomon:::::By turning the works into a kind of play, she could use her artistic mind to imagine how things were in the past, said Mirjam Knotter, the curator of the Amsterdam exhibition, which opened on Friday and runs through March 25.Although, Ms. Knotter added, It was an entirely unique artwork, which was not meant to be played or performed.Photo Salomon, born in Berlin in 1917, came from an upper-middle-class Jewish family and watched as the world she had known as a child disintegrated when Hitler came to power.She was a reserved child, but she clearly had a turbulent and passionate inner life with an astute visual memory, imprinting everything for future use, according to her biographer Mary L. Felstiner.Images she later painted of this period reveal a wry, bitter humor.Hitlers election to chancellor in 1933 is illustrated with rows of faceless Brownshirts, painted in muddy Expressionist streaks.The swastika on a flag is reversed, a sly attempt to neutralize its power.Photo The terror of Kristallnacht the night in 1938 when Jewish homes, schools and businesses across Germany were ransacked made it clear that the Salomon family was no longer safe, and Charlotte, then 22, was sent to live with her maternal grandparents in the South of France.It was there that her grandmother killed herself, an event that led to the shattering revelation of a long line of suicides by women in the family, including, most devastatingly to Salomon, her mother, whom she had thought died of influenza.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With her grandfather taunting that she would be next, Salomon embarked on artistic creations in a bid to stave off what she saw as a family tendency toward self-destruction, inspired by the ideas of Alfred Wolfsohn, her stepmothers vocal coach, who she had known in Berlin.Having suffered acute trauma during World War I, he had developed theories of the curative power of creativity that had a lasting influence on her.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.It is unclear if Wolfsohn and Salomon were lovers.If you look at the paintings, you kind of assume it, Ms. Knotter said.Indeed their affair, whether real or imagined, takes up most of the central portion of the Life?or Theater?series.But after the war her stepmother dismissed any notion of romance between the two as fantasy.Resolving to go deep into herself in order to make sense of her life and the chaos around her, Salomon shut herself away and, in a frenzy of creative activity, painted almost 1,400 gouaches from 1940 to 1943.The musical references which accompany the work refer to the music she was hearing in her mind while she was creating the paintings, Ms. Knotter explains.Salomon hummed as she worked to jog her memory, noting which song a painting was inspired by on the rear of the paper.The paintings, text and musical references then edited into a play structure, complete with chorus, in which she and her family appear under the guise of humorous pseudonyms.She is the painter and the director of the play, Ms. Knotter said, but she is also using the role of the choir, who are commanding all the events, even the character who is an alter ego of herself.For Griselda Pollock, the author of a major study of Salomons work, the artists need to dramatize her past had a purpose: to help her uncover a history of sexual abuse by her grandfather which may have included Salomon among the victims that Ms. Pollock believes provoked the Salomon familys many suicides.The exhibition contains a recently discovered addition to Life?or Theater?, a painted letter, kept secret by her family for decades, in which Salomon appears to confess to killing her grandfather, which may give credence to the theory.However, given that Salomons work so clearly blends fact with fiction we are unlikely to ever know if she actually did.One thing that does seem clear is Salomons desire to survive.The final image of Life?Or Theater?shows her in a bright green bathing suit, facing the sea, a paintbrush in hand.It is as if she had painted her past, real or imagined, so that she could turn to her future.Photo But perhaps she sensed she wouldnt be able to.Feeling a growing sense of unease as World War II raged on, Salomon packed up her work and left it with a doctor in the summer of 1943, asking him to keep it safe, as she said it contained my whole life.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Shortly afterward, Salomon, then 26, was deported to Auschwitz.She was killed on arrival.Her journey to public recognition has been a long one.But perhaps the Amsterdam exhibition will shine a light on what, in the words of Ms. Pollock, was an extraordinarily brilliant artist, creating a work under conditions where you couldnt think anyone would create anything.
Titanic Letter Sells for Record Price at Auction in England:::::LONDON A letter written by an American first-class passenger aboard the Titanic sold on Saturday at auction for 126,000 pounds, a record price for a note written by someone on the ill-fated ocean liner.Alexander Oskar Holverson, a salesman, wrote the letter to his mother on April 13, 1912, on embossed Titanic stationery and tucked it away in his pocketbook.In it, Mr. Holverson describes a giant ship fitted up like a palacial hotel.He also mentions seeing the millionaire John Jacob Astor sitting on a deck of the vessel: He looks like any other human being even tho he has millions of money.In the most poignant mention, Mr. Holverson writes, If all goes well we will arrive in New York Wednesday A.M.

2017: The Biggest Year in Horror History:::::Advertisement 2017: The Biggest Year in Horror History We tracked horrors rise at the box office over the decades.This year, led by It and Get Out, really has outpaced all others.Image Pennywise (played by Bill Skarsgard) in "It," which has been a smash success at the box office.Credit Brooke Palmer/Warner Bros.This year, scary clowns, scary dolls and scary suburbanites have drawn audiences to the movies in droves.Even with two months remaining, 2017 has already become the biggest box office year ever for horror.Scary movies have collected $733 million in ticket sales, according to the website Box Office Mojo .The runaway success of It (more than $300 million and counting) and Get Out ($175 million) led the way, but October is a golden month for horror and will surely add more to that tally.Happy Death Day was No.1 when it opened this month (on Friday the 13th), and a new entry in the hit Saw franchise, Jigsaw (due Oct. 27), should also raise the total.How has horror fared at the box office in previous decades?Going back to the 1970s, I used data from Box Office Mojo to track the genres rise as a moneymaking force, focusing on one key year from each decade.Box Office Mojo breaks horror down into 10 subcategories on its site and its editor, Brad Brevet, has struggled with the question of what constitutes a horror movie.He tried to bring some clarity with a new list.When It came out I created an R-rated horror list on Mojo, he wrote in an email.That, at least, felt representative of the horror genre.We used the R-rated list as a reference point, but the highest-grossing year for each decade is based on figures collected from all the films the site considers horror.Also, these numbers have not been adjusted for inflation (which would turn The Exorcist into a $983 million earner).The 1970s Biggest Year: 1973, $232.9 million Image Linda Blair in "The Exorcist," with a box office take that dwarfed that of all other horror films in the '70s.Credit Warner Bros.In the early 1970s, horror broke into the mainstream in a big way, primarily with the astronomical success of The Exorcist in 1973, which alone topped the collective total of any box office year in the decade.(This figure includes box office receipts from the films later rereleases.We went with lifetime grosses in this analysis for consistencys sake.)That movie aside, horror didnt make much of an impression that year.And it was really films released later in the decade that would prove pivotal.The popularity of Halloween in 1978 ($47 million) showed that slasher films could be a force.And 1979 brought the blockbuster haunted house scares of The Amityville Horror ($86.4 million) and the influential space scares of Alien ($80.9 million).That film captured a mass audience with a return of sorts to the creature features of classic horror.The 1980s Biggest Year: 1987, $293.6 million Image Freddy (Robert Englund) was still going strong in "A Nightmare on Elm Street 3."Credit New Line Cinema The slasher genre came into its own in the 80s, with the introduction of Jason in Friday the 13th (1980) and Freddy in A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984).Those franchises produced buckets of blood and cash ($380.6 million total for Friday and $370.5 million for Elm Street).1987 was one of the decades most profitable.Elm Street was in its third installment ($44 million), The Lost Boys added young vampire thrills to the mix ($32 million) and the action horror of Predator (a movie that probably wouldnt have existed without the success of Alien) brought in strong numbers ($59 million).The 1990s Biggest Year: 1999, $574.6 million Image Heather Donahue in the found-footage hit "The Blair Witch Project."Credit Artisan Entertainment The early part of the 90s saw few major horror blockbusters.Daniel Loria, the editorial director of Boxoffice Media , cites the rise of home video in the late 80s as the reason for the dip.In a phone interview, he said that many horror films bypassed theaters for home video.A B-side horror film like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre might not have played in theaters had it been made in the late 80s or early 90s, he said.It might have just gone straight to video for a quick buck.Things looked up in the latter half of the decade, with the revival of the slasher genre through the Scream franchise ($331.7 million).And then, 1999 brought a new revolution via The Blair Witch Project, a lowest-of-budgets found-footage movie shot on video that scared up a phenomenal $140.5 million, along with many copycats.The Aughts Biggest Year: 2000, $617.7 million Image A scene from "Scream 3," released in 2000, a strong year for horror at the box office.Credit Dimension Films The 2000s began by coasting on a wave of Scream popularity.While that franchise added sequels, the 2000 parody Scary Movie pulled in $157 million.(It ranked No.9 for the year, followed by the high-end horror drama What Lies Beneath at No.10.)Later during this decade, found footage was replaced by slick yet gruesome torture horror like the Saw films, which have taken in $415.9 million so far.And reboots of earlier horror movies became a trend.2009 featured a number of these films, including a reboot of Friday the 13th, a sequel to a reboot of Halloween and the sixth entry in the Saw series.But the jaw-dropper that year wasParanormal Activity.A return to low-budget found footage, the film had a $15,000 production budget , according to Box Office Mojo, and made $107.9 million.The 2010s Biggest Year: 2017, $733.5 million Image Daniel Kaluuya in "Get Out," Jordan Peele's hit from earlier this year.Credit Universal Pictures 2017 has seen several strong performers from one of the most successful contemporary horror producers around, Jason Blum (Get Out, Split, Happy Death Day).But the biggest story is the tremendous run of It.That Stephen King adaptation perked up the domestic box office after a dismal August, and not even box office experts predicted just how well the movie would perform.Mr. Loria of Boxoffice Media said his team forecast an $81 million opening weekend.The real number was $123 million.He said they look at social media mentions to see how vocal audiences are being about a title.When it came to It, Mr. Loria said, it was just really difficult to track the word It across social media to get the snapshot we needed.
Review: Glib Laughs and Race Hate in ‘Suburbicon’:::::Photo Suburbicon, a jaundiced, hard-sell comedy, wants you to know that the American dream was always a crock.This may not be news, even in the movie industry, which loves white-picket fences in principle but remains a gated community in fact.Still, every so often a filmmaker restates the case for the prosecution.The latest complainant is George Clooney, who in directing Suburbicon has turned back the clock to the 1950s for a story about the good old American days of prosperity and prejudice, of race hate and white people who are always just one clenched fist away from becoming a mob.The title refers to the ticky-tacky Potemkin suburb where it all goes down.You know the place: Its as American as apple pie and quiet desperation.Its the post-World War II wasteland with the identical homes, lawns and faces that has been grist for critique and caricature, novels and movies, ever since suburbs were invented.In Little Boxes, a 1960s lament about conformity, Pete Seeger warbles about that sprawling wasteland, where all the boys go into business and marry and raise a family.That these little boxes look a lot like coffins gives his song the tenor of a dirge, one that Suburbicon delivers anew with cruel laughter, violent enthusiasm and acres of dark-wood paneling.Matt Damon plays Gardner Lodge, some kind of executive who has his own office and secretary at work and a wife, Rose (Julianne Moore), and son, Nicky (a good, appealing Noah Jupe), at home.It all looks neat and tidy, especially Suburbicon, a planned community dotted with houses as square as Gardners sack suits and yards that look as if theyd been landscaped using a compass and protractor.There are a few midcentury modern flourishes, but the sheer, overriding, bland whiteness underscores that this entire world has been drawn along the antiseptic lines of a period sitcom like Father Knows Best rather than a riposte like Mad Men.Video The story opens just as the Mayerses, Suburbicons first black family, move into the area, an event the neighborhood treats as a collective home invasion.Women whisper and stare, men sputter and rage, and soon all their white faces have gone red.Before long, unneighborly clusters begin gathering around the familys home, edging around the perimeter and transforming it into a kind of stage.And then the fences go up, and the clusters develop into a pack.The whispers morph into jeers, and the progressively, dangerously impatient crowd howls for the show to begin.Any resemblance to the audience watching Suburbicon is as intentional as it is obvious.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Clooney, who wrote the movie with Grant Heslov reworking a script by Ethan and Joel Coen has embraced symmetry as his guiding principle.Everything looks picture perfect in Suburbicon, and the story is so ordered that at first the movie seems to be a tale of two families, twinned peoples whose only sons dress alike and play catch in yards that face each other as if mirrored images.That there arent any movie stars in the Mayers family, though, is an early sign that all isnt quite as balanced as it seems.Karimah Westbrook has a few good moments as Mrs. Mayers, but Leith Burke, as Mr. Mayers, barely says a word.Tony Espinosa has more to do as the couples son, Andy.
Review: ‘The Square’ Takes Aim at Art, Sex, Money and More:::::But its not so simple.While Christian is willing to admit fault, he also feels compelled to note that the problem isnt just a matter of his own thoughtlessness.(Im refraining from saying what he did, since, like everything else that happens in The Square, its too surprising to spoil and too weird to explain.)There are social forces and economic structures at work, he says, large historical tendencies that both extend and extenuate his guilt.Immigration.Inequality.Social alienation.Global capitalism.That kind of thing.Christian knows a billionaire a donor to the museum who might be able to throw enough money at the problem to solve it.But even then Is there a saying about fish that live in glass barrels shooting themselves in the foot?Mr. Ostlund, whose film before this one was the squirmy, incisive Force Majeure, takes aim at some pretty fat satirical targets art, taste, sex and money, for starters and sprays buckshot at the audience as well as in his own face.The bad conscience of the cultural elite is hardly a new concern in European cinema (or American journalism, if we want to go there), and The Square, which won the Palme dOr in May, uses some of the shock-the-bourgeoisie tactic refined, in recent years, by his fellow Cannes laureates Michael Haneke and Lars von Trier.If Mr. Ostlund lacks Mr. Hanekes rigor and Mr. von Triers sadism, he at least has a sense of humor.The Square, ragged and headlong, plays like a series of elaborately staged sketch-comedy routines.Or, closer to its own concerns, like an anthology of performance art pieces.Just about everything that happens to Christian has a conceptual dimension, an element of coy self-consciousness, that makes you wonder whether its just something that happened or a carefully planned and theorized happening.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Literally speaking, of course, the movie is a string of such events, though it manages to fool, or at least to tease, the characters as well as the viewers.The robbery that sets the main plot in motion seems at first like an art-world provocation, and before he quite understands what has happened, Christian experiences the kind of thrill that art is supposed to elicit.His one night stand with an American journalist (Elisabeth Moss) is not so thrilling, but its very awkwardness has an arch, knowing quality.Staff meetings at the museum have a similar feel.Is the baby whom one of Christians colleagues brings into the room really his child?Is its presence a commentary on the persistence of innocence in a fallen world?What about Christians own daughters?Can any human action or feeling be called natural or real?
Making Room for Deaf Performers in Hollywood:::::Millie Simmonds plays Rose, a lonely deaf girl in 1927 New Jersey enamored of silent movies and of one star in particular (played by Julianne Moore, the hearing actress who also plays the grown-up Rose).Roses story alternates with that of Ben (Oakes Fegley), a Minnesota boy who becomes deaf when he is struck by lightning in 1977.In Brian Selznicks best-selling book, which he adapted for the screen, Roses story is conveyed wordlessly in pencil drawings; Bens is shared entirely in words.In the movie, her story unfolds without speech in black and white, his with blazing 70s pop color but for nearly an hour no dialogue.I was completely shocked by how little dialogue there was in the film, Mr. Haynes said in a phone interview.To approximate a nearly soundless world before production, he and Oakes wore noise-canceling headphones as they walked around New York City one day.He became aware of acute shards of visual information, he said, though he wasnt kidding himself that he had any idea what it was like to live deafness: This was a thumbnail version of anything close to life.Like Rose and Ben, Carol Padden and her husband, Tom Humphries, who both teach at the University of California, San Diego, represent different deaf experiences.Ms. Padden, a MacArthur Fellow for her research in world sign languages, was born deaf to deaf parents and grew up in deaf culture.Mr. Humphries lost his hearing when he was 6, had no deaf family and did not learn sign language until he went to college.The couple were advisers for Wonderstruck, both the book and the movie.Ms. Padden and Mr. Humphries would like to see more deaf actors in film and not just as deaf characters.Deaf actors played nonspeaking hearing roles a policeman and a maid, among others in Wonderstruck, and as a fun exercise, Ms. Padden said in an email, she tried to figure out who was deaf in the movie.There was one I missed, she said, which is a good sign of his acting.I heard that as they prepared to play their roles, they were told to look less intently at others so they would seem more hearing.But authenticity works both ways.Its hard for hearing actors to look deaf to deaf viewers, Ms. Padden said, since American Sign Language is not just a finger alphabet but a system of expression employing the whole body.For hearing viewers, she said, being deaf is about signing, or seeming silent, but for deaf viewers, its the entire embodiment of that life: the eyes, the shoulders, the hands, the walking and of course the looking.Until hearing viewers see deaf actors playing them, they may not realize entirely the hard work of embodying an entire different kind of life.Mr. Haynes said there was discussion about hiring a deaf actor for the adult Rose, but he said the film needed stars to get financing and the only role that offered itself that kind of status was the role of Rose.He turned to Ms. Moore.She took on the responsibility of that character and the research with great seriousness.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Humphries, in an email, said that the movie succeeded way better than most, but he also said that you cant achieve authenticity without much more participation of deaf people in all aspects of a movie about deaf people.Even films with deaf involvement can misstep by putting the hearing point of view first.In the summer hit Baby Driver, for example, the deaf actor and comedian CJ Jones is a scene stealer amid some Hollywood heavyweights.But Mr. Humphries pointed out that the editing cut into CJs signed lines so much we often couldnt see his signing and added, Thats reality, audiences are overwhelmingly hearing.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Matlin said that not so much has changed since Children of a Lesser God when it comes to studio movies.In independent films, where budgets are smaller, she said, risks can be taken, and there has been some progress.A recent Ukrainian film, The Tribe, has gone further than any Hollywood movie.It was filmed entirely in Ukrainian Sign Language, with a cast of deaf actors, and no subtitles or voice-overs.Still, Ms. Matlin pointed out that on TV and streaming services, there are many, many deaf actors, writers, directors and producers and lots of stories to tell.Chief among those stories may have been the cable series Switched at Birth, which ran for five seasons, featured multiple deaf actors and included an episode shot almost entirely in A.S.L.A current example is the ABC series Quantico, now shooting Season 3 in New York.Ms. Matlin (who had a recurring role in Switched at Birth) joins the cast as an ex-F.B.I.agent who lost her hearing in a bomb blast.They just put me in and have had no qualms about How do we do it?she emailed from the set.In films, by contrast, there isnt much nuance in telling the story of a deaf character, she said: Usually theyre victims, or their deafness creates some sort of jeopardy.Ethan Sinnott, director of the theater and dance program at Gallaudet University and a set designer, said that deaf theater professionals like him were not waiting for hearing Hollywood to call but taking matters into their own hands.Deaf filmmaking is ascendant, he said in an email, likely due to the ease of communication afforded by a common language between deaf actors, creatives and techies.He also said that he was gobsmacked by the success of Switched at Birth, adding, I never thought I would ever see this in my lifetime.Millie Simmonds has seen neither The Tribe nor Children of a Lesser God (they both have very adult themes), and she never, never never dreamed of being an actress.I always wanted to be a cop or a fireman or do something dangerous, she said.But here she was in Poughkeepsie, already at work in her second movie, A Quiet Place, with John Krasinski and Emily Blunt.She has no time to watch noisy scary movies anytime soon, even if she wanted to.
Review: In ‘Thank You for Your Service,’ the War at Home:::::Photo The most relevant movie precursor to Thank You for Your Service, an earnest and powerful drama about Iraq veterans returning to Kansas, is not The Hurt Locker, or the well-meaning but toothless coming-home dramas released during the Bush years (Stop-Loss, The Lucky Ones), or even American Sniper, written by Jason Hall, who wrote the screenplay for this film, his feature directing debut.Its Of Men and War, a 2015 documentary shot at the Pathway Home in Yountville, Calif., a center designed to reacclimate veterans to civilian life and also where one of the characters in Thank You for Your Service winds up.Of Men and War demanded that viewers witness the psychic scars of fighting, measuring them as part of wars cost along with the dead and more visibly wounded.Mr. Hall, working in a more sentimental, multiplex-friendly mode, makes the same point here.The movie is partly adapted from the well-received 2013 book by The Washington Posts David Finkel, who followed survivors of a battalion he had chronicled in an earlier book.Working freehandedly, Mr. Hall contrives motivations and friendships for dramatic effect.(One of the main three returning soldiers in the movie, played by Joe Cole, who arrives in Kansas only to learn that his fiance has left him, has been added to the mix.)Video The central protagonist is Adam Schumann (Miles Teller, convincingly tough), who still instinctively scans American roadsides for bombs just as he did in Iraq.He has missed crucial time with his wife (Haley Bennett, whose character and performance go beyond sympathetic-wife clichs) and young children.He is haunted by two incidents for which he feels responsible: his imperfect rescue of a comrade shot in the head, seen in a prologue, and another death, revealed only gradually, that left his wifes friend Amanda Doster (Amy Schumer, in a successfully counterintuitive bit of casting) a widow.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The other principal character is Tausolo Aeiti (Beulah Koale, a newcomer), who suffers from crippling memory loss that hampers daily functioning.As with Adam, part of Tausolos trouble is admitting his problems to himself.The movie argues that the military stifles such breakthroughs on two fronts: first with a culture that encourages stoicism, second with a failure to provide prompt medical care for veterans.Striving for the elusive goal of political neutrality, Mr. Hall has made a less jingoistic film than American Sniper (in the combat sequences, villainous Iraqis have been replaced with faceless ones).Instead, Thank You for Your Service is a macho weepie, whose message that wars are permanent for those who fight in them has broad appeal.
Streaming Halloween: Canon Classics and New Movies to Scream With:::::Photo In Halloween-season viewing prospects, theres good news and less-good news.The good news is that two stellar restorations of stone-cold horror classics were released recently.They are the amazing, amusing The Old Dark House, a 1932 horror comedy directed by James Whale, the maestro of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein, and George A. Romeros seminal 1968 Night of the Living Dead, which had a long road to a beautiful new version.The less-good news is that these restorations are not yet available for streaming, but are likely to show up in time.The Living Dead restoration is distributed by Janus, whose stuff is regularly featured on the Criterion Channel of the service Filmstruck and Kanopy.(In the meantime, if they show up at a theater near you, I implore you to go.)Filmstruck is actually an excellent site for vintage horror this Halloween.Earlier this month the service featured premieres of six 1940s horror movies produced by Val Lewton for RKO Pictures.Lewton was a novelist-turned-producer of first-class taste, wide-ranging imagination and remarkable resourcefulness.In emphasizing that taste, critics have risked giving his nine RKO horror movies short shrift in terms of their potency in the fright department.While some Lewton pictures are more conventionally thrilling than others The Curse of the Cat People (1944) is an unusual kind of sequel and features a tone more poetic than spooky most of the movies still carry strong scares.In the original Cat People (1942), the European immigrant Irena (Simone Simon), bride of a Norman-Rockwell-type all-American (Kent Smith) fears that her sexual awakening will turn her into a deadly feline creature.The scenes of Irenas romantic rival Alice (Jane Randolph) seemingly stalked by a panther through Central Park and at an athletic club are still among the tensest ever executed in film.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Similarly, the director Jacques Tourneur, who was behind Cat People and I Walked With a Zombie (1943) gets an enormous amount of scare-mileage out of the sound of dripping water, a train going over a bridge and, finally, a bolted door and some terrifying sound effects in a stage-setting scene from The Leopard Man (1943).Cat People, Zombie, Curse and Leopard Man are all part of the Filmstruck package.The other two titles are The Body Snatcher (1945) and Bedlam (1946), both more horror-conventional in subject matter and star power.The Body Snatcher is derived from the Robert Louis Stevenson story and stars both Boris Karloff of Frankenstein and Bela Lugosi of Dracula fame its one of only six movies the horror heavyweights made together.A spectacularly ghoulish story of grave robbers and medical demonstrations in 19th-century Edinburgh, it builds to a dizzying pitch of delirium.So does Bedlam, also starring Karloff, another grim period piece set in an asylum.Because the Lewton productions were low-budget pictures meant to fill out double-features, theyre pretty concise, with not many reaching the 90-minute mark.As such, the lot can serve as terrific Halloween binge-watching.
Colin Farrell and the Art of the Small Comeback:::::Before Dumbo, which he said he liked working on very much theres fire eaters and guys walking on balls and trapeze artists and Tim Burton running around with a stick.Its genius Mr. Farrell was in Chicago filming Widows with Steve McQueen, and before that working on Roman J. Israel, Esq., with Denzel Washington.And before that was The Beguiled, with Sofia Coppola, and The Killing of a Sacred Deer, which was shot last summer in Cincinnati and, of Mr. Farrells recent films, has perhaps affected him the most.Written by Mr. Lanthimos with Efthymis Filippou, the film is far darker than The Lobster, and suffused with an increasingly claustrophobic dread.Mr. Farrell adopted a monotone for the part similar to that of his Lobster role, but the characters similarity ends there.David, his Lobster character, was doughy, inward, guileless and desperately lonely, all of which felt especially poignant coming from a live wire like Mr. Farrell, who said he felt great liberation in being so contained.There was no attempt and no desire, as written, to be in any way cool, any way interesting, any way suave, he said.But Steven, the heart surgeon he played in Killing, is cunning and arrogant, and by the end of the production, Mr. Farrell said, he felt very depressed.Video He was drawn to the part by the same tug that drew him to The Lobster, finding brilliance in the twisted worlds Mr. Lanthimos creates.And in Mr. Farrell, Mr. Lanthimos said he found a true creative partner.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its a gift to have that kind of relationship, its easier to go further and explore other things, Mr. Lanthimos said.This was a challenge, something more different and complex and dark, and I knew he had the understanding and tone.For all his work on big films, Mr. Farrell has long preferred smaller films anyway and the specific stories they can tell.When Martin McDonagh approached him to play a hit man for In Bruges, basically throwing him a lifeline, he almost turned down the part.Hed been in a string of bad movies and was still feeling the lingering burn of his Alexander the Great movie.(Among the sharper barbs: He seems like a moody sad sack that I wouldnt follow to the grocery store much less into battle.)He worried his name might scare people away.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. McDonagh persuaded him anyway.The character needed to be lovable and appealing even though hes done something horrific and unforgivable, and its easy to love Colin, and to believe that sense of guilt he showed so well, Mr. McDonagh wrote by email.Also, I dont think he ever really didnt want to do the part for a second!For Mr. Farrell, it was a shaky time.He was scant months out of rehab, having finally caved to his familys pressures to get straight.Asked what hastened his bottoming out, Mr. Farrell quipped, Just existing.But really, he added, it was the intensity of sudden fame, which came fast after Joel Schumacher cast him in Tigerland (2000) and then Phone Booth (2002).Getting all these platitudes and things being said about you, and all these gifts, it wasnt in my DNA to believe any of this stuff, he said.You try and match the hype, but I never believed it.Mr. Farrell is from Castleknock, a relatively well-to-do Dublin suburb, and studied at the Gaiety School of Acting in Dublin before landing a role in 1998 on the BBC soap Ballykissangel.He took the Irish national commandment of not getting ahead of yourself to Hollywood, foolishly and understandably, he now says, equating personal change with betraying his roots.I remember making a promise to myself, Dont change, dont change, remember where you come from, he said.But change is inevitable.You dont change, you get sickness, your life will fall apart on the inside.His antics filled gossip pages, but he swears many of them were lost to blackouts.I asked about the time he kissed a reporter on camera on the red carpet, and his eyes widened.Did I?Who?Which one?he asked.I swear to God, I lost so much time.A little while later, a button on my blouse popped, and as I quickly refastened it, he steadfastly held my gaze, and then pointed to his eyes.I kept right here, the whole time, he teased.Back in the day I wouldve leaned in for a kiss, obviously.The exchange was light and playful, and the interview took place before The New York Times published its expos on the producer Harvey Weinstein, whose reported sexual misconduct Mr. Farrell would later denounce as atrocious.In our chat, though, Mr. Farrell did address the latitude given to stars.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The one thing that fame asks you to do, I have learned, is to police yourself, he said.You get away with murder, you get away with mistreating people, you wont be called out on things you really should be called out with, you really do.He was glad that those days were behind him, he said, not least because sobriety has made him a much better dad.His first son, James Padraig, was born in 2003 (Jamess mother is the model Kim Bordenave), and initially Mr. Farrell figured hed be his sons friend.Cause thats what a 6-month-old grub needs, he cracked, a 27-year-old drunk, high friend.He had his second son, Henry, with his former girlfriend the actress Alicja Bachleda-Curus.Mr. Farrell shares custody of his sons, and says he cant think of a decision he has made in the last dozen or so years without thinking about how it would impact them.Now his life centers on the boys, his home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, yoga (I said I love it, I didnt say Im doing it), and saunas (very purifying).Video He was a wild guy, and now I think hes channeled all of that into his family, and his work, said the director Dan Gilroy, who said he cast Mr. Farrell in Roman Israel in part because he knew he could hold his own with Denzel Washington.Mr. Farrell said he planned to take a long break, and he was open to whats next, be it action heroes, even though he loathes guns (Hate em!)or, in the vein of Mr. Lanthimoss films, more unsexy roles, even if he might be somewhat alone in characterizing them that way.I still think he was sexy in those movies, Mr. McDonagh wrote in his email.He couldnt really get rid of that without chopping his head off.
‘Daughter of the Nile’: Baffling, Beautiful and Newly Restored:::::Photo The great Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsiens work is at once popular and avant-garde.His films are also seldom available on the big screen after their initial releases.The weeklong run that Quad Cinema is giving his 1987 film, Daughter of the Nile, starting Friday in an excellent digital restoration, is thus something of an event.Generically a film about disaffected youth in the tradition of Rebel Without a Cause, Daughter of the Nile was produced by a music company as a vehicle for the Taiwanese singer Yang Lin, who does not perform onscreen (although she is heard on the soundtrack).Her character, Shao Yang, is a stoical, dreamy teenager attending night school; working shifts in a Taipei KFC; and keeping house for her kid sister and older brother, a petty criminal.Her mother is dead, and her father is a policeman who works in another city.Shao Yang nurses a crush on one of her brothers sketchy associates, but her fantasy life is nourished by the Japanese manga that gives the movie its title she identifies with the comic books dislocated heroine, an American girl who time travels to ancient Egypt, where she falls impossibly in love with a handsome young pharaoh.Daughter of the Nile is deceptively tranquil, considering that two men in Shao Yangs life suffer violent deaths and another is severely wounded.This mayhem is largely unseen and barely explained.The sense of wistful melancholy and fidelity to the protagonists point of view suggests that it is all her future memory.Rather than gangster melodrama, she lives in a world of American pop, Japanese gadgets and ironic intimations of antiquity, as when a version of Walk Like an Egyptian pops up on the soundtrack.Life, to borrow the title of a Milan Kundera novel, is elsewhere.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Vincent Canby, who reviewed Daughter of the Nile in The New York Times when it was shown at the 1988 New York Film Festival, patronizingly characterized Mr. Hou, then well into his career, as an earnest film student, noting his affinities to the Japanese master Yasujiro Ozu.Daughter of the Nile does resemble an Ozu film in its precise camera placement, use of repeated images (mainly cityscapes) as punctuation and preference for movement within the frame.The most compelling object in Shao Yangs modest home is a large fish tank.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But Mr. Hou, now 70, is closer to Robert Bresson in his oblique narrative style.Transitional shots are few; empty interiors are introduced before (or held after) being animated by human activity.Like Bressons actors, Mr. Hous are less performers than physical presences.The movie begins with a lengthy close-up of Ms. Yang that is practically a Warhol screen test.Making films that are understated but not austere, Mr. Hou is an original.In different ways, Daughter of the Nile seems to have inspired two of the most ambitious Chinese movies of the early 1990s: Wong Kar-wais Days of Being Wild and A Brighter Summer Day, the masterpiece directed by Mr. Hous Taiwanese compatriot Edward Yang.
Anatomy of a Scene | ‘The Square’:::::Film directors walk viewers through one scene of their movies, showing the magic, motives and the mistakes from behind the camera.
Review: In Folsom State Prison, ‘The Work’ Sets You Free:::::Photo The main takeaway from the prison-therapy documentary The Work (besides the fact that watching grown men scream and grovel is not for the fainthearted), is that crime in this country could be drastically reduced if only more fathers were around to raise their sons.That may seem a simplistic, even flippant conclusion.But hearing inmate after inmate describe an absent or emotionally withholding father as the source of his mental anguish renders it also an inescapable one.Set mainly in a single, stone-walled room in Folsom State Prison in California, this fly-on-the-wall study by Jairus McLeary and Gethin Aldous follows three variously troubled non-inmates over four days of intense group therapy with a passel of maximum-security convicts.Video Opening an aperture into a process so ego-stripping that it feels unseemly to witness, The Work is enlightening yet also punishing.Even more disturbing than one of the crimes described and the near-constant background howls is the convicts willingness to bare their souls for the nosing-around camera.Some offenders have been attending these sessions (run by an admirable nonprofit dedicated to inmates personal growth) for years, and the brothers-in-arms lingo of the 12-step program flows easily.The mens wrenching revelations and raging breakdowns appear brave and genuine; but how far can we trust behavior that at some point could be factored into parole decisions?For one quiet outside visitor, warily watching these agonized displays, the pressure to follow suit is palpable.I didnt come here looking to cry, he says, and I dont want to feel like Im letting them down if I dont.His guardedness is the movies most relatable moment.
Refusing Weinstein’s Hush Money, Rose McGowan Calls Out Hollywood:::::She said she told her lawyer to pull the offer within a day of The New York Times publishing an article that detailed decades of Mr. Weinsteins alleged sexual harassment, aggression and misconduct toward women, as well as at least seven other settlements he had reached with accusers.After that, the dam burst, with The New Yorker, The Times and other news outlets reporting on dozens of other womens experiences with Mr. Weinstein.Photo Mr. Weinstein, his accusers say, built his long history of abusing women on a risky gamble that worked for him over and over the assumption that money or threats could buy womens silence on a subject so intimate and painful that most would prefer not to go public anyway.While Ms. McGowan was the rare voice suggesting that the cover-up was not fail-safe, even she considered not naming him, having already, she believes, paid a career price for that long-ago episode and its aftermath.A Weinstein spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said that Mr. Weinstein unequivocally denies any allegations of nonconsensual sex.Ms. McGowans lawyer, Paul Coggins, confirmed that Ms. McGowan received the offer.By 2015, Ms. McGowan, who felt alienated by the industry, started using her sizable platform on Twitter to maximize her status as both insider and outsider someone with enough Hollywood experience to speak with authority about sexism within it, and someone liberated enough from its compromises to unleash the fury in her that had been building for years.Only now does the scope of the news about Mr. Weinstein and the public conversation about whats wrong with Hollywood seem to match the scale of her outrage, giving her the clout of a contrarian at last proven right.On Friday, at the inaugural Womens Convention in Detroit, she was a featured speaker a new, combative face of feminism, endowed with Hollywood charisma yet anything but slick.I have been silenced for 20 years, she told the gathering.I have been slut-shamed.I have been harassed.I have been maligned.And you know what?Im just like you.A Crusade Gathers Strength As other women told their stories in recent weeks, Ms. McGowan not only addressed what happened to her but also attacked those she considered complicit.Photo When the actor Ben Affleck claimed he never knew of Mr. Weinsteins history, she wrote in a tweet: GODDAMNIT!I TOLD HIM TO STOP DOING THAT you said that to my face, adding, The press conf I was made to go to after assault.You lie.(Mr. Affleck declined to comment.)She called out the larger apparatus of Hollywood, criticizing talent agencies you are guilty of human trafficking, she wrote and a film studio that she believed knew of Mr. Weinsteins alleged misconduct.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When Twitter suspended her account the company said that it was because she had published a private phone number users retaliated with a boycott that drew support from celebrities such as the actress Alyssa Milano and the writer Cheryl Strayed.The actor and filmmaker Jordan Peele tweeted, in response to Ms. McGowans blistering attacks, a moody still of her from Grindhouse in which she surveys burning wreckage her character has wrought.Get em, Rose, he wrote.On Oct. 13, the day of the boycott, Ms. McGowan retreated from Los Angeles, where she had been working on her memoir, to a beach cottage in Hawaii, safely ensconced behind two gates, near a park locals call the City of Refuge.I wanted to come to a place that had so much power to it, that it could hold a lot at bay a lot of monster energy, said Ms. McGowan, sitting at a picnic table near the ocean.I came to a place that almost has a protective zone around it.Her hair was short, but not shaven, as it had been in the past.Once featured on the covers of Maxim and Rolling Stone as a longhaired, barely dressed object of desire, Ms. McGowan seems to have settled on an aesthetic of chic simplicity.If not a time of celebration, this moment could be perceived as a moment of vindication for Ms. McGowan.Yes, she said, she sometimes feels like laughing kind of like a witchs cackle, she clarified.But at other times she feels emotionally raw, just knowing that a click on her phone would bring her to conversations others were having about her assault allegation.The phone had come to feel too powerful: Its like a live wire that youre holding in your mouth, and it goes directly to your brain, she said.The Meeting and the Aftermath Her story of assault, although uniquely her own, shares some of the now familiar hallmarks of a Weinstein encounter.Ms. McGowan, then 23, was in Park City, Utah, in early 1997 to attend the Sundance Film Festival and the screening of a film in which she appeared, Going All the Way.She had also recently appeared as a smart-mouthed beauty who dies a gruesome death in the blockbuster film Scream, on which Mr. Weinstein was an executive producer.Got a confidential news tip?The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.Ms. McGowans manager then, Jill Messick, told her to meet Mr. Weinstein at the restaurant in the Stein Eriksen Lodge for a 10 a.m. appointment.On her arrival, the matre d directed the actress upstairs to Mr. Weinsteins suite, she said.Ms. McGowan remembers passing two male assistants on the way in.They wouldnt look me in the eye, she recalled.She sat at the far end of a couch as Mr. Weinstein sat in a club chair, and they had a brief business meeting.But on their way out, she said, he interrupted himself to point out that the hotel room had a hot tub.And then what happened, happened, said Ms. McGowan, who has described her experience, on Twitter, as rape.Suffice it to say a door opened and my life changed.She declined to share the details of the encounter.Thats my story to tell, she said emphatically.But she said that she walked out of the hotel suite and directly into a press event.She remembers fighting back tears, and the conversation with Mr. Affleck.She said she told Ms. Messick, then of Addis-Wechsler & Associates, what had occurred.She held me, Ms. McGowan said.She put her arms around me.But in the months to come, Ms. McGowan did not feel supported by her management team.She was referred to a lawyer specializing in sexual harassment and assault cases who, Ms. McGowan said, gave her the impression that filing a criminal charge was hopeless.She was like, Youre an actress, youve done a sex scene, youre done, she recalled.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Anne Woodward, now a manager herself, was a young assistant in Ms. Messicks office at the time, and was in on many of Ms. Messicks calls.I remember that Rose was extremely upset and did not want to settle, Ms. Woodward said.She wanted to fight.No one around her, as Ms. Woodward recalls, supported that instinct.It was an emotionally shocking way to see a woman being treated, Ms. Woodward said.Thats what stuck with me.Photo Nick Wechsler, then a principal at Addis-Wechsler & Associates, said that he and his partner, Keith Addis, met with Mr. Weinstein at Ms. Messicks request and confronted him with Ms. McGowans claim.I remember Harvey saying he was going to get psychiatric treatment or some kind of therapy for his sexual behavior, Mr. Wechsler said.Ms. McGowan initially asked for about $25,000, enough money to cover her therapy; by the time she signed the settlement, the amount had been raised to $100,000.Both Ms. Woodward and Ms. McGowan were shocked when, only a few months afterward, Ms. Messick accepted a job working as vice president for development at Miramax, then run by Mr. Weinstein.Ms. Messick did not respond to a request for comment.At the time of the alleged assault, Ms. McGowan had finally been emerging from the trials of an insecure childhood, with loving but unconventional parents: Her father, said his sister, Rory McGowan, Roses aunt, almost certainly had undiagnosed manic-depressive disorder.He was the leader of a religious cult in Italy, from which Roses grandmother extracted her before she reached middle school.Both parents were hippie intellectuals, members of the counterculture who taught their children to prize independent thinking and buck the system.Maddie Corman, an actress who befriended Ms. McGowan in the mid-90s, perceived a change in Ms. McGowan after the 1997 episode (she says she was aware of the settlement, but could not recall if she learned it directly from Ms. McGowan or from others).Rose was never this sweet, simple soul there was always something ferocious about her, Ms. Corman said.After that assault, a light dimmed.I remember her souring on the powers that be.And she became very protective of us.It was sometimes cryptic: Keep your guard up.Ms. McGowans friends watched as she made choices that surprised them, including beginning a relationship with Marilyn Manson, a controversial rock star and ordained Satanist who has called himself the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles.(I ran away for three years and joined the circus, Ms. McGowan said of that romantic involvement.)She showed up for the red carpet at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1998 in a dress made of tiny beads that left her nearly nude.That was my first big public appearance after being assaulted, she said.And I thought you want to see a body?I did it with a giant middle finger.Photo Camilla Rantsen was also a young actress in Los Angeles who was close to Ms. McGowan, and was aware, only through friends, of what had transpired.I think some of the people she started surrounding herself with werent as great as the people she had before, said Ms. Rantsen, who is now a writer.Plenty of young actresses with promising starts see their careers founder for one reason or another.But Ms. McGowan believes that after she finished up work on Phantoms, a 1998 film produced by Miramax, her career suffered because collaborations with Weinstein productions were for many years off the table.And they were doing the kinds of movies that I would be doing, she said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She continued to work, on Charmed until 2006, but also in independent films.Eventually, she appeared in both of the two films packaged as Grindhouse, directed by Robert Rodriguez, with whom she was romantically involved, and by Quentin Tarantino.It was distributed by Dimension, run by Bob Weinstein, Harveys brother.As the film critic David Edelstein put it in New York, Ms. McGowan played the ultimate abused-and-fetishized action-movie femme.The experience, Ms. McGowan said, left her shattered.I was really lost at that point, she said.I was damaged.Shunning Celebrity It is impossible to predict how Ms. McGowans career path in film would have proceeded had the episode with Mr. Weinstein never occurred.She is an unconventional figure, occasionally provocative and profane, but also sometimes old-fashioned and even formal in spirit.I never considered myself a celebrity, she said at one point.I hate that word.Its tawdry.Ms. McGowan became an increasingly outspoken voice for women mistreated by Hollywood.In 2015, she was dropped from her agency after mocking a casting call that encouraged women to wear push-up bras in auditions.(Her agent had been fired a few days earlier, but the agency did not fight to retain her, as agencies typically do of valued clients.)Photo In The Hollywood Reporter, she passionately defended Rene Zellweger last year from what she perceived as sexist comments in Variety about the actresss plastic surgery.How dare you bully a woman who has done nothing but try to entertain people like you?she wrote, in a direct accusation of the pieces writer, Owen Glieberman.It was startling and inspiring to see someone who was willing to put herself out there in support of other women/actresses, said the actress Molly Ringwald in an email to The Times.Her tenacity is something that you would hope for in an union leader but of course never really get.And Ms. McGowan spoke, in veiled terms, to the Buzzfeed reporter Kate Aurthur in 2015 about her experience as an assault victim.You are taking part of someones soul, she said.Its happened to me.Last year, during a Twitter campaign called #WhyWomenDontReport, she all but named Mr. Weinstein as the perpetrator of the violence against her that she had mentioned in the past.During her recent visit to Hawaii, Ms. McGowan, over a day and a half in Kona, revealed a person much more playful than her fierce Twitter persona.She would interrupt a thought to smile and smell a flower that caught her eye; she could not resist a swing hanging from a large tree, and enjoyed twirling an umbrella the same blue as her sundress while walking on the beach.She seemed free, in some ways, from both a long-kept secret and a labor of love that had occupied her for the last year and a half her book, Brave, which will be released by Harper One early next year.To some degree, she had shielded herself from the news.But when she learned how many women had stepped forward to complain of assault or harassment by Mr. Weinstein, she said: I knew we are legion.We are legion.She had been corresponding lately with Asia Argento, an Italian actress who also accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual assault (and was subsequently shamed by the Italian press).It feels, Ms. McGowan wrote to Ms. Argento, reading from her text, like toxic slime going out of a spiked birth canal.Thats what the whole experience feels like to me.Its an intense process.Sometimes she feels fresh rage.But Ill tell you what I dont feel anymore, she said.Despair.
Walter Lassally, Cinematographer Who Won Oscar for ‘Zorba,’ Dies at 90:::::Mr. Lassally worked with the director James Ivory on the period dramas that were the signature of Merchant Ivory Productions, like The Wild Party (1975), set in Hollywood of the 1920s, and Heat and Dust (1983), set partly in India of the 1920s.He shot comedies like The Great Bank Hoax (1978).He did the occasional television movie, including The Man Upstairs, a 1992 comic drama on CBS that starred Katharine Hepburn and Ryan ONeal.He could make even a mundane setting interesting, as Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted in his review of the 1969 film 3 Into 2 Wont Go.Walter Lassally, Mr. Canby wrote, who photographed some of Tony Richardsons best films (The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner), must, I assume, receive some of the credit for transforming a suburban house into a locale as fascinating and mysterious and necessary to this film as Monument Valley used to be to John Ford.Photo Mr. Lassally was born on Dec. 18, 1926, in Berlin.His father was an engineer who sometimes used film as an adjunct to his work as he studied mechanical processes.The family, Mr. Lassally said in an interview with the website Web of Stories, was not Jewish but had Jewish ancestors, making them unwelcome in their own country as the Nazis came to power.In 1939, just before the outbreak of war, they emigrated to England.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There was no immediate word on his survivors.As a youngster Mr. Lassally worked at Riverside Studios in London as a clapper boy, holding the slate up before a scene.Riverside soon went bankrupt, but Mr. Lassally was on his way; in 1950 he was given the chance to shoot a fire-prevention documentary called Every Five Minutes.He also began writing about moviemaking, becoming identified with the British documentary film movement known as Free Cinema.His first features as cinematographer, Another Sky, set in North Africa, and Passing Stranger, a crime film set in a small British town, were both released in 1954.He started his career in documentaries and applied some of those techniques to his feature work in groundbreaking ways, Stephen Pizzello, editor in chief and publisher of American Cinematographer magazine, said by email.The mission of the Free Cinema movement was to produce realistic films about the working class, and its practitioners shot in authentic locations with relatively unknown actors and actresses; they were the guerrilla filmmakers of their day.Photo In 1961 Mr. Richardson, who died in 1991, asked Mr. Lassally to shoot A Taste of Honey, a drama about a pregnant teenager, which Mr. Pizzello said was the first major British feature shot entirely on location.The next year the two made The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, about a boy at an English reform school.In 1963 came Tom Jones, a romantic romp, based on the Henry Fielding novel, set in the 18th century.It had a particularly memorable scene involving a stag hunt, which included countless hounds running alongside riders on galloping horses.Mr. Lassally found a thrilling way to render the scene, mixing conventional images with shots taken from a helicopter and a camera mounted so low on a truck that it could look up at the riders faces.Its so cleverly intercut that sometimes you think youre running along the ground, and then suddenly youre jumping over the bushes and rising into the air, Mr. Lassally said.So that was a very effective technique, and its caused a lot of comment after.People always ask me, How did you do that?The cinematographer Tom Houghton worked as a gaffer with Mr. Lassally on later films, including the marital drama Too Far to Go (1979), and found it a vital learning experience.He took a great deal of care in the placement of lights, Mr. Houghton told American Cinematographer for a 2008 article on Mr. Lassally, and it was an amazing experience to watch him.The more I worked with him, the more I understood what he was going for.He knew how to create subtleties and nuances in the midst of simplicity, and he brought that sensibility from the smaller projects to the bigger films.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a 2015 interview with Radio Prague, Mr. Lassally summed up the importance of the look of a film.To me cinema is visual, he said.In a good film, you should be able to turn off the soundtrack and still get the story.Nowadays its the other way around.Most of the information tends to be in the dialogue and not in the pictures, and thats not cinema to me.
Motion Picture Academy Moves to Institute Code of Conduct:::::Photo Nodding to critics who contend that the movie industry hasnt done enough to fight sexual harassment, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Thursday that it would be establishing a code of conduct for its members.According to an email sent to members by the Academys chief executive, Dawn Hudson, the new rules will include a policy for evaluating alleged violations and determining if action regarding membership is warranted.This comes on the heels of the Academy, which is the de facto governing body of the movie industry, expelling Harvey Weinstein two weeks ago, breaking with 90 years of precedent.At the time, the Academy said in a statement that it would, work to establish ethical standards of conduct that all academy members will be expected to exemplify.But still, it has faced criticism in recent weeks, given that Roman Polanski, who pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor in 1977, and Bill Cosby still remain members.Ms. Hudson said in the letter that the Academy would consult experts in law and ethics to gain a better understanding of what more we can and should be doing.She added, Although we have no intention of functioning as an investigative body or moral court, we do have a right and duty as a voluntary association to maintain clear standards of workplace behavior for those we accept as members.
It’s Always Fishnets Season Somewhere:::::That look is dated, for sure, bearing little resemblance to what many prostitutes actually wear, but those images have proliferated just the same, a common sight this fall at concerts, on theater screens and in a flurry of luxury ad campaigns.Seedily costumed streetwalkers are a magnet to fans of The Deuce, about 1970s-era Times Square and the rise of its infant pornography industry.A leather-clad vixen grinds her stilettos into a fleshy male torso in one of the Steven Klein videos on display this month in Fetish, an exhibition organized in partnership with Visionaire magazine at the venerable Sothebys auction house.And a manga-inspired old-school prostitute, resplendent in shrill fuchsia fur, is among the vivid attractions of Blade Runner 2049.The very prevalence of such images, overworked as they may be, is a testament to their durability.It is reason enough to look more closely at a position advanced by scholars and style arbiters alike: that the clothes we wear, or might like to wear, owe a very real debt to the worlds most ancient profession.Fashion right now is influenced by hookers, said Anna Terrazas, the costume designer of The Deuce.Its not the other way around.In a sea of eye-numbing conventionality, a maverick appearance is their signature.For someone employed on the busy streets, Ms. Terrazas said, the point is to be seen.Not a groundbreaking concept, exactly.There is an untold history of the relationship between sex workers and fashion, said Rebecca Arnold, a fashion historian and lecturer at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London.As fashions early adopters, working women routinely took up what their respectable contemporaries shunned as too showy, tasteless or new.Photo The dubious woman could be more outlandish in her dress, and more experimental, Ms. Arnold said.She is allied with the idea of fashion as linked, not necessarily with the avant-garde, but with the beginning of new dress trends.Among the more fashionably progressive were the grandes horizontales of the 19th century, courtesans like Cora Pearl, a client of Charles Worth, the eras first celebrity designer; and Catherine Walters (Skittles to her public), riveting on horseback as she paraded through Hyde Park sewn into her riding ensembles.Her style was much copied by noblewomen of the day.Advertisement Continue reading the main story More recently, to hear it from the prostitutes themselves, down-market variations on that patrician theme have been reduced to a series of musty clichs.Fashion doesnt produce a vast range of ideas of what female sexuality looks like, said Annie Sprinkle, a writer, sex educator and former prostitute.Stereotypes abound, she noted, with the upper echelons of the profession embodied by the aspirational up-and-comer cloaked in cashmere and silk and the role-play specialist dressed in pinstripes or a schoolgirl smock.The more down-market variations flaunt fishnets, kinky boots, hot pants, fur chubbies and harnesses.Its a visual code dating at least from the 70s, tatty and archaic even then.Yet it is routinely resurrected by top-tier designers including Marc Jacobs, John Galliano and Alexander Wang, each gussying up his offerings in sumptuous fabrics or in a mash-up of fetish, athletic and military gear, to tamp down the steamy aggression and make the look palatable to an affluent clientele.Photo The gambit works.In the disco era, fashion was inspired by drag queens and prostitutes, said Tom Fitzgerald, one half of Tom & Lorenzo, an opinionated fashion blog.Fashion in general is always borrowing from street wear, and it doesnt get more street wear than hooker.Those references, fixtures in the lexicon of style, are mainstream now.Is there a specific sex worker look anymore?Mr. Fitzgerald said.Or does it all get pulled from the sexy pile at Forever 21?Like hip-hop and grunge, the look has been normalized, he said.Its never been more respectable.Or apparently more covetable.In The Deuce, Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the prostitute Candy, swivels her hips in a working-girl wardrobe of short shorts, skimpy tops and lightly soiled coats.The actress reminisced the other day about her fixation with its centerpiece, a boxy fur chubby, a down-market variation on a famously scandalizing look introduced in the 70s by Yves Saint Laurent, one inspired by the wartime prostitutes of the Rue Saint-Denis.Photo Seemingly unaware of its provenance, Ms. Gyllenhaal went on, I wanted to wear that jacket in every scene.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She wasnt alone.It became such an iconic piece on the set, Ms. Terrazas said.All of the girls were, like, I want a jacket like that.Pop performers like to tap the look as an assertion of power, often treading a fine line between owning their sexuality and trading on it.Cardi B, a retired stripper-ho, as she boasts, has been accused of glamorizing prostitution.She makes no apology.Nor does Nicki Minaj, who turned up at a fashion show this fall wearing lace-up hot pants, over-the-knee boots and an ermine stole, her image an echo of Julia Robertss pre-makeover turnout in Pretty Woman.
Weinstein Sues Weinstein Company, Demanding Access to Records:::::Photo LOS ANGELES Weinstein v. Weinstein has commenced.Harvey Weinstein, who was fired by the studio he had helped found after The New York Times revealed decades of sexual harassment allegations against him, sued the Weinstein Company on Thursday to demand access to records and emails.The complaint, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, said Mr. Weinstein needed the materials to defend himself.More than 50 women have come forward in recent weeks to accuse Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment or rape.Mr. Weinstein believes that his email account which is the primary, if not only, account he used during the term of his employment by the company will contain information exonerating him, the complaint said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Weinstein also wants access to his former email account and other company documents, including his personnel file, to pursue a claim of wrongful termination against the Weinstein Company, according to the complaint.He also wants to pursue legal action against the studio for mismanagement by leaking confidential company information saying that certain news reports about his behavior could have only come from his personnel file.
Talk of Weinstein Dominates Women’s Ceremony in a Hollywood ‘Unmoored’:::::These last couple weeks have unmoored the industry, Ms. Silverstein said in a somber tone during her opening remarks.But the revelations about Mr. Weinstein and others, she quickly added, should be seized upon as a real opportunity to push for systemic change.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A global conversation about sexual harassment, toxic masculinity and the institutional sexism that envelops the industry is much needed, she said.Some women in the audience raised a fist in solidarity.One shouted, Topple the patriarchy!A few men shifted uncomfortably in their seats.During a cocktail hour before the ceremony Women and Hollywood held a similar event in New York last week and will host one in London next month honorees like Lenora Lapidus, director of the Womens Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, networked over coconut chicken skewers and cilantro steak empanadas.Photo Theres a teeny silver lining, Ms. Lapidus said about the deluge of allegations.Its reached such a crescendo that theres no going back.A spokeswoman for Mr. Weinstein, who was fired by the studio he co-founded, has repeatedly denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex.The ArcLight, an upscale movie theater and event space in the heart of Hollywood, was simultaneously hosting a premiere for Jigsaw, which Lionsgate hopes will restart its Saw franchise.As women at Ms. Silversteins gathering cited statistics about gender inequality in moviedom women buy 50 percent of movie tickets in the United States, but only 7 percent of the 250 top-grossing films in 2016 were directed by women several dryly noted that it seemed appropriate to have a torture-themed horror movie as a backdrop.One honoree, Stacy L. Smith, an associate professor at the University of Southern California and author of damning reports about gender discrimination in the movie and television business, called Hollywood a cesspool of humanity.But Ms. Smith had high praise for Ms. Silverstein, whom she referred to as the entertainment industrys chief agitation officer.Ms. Silverstein, who grew up on Long Island and works from her Brooklyn apartment, has long focused on womens causes.After graduating from Brandeis University in 1989 and earning a masters degree from Columbia University in 1993, she worked for organizations like the Ms. Foundation and the White House Project, a now-defunct nonprofit dedicated to increasing female representation in business and government.Photo In 2007, she started a blog to push for gender diversity in the global film industry.She called it Women and Hollywood.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I didnt trust my voice at first, but I slowly put myself out there and started to get noticed, Ms. Silverstein said.Now Im kind of a rabid dog, she added with a chuckle.On Twitter, where Ms. Silverstein has 33,500 followers, she has been encouraging abused women to come forward.On Thursday, she tweeted #catchthebastards and #BelieveWomen.Although it has evolved into a larger organization, Women and Hollywood is still mostly known as a blog.Ms. Silverstein has a small staff of editors, and the site publishes articles by a range of freelancers.She does not sell advertising and depends on funding from sponsorships and people like Barbara Dobkin, a philanthropist dedicated to womens issues.Ms. Silverstein is also artistic director and co-founder of the Athena Film Festival, which programs films, like Suffragette and Hidden Figures, that highlight women in leadership roles.The eighth annual festival will take place at Barnard College in February.I do this work because movies are our cave paintings, Ms. Silverstein said.And there are still so many stories that are missing.We are desperate for diverse stories from diverse points of view.

Review: Lena Olin Is Fierce as a Suicidal Poet in ‘Maya Dardel’:::::Photo The first time we hear Maya Dardel (Lena Olin, and her inimitable rasp), she is declaring her intention to commit suicide.Maya, a renowned poet living in isolation, believes her work has begun to decline.Her only concern now is with finding a worthy heir to manage her estate.Women need not apply Maya wants to play with power and toy with the young male poets who offer themselves as her potential successors.Video The passions that drive Maya Dardel, written and directed by Magdalena Zyzak and Zachary Cotler, are more literary than cinematic.Maya circles her legacy-minded suitors, dropping references to Sylvia Plath and discussing the merits of rhyme schemes and suicide.But for all the linguistic gymnastics, the film is hamstrung by its directors lack of visual imagination.Maya challenges her boyish applicants poetically, sexually and finally with offers of intimacy, but the editing all too often settles into a submissive back and forth.During Mayas tte--ttes, we get a glimpse of her home, but every room in her mountainside hideaway has the same sickly hues of blue and green.What little light makes it through appears weak and suffocated, and though the claustrophobia abates when she walks through the California brambles, even nature isnt immune to the enervating pallor of Ms. Zyzak and Mr. Cotlers compositions.The red-blooded vivacity of Ms. Olins performance, however, pierces through the muck.She chews feeble lines like meat, spitting out the masticated remains.For all of Mayas talk of finding the youthful Actaeon to her Artemis, the only time Ms. Olin appears matched is in her brief scenes with her neighbor, Leonora, played by the equally strong Rosanna Arquette.
New Trailer: ‘Mudbound’ From Dee Rees:::::Photo Netflix has yet to make a major impact on the Oscars (witness Idris Elbas snub for the acclaimed 2015 drama Beasts of No Nation), but that may change with Mudbound, based on the powerful trailer that has just been released.The film has earned raves on the festival circuit and from critics, who are quoted in the teaser.Directed by Dee Rees (Pariah), the sprawling drama follows two families one white and one black in rural Mississippi during World War II and its aftermath.Carey Mulligan, who earned an Oscar nomination for An Education (2009), stars as a farm wife caught between her husband (Jason Clarke) and his younger brother (Garrett Hedlund), a returning veteran.The R&B singer Mary J. Blige, in whats said to be a breakout performance, plays a mother whose son (Jason Mitchell) is also a returning veteran who comes back from Europe only to encounter intransigent racism.Ms. Rees, who along with Virgil Williams adapted Hillary Jordans novel, could become the first African-American woman nominated for best director at the Oscars.(Ava DuVernay was passed over for the 2014 drama Selma.)But Ms. Rees will have to overcome the perception that Mudbound is a made-for-TV movie, since it will be released simultaneously online and in theaters on Nov. 17.
Review: Two Unlikely Roommates Share Heartbreak in ‘Crash Pad’:::::Photo The sin of poor comedic timing is almost an unpardonable one.Kevin Tent, Alexander Paynes longtime editor, has worked on some of that directors funniest movies, including Sideways and the forthcoming Downsizing.Yet Mr. Tents directorial debut, Crash Pad, indicates this artist has more to learn about his new craft.Crash Pad follows a millennial slacker and self-professed romantic, Stensland (Domhnall Gleeson), in the depths of heartbreak after the end of his fling with a married woman, Morgan (Christina Applegate).After binge-watching episodes of Dawsons Creek and trying to blackmail his former flame, Stensland receives an unusual proposal from Morgans husband, Grady (Thomas Haden Church from Sideways).The two men become roommates in a bid to make Morgan jealous while they mend their bruised feelings with women and cheap tequila.The movies premise isnt as bad as the forced, unnatural dialogue.Even the reliable Ms. Applegate and Mr. Church cant salvage the screenwriter Jeremy Catalinos clumsy lines.Morgans faithlessness has emboldened me to take a vacation, Grady declares when moving into Stenslands apartment.Saddled with the wordiest scenes in the movie, Mr. Gleeson comes across like a college freshman fumbling through his first Shakespeare play.Stensland and Gradys romantic plight might have earned more sympathy if their characters werent so insufferable.While Mr. Tents direction is serviceable, its safe.His movie lacks any stylish risks that would make this trios bad romance memorable, leaving Crash Pad to feel like a warm-up act.
Review: ‘Novitiate’ Shares a Young Nun’s Emotional Story:::::Photo What do you seek?What do you desire?a young woman named Cathleen is asked as she prepares to take religious vows.Even though the questions are part of a centuries-old ritual, Novitiate, written and directed by Maggie Betts, takes their content seriously and understands that they are not synonymous.What Sister Cathleen (Margaret Qualley) and her fellow novices aspire to become does not always align with what they want in their hearts.Though they feel themselves called to a life of sacrifice, seclusion and austerity, that vocation often expresses itself with a passion that can be unsettling.It is not just about loving God, but about being in love with him.Eros and Agape, the worldly and spiritual manifestations of love, are not always easily separated.Cathleen Harris arrives at the Sisters of Blessed Rose monastery in 1964, when she is 17.Even though the Vatican II reforms initiated by Pope John XXIII are bringing radical changes to the Roman Catholic Church, they have yet to reach the quiet hillside where the sisters live, almost entirely cut off from the rest of the world.Cathleen, educated in a Catholic girls school in Tennessee, is leaving a family situation sketched in a few baldly over-dramatized scenes.Her tomcatting father (Chris Zylka) comes home drunk and angry and then leaves altogether.Cathleens mother, Nora (Julianne Nicholson), an occasional churchgoer, smokes and swears and sleeps around and is utterly mystified by the intensity of her daughters faith.Photo Novitiate veers between subtlety and its opposite, which is personified mainly by Melissa Leos abbess.An autocrat with a sadistic streak, the reverend mother enforces harsh discipline and seems to enjoy humiliating her young charges.She brooks no dissent and finds herself in conflict both with an independent-minded underling (Dianna Agron) and with the modernizing archbishop (Denis OHare).Another side of the reverend mothers personality an intense religious devotion entwined with a quasi-feminist, anti-authoritarian streak emerges late in the film, but rather than reveal the characters complexity it undermines the storys coherence.The movie is on surer, more interesting ground when it explores Cathleens inner life, her daily routines, and the camaraderie and rivalry that emerge among the novices.Discouraged from forming close friendships that might distract from their primary devotion, the young women, mostly still teenagers, behave in some of the usual ways for girls of their age.They gossip and share confidences and break rules carelessly or brazenly, all the while grappling, as most adolescents do, with deep and murky questions of identity.Video Their reasons for joining the order are as various as their temperaments.One cites Audrey Hepburn in The Nuns Story as a primary inspiration.Novitiate avoids both the laundered piety of that movie and the sensationalism that hovers around the subject of women and religion.At least since the 18th century, the depiction of nuns and convents in literature has often tended toward the Gothic or the pornographic, fed by anticlerical and anti-Catholic ideology as well as by fantasies about female sexuality.There is certainly cruelty in Novitiate, and lust as well.In her desk drawer, the reverend mother keeps a small whip made of knotted rope, called the discipline, that the sisters may borrow to use on themselves.Cathleens spiritual hunger her need to be loved and worthy of love, her longing for comfort as well as sacrifice brings its share of anguish, shame and confusion.Ms. Qualleys performance, and those of some of the supporting cast, notably Morgan Saylor and Rebecca Dayan, convey the difficulties these women face.Ms. Betts refrains from easy, uplifting answers and facile condemnations of organized religion.Aided by Kat Westergaards warm, restrained cinematography, she takes the viewer close to an understanding of Cathleens evolving sense of her relationship with God.
Review: In ‘All I See Is You,’ Sight Is Restored and a Marriage Rocked:::::Photo All I See Is You is halfway through before something resembling a plot kicks in, and even then this limp, shape-shifting psychodrama proves unable to sell it with anything approaching coherence.Yet the director, Marc Forster (who wrote the script with Sean Conway), fashions such a languid, tipsy aesthetic around the seemingly happy marriage of Gina and James (Blake Lively and Jason Clarke) that its easy to keep watching.Legally blind since childhood, Gina rarely leaves their home in Bangkok, relying almost entirely on the attentive James.But when a cornea transplant restores vision to one eye, Gina discovers that her life is not quite as she imagined.Nor is she.New erotic interests surface during a trip to Spain, where the hypersexualized marriage of her sister and brother-in-law nudges the film into seamier territory and prompts a change in Ginas appearance.As James becomes increasingly destabilized by his wifes transformation, the movie seems keen to linger over what can happen to a relationship when a previously dependent partner gains agency.Video Instead, were hastened toward a nonsensical, almost illegible ending that lays waste to all this careful mood-setting.Ms. Lively is well cast, gracefully patrolling the boundary of her limited range, with Mr. Clarke less steady in the more amorphous role of someone who seems a bit off from the outset.And though the milky visual disruptions that signal Ginas initially blurry view of the world are overdone, theres something seductive about her journey that cries out for a filmmaker like Nicolas Roeg.In his hands, the haze of sex and danger that surrounds these two might have been revealed as more than just a tease.
Review: ‘Mully’ Is a Man Dedicated to Saving Kenya’s Orphans:::::Photo Mully isnt much in the way of cinema.But its courageous subject makes this documentarys shortcomings easier to overlook.Charles Mully was born in Kenya and abandoned by his family at 6; he later stole and begged on the streets.Through the generosity of strangers, hard work and some prayer, he not only found a job but became wealthy by running several companies, including a bus service and oil and gas ventures.To the surprise of his wife and eight children, Mr. Mully one day decided to give up business and devote his resources to Nairobis orphans.He turned his residence into a shelter, moving in dozens of homeless Kenyans (while sending some of his own children away to boarding schools).Later he built an orphanage that has housed and fed thousands; a farm there is dedicated to environmentally friendly agriculture.Scott Haze, the director, is eager to inspire.Interviews show Mr. Mully to be resolute, and his family kindhearted.Yet the films tone sometimes turns repetitive.In one short section, a few orphans tell of their lives before meeting Mr. Mully.Their brutal recollections are essential to hear, but Mr. Haze hurriedly retreats from those and other harsh topics.Just as vexing, redundant voice-overs describe what is being shown; while Mr. Mully speaks of events, scripted scenes re-enact them.Mully nods toward its subjects religious faith but refrains from preachiness.Mr. Mullys actions speak for themselves, and his robust personality makes him a pleasure to listen to.If the film doesnt always dig deeply into this mans life, we still see the results of his efforts.Those are enough to admire.
Review: ‘Bill Nye: Science Guy,’ a Portrait of a Fighter for Facts:::::Photo In the film Bill Nye: Science Guy, Mr. Nye, the 1990s childrens-television personality with the signature bow tie, warns of an anti-science movement afoot in this country.And this delightful, revealing documentary, directed by David Alvarado and Jason Sussberg, offers evidence supporting that assessment.Mr. Nye, who left his Emmy-winning series after around 100 episodes, has embraced a new mission: educating an older generation as he champions space exploration and challenges creationists and climate-change deniers.In TV clips, Sarah Palin impugns Mr. Nyes credentials, and an Obama-era Donald J. Trump declares, Our president is worried about global warming what a ridiculous situation.Joe Bastardi, the former chief long-range forecaster at AccuWeather and a frequent Fox News guest, insists that extreme weather is merely meteorological variation, not the result of human-caused global warming.(Mr. Nye is polite but resolute as he argues with Mr. Bastardi during a visit to his home.)As we stand here, the Juno spacecraft just went into orbit around Jupiter, Mr. Nye says.Its an extraordinary accomplishment of engineering and rocket science.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Here is anti-science, he adds, gesturing in the direction of the Kentucky tourist attractions the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter, whose exhibits present such sights as prehistoric humans cohabiting, Flintstone-like, with dinosaurs, and a sauropod (a dinosaur species) dwelling on Noahs ark.Mr. Nye debates the museums chief executive, Ken Ham, on a stage, though his efforts only galvanize Mr. Hams supporters.The documentary also follows Mr. Nyes work as chief executive of the Planetary Society, as he collaborates with the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and spearheads the LightSail project (a small spacecraft powered by photons from the sun), a tribute to Mr. Nyes mentor Carl Sagan.And it accompanies Mr. Nye to Greenland, where he witnesses melting ice caps and ice-core studies revealing climate temperatures of centuries past and our fossil-fuel-poisoned present.
Review: In ‘Félicité,’ a Mother Scrambles to Save Her Son:::::Photo In Flicit, Vro Tshanda Beya Mputu plays the title character, a singer and single mother in Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The movie opens in a lively bar, full of gyrating, intoxicated folk, whom Flicit and the band entertain all night with infectious songs filled with blue notes.(The music is provided by the well-regarded Kasai Allstars.)The next day, shes got troubles with her refrigerator and negotiations with a local handyman.Then, some bad news: Her teenage son has been grievously injured in a motorbike accident.He needs an immediate and immediately paid-for operation.In an ordinary movie this would set off a race-against-the-clock scenario.But Flicit, written and directed by the Franco-Senegalese filmmaker Alain Gomis, is an unconventional treatment of an emergency.At crucial junctures in Flicits desperate scramble to raise funds for her sons medical care, Mr. Gomis, who wrote the screenplay with Olivier Loustau and Delphine Zingg, expands time instead of compressing it.Flicit still has her job to do, after all.This movie aspires to depict real life, not life as cinema is often inclined to idealize it; by the same token, it is hardly a work of naturalism.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Gomiss cinematic style is spectacularly multifaceted.The camerawork and cutting often have the fleetness of a documentary, but theres nothing sloppy about them.(The cinematography is by Cline Bozon, the editing by Fabrice Rouaud and the director.)
Review: ‘The Divine Order’ Recalls the Fight for Women’s Suffrage in Switzerland:::::Photo If its startling that the 19th Amendment, which enshrined womens voting rights across the United States, is less than 100 years old, The Divine Order is set in Switzerland, where the equivalent constitutional amendment establishing the right for women to vote at the federal level didnt pass until 1971.The Divine Order examines that fight for womens suffrage in a microcosm.Directed by Petra Volpe, the film is set in a conservative Swiss town that has gone largely insulated from the spirit of the swinging 60s.(To judge from the films grayish look, the locality has even escaped the decades tie-dyed palette.)The movie centers on Nora (Marie Leuenberger), who, like most of the towns women, has been cowed into keeping her opinions to herself.The more we push, the more the men do what they want, she tells a pamphleteer encouraging approval of the referendum.Noras days consist of caring for her children, indulging her proudly retrograde father-in-law and yearning to take a job that would break the monotony.If Noras name werent enough of a nod to Ibsen, her husband, Hans (Max Simonischek), addresses her as my little bird.But soon Nora is moved to act.Noras rebellious teenage niece (Ella Rumpf) is sent to reform school and then, after she runs away, to prison.Nora reads up on the inequities of Swiss marriage law.A small act of defiance against the towns leading female anti-suffrage finger-wagger (Therese Affolter) wins her an ally in a feisty widow (Sibylle Brunner), and soon an Italian restaurant owner (Marta Zoffoli) joins them.Their growing movement culminates in a strike that brings the town to a halt.Taking a middlebrow, mildly rollicking approach to a serious subject, The Divine Order doesnt exactly break new ground.It goes for easy laughs, like a scene in which the women attend a workshop led by a Swedish guru who teaches them a better appreciation of their anatomy.The composer, Annette Focks, supplies an array of insistent Spielbergian music cues, and the film hinges on a pair of big-speech scenes.Still, The Divine Order effectively illustrates how peer pressure can influence the political process.Collective silence, whether its from women unwilling to publicly press for their rights or men afraid to voice agreement with their wives for fear of looking weak around co-workers, proves more of an obstacle than any opponent.That message gives Ms. Volpes lark a timely edge.
Weinstein Company Will Not Get Planned Cash Infusion:::::On Monday, the New York attorney general opened an inquiry into the studio, examining whether allegations against Mr. Weinstein reflect broad gender discrimination and other civil rights violations.On Tuesday, an aspiring actress, Dominique Huett, sued the Weinstein Company in Los Angeles Superior Court, accusing it of negligence.She became the first woman to take legal action against the studio since The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed decades of sexual harassment and rape allegations against Mr. Weinstein.In her complaint, Ms. Huett said Mr. Weinstein had lured her to a Beverly Hills hotel room in 2010 with a promise to discuss acting roles and instead forced her to engage in sex acts.A spokesman for the Weinstein Company did not respond to requests for comment on the suit on Wednesday.The suit contends that the Weinstein Company had a duty to control Weinstein in his interactions with women during meetings taking place within the course and scope of his employment.A spokeswoman for Mr. Weinstein, who was fired by the studio on Oct. 8, has repeatedly denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Part of Colonys calculus appears to involve the likelihood that other women will sue the studio.More than 50 women have come forward with allegations against Mr. Weinstein.In remarks to Bloomberg Television on Tuesday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where Mr. Barrack was attending a business conference, he said that sorting through which potential liabilities are attributable to the company on an ongoing basis, and which arent, is a Rubiks Cube.Adding to the complexity, no one is interested in salvaging a company which would benefit Harvey, Mr. Barrack said.In other words: Would it be possible to structure a sale so that Mr. Weinstein did not benefit financially?Mr. Weinstein owns roughly 20 percent of the studio.His brother, Bob, owns an identical share.The rest is owned by about 25 investors, who hold portions of varying sizes.Several major entertainment companies have looked at buying pieces of the Weinstein Company and come away with mixed to negative reactions, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.Lionsgate had interest in only one of the studios coming films, Paddington 2, which is set for release in January.But even that family sequel has limited potential; the Weinstein Company mainly holds domestic rights.Endeavor, which owns the William Morris Endeavor talent agency and the IMG sports and fashion business, took a look at the Weinstein Company to see if there was a way to protect clients who have projects in the works there.But it concluded that clients should instead use legal tactics to pry projects loose.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Endeavor-related projects include a film adaptation of the musical In the Heights, created by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Quiara Alegra Hudes; a documentary about President Trump by Michael Moore; and a planned adaptation of The Boys in the Boat, Daniel James Browns book about the American rowing team that won a gold medal at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.Even before the sexual harassment crisis, the Weinsteins boutique studio was struggling.Film releases had become sporadic, and its library of old films had become less valuable because of the collapse of the DVD market and a 2010 deal to sell a substantial portion to prevent bankruptcy.The studio has made inroads in television, selling series to the likes of Amazon and Viacom and lining up potential shows with Showtime and Apple.But Amazon pulled the plug on its deal after the harassment scandal.Apple also walked away.Showtime said it would move forward with its project only if the Weinstein Company dropped out.Viacoms Paramount Network, formerly known as Spike, is moving forward with three series.In terms of existing shows, the Weinstein Companys primary asset is Project Runway, which airs on Lifetime.A scripted series, Scream, will return for a six-episode third season on MTV in the spring.
Review: A ‘Joan Didion’ Portrait, From an Intimate Source:::::Photo Joan Didions meticulously calibrated prose has the effect of placing her at a particular remove from the reader.The persona she creates on the page is always frank but never ingratiating.So its disarming to see a relatively cozy Joan Didion in the documentary Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold, but it should not be surprising.The movie is directed by Griffin Dunne, one of Ms. Didions nephews, who also appears as an onscreen interviewer.The Dunne-Didions are a storied family whose members are, and have been, significant cultural forces.They are also a clan rived by tragedy.Two of Ms. Didions most celebrated recent works concern the deaths of her husband, the writer John Gregory Dunne, and her daughter, Quintana Roo.The exchanges between Mr. Dunne and Ms. Didion are at once fond and candid.When Mr. Dunne suggests that his uncle, Ms. Didions husband, was a protector, Ms. Didion nods animatedly before adding, And a hothead.The relationship between Mr. Dunne and Ms. Didion limits the movie in certain ways, but opens it up in others.Mr. Dunnes longtime family connections and his own prestige as a filmmaker no doubt helped him snag interviews that other documentarians would be hard-pressed to schedule.Ms. Didions friend Calvin Trillin is among the interviewees, and while Id never dare suggest that great writer is not a big get, I was impressed in a different way when Harrison Ford showed up.Advertisement Continue reading the main story While the movie covers the whole of Ms. Didions life (and even the period before it, offering a fun fact that at one point the pioneer Didions traveled with the Donner party), those expecting a thorough examination of Ms. Didions work may be disappointed.Which is not to say that Mr. Dunne, a very canny filmmaker, doesnt accomplish a lot via implication.The movie is subtly bracketed by readings of Ms. Didions appreciation of John Wayne, in an early essay, and her excoriation of Vice President Dick Cheney, in a later one.Unlike a great many more facile thinkers, Ms. Didion clearly does not consider them equivalent figures.But the citation of both works illuminates the changes in Ms. Didions thinking over the years.Her early writing reveals the instincts of a conservative.As she witnessed the tectonic shifts in American life wrought by, among other things, the counterculture, she admittedly lost faith in the social contract, but did not turn left for solutions; rather, she staked a claim as a kind of ideological outsider.(Two words that are never uttered in this movie are feminism and feminist.)Mr. Dunnes movie gets you thinking about all this with extremely well-chosen archival footage and evocative music choices.
Their Love Letter to Aunt Joan (Didion):::::Though fans admire Ms. Didions ability to write coolly about matters of the heart, Mr. Dunne said that he could not separate his emotions from the filmmaking.It was always going to be a love letter, he said.Shes my Aunt Joan.In the new film, Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold, which reaches theaters and Netflix on Oct. 27, Ms. Didions notably distant cool is immediately apparent when she discusses her classic 1967 essay, Slouching Towards Bethlehem, which chronicled the dark side of the hippie movement in San Francisco.While reporting on free love and flower children, Ms. Didion encountered a harrowing scene inside a flophouse, where a 5-year-old girl was tripping on LSD.When Mr. Dunne pressed Ms. Didion to describe this incident for the documentary, she said, Let me tell you, it was gold.Thats the long and the short of it, is you live for moments like that if you are doing a piece.Good or bad.Ms. Didions candid comment, recorded during a long conversation in 2013 that makes up the bulk of the documentary, reflects the levelheaded yet ambitious tone that made Slouching Towards Bethlehem and her first essay collection of the same name a national sensation in 1968.Though she had already published one novel, Run River, in 1963, it was her nonfiction that turned Ms. Didion into a writer-celebrity, a glamorous cultural space she still occupies five decades later.In her long career, Ms. Didion has published more than a dozen books, written or co-written six screenplays, and received the National Book Award and the National Humanities Medal.Still, Mr. Dunne said, she waited a long time to consent to a documentary.She kept saying no, he said.It wasnt until she asked me to film the trailer for her book Blue Nights in 2011 that I started to think about being the one to do it.I saw how much she loved the process.I thought, this is all going so great, why dont I just ask her?To his delight, she said yes.Writing via email, Ms. Didion said: Im still not sure it is the right time.Six years ago, when I said yes, it did not seem possible that the time to actually do it would ever arrive.Im naturally skeptical that these things can work.But here we are.Ms. Dunne said with a laugh, Of course, neither of you knew what you were getting into, and Mr. Dunne agreed.The gravity and the burden of responsibility only kicked in later, he said, after it became clear how much interest there was in a Didion documentary.A crowdfunding campaign for the film reached its goal in one day and news that the project was in the works made international headlines.He realized, I better not screw this up.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Dunne, who has directed five features, including Practical Magic (1998), said that while Ms. Didion is no chatterbox, he felt that there was a cathartic effect to asking her about her past.Ms. Didion agreed, saying by email: I felt at home with Griffin and Annabelle from the beginning.Feeling at home was most important.It was nice at the very least to talk to someone who knew John and Q. I couldnt have described either of them to another interviewer.Photo John and Q were Ms. Didions husband, the writer John Gregory Dunne, who died in 2003 after a sudden heart attack, and her daughter, Quintana Roo Dunne Michael, who passed away as a result of an infection in 2005 at only 39.Mr. Dunne and his cousin have also experienced their share of grief Mr. Dunnes sister, Dominique, was killed in Los Angeles in 1982, and both of his parents, including his father, the longtime Vanity Fair writer Dominick Dunne, are gone.It was torture.Mr. Dunne said of approaching the last quarter of the film, in which he raised the subject of loss with Ms. Didion, who had written two books exploring the tragedies, the best sellers The Year of Magical Thinking (2005) and Blue Nights.I think it was easier for her than it was for me, Mr. Dunne said, adding, For me, the good news was Im related, so I got permission to make this movie.The bad news was I am related, so I know all the people she lost.Quintana is my cousin, John is my uncle, and I have to make her go through it all over again.If I was a more dispassionate, regular documentarian, that would be questions on the clipboard.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Still, Ms. Didion, who saw several cuts of the film along the way, said, I did find it fortifying to know that I was telling these secrets to people who regarded them as such.The feeling was mutual.I was really conscious of how just through attrition, there was just Joan and I in the room, Mr. Dunne said.Its probably one of the reasons she let me make the movie.I know all those people who are not here, I loved all those people, we share that love.Without being too mystical, I was always aware of my parents, and John, and Quintana, in the editing room, he added, his chin shaking, fighting back tears.And I think they would have liked it.
Harvey Weinstein’s Italian Friend Is Now in the Eye of a Media Storm:::::Thats absolutely not true.I completely deny it.Its false, Mr. Lombardo said in another interview in his lawyers office in Rome, a city where he said he had done great work bringing movies and a lot of money to Miramax.He said he was shocked by the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, though he reserved judgment on the validity of the accusations.This is something that nobody knows, except the people in the place where it happened, he said.A man wouldnt tell this story.So how do I know?You see what I mean?I dont think anybody knows except the people in the room.At the height of Mr. Weinsteins power, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, unease about Mr. Lombardos role in the company was so great that Mr. Weinstein attempted to allay concerns, according to Elizabeth Dreyer, a senior executive who was in charge of international acquisitions at the time.But Ms. Dreyer said Mr. Weinsteins denial to his senior international staff at a meeting she attended did not entirely dispel suspicions inside the company.Years earlier, Ms. Dreyer had worked in Miramaxs New York office and was responsible for reserving hotel rooms for the Cannes Film Festival.She recalled requesting a room at the Htel du Cap-Eden-Roc for Mr. Lombardo, and being told that he was barred because the owner said he brings too many girls.That was kind of an ah-ha moment for me, she said, recalling thinking, I get what Fabrizio is about now.I get the relationship.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Lombardo said that neither he nor Mr. Weinstein was ever barred from the hotel.(The hotel manager at the time would not comment.)Mr. Lombardo attributed the criticisms to people within the company who were envious of his relationship with Mr. Weinstein.They have to find a reason for their failure he said, adding that it was not his fault what took place behind closed hotel room doors.You cant hold responsible the person who from the lobby shows the room.But some of the women are eager to take Mr. Weinstein, and his alleged facilitators, to task.One of Mr. Weinsteins accusers, Asia Argento, an Italian actress, received what she considered threatening messages on her telephone from Mr. Lombardo, whom she said she hadnt heard from in years.Im scared to death, Ms. Argento told a reporter by phone the morning after receiving the image on Oct. 3 of an anonymous couple passed out on a bed with the words, Have You Ever Been This Drunk.Why is he sending me this?she said.Mr. Lombardo acknowledged he had sent what he called the funny videos, but argued he sent them to her on two separate days as part of a mass forwarding by mistake.He expressed regret that Ms. Argento felt threatened and he conceded that the timing was terrible.Ms. Argento subsequently went public in The New Yorker with her account of sexual harassment by Mr. Weinstein, and she has since named Mr. Lombardo as the person who brought her to Mr. Weinsteins room in 1997 under the false pretense of attending a party.Another woman, Zo Brock, has accused Mr. Lombardo of accompanying her into Mr. Weinsteins Cannes hotel room in 1998 under the pretense that friends would be joining them to continue a party.Ms. Brock, a former model, said in a phone interview that Mr. Lombardo had excused himself to leave her alone with Mr. Weinstein, who, behind closed doors, stripped naked and chased her around the room.Photo It was a total set up.He knew, Ms. Brock said, referring to Mr. Lombardo.Mr. Lombardo denied both accounts.Mr. Weinsteins spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said Mr. Weinstein denied all the allegations against Mr. Lombardo.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As the executive in charge of Rome and parts of Europe, Mr. Lombardo made contributions that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues for the company, she said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're

in Paris, where he first put his early passion for real estate into practice and entered the orbit of Jean-Luc Brunel, a powerful modeling agent in the 1980s.He was one of the boys hanging around Jean-Luc, said Rene Toft Simonsen, a top model at the time, who considered Mr. Lombardo part of the system of young men who hang around models and connect them with powerful people.Mr. Brunel, who surfaced in news reports several years ago for his connection to Jeffrey Epstein, a Florida billionaire convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, declined to comment.Mr. Lombardo ended up as part of the moveable feast.Former models and Miramax executives recalled him as a handsome wingman of Italian soccer stars like his real-estate business partner Nicola Berti.Mr. Lombardo said he first met Mr. Weinstein and his family in St. Barts.Ms. Hofmeister, speaking for Mr. Weinstein, said the two met during the making of the film Pulp Fiction, when Mr. Lombardo was dating the actress Uma Thurman.Mr. Weinstein and his first wife dined at Mr. Lombardos West Village townhouse, and Mr. Lombardo said Mr. Weinsteins office subsequently called him to help interpret during a meeting with the Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But he said they mostly saw each other in Cannes and St. Barts, where, during a Weinstein family Christmas vacation, the mogul fell deathly ill with septicemia.Mr. Lombardo arranged for a private plane to medevac Mr. Weinstein out and flew with him to New York, where Mr. Weinsteins brother, Bob, waited with an ambulance.If he had waited another day in St. Barts he wouldnt have survived, Mr. Lombardo said.His big break came, he said, when he brought Mr. Tornatores project, Malna, to Mr. Weinstein, who in 1999, despite the objections of some Miramax executives, asked Mr. Lombardo to lead Miramax Italy.Ms. Dreyer, then overseeing Miramaxs Italy operations, said she received a call from her superiors urging her to use Mr. Lombardo in everything she did.I thought this was a way to legitimize his involvement in the company, she said, adding that his responsibilities amounted to setting up meetings and translating.In 2003, Mr. Weinstein served as the best man to Mr. Lombardo when he married Chiara Geronzi, the daughter of Cesare Geronzi, then chairman of the Capitalia bank.But soon after, Miramax closed its Italian branch but the company was upset that Mr. Lombardo kept receiving payments, which he said protective Italian labor laws required.An article in The New York Times in 2004 aired the companys grievance, and Mr. Lombardo felt unfairly maligned and insufficiently defended by Mr. Weinstein.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We had a little falling out, he said.Mr. Lombardo subsequently kept a lower profile, playing golf, raising a family and occasionally showing up for movie premieres with his wife.Several years ago, Mr. Lombardo bumped into Mr. Weinstein on the ski slopes in Gstaad, Switzerland, prompting a reconciliation.Earlier this year, Mr. Lombardo accompanied Mr. Weinstein to a private screening in Rome of the film Perfect Strangers, leading the Weinstein Company to buy the rights.I made it happen, Mr. Lombardo said, adding that instead of a payment, he sought only an executive producer credit to demonstrate to his daughters that their father was once somebody in the film business.The movie tells the tale of old friends who think they know each other, but they dont.This film, Mr. Weinstein told Variety in February, is about what can happen when our addiction to phones and social media reveals our deepest secrets rather than letting people hide behind the public profiles they so skillfully create for themselves.
Review: Love Is Wild, if Not Pretty, in ‘God’s Own Country’:::::Photo Trapped between skies like beaten tin and earth scrubbed raw by wind and rain, the characters in Gods Own Country are well used to harshness.Like Johnny (Josh OConnor), who labors on his struggling family farm in Yorkshire under the critical eyes of his sick father (Ian Hart) and stolid grandmother (Gemma Jones).For relief, he vents his frustrations in binge-drinking and furtive, feral sex with random young men.Video These taciturn encounters, unfolding as unsentimentally as the internal exam he gives a pregnant heifer, suggest someone disgusted by his own sorry self.But this bracing, sometimes brutal movie the feature debut of the writer and director Francis Lee doesnt present Johnnys sexuality as the cause of his self-loathing.Rather, its his imprisonment by a legacy hes not sure he wants that ties his tongue and clots his emotions.Both are about to be loosened.The arrival of Gheorghe (Alec Secareanu), a gentle, darkly handsome Romanian migrant worker, softens Johnnys heart and the movies tone.Their passion isnt pretty, but awkward and pasty and explicit: two frantic strangers grappling in the muck of the moors.Yet Gheorghe is skilled at handling more than newborn lambs; and as the men grow closer, the glowering light grows warmer and the whole picture seems to briefly exhale.Filmed with a naturalism that recalls Andrea Arnolds 2012 dive into Wuthering Heights, Gods Own Country weaves a rough magic from Joshua James Richardss biting cinematography and the storys slow, unsteady arc from bitter to hopeful.Bodily fluids bestial and human stain the screen, punctuating a story thats as much about rediscovering place as finding love.So when Gheorghe looks out at the brooding countryside and murmurs Its beautiful here, we sense that Johnny really doesnt need persuading.
New Trailer: Paul Thomas Anderson’s ‘Phantom Thread’:::::Photo Daniel Day-Lewis has always been unpredictable, and he may have delivered his biggest surprise yet when he announced in June that he would retire from acting after reteaming with his There Will Be Blood director, Paul Thomas Anderson, on one final film, Phantom Thread.The trailer for the movie has just been released, and it looks to be a portrait of an artist as intense and focused as the man who plays him.Mr. Day-Lewis stars as Reynolds Woodcock, a 1950s London couturier who has always been married to his work.Into his life comes Alma (Vicky Krieps), a young woman who becomes his muse and, seemingly, his obsession.Lesley Manville, known for her roles in Mike Leigh films like Mr. Turner and Topsy-Turvy, plays Woodcocks sister.Whatever you do, do it carefully, Alma advises Woodcock in the teasers final line.That sentiment certainly applies to Mr. Day-Lewis, who has thoughtfully chosen parts like the painter with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot and the legendary president in Lincoln.Both those roles won Oscars for the actor, and so did his turn as an avaricious oilman in There Will Be Blood.If Mr. Day-Lewis wins again for Phantom Thread, he will tie Katharine Hepburn as the actor with the most Oscars.The film will be released in theaters on Christmas Day.
New Trailer: Liam Neeson in ‘The Commuter’:::::Photo In 2008, Liam Neeson kicked his career into a higher gear when the surprise-hit action movie Taken scored one of the biggest openings ever for a Super Bowl weekend.So its no wonder his latest thriller, The Commuter (due in January) debuted its new trailer during Foxs N.F.L.coverage on Sunday.The film is the fourth collaboration between Mr. Neeson and the director Jaume Collet-Serra.Their most successful vehicle to date, Non-Stop, took place on board an airplane, and The Commuter shares a similar transportation theme.The star plays an insurance salesman who must determine which of his fellow railroad passengers is in mortal danger or risk the safety of his own loved ones.The plot contains echoes of Strangers on a Train as well as Murder on the Orient Express (director Kenneth Branaghs all-star remake of the Agatha Christie whodunit opens next month).The cast also includes Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, both veterans of the wildly successful horror franchise The Conjuring.Mr. Neeson, 65, was recently quoted as saying he was retiring from action films, then walked back the story.Given his particular set of skills and the commercial failure of his most recent drama, Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House The Commuter might not be his last trip as an action hero.
At BuzzFeed, a Pivot to Movies and Television:::::Mr. Henicks team is also working with Smokehouse Pictures, a production company run by George Clooney and Grant Heslov, to develop a movie based on a BuzzFeed News investigation into assassinations that may be linked to the Kremlin.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Other projects include a series for the NBCUniversal cable network Oxygen that is based on an article about the gruesome death of Jessica Chambers, a teenager who was burned alive in Mississippi, and an adaptation of the online cooking show Mom vs.Chef for USA, another NBC cable network.Mr. Henick grew up in Great Neck, N.Y., and spent his childhood riding forklifts around his fathers floor-covering business at a warehouse in Brooklyns Williamsburg neighborhood that has since been converted into an apartment building.His interest in media and technology began early.When he was 14, he and his best friend created an MP3 website that drew a cease-and-desist letter from the Recording Industry Association of America because it hosted the Titanic soundtrack.Several years later, Mr. Henick and his friend started one of the first ringtone sites in the United States.They bought the domain name NokiaUSA.net in the hope that Nokia customers would stumble on their site.Nokia was not pleased it served the teenagers a cease-and-desist letter in the halls of their high school, after which they changed the companys name to MobileSmarts.The business, Mr. Henick said, made a lot of money, although he wouldnt specify how much.Photo Hes an entrepreneur who knows how to build new things and new companies, Jonah Peretti, the founder and chief executive of BuzzFeed, said in an interview.Im always amazed at the way hes able to switch between these different models in his head and see the same things through a totally different lens.Mr. Henicks experience as a teenage ringtone magnate gave him the idea to go west for college.I was sort of already on that trajectory of wanting to head at least somewhere close to Silicon Valley, to figure out what was going on there, he said.He enrolled at Stanford, where he wrote for the campus humor magazine and played bass in a band called North of Cuba with his Theta Delta Chi fraternity brothers.After graduating with a degree in science, technology and society, he stayed at Stanford another year, earning a masters in digital media studies, which he now calls completely useless.The professor would want to talk to us about LiveJournal and Myspace to a certain extent, and the students in the class would raise their hand and say, Well, what do you think about Facebook?Mr. Henick said.And they didnt even know about it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story From there, Mr. Henick studied producing at the University of Southern Californias film school in Los Angeles.During summer break, he attended a talk at the Skirball Cultural Center by the comedy producer Judd Apatow.Photo I just went up to him and told him as much of my story as I could, Mr. Henick said.We were both from Long Island, both went to U.S.C., and I was looking for a gig.Mr. Apatow brought him on as an intern before hiring him as an assistant, so Mr. Henick spent his second year at U.S.C.balancing classes with reading scripts and checking out sets.After graduation, he worked on movies like Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Step Brothers before going out on his own as a writer, script doctor and start-up consultant.Along the way, he and Ms. Killoch, who met at U.S.C., started a clothing company.They also got married.I clearly get bored very easily, because I do too many things, Mr. Henick said.I was literally sitting in my apartment writing movies, doing all right thats sort of the dream for some people and I was like, What else can I be doing?Before Mr. Henick started at BuzzFeed, he was worried that he might end up restless yet again.But so far, he said, I havent been bored once.Photo When he joined three years ago, Tasty, the sites popular food division, did not exist, and the company had yet to secure funding from NBCUniversal, which has since plowed in $400 million.During Mr. Henicks tenure, many digital media companies that once raked in millions of investment dollars found themselves struggling.A so-called pivot to video a term sometimes used to cover layoffs of text-oriented staff members swept the industry.Increasingly wary of the outsize influence of Facebook and Google and hoping to siphon away some of the billions of advertising dollars still devoted to television new media companies rediscovered old media, setting off a race into TV and film.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Cue Mr. Henick.His mission is to help diversify BuzzFeeds revenue stream: Executives expect that partnerships with production studios may bring in a third of the companys revenue in the coming years.Since it was founded in 2006, BuzzFeed, which is now valued at about $1.7 billion, has anticipated trends in the media business.Its move into the entertainment industry could be viewed as prescient but the company is also said to be pursuing an initial public offering of stock, and associating itself with a glamorous business may have the side benefit of attracting investors and bolstering valuations.I dont think we do anything specifically for that reason, but its always a byproduct, Mr. Henick said.If our business is stronger and its growing exponentially because we keep finding brand-new businesses to get into, its going to allow us to hopefully go public or invest in a lot more stuff elsewhere in the company.During a weekly check-in meeting at the old BuzzFeed lot on Sunset Boulevard, Mr. Henick swiveled around on his desk chair, a hand under his chin.He wore jeans, a light blue button-down and retro Air Jordan sneakers.Staff members talked about projects or possible deals with Netflix, MTV and Facebook.The talk turned to a recent article about the right-wing website Breitbart and one of its former star employees, the rabble-rouser Milo Yiannopoulos.Did anyone see a film opportunity there?Someone suggested the Oscar-winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin.Mr. Henicks eyes sparkled.I would retire out on top, he said, if we could get Sorkin to write it.
‘Tyler Perry’s Boo 2’ Is No. 1 Amid a Plethora of Duds:::::Photo LOS ANGELES A sassy church lady, a group of elite firefighters, an alcoholic detective, some do-gooder Texans and a renegade scientific genius walked into multiplexes on Friday.Only one grabbed the attention of ticket buyers.Tyler Perrys Boo 2!A Madea Halloween, with Mr. Perry reprising his gun-toting, moralizing granny, took in about $21.7 million at North American theaters over the weekend.That total gave Mr. Perry his sixth No.1 opening, bolstering his status as one of the most reliable crowd pullers in moviedom.Even so, initial ticket sales for Boo 2 (Lionsgate) fell 24 percent behind those for Boo!A Madea Halloween last year.Boo 2 cost roughly $24 million to make.Ticket sales were terrible for the other newcomers Geostorm, Only the Brave, The Snowman and Same Kind of Different as Me adding to worries that moviegoing is falling out of fashion, as Americans curl up at home with their Netflix accounts.On the other hand, all of those films but one, Only the Brave, a dramatization of a wildfire that killed 19 responders, received abysmal reviews.Geostorm (Warner Bros.) was second for the weekend, taking in an estimated $13.3 million, a failing total for a film that cost roughly $130 million to make, not including tens of millions of dollars in marketing costs, and was released in 3,246 theaters.Geostorm, starring Gerard Butler as a scientist racing to save the planet from environmental destruction, likely suffered from a sense of been-there, done-that, coming across as another The Day After Tomorrow.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Geostorm was cofinanced by Skydance Media, a company founded by the Oracle heir David Ellison.Next among the newcomers was Only the Brave, which collected about $6 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data.Black Label Media, a company co-founded by the FedEx heiress Molly Smith, spent about $38 million to make this firefighter drama, which was distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment.(It has been a bad month for the FedEx family at the movies: Alcon, backed by Ms. Smiths father, Fred Smith, had a major box office misfire with Blade Runner 2049.)Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Sony noted that Only the Brave received an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls.We expect great word of mouth among our core audience, the studio said in a statement on Sunday.Receiving a D grade from CinemaScore was The Snowman (Universal Pictures), which bombed with $3.4 million in ticket sales.The Snowman, which cost $35 million to make, stars Michael Fassbender as a troubled detective in pursuit of a wintry serial killer.Universal said The Snowman has taken in an additional $19.2 million overseas.
Review: ‘M. Butterfly’ Returns to Broadway on Heavier Wings:::::Still reading?O.K.In M. Butterfly, our not-so-bright Gallimard a French embassy official stationed in Beijing in the 1960s falls head over heels for Song, who he thinks is a woman but is really a fetching young dude in Suzie Wong drag.That Gallimard (and his real-life prototype, Bernard Boursicot, whose case became an international scandal in the mid-1980s) failed to register the imposture has been the subject of much bewildered speculation and many jokes.(Check out the priceless Forbidden Broadway parody of the show.)Photo In the latest incarnation of the tale, Song is not merely a man pretending to be a woman.Hes a man pretending to be a woman pretending to be man who is pretending to be a woman.Got that?Never mind.Well get back to it later.This extra turn of the screw of pretense is also directly from the case history of Monsieur Boursicot (the subject of a fascinating book by The New York Times columnist Joyce Wadler).But for audiences who must digest an already complex story (did I mention that Song is a spy for the Chinese government?)within less than three hours of stage time, its a lot to assimilate.There is another, even more distracting problem.Once weve seen Mr. Ha who has a distinctly masculine cast of a jaw in boys clothes early on (thats when he says hes a man who works in drag as an actor in a Beijing opera house), its impossible to unsee him as that boy.Which makes Gallimard, our deluded protagonist, appear even more mentally challenged than usual.You could argue that such obtuseness is appropriate for a play that considers the blindness not only of love, but also of cultural and sexual imperialism.Yes, Gallimard, who has never had much luck with women before, is responding to the novelty of a beautiful actress improbably finding him attractive.But more important to the plays intriguing and ever timely central thesis is the fact that Song is Asian, perceived as a fragile lotus blossom waiting to be plucked by virile white hands, like the doomed heroine of Puccinis Madama Butterfly, Gallimards favorite opera.Such, it seems, is the Wests vision of the East.Mr. Hwang more than implicitly compares Gallimards dim vision regarding his love object to the unrealistic beliefs that Western countries hold about the East.That includes the presumption that Vietnam would fall in a swoon before the manly forces of the United States.Song, whose mission as a spy is to elicit information from Gallimard about Frances involvement in Vietnam, speaks scornfully of a Western self-image involving big guns, big industry, big well, you know your own fantasies.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But for M. Butterfly to have emotional impact, it must make its audiences uneasily complicit in that fantasy.In this version, you always maintain the distance sometimes amused, sometimes appalled thats generated by your awareness of theatrical machinery churning away.Photo Dont blame Mr. Owen, who works skillfully and, well, manfully at becoming a wimp in a part memorably originated by John Lithgow (and played by Jeremy Irons in the 1993 film).Though he has established himself on screen as a thinking persons hunk (Children of Men, The Knick), Mr. Owen is surprisingly convincing here as someone who could never get a date in high school.The shows broken master of ceremonies, whom we meet in a French prison cell many years after the events recounted here, Gallimard does his best to frame the story of his relationship with Song as a love story worthy of tragic opera.As Mr. Owens Gallimard struggles to make facts succumb to romantic fiction, his discomfort in his own skin glistens like flop sweat.If only this production trusted more in its reliably unreliable narrator, and let us see a bit more through his bedazzled eyes.Instead, the show has a grinding Brechtian self-consciousness throughout, which calls harsh attention to its less than subtle ironies.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Has arch Song seems to be all too demonstratively in on the cosmic joke being played on poor old Gallimard.Building up the role of Songs shrill Communist party liaison (Celeste Den) was a mistake.Though Enid Graham is fine in the thankless part of Gallimards wife, the character of his macho best friend (Murray Bartlett) remains an annoying device.Most disappointing for Ms. Taymors fans is the productions lack of the ravishing visuals she brought to The Lion King and her more recent A Midsummer Nights Dream.The tall, painted Chinese screens that frame each scene are alarmingly clunky and unsteady.(Paul Steinberg did the sets.)The two centerpiece dance sequences, choreographed by Ma Cong, feel scrappy, like numbers from a pared-down touring production of Miss Saigon.And Elliot Goldenthals original music and soundscapes are usually more intrusive than evocative.Such clumsiness sadly undermines a play that remains urgently relevant.Anyone doubting that Gallimards pipe dream of masculinity is still with us need only consult recent reports of the behavior of Hollywood moguls and American presidents or daily accounts of the United States military in quagmires on foreign soil.But even if the romance at the heart of M. Butterfly is toxic, we still need to be swept up by the tide of this crazy infatuation.In this incarnation, were not being seduced, but preached at.And Gallimards grand self-sacrifice seems more pathetic and unnecessary than it ever did before.
A New London Theater Aims to Stage a Revolution:::::Part of a glossy new development, the theater looks on to two of the citys most recognizable landmarks: Tower Bridge and the Tower of London.Photo Its two miles to the east of Londons Theaterland but it is a world away from the cramped facilities of the West Ends Victorian venues, with their restrictive proscenium arch layouts.The Bridges auditorium is fully flexible.The stage for Young Marx extends into the audience; the audience sits on three sides, with seats raked over four tiers.Yet the space feels remarkably intimate, and even the cheap seats costing under $20 have decent sightlines.Critics, lukewarm about the play but effusive about the venue, have been quick to point out the irony of opening Londons first wholly new, large-scale commercial theater in 80 years with a play about an critic of capitalism.Yet the theater is attempting to, well, bridge the usual approaches of the commercial and subsidized sectors in the UK.For starters, its largely dedicated to new writing a notoriously tricky sell at the box office.Few untested plays open in the West End.New writing can also suffer from a reputation for dry worthiness, a notion Mr. Hytner aims to dispel.New writing doesnt have to be a ghettoized, virtuous thing, he said.These are new shows that aim to communicate widely.And if were ever going to find a Curious Incident or The History Boys, theyre going to be new things.Mr. Hytner also insisted that there is a big audience out there.They flock to the shows they want to see, he said.A lot of them musicals, quite a lot of them not.Indeed, a raft of plays have transferred from subsidized theaters to the West End in recent years including new writing from venues such as the Almeida (Ink; King Charles III) and the Royal Court (The Ferryman; Hangmen) as well as the National.Advertisement Continue reading the main story New writing is always risky, but the work has been so good, audiences are more receptive now, said Nica Burns, a West End producer who credits the increasing collaboration between subsidized and commercial theaters.This is why we have such a healthy theater, with so many plays in the West End compared to Broadway.Photo The Bridges investors seem convinced that if an appetite for bold new plays has been nourished by thriving government-funded theaters and a culture of transfers, they can be originated in a commercial venue in the first place.The 12 million, or about $16 million, construction costs were raised upfront from venture capitalists.But the model is based on the two Nicks experience running a building, and theyre deliberately swerving away from the more usual path of renting a theater.A West End producer puts up all the money, takes all the risk, and because there are so many fighting for relatively few theaters, they have to take the terms youd expect, Mr. Hytner said.He added that they dont get the revenue from the bars, the programs, the ice creams.I know from the National that the profit margin on ice-cream is something you want to keep!Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Owning the Bridge means Mr. Hytner and Mr. Starr have the opportunity to rake those retail profits in.But crucially, it also means theyll avoid the particular pressure of budgeting on a show-by-show basis.We dont have to show a return on every single play, Mr. Hytner said.Its a cash-flow business.That graph can go up and down quite considerably, but if we play at over 75 percent were doing brilliantly.Thats not even really a target because if, say, Julius Caesar plays to 95 percent it doesnt really matter what the plays either side of it do.Such long-view financial flexibility will allow Mr. Hytner and Mr. Starr to program the work they like: theater which is ambitious, as Mr. Hytner defines it.And theres surely another lesson from the subsidized sector: To be ambitious, you have to be able to afford to fail sometimes.Mr. Hytner is evidently relieved to have shrugged off the burden of overseeing a national institution, however.Everybody knows what a National Theater should be, what the repertoire should be, he said.The fact is that everyone, of course, knows differently.Now, he is free to do as he pleases just so long as what pleases him pleases the audience.

Murray Abraham, Rileigh McDonald and Michael Rabe, the playwrights son.A former talk-show host and self-proclaimed theater fanatic, Ms. ODonnell played Golde in Fiddler on the Roof on Broadway in 2005, and had parts in the musicals Seussical and Grease, but this will be her first steady role in an Off Broadway production.(She was part of the rotating cast in Love, Loss and What I Wore.)Good for Otto tells the story of the doctors, patients, and families connected by a rural Connecticut mental health clinic.Ms. ODonnell is slated to play Nora, the foster mother of a daughter, Frannie, who suffers from serious depression.The productions director, Scott Elliott, explained in an interview that the casting of Ms. ODonnell was a result of their friendship and mutual desire to work together.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Ive asked her to do some readings over the years, he said.I just think shes an amazing actress.When I read this play, which really speaks to the human condition, I thought this was a role shed really relate to because shes a thoughtful and compassionate person.I didnt think shed do it, he added, but I sent it to her and in less than 24 hours she responded and said she would.The play premiered in 2015 at Chicagos Gift Theater.In a New York Times review, Charles Isherwood wrote: Mr. Rabe digs into his subject with a depth that almost feels bottomless.The New York production will begin previews Feb. 20 for a March 8 opening at the Pershing Square Signature Center.
The Rockettes Own Christmas. But Spring Is a Tough Nut to Crack.:::::Devising a new annual entertainment tradition in an era when people have so many options, however, has bedeviled producers across fields like theater, circus, art, and concert festivals.The Christmas Spectacular is spectacularly successful, but a strong part of its pull is nostalgia and tradition, said Drew Hodges, the founder of SpotCo Advertising who worked on Rockettes projects in the past, and is now an independent consultant for producers of live entertainment.Its difficult to build a new tradition it takes years and even harder to create a family-friendly entertainment that fills 6,000 seats a night, referring to the seating capacity at Radio City Music Hall.Time would seem to have run out for this coming spring.None of the behind-the-scenes work needed to mount a major new production is taking place, and this month the Tony Awards said it would return to Radio City on June 10, all but precluding a late-spring show as well.Rhonda Malkin, a dance coach who has trained dozens of Rockettes, noted that the company has tried and failed to create various shows for the group over the last 15 years.She admired the most recent iteration of the late-spring show, overseen by the choreographer Mia Michaels, and said that Rockettes were excited to perform it again.Photo Radio City tends to build a big show and then at the last minute either do away with it or change it or not put it up, Ms. Malkin said.For years now, Madison Square Garden Company has faltered in its artistic choices for a new Rockettes franchise a creative development process that started becoming bumpy in 2014 because of Mr. Weinstein, the film mogul who was fired as co-chairman of the Weinstein Company this month amid allegations of sexual harassment and assault.That year, Mr. Weinstein played a key role in the decision to scrap a multimillion-dollar new springtime Rockettes show, Heart and Lights.He did not have an official role on the production, but attended a run-through with his friend Mr. Dolan, and was among those voicing doubts about the shows book and songs.The show was canceled, and its creative team was soon gone, including Linda Haberman, the respected artistic director of the Rockettes since 2006.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The following year Mr. Weinstein was brought onboard to overhaul the show and serve as its producer.He remade it and brought on a raft of stars, but it was not a success: Reviewing it in The New York Times, Charles Isherwood praised the Rockettes but little else, describing the show as a numbingly overblown 90-minute infomercial.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Another shake-up was ordered for 2016.Mr. Weinstein was no longer its producer, Ms. Michaels became its new director and choreographer, and the playwright Douglas Carter Beane wrote a new script.But that version was not a success either.A Madison Square Garden Company earnings report issued for the fourth quarter of 2016 said that it took in less revenue due to fewer scheduled performances, a result of a shift in the timing of the productions run from the spring to the summer, and, to a lesser extent, lower per-show revenue.Last winter there were indications that another overhaul was in the works.After a number of Rockettes expressed concerns about performing at the inauguration of President Trump, Marie Claire magazine published leaked remarks that Mr. Dolan made to a group of the dancers.I dont believe its going to hurt the brand, the magazine quoted him as saying.And nobody is more concerned about that than the guy sitting in this chair.Im about to spend $50 million remounting this summer show.Im going to spend a similar amount remounting next years Christmas show.I gotta sell tickets.But in February the Madison Square Garden Company announced that it would not be going forward with its 2017 show by Ms. Michaels after all.It said it would take a one-year hiatus, adding that we remain committed to the production and look forward to the shows return in 2018.Several Rockettes had been eager to return to Ms. Michaelss show, according to Ms. Malkin.The show was expected to include a mix of precision dancing and other choreography that was different from the Christmastime production.As a former Rockette and dancer, I thought it was refreshing to see the Rockettes do a different style and do it so incredibly well with the precision aspect in tact, Ms. Malkin said.But in terms of where the audience as a whole is coming from, I guess they were expecting more of what they see for Christmas.
Review: Throwback ‘Portuguese Kid’ Will Do Anything for a Laugh:::::Or when Barrys young wife, Patty (Aimee Carrero), asks Atalantas boy toy, Freddie (Pico Alexander), how he could pick up a widow at her husbands funeral, he doltishly justifies himself: She came solo!Advertisement Continue reading the main story I believe Ive now provided enough bone fragments so you can confidently reconstruct the rest of the dinosaur.To spare you the effort, heres a prcis.The weathered 50-somethings Atalanta and Barry, who grew up together in Providence, are mismatched with the shallow 20-somethings Freddie and Patty, who once had a disastrous affair.As hot-blooded Mediterranean stereotypes (though Patty is Puerto Rican) they cannot help but bay at the moon, write terrible poetry and shout the wrong names during sex.The plays burden, like that of any number of romantic roundelays, is to get these wounded lovebirds repaired and re-paired before anyone is killed.Not that the knives and fists brandished onstage ever get close to doing real damage.The play is too superficial for that.Rather, the deadliest (and funniest) weapon wielded in The Portuguese Kid is the ferocious stink-eye of Mary Testa as Fausta, the dragon mother to end all dragon mothers.(Her last name, alas, is Dragonetti.)I pray to God I never have to violate these eyes with the sight of you again, she snarls at Atalanta when the widow shows up at Barrys office for help resolving a tax problem.Did I mention theres a plot?Well there is, sort of, involving Atalantas various dead husbands and a real estate deal, but it doesnt make sense.Mr. Shanley is more interested in the sound of conflict and reconciliation than in the actual details.He thus spends the first two scenes of The Portuguese Kid burying images the way a squirrel buries nuts, and the last two scenes trying to dig them back up.The result may sound like a play and look like a play but it isnt a play its just a collection of nuts.Photo Perhaps it would have been more convincing if Mr. Shanley hadnt hired himself to direct.A strong countervailing force might have encouraged him to look beyond the sitcom laugh track and might have informed him that his spice rack of gender and ethnic stereotypes (women are paradoxes; Puerto Ricans are firecrackers) has gone stale.The designers, all tops in their fields in other productions, might have found a less garish palette, too; The Portuguese Kid looks like a picture book designed for children with cataracts.Certainly a better director would have done more than let the play coast on the sorely tried inventiveness of its stars.Ms. Scott is incapable of being uninteresting, even when furiously working to forge a character out of punch lines.And Mr. Alexander mines a surprising amount of truthfulness, if not from his role as written then from himself.Despite their ingenuity, the 100-minute play moves like a kicked horse: fast but grudging.This is all a shame, if not a surprise.Mr. Shanley, who has proved himself capable of great dramatic discipline in works like the Pulitzer Prize-winner Doubt (2004), has of late been exploring his shaggier side.At least in Outside Mullingar (2014) and the autobiographical Prodigal Son (2016) it was still possible to feel that he was making deliberate choices to play with genre.There was something to take away if you were willing to suspend disbelief and work at it.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But in The Portuguese Kid, I fear he is no longer writing; hes scrapbooking.Heres the page about Atalanta, the huntress of Greek mythology who killed any suitor who could not defeat her in a race.Heres the page about Smiles of a Summer Night and A Little Night Music, with which the play shares a basic structure (and nothing else).And here, heavily underlined, is the page about Neil Simon a playwright with whom you might once have thought Mr. Shanley had little in common.These pages dont go together, any more than the plays lovers do in their initial configuration.But instead of taking delight at the comedy of their eventual sorting out, I spent most of the play taking cover, so relentless and assaultive were the jokes.To be fair, many in the audience last weekend appeared to be having a rollicking good time.But though I laughed when poked to do so, or when Ms. Scott hurled off a terrific line reading, it was not the laughter of pleasure or recognition.It was the kind sitcom characters sometimes cough up at a mortifying wedding or funeral.
Review: The Horror Show of Rehab in ‘People, Places & Things’:::::This is all very effective, which is saying a lot.The nostrums of 12-step recovery, even with Emma resisting them bitterly, are not inherently dramatic.Montages of Im an addict sharing sessions, peppered with role play and tearful confession by a strong ensemble of actors, are nothing we havent seen before.Photo Still, the staging gives the illusion that something dynamic and new is happening.In an odd way, Mr. Herrins hilarious work on the recent production of Noises Off at the Roundabout Theater was excellent preparation.People, Places & Things is a kind of inverted farce, with all the doors slamming in the other direction.But I kept waiting for something bigger than fine stagecraft and even Ms. Goughs extreme, ingenious performance to kick in.In his touching play Every Brilliant Thing and in the brutal adaptation of George Orwells 1984 he wrote with Robert Icke, Mr. Macmillan demonstrated an eagerness to keep the audience engaged in static stories at all costs, and to send it off with a big finish.These are usually admirable instincts, and they do, for the most part, keep us from wandering as Emma goes through her recovery laps.Even during the plays longueurs it feels a bit padded to achieve its length you sense that larger questions are being assembled to deliver a gut-punch reversal at the end.When it comes, you must re-evaluate what you thought you knew.But Ben Brantley was right to ask, in his New York Times review of the plays 2015 premiere at Londons National Theater, whether that effect is enough to make theatergoers feel that their own long, often tedious path to enlightenment has been worth it.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.His answer was no.Mine is yes, but.However valuable and accurate People, Places & Things is as a portrait of the addicts nightmare, in and out of rehab, the play really wants to weigh in on a more fundamental issue about addiction and responsibility.And on this note it seems to waffle as much as I do in responding to it.Perhaps this is the result of a contradiction built into recovery itself, at least as structured along the 12-step model: We play a large part in our own addictions yet we are powerless over them.Mr. Macmillan develops the argument between these two ideas in a series of confrontations with three women: the recovery centers doctor; its therapist; and, eventually, Emmas mother.(It is thematically useful that all are played by Barbara Marten, who is brisk as the doctor, warm as the therapist and jaw dropping as the mother.)The first two women, as advocates for a process that is fundamentally structured around acceptance of a higher power, locate the source of addiction in a breach of humility: Addiction, the doctor suggests, is caused by trauma we flatter ourselves to think we can ignore or control.Emma furiously rejects this interpretation, in ways that many an atheist and Foucaultian will recognize.If its vital to my recovery that I come to believe in a power greater than me, Emma fulminates, then we might all just be wasting our time.It is, she points out, the 21st century.And though the doctor explains that her clinic employs a religiously neutral modification of the 12-step template one in which addicts express powerlessness over the three nouns that make up the plays title she nevertheless (Emma notices witheringly) wears a crucifix.Further, the play is all too successful in replicating the sententiousness and sanctimony of recovery jargon, at least as overheard by an outsider.So which is it?Is recovery (as Emma first sees it) a cult of ego deflation or (as she later sees it) a spiritual and medical response to trauma?It may be reasonable to suggest that, as she recovers, her position gradually changes, her punctured actorly narcissism fizzling with a long hiss.She leaves rehab a convert to its philosophy of personal responsibility.But then, as the play closes I wont spoil how we are given devastating evidence that Emmas addiction is not her fault at all, but rather the mark of the worlds cruelty to sensitive souls.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Are we not then all addicts?Or is the play simply addicted to its own effects?If I was troubled by Mr. Macmillans philosophical opportunism the story sometimes works like a toggle switch, flipped this way and that to maintain suspense perhaps its because I am leery of a mechanistic approach to issue drama.And to recovery.Yet it is not the playwrights job to provide answers to such questions.It is enough that he leaves you scraping the insides of your soul, looking for your own.
Putting Detroit’s Finest in Detroit Public Theater:::::But it is only in the last year that her works have made their way to the city that inspired them.With help from the Detroit Historical Society and the Knight Foundation, the theaters roving production of Detroit 67 has traveled to museums, high schools and community centers in the metropolitan region.Photo Detroit 67 is one of three plays inspired by the city; Paradise Blue, the second, about an arts-rich African-American neighborhood demolished at midcentury for freeway construction, will be produced at the Signature Theater Company in Manhattan in the spring.Skeleton Crew, the final work in the trilogy, centers on the closing of an automobile plant and its impact on four workers during the 2008 recession.It runs through Oct. 29 at the Detroit Public Theaters 150-seat space inside the Max M. and Marjorie S. Fisher Music Center; the Detroit Free Press described it as maybe the best play youll see this year.The theater was founded in 2015 by Courtney Burkett, a native of the city who had worked in theater here and in New York; Sarah Clare Corporandy, who also serves as managing director at Chautauqua Theater Company in upstate New York, but returned here for this challenge; and Sarah Winkler, a native New Yorker with more than two decades as an actress and producer Off Broadway, who moved here when her husband took a job in Michigan.All three share the title producing artistic director.We felt like there was not an anchor for theater serving the city, Ms. Burkett explained, noting the presence of major cultural institutions like the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and Detroit Institute of Arts.A theater like this could not have existed 10 years ago, she added.Now that the citys stabilizing and even thriving in so many ways, our artists are also thriving and getting the attention they always deserved.Among the challenges is ensuring that, as white women, they remain connected to a city that is more than 80 percent black.(Matrix Theater Company and the African-American focused Plowshares Theater Company both have long histories here.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story In an email, Ms. Corporandy said: Producing theater in a city that is predominantly African-American means we need to make sure that our stories speak to everyone, to the public we want to serve.Photo We are also very aware of the privilege we come to the table with, she added, and we want to be sure that we are leveraging that privilege to give back to this city that we all love, not take from it.The Detroit Public Theater annual budget is a relatively modest $1 million; its costs include renting space inside the symphonys hall.The leaders hope to raise enough money to have a permanent home eventually; in the meantime, they believe that showing work like Ms. Morisseaus is vital to the theaters becoming better known to Detroiters, suburbanites, and visitors intrigued by the citys much-touted comeback.This playwright was a natural choice for the inaugural 2015-16 season, according to Ms. Burkett.(It presented Detroit 67 in a coproduction with Baltimore Center Stage.)And the leaders intend to bring other Michigan artists into the fold, including the playwright Noah Haidle, whose Birthday Candles will have its world premiere as the final show this season.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Debbie Erb, the chairwoman of the theaters board, said leaders want to keep the shows really accessible.Ticket prices top out at $45, with group and student discounts and pay as you go options during previews.Another goal is to keep actors who are from the Detroit area in Detroit, Ms. Erb said.Because why should they have to go to Chicago or New York to earn a decent living?Ms. Morisseau admits that until recently she was better known outside her hometown than inside.Even starting from Detroit, she said, local theaters didnt know who I was until really, really huge things happened for me.Clearly that is changing.Ella Joyce, a Detroit native now living in Los Angeles, plays Faye, the lead character in Skeleton Crew.She was excited to return for the role.I dont think Dominique is just Detroits greatest playwright, she said on opening night.I think she is one of Americas greatest playwrights.Photo Ms. Joyce said friends from grade school turned up at performances of the play and came up to speak with her afterward, even bringing childhood photos to remind her who they were.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Writing about the people of Detroit, particularly African-Americans, is crucial to Ms. Morisseaus work.And while she now lives in Los Angeles, serving on the writing staff of Showtimes Shameless, she believes her work brings Detroiters alive, especially when it is performed by local actors.Something kind of magic and organic comes out of the mouth of a native Detroiter when theyre saying my words, she said.Its like we speak the same language.Earlier this month Ms. Morisseau came to see Skeleton Crew with her husband and an entourage of dozens, including her mother, who still lives in Detroit.When you are sitting around with half your family that inspired your work, its profound and exciting, but it is also overwhelming because these are the people that know it best and that live it, she said.Its for this reason that Ms. Morisseau is not only glad to see her work produced inside the theater, but brought to the public as well.Asking communities from all over to not just go to midtown or downtown Detroit to see shows, but come out to the neighborhood where what happened in these neighborhoods happened to someone you know, she said.That to me has power, in the best way, to affirm, to vindicate, to humanize and to heal.
Review: All Life’s a Swirling Proscenium in ‘The Red Shoes’:::::Smooth flow and swirling action are also the strengths of Mr. Bournes choreography and direction.This production moves.But besides the set, its chief cleverness lies in its choice of music, a collage clipped from various film scores by Bernard Herrmann.Its the sound of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Alfred Hitchcock, of high anxiety and romantic melodrama, with string sections desperately scaling musical cliffs and orchestral waves crashing.Photo The deftness with which Mr. Bourne (aided by the arranger Terry Davies) makes Herrmanns musical moods and cues serve his story gives sustained delight.The shoe keeps fitting.The productions achievements, though, are tangled up with its flaws.Crucial plot points can get lost in the bustle and detail.And Mr. Bournes push for efficiency making a dance number work both as period flavor and plot advancement, quickly slipping in a dramatic turning point in the middle of something else can shortchange or skirt character motivation and decision making.Mr. Bourne is a master of surface style, and the abundance and variety of pastiche dance from the stiff, hoppy ridiculousness of aristocrats to awful music hall numbers to an ample survey of between-the-wars ballet is another pleasure, especially for connoisseurs.Yet all this affectionate parody leaves him without much of a straight mode.The anguished danced monologues share the atmosphere of parody.Photo Meanwhile, the story has been streamlined and simplified, transformed into a standard love triangle.The tension in the film between Lermontovs personal involvement and his principled objection to a ballerinas marrying is absent.So is his religious devotion to ballet.Admittedly, these are difficult layers to convey without dialogue, but when Mr. Bourne has Lermontov moon over a statue of a shoe, the spiritual pursuit of beauty has been reduced to a foot fetish.The shows conception of Lermontov is characteristic of its swerving from the challenge of the films indelible performances.Anton Walbrooks flamboyant portrayal of the impresario is, along with the saturated colors, the movies greatest glory.Sam Archer, who plays Lermontov in every New York performance of Mr. Bournes show, is dashing but subdued, buttoned-up British instead of larger-than-life Russian.Despite Mr. Bournes tidying, he doesnt take the opportunity to flesh out the love story between Vicky and Julian.As in the movie, it basically comes out of nowhere, though the thinness is more of a problem without a complicated Lermontov.Mr. Gomes, imparting Julian with his usual warmth and charisma, helped, but couldnt redeem the roles histrionic conducting.Ms. Mearns, out of her usual element, fit in fine, her sense of drama proving equal to the roles acting demands, her performance only a tiny bit rougher than that of the first-cast Vicky, Ashley Shaw.(Ms. Mearns and Mr. Gomes, by the way, make an excellent couple: Company directors and casting agents take note.)Where Mr. Bournes show most successfully breaks free of the original is in the Red Shoes ballet, the allegorical work that Lermontov and Julian make for Vicky.In a reverse homage to the movies surreal colors, Mr. Brotherston sticks to black and white and gray, and Mr. Bournes choreography finds its own stylized nightmare.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As for the rest, it can feel as conflicted as Vicky, not sure what movie it wants to be.Mr. Brotherstons rotating set adroitly mixes up performance and rehearsal, art and life.When it stops spinning, it leaves you impressed and a little dizzy and not very moved.

Stratford Festival in Ontario Gets Record Donation:::::Photo The Stratford Festival in Ontario, Canada, announced Wednesday that it has received its largest single donation, a pledge of 10 million Canadian dollars, or about $7.8 million, from its board chairman, Dan Bernstein, and his wife, Claire Foerster.The donation is intended to help pay for a new theater space to replace the 46-year-old Tom Patterson Theater Center.Dan and Claires remarkable gift is an incredible endorsement of the vision we have for the future of the Stratford Festival, said the festivals artistic director, Antoni Cimolino.Photo Mr. Bernstein and Ms. Foerster are residents of Connecticut, where Mr. Bernstein is senior strategist and director of Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund.The Stratford Festival the largest nonprofit classical repertory theater in North America is an annual theater festival running from April to October and primarily dedicated to the work of William Shakespeare.In 2016 it attracted over 500,000 visitors.In addition to the pledge by Mr. Bernstein and Ms. Foerster, the government of Ontario has promised 20 million Canadian dollars for the project.The Canadian federal government is reviewing a request from the festival for a similar amount.The plans for the new theater, unveiled in August with a design by the Canadian architect Siamak Hariri, await approval from the city of Stratford; a City Council vote is expected by the end of November.The festival estimates that the new theater will cost 60 million Canadian dollars, and a fund-raising campaign to meet that total and establish a fund for future operating costs is set to begin if the plans are approved.
How Broadway Became Broadway:::::Photo Q.When did Broadway become shorthand for professional theater?A.Although Dutch settlers originally came up with the name for what would become a famous thoroughfare, the term, as it relates to theater, appears to have originated in the late 1860s, when productions like The Black Crook, a popular show that some consider the first modern musical, went on tour.After the Civil War, the phrase direct from Broadway emerged in advertising when shows traveled to other cities, said Jennifer Ashley Tepper, a theater historian and producer.Everyone knew Broadway was where the best theaters were.Such tours were suddenly possible because of significant expansion and improvements to the nations railroad network, made for military purposes during the Civil War.Before then, the touring production was rare.You would have a Broadway cast do a show in New York, and that would be it, said John Kenrick, a theater writer and historian who manages the website Musicals101.com.You couldnt bring the sets, the costumes, everything that made the show what it was, until the railroad system was developed.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Professional theater in New York dates back to at least 1732.The few theaters that opened before the Revolutionary War were small, holding at most a few hundred people.
Ex-Theater Agent Sentenced to Six Months for Fake Play:::::Photo A former theater agent has been sentenced to six months in jail after admitting that he bilked investors of hundreds of thousands of dollars to back a nonexistent Broadway play.Roland Scahill, 42, confessed to a scheme that took place between October 2014 and August 2015, in which Mr. Scahill told associates that he had secured the rights to the life story of Kathleen Battle, the opera singer, and was going to produce a one-woman play called The Kathleen Battle Project with Lupita Nyongo as its star.Ms. Nyongo had no knowledge of this, nor did the Shubert Organization, which Mr. Scahill said was offering up the Booth Theater to house the show.Mr. Scahill also said he had told investors that he had struck a deal with Netflix to stream a performance of the show.In total, Mr. Scahill confessed to defrauding 10 investors of $205,000, according to court papers.In the plea agreement, Mr. Scahill said, I never purchased life rights from Kathleen Battle, I never contracted with Lupita Nyongo to star, I never procured the Booth Theater as a venue for the show, and I never had a contract with Netflix.As part of the deal, Mr. Scahill paid back the remaining amount of about $90,000 that he owed the investors in restitution.In a statement, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said, Through his elaborate overtures to investors, Roland Scahill scammed patrons of the arts to the tune of more than $200,000.We are pleased to have brought his larcenous scheme to a grand finale.
Review: A Timely Take on ‘Oedipus’ by Way of South Central Los Angeles:::::Photo In America, there are stories we like to tell.Stories about meritocracy and opportunity, about talent, hope and help.We tell them, in part, so that we dont have to voice less comfortable truths that the circumstances of a persons birth often prophesy the life that follows.Thats uniquely true of Oedipus, the limping princeling fated to kill his father and marry his mother.Hes crossed seas and centuries to appear in Luis Alfaros vigorous and pointed Oedipus El Rey, at the Public Theater, which resets the tale in modern-day South Central Los Angeles.Directed by Chay Yew with energy and flair, its the most successful offering yet from the Sol Project, an initiative dedicated to producing the work of Latinx playwrights.The play opens in a prison complex, as a convict chorus rushes around the stage in orange scrubs and tries to decide what story to tell.Stories are boring, some prisoners say; theyre depressing, they dont change anything.But one chorus member says, Stories are all we got.So they shed the scrubs and take on the roles in this Oedipus update.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As written by Sophocles, the original Oedipus Rex is an oldie but a goody, provided your definition of a goody is heavy on the incest and the self-mutilation.And so it goes here.When Laius (Juan Francisco Villa), a Los Angeles gangster, learns that his unborn son will kill him, he arranges to have the baby killed, slashing the bottoms of his feet for good measure.I dont want him chasing me in the afterlife, Laius says.
Review: In ‘The Last Match,’ Tennis Is Not Only a Game:::::Ms. Ziegler, a fertile writer of admirably varied style and subject, considers the before-and-after part, too.But she has also dared to place The Last Match in the here and now of a game as its being played.We follow, more or less set by set, the match between Tim, a long-reigning American golden boy in his mid-30s, and the decade-younger Sergei, a rising star from Russia.Not that the actors ever hit a genuine tennis ball, and they only rarely pick up rackets.Tim Mackabees open-sky blue-and-green set may evoke the daunting public stage of center court, but the real setting is the crowded interior of the players minds.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Theater Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest news, interviews and reviews from Broadway and beyond.So as the aging Tim and the explosive Sergei struggle toward match point, their thoughts roam into the long, dark corridors of their pasts and presents.We learn of the agonizing attempts of Tim and his wife, Mallory (Zo Winters), a retired player, to conceive a child; and of the combustible courtship of Galina (Natalia Payne), an occasional actress of immense vicarious ambition, by Sergei.When the memories are especially hurtful, or the introspection too self-defeating, one of the players drops a set.Ms. Ziegler knows that self-consciousness is rarely an athletes friend, and there are moments when Tim or Sergei finds himself in the zone of a natural rhythm, when you almost palpably feel the satisfaction of instinctive performance.More often, though, The Last Match evokes those literal-minded cinematic flashbacks, when a certain word makes a characters eyes and the cameras focus go hazy, and the story shifts woozily into a significant chapter in the past.The substance of such recollected moments here isnt all that different from the thumbnail making-of-a-champion profiles that regularly punctuate Olympics broadcasts.The performances rarely transcend the expected formula of such back stories.And the womens roles are strictly supporting in all senses.But the well-cast Mr. Bethel endows Tim with a smooth Teflon surface just starting to show scratches, and Mr. Mickiewicz has an infectiously good time as the angry, bad-behaving underdog with a thick Slavic accent.As always, Ms. Ziegler whose work includes the biographical plays Photograph 51, about the scientist Rosalind Franklin (played in London by Nicole Kidman), and Boy has not only done her research, but clearly thought hard about the implications of what shes learned.There is the stuff of an elegant (if less than original) essay in The Last Match on how we invest in athletes as symbols and reflections of our own mortality.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Ziegler is also fast becoming a master of swelling choral dialogue, in which urgent but lyrical phrases are intoned in a counterpoint that seems to echo down the halls of history.(The splendid British playwright Michael Frayn, the author of Copenhagen and Democracy, is this styles most accomplished practitioner.)She delivers just such a sequence as The Last Match draws to its end.If you may have felt like changing to the Golf Channel before, you are sure to refocus your attention and perhaps even go a little misty as this production concludes.The routine back-and-forth of a hard-fought match finally approaches the ineffable radiance of one of those moments that tennis fans live for.Time seems to stop in such moments, even as it extends into eternity.
Robert Guillaume, Emmy-Winning Star of ‘Benson,’ Dies at 89:::::When criticized for playing a black domestic worker in a white household, he responded that he saw Benson as a paean to the black working mans struggle.When he took the part, he said, he decided that while Benson might be a servant, he would never be servile.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I wanted black people to be proud of Benson, he wrote in his autobiography, Guillaume: A Life (with David Ritz, 2002).Mr. Guillaume said Bensons sharp tongue and dignified mien had allowed him to transcend his station while getting laughs.What made the humor was that he didnt care what people thought about him, he said of the character in an interview for this obituary in 2011.He wasnt trying to be mean; he was just trying to be his own man.On Soap, Susan Harriss soap-opera satire, Benson would admonish the members of the wealthy Tate family for their antics amid the shows absurd plot twists, which included demonic possession and alien abduction.He won the Emmy for best supporting actor in a comedy series in 1979.That same year, Benson left the Tates for the governors mansion and his own series.In its first seasons he was the head of household affairs for Gov.Eugene Gatling (James Noble); he eventually rose to budget director, lieutenant governor and finally a rival for the governors seat itself.Photo Benson ended in 1986 with Benson and Gatling, now consummate equals, seated side by side awaiting the results of the election in which they had run against each other.Mr. Guillaume won the Emmy for best lead actor in a comedy series in 1985.Benson was followed in 1989 by The Robert Guillaume Show, a comedy in which he played a psychologist who becomes romantically involved with a white woman.The show was canceled after 12 episodes.Mr. Guillaume, who had had interracial relationships long before they were more widely accepted in the United States, blamed his own navet for the shows demise.I was ultimately responsible for that failure by not understanding what a wrenching change it would represent to an audience still uncomfortable with the subject, he said in 2011.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Guillaume went on to play an executive producer, Isaac Jaffe, on Aaron Sorkins Sports Night (1998-2000), a sitcom about the inner workings of a show much like ESPNs SportsCenter.When Mr. Guillaume had a stroke in 1999, Mr. Sorkin wrote a stroke into the script for the character so that he could continue playing the part.Photo Mr. Guillaume was born Robert Peter Williams on Nov. 30, 1927, in St. Louis.His mother, Zoe Bertha Edwards, was an alcoholic and a prostitute.He never knew his father.His grandmother Jeanette Williams reared him after a stepfather struck him in the head with a red-hot poker.Robert attended a Roman Catholic high school, where he sang in the choir.He joined the Army in 1945, but the war was over by the time he reached Okinawa in the Pacific.He was honorably discharged in 1947.After the war he enrolled at St. Louis University to study business on the G.I.Bill.He later studied singing and theater at Washington University in St. Louis but never earned a degree.He married Marlene Scott in 1955.They separated but remained married for nearly three decades before divorcing in the mid-1980s.In the late 1950s Mr. Guillaume moved to Cleveland to play Billy Bigelow in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel at Karamu House, a historically black theater.It was there that he adopted the surname Guillaume (the French form of William), inspired by his grandfathers tales of his familys French heritage.(He also had Native American ancestors.)You know how many Robert Williamses there are in this country?Mr. Guillaume said in a 1977 interview with The Times.I wanted something different.He later wrote that frequent mispronunciations of Guillaume (gee-YOME, with a hard g) were the price Ive paid for my pretentiousness.Photo Mr. Guillaume left Cleveland in 1959 to tour with the short-lived Harold Arlen musical Free and Easy, which played in Amsterdam but did not make it to the United States.Soon afterward he moved to New York, where his stage career would flourish.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Guillaume played the drug dealer Sportin Life in a 1964 revival of Porgy and Bess at City Center and the lead role, the preacher Purlie Victorious Judson, in the 1972 Broadway revival of Purlie, a musical set in the Jim Crow South.He also toured for four years with the musical revue Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris.Mr. Guillaume never made it to the Metropolitan Opera, although he did star in the Los Angeles production of The Phantom of the Opera in 1990.He landed his part in Soap in 1977 after a Tony-nominated run as Nathan Detroit in an all-black Broadway revival of Guys and Dolls.Mr. Guillaume appeared in a few feature films, notably Lean on Me (1989) and Big Fish (2003); guest-starred on shows like All in the Family and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air; voiced the baboon Rafiki in The Lion King and its straight-to-video sequels; released several albums of his singing; and received four N.A.A.C.P.Image Awards.He also won a Grammy in 1995 for best spoken word album for children for his narration on The Lion King Read Along.He married Donna Brown in 1985.He is also survived by three daughters, Patricia Carpenter and Melissa and Rachel Guillaume; one son, Kevin; four grandchildren; five great-grandchildren; and one great-great-granddaughter.Mr. Guillaume acknowledged that racism created problems for him, but he never considered them insurmountable.I have trouble handling the whole idea that its tough to get a job because youre black, he told The Times in 1977.White actors have problems, too; if youre black its just one more problem that you have to deal with.
‘Cry as Loud as You Want.’ In This Audience, They Really Do.:::::This wasnt the first time that someone in the Newman Theater had reacted emotionally to a monologue by Ms. Vardalos or one of her three castmates, in the play she adapted from Cheryl Strayeds book of the same name, based on her long-running online advice column, Dear Sugar.It is now in its second iteration at the Public after a critically acclaimed run last fall.(Ms. Strayed now collaborates with Steve Almond on the Sweet Spot column for the Thursday Styles section of The New York Times and its accompanying podcast Dear Sugars.)Earlier that evening, in fact, another young woman, sitting in the third row, started crying at the point when Sugar told of how her mother had never lived to see her granddaughter wear the red dress the two women had bought impulsively at a yard sale years earlier.And she started up again this time more loudly near the end of the show when the character played by Teddy Caez narrated the tale of a father who had lost his only son at age 22.Photo I felt I had to carry her through the show, Ms. Vardalos said.We must listen constantly, not just to each other, acting and reacting, but also to what is going on in the audience.Because the audience becomes part of the performance.Any play is going to have its challenges, of course, from complicated monologues to quicksilver scene changes to the distractions of cellphones going off or someone snoring away in the front row.(Oh, yes, Ive seen that as well, Ms. Vardalos said.)But Tiny Beautiful Things, with its tales of untimely death, a miscarriage that still haunts years later and sexual assault all taken from the letters written to Ms. Strayed and then her often deeply personal responses has an emotional rawness that seems to grab audiences in unexpected ways.(Of course, not every story is a sad one: At least one monologue, about a sexy Santa, gets laughs every night.)If you have 300 people in the theater, then the odds are someone is there on the anniversary of someone they loved passing away, or maybe of a relationship ending, said the director Thomas Kail.So something that may mean nothing to you might resonate deeply with the person sitting behind you.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After a recent Sunday matinee, four old friends two visiting from Canada, two living in New York gathered on the sidewalk outside the Public to reflect on the play they had just seen.It was like group therapy, Carolyn McAskie, 71, said to her friends, laughing.I know, responded Roxanne Carrillo, 65.I believe it was 90 minutes, but it felt much shorter, like I had just left a 50-minute session with my shrink.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.On another night, Monique Bernstein, 28, stood in the lobby of the Public, holding a program for Ms. Vardalos to autograph while wiping away traces of the tears she had shed during the last extended monologue, about the father mourning his son.I had read the book and I loved it, she said.But there is something about seeing it with an audience, as opposed to just reading a book by yourself, that is sort of a bonding experience.Like there was a woman sniffling behind me, and Im like, I dont feel so bad!Its been almost exactly a year since Tiny Beautiful Things was staged at the Public the first time around, selling out its brief run, and both Ms. Vardalos and Mr. Kail (a Tony Award winner for Hamilton) say they see small but significant differences in how audiences are now reacting.Photo The theater itself may be one reason the tears seem to be flowing so freely in the current production.Mr. Kail said the move to larger house the original venue, the Shiva Theater, held 99 seats; the Newman, more than three times that has made the experience more intimate, not less so, by letting the audience slip into the anonymity of darkness.The Newman is both narrow and deep, with lights from the stage reflecting only on audience members in the first few rows.There is something about the length of the theater, and the darkness that unfolds, that allows deep reactions to come out, Mr. Kail said.And that was one of the questions we had when we first started working on this: Can we bring a group of people together, people who have never met, sitting shoulder to shoulder in the dark, and really get them to unlock?Mr. Kail said he was in the audience the night the young woman burst into her howl of anguish.Each person on that stage, all four of them, were affected in their own way, he said.They each had to grapple with what it meant to hear someone who was clearly in pain.It opened up and expanded the show in ways I hadnt seen on other nights.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After each performance, Ms. Vardalos exits through the lobby of the Public, signing autographs, posing for selfies, even laughing and joking with people who might have been choking back tears in their seats a few minutes earlier but now are thrilled to meet the star of My Big Fat Greek Wedding.But not every night.Sometimes, I will have been so affected by what happens in the audience, that I dont come out right away, she said.I need to just sit by myself.I know people are waiting and as actors, we aim to please but there are times I cant come out.I just cant.Both she and Mr. Kail say they believe that there is something beyond the changed physical space that is causing such profound emotional reactions this time around.And that is the country itself.Deep wounds that remain from a divisive presidential election.White supremacists marching in Charlottesville.The massacre in Las Vegas.Hurricanes in Houston, Florida and Puerto Rico.The threat of nuclear war with North Korea.All are factors the two believe may make people hungry to find comfort in the theater.We are also so different now, Mr. Kail said.There is a lot of pain, Ms. Vardalos said.And I think that Cheryls words are a salve for the pain we are going through.
‘The Humans’ to Start National Tour Next Month:::::Photo The Tony-winning play The Humans will embark on a 13-city national tour starting in Seattle next month.Written by Stephen Karam, the play depicts a middle-class American family gathering on Thanksgiving; their economic anxieties and familial and generational tensions are soon laid bare over dinner.The Humans opened on Broadway in February 2016 to rapturous reviews: In The New York Times, Charles Isherwood called it the finest new play of the Broadway season so far by a long shot.He added, Mr. Karams play might almost qualify as deep-delving reportage, so clearly does it illuminate the current, tremor-ridden landscape of contemporary America.The Humans won four Tony Awards, including best play.Seattle will be the first stop, starting Nov. 17.The play will travel through cities including Chicago (Jan. 30-Feb. 11), Cleveland (April 10-29), Dallas (May 8-20), and finally Los Angeles (June 19-July 29).Richard Thomas, who received a Tony nomination for The Little Foxes last year, will star as the bewildered patriarch, Erik.The cast also includes Pamela Reed as Deirdre and Daisy Eagan a Tony winner at age 11 for The Secret Garden as Brigid.Joe Mantello, who directed the Broadway production, will stay on for the tour, as will David Zinn, who won the Tony for scenic design.While touring musicals are common, it is much rarer for plays to travel.The biggest exception, of course, is Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which will open up shop in Australia in 2019 after arriving in New York next April.A full list of tour stops can be found at www.thehumansonbroadway.com.
With a Season of New Works, the Old Vic Is 200 Years Young:::::Photo LONDON An adaptation of Charles Dickenss A Christmas Carol, by Jack Thorne (Let the Right One In, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,), starring Rhys Ifans.A new two-part play, The Divide, by Alan Ayckbourn.The stage premiere of Ingmar Bergmans 1982 film, Fanny and Alexander.A musical dance production, Sylvia, directed by Kate Prince, about the female rights campaigner Sylvia Pankhurst.New work is the theme of the Old Vics 2017-18 season, announced on Tuesday, ahead of the theaters 200th birthday on May 11, 2018.To honor the Old Vic, Matthew Warchus, its artistic director, said in a statement, We are celebrating it partly as a treasured historic icon but mostly as an adventurous, youthful, hub of creativity with a vibrant future ahead of it.Mr. Thornes version of A Christmas Carol will open the season, on Nov. 20, followed by Mr. Ayckbourns The Divide, which had its premiere at this years Edinburgh International Festival, and is set in a gender-partitioned future society.The Academy Award-winning Fanny and Alexander, adapted by Stephen Beresford and directed by Max Webster, is at its full five-hour version one of the longest fiction films made.Mr. Warchus said in an interview with The Evening Standard that while the show would be quite meaty, it would have a normal playing time.He added that the story of Fanny and Alexander about two siblings whose lives change when their mother remarries was not unlike Matilda the Musical, in that attempts to bully the imagination out of a child result in the imagination growing stronger and stronger.Photo Other productions to be staged during the 2017-18 season include the premiere of Mood Music by Joe Penhall, who wrote the book for the West End musical Sunny Afternoon and created the new Netflix series Mindhunter.An adaptation of Patrick Nesss novel, A Monster Calls, about a young boy coping with his mothers terminal cancer, directed by Sally Cookson, will come to the stage, after it was made into a movie last year.The Old Vic also announced seven new associate artists, including the writers Mr. Thorne, Mr. Beresford, Conor McPherson, Tamsin Oglesby and Lucy Prebble, and the composer Claire van Kampen, whose Farinelli and the King will come to Broadway in December.

Review: It’s Law vs. Order in ‘Jesus Hopped the “A” Train’:::::With some bravado, Angel insists that what he did was therefore only technically wrong.(He tells his court-appointed lawyer that he merely aimed at Kims water-buffalo-sized posterior.)But after he lands in 24-hour protective custody, one hour of which is spent each day in a cage in the jail yard, he meets his philosophical match.There in the next cage is Lucius Jenkins, a serial murderer and self-described paranoid schizophrenic trying to avoid extradition to Florida and probable execution there.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The moral argument between these two men forms the heart of the play, as Lucius, who says he found God in prison, confronts Angel, who long ago lost God outside it.That Lucius (Edi Gathegi) is generally sunny and witty despite having killed eight people plays with our loyalties.He is the one who reaches out, shares cigarettes, warns about the Monday soup and recites the names of the books of the Old Testament, backward, while doing deep knee bends and lunges.Angel, on the other hand, acquires the nickname of Droopy Dog.When the psychopath is an acute thinker about responsibility and the atheist a tantrum-prone man-child hoping to avoid it, we have trouble deciding how to invest our emotions.That is exactly where Mr. Guirgis, who won a 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Between Riverside and Crazy, wants us: in a confused crouch that renders us vulnerable to deeper questioning.He then mercilessly exploits that vulnerability by adding a contrasting pair of guards to the mix: one, named Charlie, a good-natured patsy; the other, Valdez, a by-the-rules sadist.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Theater Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest news, interviews and reviews from Broadway and beyond.Dont be a God-fearing man, Valdez warns Lucius, be a Valdez-fearing man.So where is God where is good in the criminal justice system?The questions dont so much hover over Jesus Hopped the A Train as yank at it with gale force.There is nothing abstract about them: Mr. Guirgis says that the play began in his own attempt to rescue a friend from the Unification Church.Perhaps it is to keep the drama from flying into pieces, therefore, that he clamps the procedural frame so firmly in place around the prisoners debates.Their scenes together alternate with ones in which Angels lawyer, Mary Jane Hanrahan, must break through his perverse resistance in order to prepare him for court.As long as these interviews maintain the plays furiously Socratic tone, they enhance the idea that making good choices in an evil world is nearly beyond the human skill set.But in a series of monologues that pull further back from the action, Hanrahans reflections on the case, and on her own investment in it, dissipate the tension.This slight flaw in the writing is exacerbated by a few awkward directorial choices, including a Law & Order-like chung-chung sound effect between scenes.This leads you to expect Jerry Orbach, or a neat denouement that Mr. Guirgis is not about to provide.But Mark Brokaws staging on a simple set by Riccardo Hernandez, sensitively lit by Scott Zielinski, is otherwise evenhanded and clean, as if not wanting to leave any fingerprints.He has rightly focused instead on shaping the cast into a superlative ensemble despite a series of setbacks: Both Mr. Carvajal and Mr. Gathegi, who are excellent, were late replacements.Thats astonishing, as their roles are killers in more ways than one.The others Stephanie DiMaggio as Hanrahan, Erick Betancourt as Charlie and especially Ricardo Chavira as the terrifying Valdez support them, and the plays whipsawing arguments, handily.Those arguments are eternal, as the frequent biblical references suggest.But they are also particular to our time and place, perhaps even more so now that the United States is the worlds largest jailer than they were in 2000.In 2017 Jesus Hopped the A Train seems to ask whether justice, and even God, is possible in an unjust society.No wonder its so profane.
Review: Romancing the Bot in Zoe Kazan’s ‘After the Blast’:::::Grim forecasts for the day after tomorrow have informed a slew of dystopian plays in recent years, and After the Blast isnt venturing into virgin territory.The script especially brings to mind Jordan Harrisons Marjorie Prime, seen in New York in 2015 (and made into a recent movie), in which replicants become comforters for the old and lonely; and Penelope Skinners The Ruins of Civilization (2016), which concerns a husband-dominated, stay-at-home woman of tomorrow yearning for a child.Photo Like Ruins, After the Blast intimates that the lot of womankind will not have improved radically, though neither work approaches the retrogressive horrors of The Handmaids Tale.A third-generation descendant of select Americans who make up an underground colony after the earths surface becomes unlivable, Anna stays at home and mopes while her brilliant scientist husband, Oliver (William Jackson Harper of TVs The Good Place), toils for the betterment of the upper earths ecology.If only this couple could receive approval to conceive a child from the population-monitoring government, Anna might find a raison dtre.But she fails to meet the happiness quotient expected of parents-to-be, nor is she a willing conformist in an assembly-line culture.Shes suspicious, for instance, of the virtual-reality chips with which the underground colonists have been implanted.These allow people to simulate experiences like visiting the seashore or tasting flavorful food that their regulated environment does not offer naturally.Indulging in these vivid visions is known as simming, and even Oliver, it turns out, does it on the q.t.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Ms. Kazan a vivid actress and the screenwriter of the charmingly fantastical Ruby Sparks has fulfilled the first criterion of persuasive futurist fiction: Shes created a slyly detailed alternate universe that is both an extrapolation of the world we know today and its own consistent entity.Daniel Zimmermans sets are alarmingly, soothingly bland, suggesting an interior decorating collaboration between Ikea and Apple.And the cast which also includes Eboni Booth and Ben Horner as Oliver and Annas best friends subtly conveys a cautious and subdued population, which has learned to neither hope nor ask for too much.Perhaps the anodyne factor of this wan new world accounts for the lack of tension in After the Blast.But its also true that the characters often seem to have little existence beyond their functions as avatars of a new social order.The relationship between Oliver and Anna, in particular, never acquires the heat to make us feel anxious when its in jeopardy.And the revelation of an act of betrayal that Anna uncovers in the plays final scenes fails to land with the intended impact.We feel most invested in Annas friendship with Arthur (voiced by Will Connolly), who is ultimately, of course, just an extension of her lonely self.Pausing to think about the implications of that is perhaps the best way to register the warning in a play in which reality, as we have traditionally known and sensed it, is increasingly in retreat.
Review: In ‘Squeamish,’ It’s the Therapist Who’s Troubled:::::Photo The playwright and director Aaron Mark likes to tell creepy stories in the dark, or as close as he can get to it.Two seasons ago, when Daphne Rubin-Vega played a woman with a grisly past in Mr. Marks monologue Empanada Loca, the glow of a trash-can fire illuminated the gloom.Squeamish, his ghoulish new play starring Alison Fraser, is also a one-woman affair.Presented by All for One Theater in the Beckett Theater at Theater Row, it, too, is cloaked in an unusually enveloping blackness.It is the middle of the night in a psychiatrists home office on the Upper West Side, and Sharon is explaining how shes been for the past five months, ever since she went off her antidepressants and stopped checking in.Lets just say, a lots happened, she says, settled comfortably into a leather wing chair.(The set and its dusky-dim lighting are by Sarah Johnston.)Chipper and well put together, with a cultured voice whose lilt is a charming remnant of her Texas past, Sharon is a psychotherapist.If at first she doesnt seem in dire need of an emergency session about her own troubles, listen awhile.She could use way more drastic help than that.Like Ms. Rubin-Vegas subterranean dweller and the charismatic psychopath Tom Hewitt played in Mr. Marks Another Medea, Sharon is an entertaining raconteur whose ordinary life has taken a Grand Guignol turn.Shes just back from Texas, where she went for the funeral of her beloved nephew, Eddie.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The strange thing about Eddie, who was 24, is how he died: bleeding out in the bathtub, as Sharons mother did decades before.Just like her, he had cut marks all over his body.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.At the funeral, Eddies sweet-voiced sprite of a girlfriend, Cara, comforts her fellow mourners cheerfully.When she turns up later at Sharons hotel, the two women bond.Then Cara lets Sharon in on a certain gruesome secret about Eddie.
Review: 1 Actor, in 8 Roles, Wrestles Nuance From Eugene O’Neill’s ‘Strange Interlude’:::::Unspooling over three generations of a family, it revolves around the beguiling Nina Leeds, who, as the play begins, is a young woman mourning her first love and tormented by the fact that she never slept with him.Killed in World War I, he was her male ideal.Even in death, he is an object of jealousy for the other men in her life, including her professor father and her familys friend Charlie Marsden, an author sexually uninterested in women but obsessed with Nina all the same.Dear old Charlie, Nina likes to say, her platonic fondness a dagger to his heart, but Charlie is her mainstay through the tumultuous years.After Nina marries Sam Evans, a nice guy she doesnt love, she discovers that insanity runs in his family a secret he doesnt know and she isnt about to tell him.To give Sam a child but avoid the risk of passing along mental illness, she enlists her friend Ned Darrell to get her pregnant on the sly.The plan works, except that their arrangement blossoms into an affair, and Ned isnt wild about seeing his son raised by another man.The boy, in turn, is haunted by spying his mother kissing Ned.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Its a crowded play, and ONeill layers its abundant dialogue with the racing thoughts of his characters, who speak their anxieties and suspicions aloud for the audiences benefit.However many people Mr. Greenspan is playing in a given scene, he is operating on double that number of tracks and following along, so are we.This takes some getting used to, but its like the way your ear has to adjust to Shakespeare.Give it a little time, and youll ease right in.The straightforwardness of the design sets and costume by Dane Laffrey, lighting by Jen Schriever helps here.Mr. Greenspan wears a classic three-piece suit throughout, and the playing spaces for the first seven acts are intimate, contained within a wooden structure that Mr. Laffrey has nestled inside the cavernous theater.But sound is a stubborn obstacle to this delicately modulated performance.Ceiling fans whir softly over the audience in those initial spaces, making it difficult to hear, especially when Mr. Greenspan lowers his voice to a whisper or moves upstage.Well into the show on Friday night, the fans were turned off, and the difference was remarkable: Act VI featuring Nina; Ned; and my two favorites, the aw-shucks Sam and the petty, surprisingly sympathetic Charlie actually rollicked.For the final two acts, though, we migrated upstairs to the mezzanine, where echoey acoustics and a sudden distance from Mr. Greenspan, separated from us by the balcony railing, got in the way.Still, his performance is astonishing in its clarity, nuance and endurance.When, at the end of that evenings marathon, Mr. Greenspan took a too-brief bow, I thought: Wait, come back.Were not done thanking you.

Selma Blair, Rachel McAdams accuse James Toback of sexual harassment:::::Oct. 27 (UPI) -- Selma Blair and Rachel McAdams have joined the other 38 women who have accused filmmaker James Toback of sexual harassment.Blair and McAdams shared their accounts of meeting with Toback about the film Harvard Man Thursday in a story published by Vanity Fair."Against my better judgment, I went upstairs," Blair shared of her encounter with Toback."I went in the room feeling a little off balance about the arrangement, but he seemed nonplussed.He pulled out the script and said, 'I look at you, and I see that we have a real connection.You could be an incredible actress, just by your eyes.But I can tell you don't have confidence,'" before noting how the director then asked her to "do this monologue naked.""I do remember looking down at the script and seeing my bare chest, and not being able to focus on anything but the words and my face being so hot and puffy, and feeling so ashamed," Blair said.The actress stated that after she denied Toback sex, she allowed him to touch her while he masturbated after he stopped her from leaving.McAdams shared a similar story about meeting Toback for Harvard Man detailing how upon arriving, he admitted to masturbating while thinking of her."Eventually, I just excused myself.I can't remember how long I was there.I felt like I was there forever.This has been such a source of shame for me -- that I didn't have the wherewithal to get up and leave," McAdams said.After explaining what happened to her agent, McAdams said she discovered that another of the agent's clients went through the same thing with Toback."That is when I got mad, because I felt like I was kind of thrown into the lion's den and given no warning that he was a predator," she said."This was something that he was known for doing already."Toback has denied the allegations made against him by the 38 women and offered no comment when asked about Blair and McAdams' allegations.

Rare, hidden portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots revealed:::::EDINBURGH (Reuters) - A rare, unfinished portrait believed to be of Mary, Queen of Scots has been found underneath another 16th-century painting after an X-ray revealed a ghostly likeness of the executed queen.An unfinished portrait of a woman, thought to be Mary Queen of Scots, and a portrait of John Maitland, are displayed at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery during a media view, in Edinburgh, Scotland October 27, 2017.Conservator Caroline Rae discovered the unfinished portrait hidden beneath the painting of Maitland, using X-rays during a research project conducted at the National Galleries of Scotland (NGS) and the Courtauld Institute of Art.REUTERS/Russell Cheyne A woman with distinct similarities to near-contemporary depictions of Mary was revealed during an examination of a portrait of Sir John Maitland, attributed to Adrian Vanson, a Dutchman who was court painter to Marys son King James VI of Scotland (James I of England).The X-ray showed the shape of a womans face and the outline of her dress and hat beneath the upper layers of paint in a pose and a likeness similar to those of the queen at the time.Mary was forced to abdicate in 1567 after she was implicated in her husbands murder and was then imprisoned in England by her cousin Elizabeth I from 1568 and executed in 1587.The painting usually hangs in the National Trusts Ham House southwest of London.Vansons portrait of Sir John Maitland is an important picture in the National Trust collection, and the remarkable discovery of the unfinished portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots adds an exciting hidden dimension to it, said David Taylor, Curator of Pictures and Sculpture at the National Trust.It shows that portraits of the queen were being copied and presumably displayed in Scotland around the time of her execution, a highly contentious and potentially dangerous thing to be seen doing, he added.The portrait and X-ray images will be on display at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery from Saturday.
'East German' art show another step in still-rocky unification:::::POTSDAM, Germany (Reuters) - A display of artworks created during 40 years of East German history could help Germans from east and west bridge the divide that still separates them 27 years after unification.German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Saturday opened an exhibition at the Barberini Museum in Potsdam near Berlin that seeks to illuminate how artists saw and represented themselves in a state that kept tight controls on all creative pursuits.Behind the Mask: Artists in the GDR includes 100 paintings, sculptures, photographs and other artworks created by more than 80 artists from the states creation in 1949 until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.Germanys Sept. 24 national election highlighted the difference in mood and politics between east and west.It swept the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party into parliament for the first time in what experts largely describe as a protest vote against Chancellor Angela Merkels 2015 decision to allow in over a million mostly Muslim migrants.The election was seen as a wake-up call about lingering divisions between the former Communist east and the capitalist west since support for the AfD was particularly strong in eastern states like Saxony, where it bested Merkels conservatives to become the biggest party.Steinmeier last month said the election had exposed large and small cracks in society and called on democratic lawmakers to join forces against any return to nationalism.On Saturday, he said he hoped the wide-ranging exhibit would enable a deeper understanding of how East German artists dealt with the challenges of creative expression in a country where art was often censored, restricted or instrumentalized.This exhibition ... will open our eyes anew, Steinmeier said in the text of a speech at the exhibits official opening.That is why it is a very important milestone on the path toward one another that we embarked on a quarter century ago - and that is taking longer than we all imagined back then.The display offers insights into how people lived, thought and work, and how the world was seen, and what was so important and valuable that it was artistically rendered, he said.Ortrud Westheider, director of the museum, said the concept of mask was useful for organizing the show because it showed how artists were at once forced into a certain role, but also makes clear that they were aware of that fact.Curator Michael Philipp said the exhibit aimed to show the leeway that artists had, and the leeway that they fought for, chose and used despite governmental constraints.Many of the paintings and sculptures used irony to respond to the conditions under which they lived and worked, he said.

Note with Einstein's theory on life auctioned for $1.3 million:::::JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Strapped for cash in a Tokyo hotel, Albert Einstein wrote his take on life on a note and handed it to the bellboy instead of a tip.The physicists formula for happy living fetched $1.3 million on Tuesday, a Jerusalem auction house said.In 1922, Einstein was en route to Japan when the announcement came he would be awarded the 1921 Nobel prize in physics, Winners Auctions and Exhibitions said.Upon his arrival in Tokyo, he holed up in his hotel room trying to put his thoughts to paper.When an attendant came to his room to make a delivery, Einstein found himself without any money for a tip.Instead, he handed him a signed note with one sentence, written in German: A calm and humble life will bring more happiness than the pursuit of success and the constant restlessness that comes with it.According to the auction house, Einstein advised the bellboy to keep the note, saying that some day its value will surpass the amount of a standard tip.Almost a 100 years later, Einstein was proven right after the bellboys nephew contacted the auction house to put the note up for sale.The identity of the online buyer has not been revealed.
Art of the deal: Trump's Empire State Building doodle fetches $16,000:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - George W. Bush famously turned to portrait painting as a hobby when he left office.Could President Donald Trump one day follow in his footsteps, encouraged by the recent sale of his drawing of New York Citys Empire State Building for $16,000?President Donald Trump's black marker drawing on paper of the Empire State building made in the 1990's sold for$16 000 at Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles, California, U.S on October 19, 2017 is seen in this photo released October 23, 2017.Julien's Auctions/Handout via REUTERS It is not the first time a Trump doodle sold for a serious sum: A 2005 sketch of the New York skyline - with Trump Tower at the center - sold for more than $29,000 in July.The latest drawing sold last week at Juliens Auctions in Los Angeles to another prominent New York developer, Elie Hirschfeld, the auction house said.The picture, which carries Trumps signature, dates to 1995 when Trump owned a stake in the iconic 102-story Empire State in midtown Manhattan and was locked in a lease dispute.Trump accused the occupants of allowing rats to infest the skyscraper and unsuccessfully sued to try to force them out.He eventually sold his interest in the building in 2002.Trump sketched the skyscraper at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida for a charity auction, where it sold for less than $100.The original buyer, whom the auction house did not identify, has kept the drawing until now.Hirschfeld, whose company owns more than 1 million square feet of commercial space and more than 1,000 residential units, also recently bought Andy Warhols 1981 pencil drawing of Trump Tower.The Warhol and Trump pieces are unique and iconic depictions of New York City that will make perfect additions to the Hirschfeld Art collection, Hirschfeld said in a statement.Hirschfeld and Trump partnered on various development projects in the past, including the large residential towers known as Trump Place along the Hudson River on Manhattans West Side.
Sierra Leone to auction multi-million dollar diamond to benefit poor:::::(This version of the story corrects para 2 to say first auction was held in Freetown, not New York.)A 709-carat diamond, found in Sierra Leone and known as the "Peace Diamond", is displayed during a tour ahead of its auction, at Israel's Diamond Exchange, in Ramat Gan, Israel October 19, 2017.Picture taken October 19, 2017.REUTERS/Nir Elias Ramat Gan, ISRAEL (Reuters) - Sierra Leone hopes to raise millions of dollars for development projects by auctioning a huge uncut diamond, believed to be one of the worlds largest, in New York in December.It will be the governments second attempt to sell the 709-carat gem, known as the Peace Diamond, after it rejected the highest bid of $7.8 million at an initial auction in Sierra Leones capital Freetown in May.Over half of the proceeds from the sale will be used to fund clean water, electricity, education and health projects in Sierra Leone, and particularly in the village of Koryardu, in the Kono region in eastern Sierra Leone, where the diamond was discovered.Theres a reason God gave these diamonds to the poorest people in the world and made the richest people want them.This is Tikun Olam (Hebrew for correcting the world), this is making the world a better place, Martin Rapaport, chairman of Rapaport Group, a network of diamond companies which will manage the auction, told Reuters.The diamond, which the auctioneers described as the 14th largest in the world, was unearthed in Koryardu in March by a Christian pastor who gave it to the government.Diamonds fueled a decade-long civil war in Sierra Leone, ending in 2002, in which rebels forced civilians to mine the stones and bought weapons with the proceeds, leading to the term blood diamonds.
In Beirut, play about Syria's war gets as close to home as it can:::::(This version of the October 22 story corrects ages of director and writer) Actors perform during a rehearsal of the play called "While I Was Waiting", at Dawar al-Shams theatre in Beirut, Lebanon October 20, 2017.REUTERS/Jamal Saidi By Ayat Basma BEIRUT (Reuters) - A play about Syrias war, told through one familys tragedy, made its Lebanon debut on Friday, the closest it will ever get to being staged on home soil, its Syrian director said.It would be impossible to perform it in Syria.There are red lines, and the censorship that was there before 2011 is still there today, said Omar Abu Saada, one of the countrys best-known theater directors.The play - called While I Was Waiting - is based on the real-life story of a young man found beaten unconscious near a hospital in Damascus in 2013, but the circumstances of his beating and subsequent death remained unclear.Abu Saada knew the man and his family.When I thought about working on a new project, this was the story that came to my mind.It pretty much imposed itself, he said.In the play, the man oscillates between life and death and the lack of answers unnerves his family.His suspended state is a metaphor for the state of waiting that all Syrians share, whether inside the country or abroad and regardless of their political views, the director said.Another thing all Syrians share is loss, he added.The Syrian conflict, which began with a popular uprising against the state, has raged on into its seventh year.The war has killed hundreds of thousands of people, made more than half of Syrians homeless, and created the worlds worst refugee crisis.Syrians today are not in a single place, they are suspended.Waiting is something that we all have in common, Abu Saada, 40, said.Most people lost someone close, either by death, emigration or imprisonment.Everyone lost something.This has changed the way Syrians think, their social fabric and even they way they make art, he said.Actors perform during a rehearsal of the play called "While I Was Waiting", at Dawar al-Shams theatre in Beirut, Lebanon October 20, 2017.REUTERS/Jamal Saidi The play charts the disenchantment of young Taym, the comatose patient, from his hope for change at the start of the 2011 uprising to his despair as it spiraled into a war.Syrias young generation, active in organizing and documenting the mass protests, lost the most in the violent turn of events, he said.The state of coma is more of a metaphor for the lack of power to change things, Abu Saada said.The play made its debut in Brussels in 2016 and has since been staged in France, the United States and Japan among other places.The six cast members said they could not meet anywhere in the Arab world for rehearsals because of visa restrictions.Slideshow (2 Images) So in the end, we rehearsed in France which under normal circumstances would have been the harder place to go to, said Nanda Mohamed, a Syrian actress.The writer, who has previously lived in Lebanon, had to leave Beirut in 2015 when the Lebanese government imposed stricter conditions on Syrians in the country.But he said being forced to leave Lebanon helped him view the war differently.Sometimes the geographical distance helps create the gap for critical thinking and I tried to take advantage of that, said Mohamed al-Attar, 37.What happened to us was tragic but what would be more tragic is if we couldnt review things.It would be disastrous if after the heavy price we paid and we continue to pay that we also do not have the courage to think about what we lost and boldly criticize it, Attar said.Attar previously worked in Beirut with director Abu Saada on an adaptation of the Greek myth Antigone performed by an all-female cast of Syrian refugees.Both agree the play is about fuelling debate about a war that is not yet over.The idea of creating a play about something that you are living in the middle of and still being affected by and probably have not yet processed is difficult, Abu Saada said.But I know that there is no running away from it.
Graffiti set design adds punch to Cuba theater festival:::::HAVANA (Reuters) - A play parodying the lengths some Cubans will go to in order to earn a few tourist dollars set against the backdrop of socially critical graffiti is adding punch to Havanas annual theater festival.Public wait for the beginning of the spectacle "Guan meln!, tu meln!"beside a paint of Cuban street artist Yulier Rodriguez in a theatre in Havana, Cuba, October 20, 2017.REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini The first-time collaboration between veteran theater director Nelda Castillo, 64, and street artist Yulier Rodriguez, 27, underscores unease among some Cubans with the recent influx of tourists on the cash-strapped, Communist-run island.The interdisciplinary spectacle, Guan meln!, tu meln!, is also an example of the innovative ways Cubans are pushing the boundaries of critical expression.Rodriguezs eerie murals of creatures that look malnourished and malformed had become ubiquitous throughout Havana over the last three years, reflecting his view of the dark path upon which society was.But the artist said authorities detained him for two days in August and ordered him to stop painting in public spaces.Graffiti is seen as vandalism in many countries, although Rodriguez suspects authorities stopped him more because they did not like the content of his work.Now I am limited in what I can do in the streets, any space where I can exhibit my work becomes a space of resistance for me, said Rodriguez.Castillo, who often collaborates with visual artists, said she invited Rodriguez to paint the walls of the renowned El Ciervo Encantado theater because she knew his graffiti would enrich her play.Theatre director Nelda Castillo speaks to actors (not pictured) after the play "Guan meln!, tu meln!"beside a paint of Cuban street artist Yulier Rodriguez in a theatre in Havana, Cuba, October 20, 2017.REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini The piece is about the Cubans struggle in the street in the context of the new relations with the United States and the influx of American visitors, she said.His work is also about that struggle in the street.In the play that was first staged last year, a skinny and squat comic duo attempt frantically to entertain tourists arriving on cruise ships with Cuban tunes and to sell them outsized cigars and paper cones of peanuts.Slideshow (5 Images) A student with a manic fake smile, rudimentary English and a hypersexualised walk sells chocolate and offers salsa lessons, city tours and cabaret acts as way to make ends meet.In a beleaguered economy which shrank last year and where the average state salary is $30 a month, the tourist sector is a relative gold mine.Castillo said Rodriguezs graffiti - eerie, scared and hungry-looking creatures with four eyes, two gaping mouths or a crown of skulls - was like another protagonist in the play.Dialogue is always enriching as long as it is coherent, said Castillo.The two kept quiet about their collaboration until the day it opened to the public, at the start of the theater festival that runs from Oct. 20-29.Fingers crossed no one from up top orders the graffiti to be erased, said Rodriguez.

Italy gets back looted mosaic from Emperor Caligula's ship:::::ROME (Reuters) - A floor mosaic from one of Roman Emperor Caligulas opulent private ships, which was stolen after World War Two, is on its way back to Italy from the United States where it has been recovered from a private collection.The first century AD marble, serpentine and porphyry mosaic came from one of Caligulas ceremonial vessels, which was found at the bottom of Lake Nemi, near Rome, in the 1930s.The artifact, stolen from Italys Roman Ship Museum after the war, was seized by the New York district attorneys office from the collection of an Italian woman living in New York following an Italian police investigation.The United States have today given back to Italy several archaeological treasures that came from clandestine digs or thefts in our country, Culture Minister Dario Franceschini told a news conference in New York on Friday.They will all be returned to the places from where the criminals took them, he said.Among other Roman-era items recovered was a vase from the Puglia region dating to around 350 BC, which found its way to the New York Metropolitan Museum, and two amphorae from the 4th or 5th century BC.The vase was taken from an illegal dig in the 1980s.The artifacts presented at the news conference also included Roman coins, books and manuscripts.Caligula, whose real name was Gaius Julius Caesar, was emperor between AD 37 and AD 41.Historical accounts describe him as an insane, violent and sadistic man who ordered killings at a whim.Legend has it that he planned to make his horse Incitatus a consul.
'Stranger Things 2' gets darker in aftermath of death and Demogorgon:::::LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A year has passed since a supernatural demon terrorized the town of Hawkins, Indiana, but as Netflixs hit 1980s science fiction series Stranger Things returns for a second season on Friday, life has not returned to normal for the unlikely heroes.The adults and teenagers of Stranger Things 2 wrestle emotionally with the events of the first season: a town boys disappearance, a death, a mysterious girl with superpowers and a decaying parallel universe called the Upside Down.We wanted that trauma to really run through the entire season so its about these characters confronting the horrors, said Matt Duffer, one half of the Duffer Brothers, the twins who created the show.All nine episodes of Stranger Things 2 will be released on Friday.At the center of the show are its young teenage breakout stars.Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) suffers worsening visions of the Upside Down after being rescued, forcing his friends to try to find a way to defeat the demon known as Demogorgon.Eleven, the innocent, tormented young girl with superpowers played by Emmy-nominated 13-year-old Millie Bobby Brown, is believed dead and is in hiding, staying with the towns police chief, Jim Hopper.Frustrated at being kept away from her friends, Eleven clashes with Hopper (David Harbour) and embarks on a mission to find her mother and finally find a home.Cast members (L-R) Caleb McLaughlin, Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapp and Gaten Matarazzo pose at the premiere for the second season of the television series "Stranger Things" in Los Angeles, California, U.S., October 26, 2017.REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni We wanted (Eleven) to go through her own journey in a way that was much more personal to her and wasnt tied to the boys, Matt Duffer said.We wanted her to go through a journey of self-discovery without the help of anyone else.Stranger Things has become a phenomenon for Netflix Inc, landing Emmy wins and drawing a cadre of obsessed fans who launched a viral online campaign, #JusticeForBarb, sparked by the gruesome demise of supporting character Barb Holland.Slideshow (14 Images) The second season ramps up the quest to bring closure to her death while introducing new characters and expanding the story geographically.The Duffers said they anticipate five seasons to bring Stranger Things to a conclusion.It was important to us this season to start to move out of Hawkins and to introduce this world, said Ross Duffer.Its such a fine line and its difficult and obviously sequels always feel this way because people want some of the same - thats why they liked it in the first place - but you dont want to just go in circles, he added.
Harvey Weinstein sues The Weinstein Co for company records:::::WILMINGTON, Del.(Reuters) - The Weinstein Co film company on Thursday was sued by its founder and former co-chairman Harvey Weinstein who is seeking information that could help defend himself against sexual assault allegations, and also help defend the company against potential liability.FILE PHOTO: Harvey Weinstein, of the Weinstein Co arrives at the Sun Valley Inn in Sun Valley, Idaho July 9, 2009.REUTERS/Rick Wilking In the lawsuit filed in Delawares Court of Chancery, Weinstein said he needed the information to prevent the company, in which he and his brother remain the largest investors, from being harmed by unjustified legal settlements.Representatives for Weinstein and The Weinstein Co did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The Weinstein Co has been one of Hollywoods most influential forces since its launch in October 2005 and has produced and distributed films including The Kings Speech and Silver Linings Playbook.The New York Times reported earlier this month that Weinstein, 65, had reached eight previously undisclosed settlements with women who accused him of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact.The New Yorker magazine reported that 13 women had claimed that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them.On Tuesday, an actress who accuses Weinstein of sexually assaulting her filed a negligence lawsuit against the company, saying it was aware Weinstein had previously settled other allegations of harassment and assault and should not have let her meet privately with the movie producer in a hotel room.The New York City Police Department has said it is investigating an allegation of sexual assault by Weinstein in 2004.The Los Angeles Police Department also said earlier this month that it is investigating a 2013 sexual assault allegation against movie producer Harvey Weinstein.Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.In Thursdays lawsuit, Weinstein said he also wants to investigate whether confidential information was leaked to the press, if the Weinstein Companys board and executives wrongly terminated him as chief executive, and if the board is pursuing a fire sale of the company, according to the complaint and attached exhibits.Mr. Weinstein believes that his email account -- which is the only one he used throughout the time he was employed by the company -- will contain information exonerating him, and therefore the company, from claims that may be asserted against them, Weinsteins lawyer wrote in an email to the Weinstein company, according to Thursdays filing.The New York attorney general has opened an investigation into sexual harassment and possible violations of civil rights laws at the Weinstein Company also.
George H.W. Bush apologizes after actress accuses him of groping:::::LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Former U.S. President George H.W.Bush apologized through a spokesman on Wednesday for what an actress described as a sexual assault but which Bush said was intended as a friendly pat and a joke to put her at ease during a picture-taking session.Heather Lind, who starred in the AMC cable television networks historical drama Turn: Washingtons Spies, accused Bush of groping her as they posed for photos together with his wife and others during a promotional event for the show in 2014.The allegation surfaced in an Instagram post from Lind featuring a photograph of Bush, 93, shaking hands with former President Barack Obama during an appearance of all five living former presidents at Saturdays hurricane fund-raising benefit.In the post, Lind, 34, said that seeing that photo reminded her of her own meeting with the 41st president three years earlier, when, according to her, he sexually assaulted me while I was posing for a similar photo.He didnt shake my hand.He touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side, Lind wrote.He told me a dirty joke.And then, all the while being photographed, touched me again.FILE PHOTO: Former U.S. President George H.W.Bush arrives on the field to do the coin toss ahead of the start of Super Bowl LI between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons in Houston, Texas, U.S., February 5, 2017.REUTERS/Adrees Latif Lind said the former first lady rolled her eyes as if to say, not again.'The Instagram post, since deleted, carried the MeToo social media hashtag spawned by the recent outpouring of sexual assault and sexual harassment accusations leveled against former Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein.Weinstein has denied engaging in non-consensual sex with anyone.Bushs spokesman Jim McGrath, issued a statement in response to Linds post that sought to explain the former presidents behavior as an attempt to make light of social awkwardness posed by his own physical disability during photo sessions.Confined to a wheelchair, as Bush has been for about the past five years, his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he take pictures, McGrath said.To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke - and on occasion, he has patted womens rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner.Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate, McGrath wrote.To anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely.Representatives for the actress were not immediately available for comment on the presidents response to her allegations, and it was not clear what prompted her to take down the Instagram post in question.
George Clooney rebukes racism in backdrop of thriller 'Suburbicon':::::LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - As one of Hollywoods most famous celebrities, George Clooney is not afraid to use his platform to speak up on issues close to him, but do not expect the actor to enter the political arena anytime soon.Ive always been around and involved in politics and believe that we all have to participate one way or another.But no, Im not going to get into it, Clooney told Reuters.I dont have to answer to any one person.I dont have to make compromises, I can point the finger at whomever I think needs to be pointed out, he added.In his latest film Suburbicon, Clooney directs a darkly humorous 1950s crime tale in which he points the finger squarely at the racial tensions in present-day America with a story about a black family moving into an affluent white suburban neighborhood as the backdrop.I think we should constantly be talking about whether or not building walls and scapegoating of minorities is how we want to be represented, Clooney said.I think the best way to do that is to remind ourselves that this is something that we do, that weve been doing probably since the beginning of our country and that we have to constantly litigate it, he added.Director George Clooney (R) and cast members Matt Damon and Julianne Moore pose for a portrait while promoting the movie "Suburbicon" in Los Angeles, California, U.S., October 22, 2017.Picture taken October 22, 2017.REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni Suburbicon, out in U.S. theaters on Friday, follows Gardner Lodge (Matt Damon) in the aftermath of a terrifying break-in at his suburban home, which results in the suspicious death of his wife.As the investigation into the tragedy deepens, Gardner and his wifes twin sister Maggie (Julianne Moore) find themselves in a situation quickly escalating beyond their control.Slideshow (2 Images) This was probably the darkest role Ive ever had a chance to play, which is very liberating, Damon said.Clooney said that while there are people much better qualified to tell the story of African-Americans in mid-20th century suburbia, he wanted to use the story of the Mayers family - based on a real black family that moved into the all-white suburb of Levittown, Pennsylvania in 1957 - to shine a light on the absurdity of racism.In numerous scenes, the white inhabitants of the town say that while they do not want African-Americans to be oppressed, they do not want black families in their neighborhood.The pinnacle of white privilege is my character driving around the neighborhood on a bicycle covered in blood murdering people and nobodys looking at him because theyre all focused on the Mayers family and blaming them for all their problems, Damon said.
Fats Domino, rock 'n' roll pioneer, dead at 89:::::(Reuters) - Fats Domino, who brought rolling New Orleans boogie-woogie piano to early rock n roll in chart-topping hits such as Blueberry Hill and Aint That a Shame, has died at the age of 89, officials said on Wednesday.FILE PHOTO: U.S. musician Fats Domino tips his hat to the crowd during the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in New Orleans May 7, 2006.REUTERS/Lee Celano/File Photo Domino, who for a while was mistakenly thought to have been killed when Hurricane Katrina devastated his New Orleans neighborhood in 2005, died at home on Tuesday of natural causes, the Jefferson Parish Coroners Office said.As one of the pioneers of rock n roll in the 1950s, Domino sold 65 million records - more than anyone in that period except Elvis Presley, according to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.He had dozens of songs on the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts, including Blueberry Hill, Aint That a Shame, Blue Monday, Im Walkin, Whole Lotta Loving, Hello, Josephine, Walking to New Orleans, Im Gonna Be a Wheel Some Day and Let the Four Winds Blow.For lack of a better way of putting it, hes a living, walking legend among us in New Orleans, singer Irma Thomas told the New York Times in 2007.Between him and Louis Armstrong, they were the first big names to put us on the musical map.Antoine Dominique Domino was born on Feb. 26, 1928 in New Orleans and one of nine children.A brother-in-law taught him piano, leading to a style that mixed the classic New Orleans sound with blues, country and Cajun music.He was performing in nightclubs while still a teenager and soon teamed with trumpet player Dave Bartholomew, who would become his co-writer and producer and help refine his piano style.His nickname was attributed to his short, squatty stature, as well as a tribute to two other pianists - Fats Waller and New Orleans native Fats Pichon.Like contemporaries Little Richard and Chuck Berry, Domino was a black performer whose music crossed over to white audiences and helped shape early rock.His first hit was an R&B song, the autobiographical The Fat Man, recorded in 1949 and considered among the first songs in the rock n roll genre.DOMINO EFFECT FILE PHOTO: R&B legend Fats Domino performs at the 34th annual Jazz and Heritage Festival in New Orleans, April 24, 2003.REUTERS/David Rae Morris/File Photo Also like Little Richard, one of his biggest hits, Aint That a Shame, was later recorded by Pat Boone, a white singer, whose version received more radio airplay.A live version of the song by the rock band Cheap Trick was a hit in 1978.Domino would be a huge influence on rockers who came after him - John Lennon told a New York radio station that Aint That a Shame was the first song he learned to play - but his prominence began to wane after the British invasion and other forms of rock took root in the 1960s.Harry Connick Jr., from a later generation of New Orleans musicians, said on Twitter, You helped pave the way for New Orleans piano players... see you on top of that blueberry hill in the sky.Guitarist Vernon Reid of the band Living Color mourned Dominos death by tweeting, Rock & Roll lost part of its soul.In his later years Domino was reluctant to perform and rarely left his beloved hometown, but he did go to Indianola, Mississippi, in 2015 to play Amazing Grace at B.B.Kings funeral.Domino was a longtime resident of New Orleans Ninth Ward - the section of the city hit hardest by Katrinas floodwaters - and had resisted early pleas to evacuate as the hurricane approached.For a time he was believed to have died in the flooding and the words R.I.P.Fats You will be missed were spray-painted on his house, which was flooded up to the roof.It was later learned that Domino and his family had been rescued by boat and taken to the refugee center set up at the Superdome in the city before going to Baton Rouge.They lost most of their possessions in the flood but managed to save Dominos couch, which was custom-made from the rear end of a vintage pink Cadillac.After Katrina, he moved to a New Orleans suburb to live with his daughter.The Recording Industry of America late gave Domino reproductions to replace the 20 gold record awards he lost.His Grammy Awards also were replaced and President George W. Bush visited Domino to give him a new National Medal of the Arts.Domino titled his 2006 album Alive and Kickin and proceeds went to help rebuild New Orleans and preserve its musical heritage.Domino was among the inaugural class of artists inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.
Weinstein Co faces lawsuit over Weinstein sexual assault claims:::::(A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to Indiana University as the University of Indiana) FILE PHOTO: Film producer Harvey Weinstein attends the 2016 amfAR New York Gala at Cipriani Wall Street in Manhattan, New York, U.S. on February 10, 2016.REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo By Daniel Wiessner (Reuters) - An actress who claims she was sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein has filed a negligence lawsuit against his former company, in what may be the first civil case brought against The Weinstein Co or Weinstein himself after reports that the Hollywood movie producer sexually harassed or assaulted women.The complaint, filed by Dominique Huett in state court in Los Angeles on Tuesday, says the company was aware that Weinstein had previously settled other allegations of harassment and assault and should not have let the movie producer meet privately with Huett in a hotel room in 2010.Representatives for the Weinstein Company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A spokeswoman for Harvey Weinstein said any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.The New York Times reported on Oct. 5 that Weinstein had reached eight previously undisclosed settlements with women who accused him of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact.The New Yorker magazine reported that 13 women had claimed that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them.The New York City Police Department has said it is investigating an allegation of sexual assault by Weinstein in 2004.The Los Angeles Police Department said earlier this month that it is investigating a 2013 sexual assault allegation against Weinstein.Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.However, in California, negligence claims must be brought within a two-year statute of limitations.Jennifer Drobac, a law professor at Indiana University and an expert in sexual harassment law, said that Huett will have a tough time proving her case given the time limit in the statute of limitations has expired.But in Huetts lawsuit, the actress says she could not have known about the alleged pattern of harassment by Weinstein, or the companys knowledge of it until media reports surfaced earlier this month.Drobac argued though that Huett could have sued Weinstein after the alleged incident, which might have led her to discover more about Weinsteins past behavior and what the company knew about it.Huett played a minor role in a 2015 episode of CBS television police drama Blue Bloods, according to the International Movie Database.
U.S. rapper Eminem wins copyright case against NZ political ads:::::SYDNEY (Reuters) - A New Zealand political party has been ordered to pay more than $400,000 to U.S. rapper Eminem for using music similar to his 2002 hit Lose Yourself in a television commercial to help win a national election.FILE PHOTO - Musician Eminem attends the premiere of "Southpaw" in New York July 20, 2015.REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo The track, played during the National Partys successful 2014 election campaign and titled Eminem Esque, was found by a New Zealand court to have substantially copied Lose Yourself.The National Party used the song 186 times during the campaign before taking the ad off the air, the court said.This decision is a warning to sound-alike music producers and their clients everywhere, Adam Simpson, director of Simpsons Solicitors, who acted for Eminems music company, Eight Mile Style, said in a statement.The National Party said the music was licensed with one of New Zealands main industry copyright bodies, the Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners Society (AMCOS).Being licensed and available for purchase, and having taken advice from our suppliers, the party believed the purchase was legal, National Party President Peter Goodfellow said in a statement.The party is now considering the implications of the judgment and the next steps.We already have a claim against the suppliers and licensors of the track.The court found Eight Mile Style was entitled to damages of NZ$600,000 ($413,000) with interest from June 28, 2014.We anticipate that all the defendants will meet to discuss the implications of the decision in the very near future, copyright body AMCOS said in an email, hailing the decision as an important first step towards resolution of the matter.The publisher had exclusive control over the song, and rarely gave permission for its use in advertising, the court said.It was no coincidence that the works sounded the same and the undeniable inference to be drawn from the evidence is that the composer of Eminem Esque had Lose Yourself in front of him at the time of composition, it added.
Thor finds his funny side as apocalypse nears in 'Ragnarok':::::LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The end of the world is nigh, and Marvels brawny superhero Thor finds himself hammerless and held hostage on a kitsch futuristic planet light years away from his home, in a sequel that revamps the slightly dim-witted Norse god with irreverent humor.Thor: Ragnarok, the third installment of Marvels standalone Thor film franchise, sees Chris Hemsworth reprise his role as the superhero and places Thor well outside of his comfort zone, relying on others to help him save the world.I was a bit sick of the Thor Id created, Chris Hemsworth told Reuters.I think that I have an obligation to change it up, you know, and give people something different, something new, he added.Ragnarok, in international theaters this week and on Nov. 3 in North America, opens with Thor hanging from a dungeon ceiling in a cave talking to a skeleton, and as things only get more bizarre, Hemsworth showcases his comedic timing with off-the-cuff jokes.Hes literally playing himself, director Taika Waititi said.You look at Chris, he looks like Thor weirdly, and hes funny, charming, beautiful guy, lovely guy and loves hammers ... he is that character.World Premiere of Thor: Ragnarok Los Angeles, California, U.S., 11/10/2017 - (L-R) Jeff Goldblum, Tessa Thompson, Taika Waititi, Chris Hemsworth, Cate Blanchett, Tom Hiddleston and Mark Ruffalo.REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni After reuniting with his mischievous and devious brother Loki, Thor discovers they have a sister, the formidable Hela (Cate Blanchett), who has her eyes on destroying his celestial home of Asgard.Thor loses his magic power-wielding hammer and is cast away by his sister to an unknown futuristic planet and held hostage by an eccentric Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), forced to fight his fellow Avenger, the Hulk.Slideshow (2 Images) Ragnarok, part of Walt Disney Cos Marvel film franchise, is by far the biggest production for New Zealand director Waititi, who previously wrote and directed small, independent fare such as 2010s Boy and 2016s Hunt For the Wilderpeople.But the comedy in Ragnarok is very much a trademark of Waititi, who likes to find comedy often by placing unlikely characters in mundane settings, such as vampires sharing an apartment in 2014s cult hit What We Do in the Shadows.Waititi said in fact that the vampire mockumentary may be remade into an American TV series.I love the idea of ... Hulk and Thor (sitting) on the bed making up after an argument -- like, you dont see that in these films, Waititi said.The fact that they allowed me to put that kind of stuff in this movie is amazing and thats why I think it feels like a Taika film.
Robert Guillaume, star of TV's 'Benson,' dies at age 89:::::, (Reuters) - Two-time Emmy Award-winning actor Robert Guillaume, who became one of the most prominent black actors on U.S. television playing the cantankerous title character in the hit 1980s series Benson, died of complications from prostate cancer on Tuesday, his wife said.He was 89.FILE PHOTO: Actor Robert Guillaume who starred on the television series "Benson," "Soap," and Sports Night" poses as he arrives for the ABC television networks 50th anniversary in Hollywood, California, U.S., March 16, 2003.REUTERS/Fred Prouser The gravelly voiced Guillaume, who thrived in Broadway musicals before starring on the TV series Soap and its spinoff Benson, died at his Los Angeles home, his wife Donna Brown Guillaume said in a statement.It is not known how long he had been battling cancer.Robert Guillaume first played sarcastic and irascible butler Benson DuBois on the over-the-top soap opera parody series Soap, which debuted in 1977 and also starred Katherine Helmond, Richard Mulligan and Billy Crystal.His work on that show won Guillaume won the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series in 1979.His character became so popular that the ABC network created Benson for him and that series ran for seven seasons from 1979 to 1986.Guillaumes character had been a butler on Soap but on Benson he served as a state governors director of household affairs, then state budget director, lieutenant governor and candidate for governor.Guillaume won the Emmy for outstanding lead actor in a comedy series in 1985 for Benson, the last of six times that he was nominated for an Emmy playing the character.He became the first black actor to win that award.In accepting the Emmy, he joked, Id like to thank Bill Cosby for not being here, referring to the fact that the star of The Cosby Show and the leading contender for the award had earlier taken himself out of the running for it.Guillaume said he was sensitive about not playing his character as a racial stereotype and was pleased that Benson evolved from being a butler to a political power player - albeit one that retained the same crotchety attitude.UPWARD MOBILITY In all honesty and candor and modesty, I always wanted the character to have that kind of upward mobility because it mirrored the American dream, Guillaume told the Washington Post in 1985.When I took a role like Benson, which was in that time-honored sense another black person in a servants role, I only took the part because it was a good part, it was a part in which I thought, with my own set of ideas about things, I could say something.And indeed that has been the case.We saw Benson was in no way anyones inferior.After the end of Benson, he starred in the short-lived sitcom The Robert Guillaume Show in 1989, as well as the series Pacific Station (1991-1992) and Sports Night (1998-2000).He suffered a stroke in 1999 on the set of Sports Night but was able to return to his role within weeks.On film, Guillaume provided the voice for the mandrill Rafiki in Disneys animated 1994 hit The Lion King and appeared with Morgan Freeman in the 1989 drama Lean on Me.In 1977, he earned a Tony Award nomination for his role in the Broadway musical Guys and Dolls.He also had leading roles on stage in Purlie and Golden Boy.Born Robert Peter Williams on Nov. 30, 1927, he changed his name to Robert Guillaume to make it more distinctive (Guillaume is French for William).He was raised by his strong-willed grandmother in a St. Louis slum after his alcoholic mother gave up her children and his father abandoned the family.After a brief military stint, he worked a series of jobs including as a trolley driver to save money for college.He studied music at Washington University in St. Louis, where he was noticed by a Hungarian opera singer who helped him get a scholarship to the 1957 Aspen Music Festival and School in Colorado.That was followed by an apprenticeship at a theater in Cleveland where he made his professional debut.

'I'm just like you': Rose McGowan gives rousing speech at Women's Convention:::::(CNN) Rose McGowan wants you to know that sexual assault and harassment is not isolated to Hollywood, and it is not something we can ignore any longer.The actress gave a rousing speech on Friday at The Women's Convention in Detroit, Michigan, where thousands of attendees gathered for workshops, keynote speeches and music.The event is an offshoot of the Women's March protests that swept the nation in January."I have been silenced for 20 years," McGowan said."I have been slut shamed, I've been harassed, I've been maligned.And you know what, I'm just like you."It was McGowan's first public appearance since charges of sexual harassment came to light three weeks ago against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.McGowan is one of dozens of women who have accused Weinstein of sexual assault and harassment.Earlier this month, she took to Twitter to accuse the now disgraced Hollywood mogul of raping her.Weinstein, through his spokesperson, has denied "any allegations of non-consensual sex."The fallout from the scandal has been swift.The mega-producer lost both his job and his wife within days of two exposs that detailed decades of alleged sexual misconduct.The stories have also sparked a #MeToo movement among women who used the hashtag to share their stories of assault and harassment at the hands of men.On Friday, the founder of #MeToo, Tarana Burke, introduced McGowan who said, "We are all 'Me toos.'"The actress said that what happened to her behind the scenes has happened to others, and it "cannot stand.It will not stand.""I came to be a voice for all of us who've been told we are nothing," McGowan said."For all of us who have been looked down on.For all of us who have been grabbed by the motherf***ing p***y."McGowan cautioned against accepting that alleged bad behavior in Hollywood is "an isolated thing.""It's not," she said."It is the messaging system for your mind.It is the mirror you are given to look into.This what you are as a woman, this is what you are as a man, this is what you are as a boy, girl, gay, straight, transgender but it's all told through 96% males in the Directors Guild of America."She continued with her speech saying,"That statistic has not changed since 1946.""So we are given one view and I know the men that are behind that view and they should not be in your mind and they should not be in mine.It's time to clean house," she said.(According to the DGA, 84.9% of its director members are men.When including production managers and other associate directing team members, the Guild's makeup is 76.6% male.)McGowan said the past few weeks have been difficult and "triggering" for her because of news coverage around the Weinstein scandal.When asked by the local media after her speech why she didn't say Weinstein's name, McGowan said, "It's a horrible name to say and a horrible name to hear and it is a name that has haunted me."She's said she is no different than any other rape victim.It is not the shame of women, she said."The scarlet letter is theirs, it is not ours" McGowan said."We are pure, we are strong, we are brave and we will fight. "Later, McGowan appeared on a panel with fellow actress and friend Amber Tamblyn.McGowan spoke of issues in their industry that continue to permeate including "when writers in Hollywood use rape as a plot device because they can't imagine that women can't get strong otherwise.""I've asked numerous times to the writers of the Guild of America to speak to their member body about just reframing things," she said."Because they are also a product of culture, but they are regurgitating culture and making culture.So, it's this vicious circle."Tamblyn said it's something she and McGowan have discussed."For us, there's always just been a sort of quiet conversation happening in our business, certainly with friends, family and co-workers, about the things that we know about, but also the things that we know are secretiveand what's at stake when you come forward and speak about those things," Tamblyn said."And usually what's at stake is a complete destruction of your character, especially in our business."According to its site, the Women's Convention will bring together all genders "for a weekend of workshops, strategy sessions, inspiring forums and intersectional movement building to continue the preparation going into the 2018 midterm elections."

Heart, he took a deep breath and fired off 36 frames.It wasnt until he developed the film the next day that he saw the amazing results.It was unbelievable, he said.Not only did he do it.He almost over-gave this.Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, 1982 Sharon is a tough cookie and I love her, and she and Ozz have both always been great to me, Preston said.They had me come out and shoot their wedding (in Hawaii).Ive done a certain amount of weddings in my time.We had some funny pictures to send out the magazines.And Sharon never had any problem going along with the jokes.Stevie Nicks, 1981 I love anyone with a great sense of humor, and Stevie was funny as hell, Preston wrote.In fact, absolutely hysterical, with more charisma in her little finger than most people can ever dream of having.For this shoot, an assignment for People magazine, Preston photographed Nicks on the rooftop of her condo in Venice Beach, California.Her dress was perfect to catch the wind and make it look like she was a bird about to fly away.But what you dont see is one of Prestons assistants, lying flat on his stomach, holding one of Nicks ankles to make sure she doesnt actually fly away.She was right at the edge of the roof, and it got so windy and dangerous I became very concerned she would fly right over the side of the building which would have made it a very bad day for the people in Time Lifes insurance department, Preston said.Besides, I didnt want to be in the grocery store looking at the next cover of the Enquirer with the headline Rock Star Falls Six Stories During Bizarre Beachfront Photo Shoot!The Jackson 5, 1974 Preston shot many photos of the Jacksons for teenybopper magazines.He took this shot through the glass as they recorded at Motowns studios in Los Angeles.Michael even then, if he wasnt the star he was certainly being groomed to be the star, Preston said.And then he became even bigger than anyone ever imagined.I shot him many times over the years.When he got older, he remembered me and he was always very sweet.He always had a sense of how can I put this?pressure on him.That was hard to explain.Like the weight of the world was on his shoulders deep inside and you knew there was something going on but you obviously werent privy to what it was.And I always found that interesting about him.Elton John, 1974 When Elton first burst through, Preston said, every tour he did got more and more flamboyant in terms of the show and his costumes.Eltons coming to town.Whats he going to wear this time?You know, that kind of thing.And I think it probably peaked around that time I think I shot that picture.I was in the corridor in front of the dressing rooms, and he just popped out.He was going on stage, I didnt realize he was, and I had a Nikon with a 24mm (lens) on the body.And I shot from the hip.Its a true grab shot, and it just turned out the framing was perfect.Sinead OConnor, 1990 OConnor made People magazines list for the years 25 Most Intriguing People, and Preston was assigned to get shots of her for that issue.I dont know how she is now, but she was very serious, he recalled.And I have a slightly snarky sense of humor.Preston was tasked with getting some light-hearted pictures, and he considered it a breakthrough when he finally got her to smile in one of them.She was a really tough one to crack, he said.I mean I did everything I could but stand on my head and spit out nickels.She was as serious in life as she is in this photo.The Traveling Wilburys, 1988 Preston had photographed Tom Petty before, and he remembers Petty calling him out of the blue and asking if hed swing by for a photo shoot.(Petty) puts me on the phone with some guy named George.Hello Neal, this is George and the address is And as hes telling me the address with a distinctly Liverpudlian accent I realize its George Harrison.I remember nothing after that point of the conversation, laughed Preston, who fell in love with music after seeing the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964.I know (Harrison) gave me the address.I know we got there.I remember nothing else.When Preston got to the house in Encino, California, he was amused at how everyone in the supergroup sort of walked on eggshells around Bob Dylan.The shoot was dependent on Dylans mood and when he was ready.Ive been around Bob before, and Bobs a good guy.But, you know, hes Bob Dylan, Preston said.We all have our good days and bad days in our lives.Once it started, the shoot lasted about an hour or so.Orbison died later that year.It was never meant to be the iconic Wilbury shoot, Preston said.David Bowie, 1973 Its been a rough time for Preston as hes watched many of his friends and favorite subjects pass away in the last few years.Every one of those (deaths) takes a chunk of my heart, he said.Its not good.And they all really upset me.(The death of) Keith Emerson really upset me.Glenn Frey really upset me.Tom (Petty), a couple of weeks ago, really upset me.David Bowie I had shot eight or 10 times but never as a one-on-one thing.And even that chips away another 3% of my heart.And its just weird that (these deaths) happen in such rapid fire.The Clash, 1982 I was working for The Who at Shea Stadium in 82 and The Clash opened, Preston said.I was standing backstage, and up drives this car and four guys pop out and I didnt even realize who it was until they popped out.Sid Vicious, 1978 This shot was taken on the last show of the Sex Pistols US tour, Preston said.Just hours later, the punk band would break up.They went back to the hotel, and my girlfriend at the time told me she just was down the hallway and she heard that they had broken up, Preston said.He said the necklace Vicious is wearing here is on display at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.A guy bought it at auction who works for the Hard Rock, and he used my picture in back of it.So if anyone wants to see the necklace, its in Vegas.Madonna, 1990 I would call this Madonna having a private moment in front of 80,000 people.And leave it at that, Preston said.The photo was taken in Tokyo during the pop stars Blonde Ambition World Tour.Kiss, 1976 This holiday-themed shoot was an assignment for Creem magazine.It didnt go according to plan.I was in the next room grabbing a different lens when I heard a sort of flat thud come from the set, Preston wrote.It sounded like someone had dropped a couple of sandbags on the floor.I was worried that something had fallen on one of the band members, and I immediately ran back in and found that the inevitable had happened: Ace Frehley had passed out cold, face down in a snowdrift.Unfortunately it was a highly toxic snowdrift because the fake snow was made out of some sort of chemical that was not to be inhaled (that particular brand of prop snow is not made any more just for that reason).He had taken a few big whiffs of the stuff and started coughing uncontrollably.I saw a little blood come up and I knew that was a wrap for the day.Dr. Dre, 1994 My favorite photographs, not necessarily mine, are photographs of people in the recording studio, Preston said.To me, the recording studio is kind of a secret place that Im not really supposed to be.... Its where (musicians) make their magic.To me, its reverential.Its almost hallowed ground.And to this day I always feel a little bit of an outsider in a recording studio.Rod Stewart, 1996 Stewart dressed in drag for his music video If We Fall in Love Tonight.Preston also took some photos of Stewart getting made up.I like that he looked like an aging Miss Moneypenny from a James Bond movie, Preston said.Like if the original Miss Moneypenny had come back 40 years later to play Miss Moneypenny, thats what she would have looked like.Ray Charles, 1981 Charles had a braille chess set, and Preston was happy to take him on.The game didnt last very long.Charles won in seven moves.He knew he was going to beat me, OK?He knew it, Preston recalled.Now Im not Bobby Fischer, but Ive been playing chess since I was a kid.Yeah, I was a little distracted because I wanted to make sure I could shoot, but I was fairly certain I could beat Ray Charles, with all due respect to everyone out there.And he hammered me.Janis Joplin, 1970 Preston was only 18 when he shot this photo of Joplin performing at the Transcontinental Pop Festival in Toronto.I like Janis Joplin, I love the Big Brother (and the Holding Company) album, but I wasnt a mega fan and I was kind of shocked at how unhealthy she looked, Preston said.She sounded great, but she did not look good.And I think that she did about seven or eight more gigs in her life before she passed away.Joplin was 27 years old when she died from a heroin overdose.Leonard Cohen, 1996 This was a People (magazine) assignment, and the assignment was to go up to Mount Baldy which is a couple hours outside of LA for this monastery where (singer) Leonard Cohen was a monk, Preston said.It was a far cry from Prestons usual shoots.So we get up there, and its very nice.But hes a monk!I mean hes not playing a monk in a movie.Hes a monk, hes living the sterile life and everything.Its not like he didnt talk to me, but hes really a monk except that sometimes on weekends hed go down the hill and play a couple of gigs.It was a little odd.Queen, 1981 Soldiers pose with Freddie Mercury, center, and other members of the rock band Queen during a tour of South America.The band performed in massive soccer stadiums.The fans there treated the band like they were the Beatles, Preston said.I mean, it was unbelievable.Kids yelling all night in front of the hotels Freddie, Freddie, Freddie.It was insane.Peter Frampton, 1976 To the real true rock fan, the Holy Grail you know, the top of the mountain, the summit is to go backstage, to go to the dressing room, for whatever reason, Preston said.Most people would rather just go backstage than see the damn show.Walking through an audience with a pass around my neck, its kind of a stone-cold aphrodisiac, and if you throw a Nikon on my shoulder its even more so.And look, lets be honest Ive been offered all kinds of things to take someone backstage, be it cash, merchandise, guitars, cameras, drugs or sex, you name it.And Im not going to say I havent accepted a couple of the latter.But dont forget youre there to do a job.You have to do the job.You cant let any of that stuff interfere with your job.
Iraq war and sobering aftermath come to movies, TV:::::(CNN) Are audiences ready to relive the early days of the Iraq war, as well as its painful aftermath, in unflinching fashion?That will be tested over the coming weeks, by the movies "Thank You For Your Service" and, to a lesser degree, "Last Flag Flying," and the eight-part National Geographic miniseries "The Long Road Home.""American Sniper," the 2014 film starring Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle, was obviously a huge hit.These projects, however, bring different perspectives to the heroism and sacrifice of those serving, while grappling with a long cinematic history of movies grappling with the aftermath of America's wars."Thank You For Your Service" --written and directed by "Sniper" scribe Jason Hall, and also inspired by a true story -- is a much bleaker account of military men returning home, starring Miles Teller and newcomer Beulah Koale as army infantrymen struggling to adjust while plagued by memories of what happened during their tours.Of the three, the most impactful is actually the most peripherally connected: "Last Flag Flying," based on Darryl Ponicsan's novel, about three former Vietnam buddies -- played by Bryan Cranston, Laurence Fishburne and Steve Carell -- reunited by a tragedy during the first year of the Iraq war.(The book was written as a sequel to Ponicsan's "The Last Detail" but has been stripped of that aspect in director Richard Linklater's adaptation.)" allowfullscreen> "Thank You For Your Service" falls into a long tradition of movies exploring the post-war experience, from "The Best Years of Our Lives" following World War II to "Coming Home" and "The Deer Hunter" after Vietnam.Despite the film's earnestness and strong performances, the drama suffers somewhat from those inevitable comparisons.At the same time, it highlights the struggles facing modern-day warriors, from indifferent treatment by government agencies to the painful re-acclimation of those coming home and their families alike.Based on David Finkel's book, whose title is tinged with irony, "Thank You For Your Service" deals head-on with post-war trauma, including suicidal tendencies, survivor's guilt and the feeling, as one of the soldiers puts it, that "I don't belong here."The confusion extends to their spouses, with Haley Bennett playing the wife of Teller's character, who keeps urging him to open up to her.(Amy Schumer has a small but significant role as a war widow.)Billed as a "global miniseries event," "The Long Road Home" engages in a less challenging balancing act, filtering the struggle and sacrifice of military personnel and their families through one harrowing battle that, given reports about Iraq being pacified, nobody saw coming."He really thought the fighting was over," says an army wife played by Kate Bosworth, to which another replies, "We all did."Eight hours, frankly, stretches the story in a way that creates uneven patches.Although it allows more time to develop characters and their histories -- including flashbacks before their deployment, and jumping ahead beyond it -- those arcs perhaps cast too wide a net, diluting the powerful moments by creating more space to drift into melodrama.Michael Kelly, Jason Ritter and Sarah Wayne Callies are among the other recognizable faces in the sizable ensemble.Taken together, these dramatizations assemble a cohesive portrait of the general chaos of war -- and what transpired in Iraq in particular -- and its aftermath, including the ripple effects across families and communities.There are, surely, sobering and worthwhile lessons there, and each war deserves its own stories.The question is whether "Thank You For Your Service" and "The Long Road Home" -- however noble their intentions -- are the most effective means of dispensing them."Thank You For Your Service" opens Oct. 27 in the U.S.It's rated R. "Last Flag Flying" opens Nov. 3 in the U.S.It's rated R. "The Load Road Home" premieres Nov. 7 at 9 p.m. on National Geographic Channel.

Rachel McAdams, Selma Blair accuse James Toback of sexual harassment:::::(CNN) Selma Blair and Rachel McAdams are the latest women to accuse director James Toback of sexual harassment.In separate interviews with Vanity Fair , Blair and McAdams recounted their alleged experiences with Toback, whom they'd met in business meetings years ago.Toback is best known as the screenwriter and director behind films such as "The Pick-up Artist," "The Gambler," and "Bugsy."Blair alleges that in their meeting, Toback asked her to audition for him naked and then requested that she let him rub himself against her."I felt disgust and shame, and like nobody would ever think of me as being clean again after being this close to the devil," Blair told Vanity Fair."His energy was so sinister."Actress Selma Blair She also claims he threatened her with violence if she told anyone about her experience.McAdams, too, met with Toback under the guise that they'd be talking about work, in particular, a role in 2001's "Harvard Man," which Toback wrote.Instead, McAdams said their meeting was filled with inappropriate comments from Toback that left her feeling uncomfortable."This has been such a source of shame for me -- that I didn't have the wherewithal to get up and leave," she said."I was very lucky that I left and he didn't actually physically assault me in any way."The Los Angeles Times was the first to bring allegations against Toback to light in a story published Sunday.To date, more than 200 women have accused Toback of inappropriate conduct, according to LA Times writer Glenn Whipp.Toback's agent, Jeff Berg, said Sunday he would pass a request for a comment on to his client.Berg has since ceased representing Toback.The director, 72, denied the allegations when contacted by the Times, the newspaper said.Toback told the paper he had never met any of the women -- or if he did meet them, it "was for five minutes and (he had) no recollection."He said that for the last 22 years, it was "biologically impossible" for him to take part in the behavior the women described in the article, saying he had diabetes and a heart condition requiring medication, the Los Angeles Times reported.He declined to elaborate.CNN has contacted representatives for McAdams and Blair for comment on this story.After the LA Times first wrote of multiple women sharing similar stories about Toback, "Guardians of the Galaxy" director James Gunn posted on his official Facebook page that when he was living in New York City in the 1990s, Toback "was EVERYWHERE.""I have personally met at least FIFTEEN WOMEN, probably more, who say that he's accosted them in NYC," Gunn wrote."He essentially goes up to women and says, 'Hey, I'm James Toback, and I'm a famous director, and I feel like there's a connection between us.'Then he shows them some article on himself or some other artifact to prove he is who he is, and tries to get them to go somewhere else with him."And Gunn wasn't alone in speaking out.Oscar-winning actress Julianne Moore shared on Twitter her story of Toback allegedly propositioning her in the 1980s."James Toback approached me in the 80's on Columbus Ave with the same language -- wanted me to audition, come to his apt," she tweeted."I refused.One month later he did it again with the EXACT same language.I said don't u remember u did this before?"@GlennWhipp 1 - #JamesToback approached me in the 80's on Columbus Ave with the same language - wanted me to audition, come to his apt.Julianne Moore (@_juliannemoore) October 24, 2017 @GlennWhipp 2.I refused.One month later he did it again with the EXACT same language.I said don't u remember u did this before?Julianne Moore (@_juliannemoore) October 24, 2017 "Today" cohost Natalie Morales wrote in a tweet that she, too, could be added to the list of women who allege run-ins with Toback."Glenn add one more," she wrote, referring to Whipp."Exact same playbook by James Toback when I encountered him near Central Park."CNN's Darran Simon and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this story.

Anna Wintour names who she would axe from Met Gala:::::Story highlights Wintour appeared on Corden's show She shut down a rumor that she dated Bob Marley (CNN) There are two things Anna Wintour apparently is not a fan of: fast food and the President of the United States.The legendary Vogue editor appeared Wednesday on "The Late Late Show with James Corden" and played "Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts," in which guests either have to answer an uncomfortable question or eat food they find disgusting.It turns out fast food is what turns Wintour off, so while there were weird options like bull penis, pickled pigs feet and a thousand-year-old egg, there were also items like a bacon cheeseburger in a donut, a chilli smoothie and bacon-wrapped pizza.Wintour opted to take a bite of the bacon-wrapped pizza rather than rank designers Tom Ford, Marc Jacobs and Ralph Lauren from best to worst."It's covered in grease," Wintour exclaimed after eating.Read More

'This Is Us': So, Jack has a [spoiler]:::::(CNN) Caution: This post contains spoilers about the latest episode of NBC's "This Is Us."This is...a twist.The latest episode of "This Is Us," titled "Brothers," may have appeared to draw its title from a storyline about Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) trying to get his sons, Randall and Kevin, to bond during a wilderness adventure, but the final minutes proved there was much more to it than that.It turns out, Jack has a brother.Or had.It remains unclear if his brother, whom Jack lovingly referred to as Nicky in a flashback, is still alive in the present-day.All we do know is what little we can gather from those key last moments from the episode.In the revealing scene, young Jack is in the front seat of his dad's car waiting to get on with their planned fishing trip.As he sits there impatiently, a small head wearing glasses pops up in the backseat.
Fats Domino dead at 89, medical examiner's office says:::::(CNN) Antoine "Fats" Domino, a titan of early rock 'n' roll whose piano-based hits -- such as "Ain't That a Shame," "Blueberry Hill" and "Blue Monday" -- influenced artists including Paul McCartney and Randy Newman, died Tuesday, an official said.Domino passed away due to natural causes, according to Mark Bone, chief investigator with the Jefferson Parish Medical Examiner's office in Louisiana.He was 89.With producer and arranger Dave Bartholomew, Domino cut a string of songs in the 1950s and early '60s that helped establish his hometown of New Orleans as a rock 'n' roll hotbed and made him one of the music's leading figures.The pair recorded "The Fat Man" in late 1949, a song considered one of the first rock 'n' roll records -- a group that includes Wynonie Harris' version of "Good Rockin' Tonight" (1947) and Jackie Brenston and Ike Turner's "Rocket 88" (1951) -- and followed it up with more than 30 Top 40 hits, including 23 gold singles.Starting in 1955, Domino was a regular on the national pop charts with songs that quickly became classics.Among the titles: "Ain't That a Shame" -- Domino's first crossover hit, which was watered down in a higher-charting version by Pat Boone -- "I'm Walkin'," "I'm Ready," "Valley of Tears," "I Want to Walk You Home" and "Walking to New Orleans."He sold more records than any 1950s figure except Elvis Presley , according to Rolling Stone.His version of "Blueberry Hill," a song written in 1940, topped out at No.2 on the Billboard charts and remains Domino's highest-charting record.Most of his hits were characterized by midtempo rhythms and Domino's distinctive triplet-based piano style, in which he hammered chords in groups of three in rollicking, melodic fashion.The arrangements usually included a saxophone solo and a lead guitar line that echoed the melody.The style was widely imitated.McCartney, a big Domino fan, wrote the Beatles song "Lady Madonna" in emulation of the pianist's work.(Domino returned the favor on his 1968 comeback album, "Fats Is Back," by covering the tune.)McCartney never grew out of his Domino fascination: Thirty years later, he did a version of the 1920s tune "Coquette" on his 1999 album "Run Devil Run" that was closely based on Domino's 1958 recording.Newman, deeply influenced by New Orleans music in general, often seemed to channeling Domino's sound -- if not his smiling attitude -- in such songs as "Mama Told Me Not to Come" and "Back on My Feet Again.""I was so influenced by Fats Domino that it's still hard for me to write a song that's not a New Orleans shuffle," Newman told The New York Times in 2008.He wrote the horn arrangements for "Fats Is Back."Domino covered Newman, too, with a recording of "Have You Seen My Baby."Domino's string of hits ended rather abruptly in the early '60s with a change of labels, from Imperial to ABC-Paramount.The latter forced him to record in Nashville, and the different atmosphere produced just one hit, a cover of the standard "Red Sails in the Sunset."But the good-natured Domino continued to tour and earn royalties, allowing him to live a comfortable lifestyle -- in New Orleans, of course, where his pink Cadillac could often be seen outside his Ninth Ward house.When Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, there was early concern that Domino, who had decided to stay in the Crescent City, had been killed by the storm.Someone even spray-painted "R.I.P.Fats -- You will be missed" on his house.However, he and his family had been rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter.His estate wasn't as fortunate: "We lost everything," he said at the time.Some of his belongings were replaced, including his gold records and a National Medal of Arts he'd been awarded in 1998 (from President Bill Clinton).His white Steinway was refurbished by the Louisiana Music Foundation, which put it on display in the French Quarter in 2013.Domino remained a steadfast part of the New Orleans scene.He played a sold-out show at Tipitina's nightclub in 2007 and appeared in an episode of the TV show "Treme" in 2012.Domino was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.

'Suburbicon' puts Coen stamp on George Clooney film:::::(CNN) Director George Clooney and star Matt Damon receive top billing, but "Suburbicon" is defined by the recognizable stamp of writers Joel and Ethan Coen, bringing a "Fargo"-like sensibility to this overly ambitious, fitfully successful attempt to filter the not-so-good-old-days of the 1950s through that prism.Suburbicon is the name of what's painted as an early version of a Spielberg-like planned community, birthed not long after World War II.A dozen years later, it's a happy little town -- at least, until an African-American family dares to move in, triggering panic among the populace and a community-wide campaign to drive them out.Yet while the residents focus on that perceived threat with mounting hysteria, they're missing the monsters living openly among them.And that plot begins with a home-invasion robbery involving Gardner Lodge (Damon), a pillar-of-the-community-type businessman, as well as his wife and sister-in-law (Julianne Moore, in a dual role) and young son Nicky (Noah Jupe).What ensues from there includes a cascading series of very Coen-esque twists (they share script credit with Clooney and his longtime collaborator Grant Heslov), in what frequently feels like a knowing homage to Alfred Hitchcock as well as such movies as "Double Indemnity."Moore, in particular, sinks her teeth into those nostalgic aspects of the role, while Oscar Isaac's later-act arrival as an insurance investigator breathes a welcome dose of life, and dark humor, into the proceedings."Suburbicon" gives away the game on its mystery a bit too soon, but it's still fun watching the various shoes drop.At the same time the concurrent thread, and its overt racial animus, offers a commentary on those pining for America's past, and a reminder that the black-and-white sitcoms of the '50s were monochromatic in more ways than one.Read More

'Stranger Things 2' builds on eerie nostalgia:::::(CNN) As part of a small subset of the pop-culture universe that thought "Stranger Things" was nice but nothing special, the second season provoked some trepidation.How can one characterize whether the Emmy-nominated Netflix phenom lives up to the hype when you felt it was overhyped in the first place?The result is a second season that replicates and, indeed, enhances the show's central charms -- its group of pubescent nerds, and nostalgic sense of time and place -- while still feeling less compelling with its teenage contingent.All told, it's an impressive follow-up, if one perhaps burdened by expectations raised by the over-the-moon reaction, to couch it in the fantasy of the era, to the debut."Stranger Things 2" has a fair amount of work to do given where season one ended, and that's accomplished pretty seamlessly.The five boys, for starters, have a new girl, Max (Sadie Sink), to trigger their curiosity and confound them, albeit without quite the impact as the telekinetically gifted Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), whose return has already been teased, and whose plot is easily the best thing about this second flight.Meanwhile, Nancy (Natalia Dyer) is still dealing with guilt regarding her friend Barb, Will (Noah Schnapp) is experiencing after-effects of his time in the Upside Down, and his mom Joyce (Winona Ryder) is wracked with concern about him, even as she tests whether it's possible to have a life of her own.The Duffer Brothers, who created the show, waste little time setting the scene, as the camera reveals Reagan/Bush yard signs and "Terminator" marquees.It's a time of "Ghostbusters" Halloween costumes, when strange doings around the town are seen by some (in what feels like a dual nod to "Red Dawn" and "The Americans") as evidence of a Soviet invasion.Read More
Bill O'Reilly dropped by another talent agency:::::Bill O'Reilly will be dropped by William Morris Endeavor, the talent agency that handles his book deals.In a statement provided to CNN, a spokesman for WME said that the agency will "no longer represent Bill O'Reilly for future deals.""It is our fiduciary responsibility to service the existing deals we have under contract, but we will not be working with him moving forward," the statement said.It is unclear how much longer that deal will last, but it's yet more professional fallout for O'Reilly after the New York Times reported last weekend on a $32 million settlement paid to a woman who accused him of sexual misconduct.On Monday, O'Reilly was dropped by United Talent Agency.His television agent there represented him for decades.The latest revelation came months after O'Reilly was sacked by Fox News, where he reigned as the top-rated host on cable news for years.The firing came after a separate Times story about multiple settlements paid to women who accused O'Reilly of sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior.O'Reilly has decried the reports as an effort to remove him from the marketplace.His representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The decision by WME could have implications on a major part of the O'Reilly enterprise.With several bestselling titles to his name, O'Reilly's success as an author nearly matched his broadcasting prowess.His "Killing" franchise, a series of history books, have sold millions of copies.The latest, "Killing England," has topped the New York Times bestseller list for the last three weeks, though it hasn't sold as well as other titles in the series.Before this week, the book deals were a rare source of stability for O'Reilly.Advertisers fled his show in droves following the Times' report in April, prompting Fox to let him go.But Henry Holt, O'Reilly's publisher, has stood by him.
Coming soon to a theater near you: Surge pricing for movies:::::Would you go see "Geostorm "or "The Snowman" -- two box office duds that were savaged by critics and have abysmal scores on Rotten Tomatoes -- if you didn't have to pay full price to watch them in an empty theater?Regal Cinemas (RGC), one of the largest movie theater chains in the United States, is hoping you might.The company will experiment with charging more for tickets during peak movie times and less at times when attendance tends to be lighter.Think of it as Uber-style surge pricing, but for movies.Regal, partnering with the online ticket service and app Atom Tickets, will try it in several markets next year.Regal CEO Amy Miles didn't say how many theaters would try it, what the prices would be or whether Regal might use such a model to charge different prices for hits and duds.But the new pricing plan, if successful, could be just what theater chains need.Shares of Regal, competitors AMC (AMC), Cinemark (CNK), and big screen operator IMAX (IMAX) have all fallen this year because of poor box office sales.There's a big debate about whether the high cost of tickets -- not to mention popcorn, soda and other concession stand goodies -- are the industry's biggest problem.Related: Box office slump hurting AMC theaters and its rivals That might be part of it, and it's the reason another company has recently launched a service called MoviePass that lets people see as many movies as they want for a monthly subscription.In other words, Netflix for movie theaters.The big chains are cautiously embracing it.Miles said in an earnings conference call with analysts Tuesday that Regal is happy to sell tickets to MoviePass at full price, and MoviePass can then offer those tickets to its customers at whatever price it wants.But Miles ruled out any partnership that would give MoviePass access to lower-priced tickets."We will take a wait-and-see approach and we're going to continue to enjoy the benefits of the full priced movie tickets that we're receiving for all MoviePass customers," Miles said."What we will not entertain is the discounted ticket arrangement or any participation in our concession sales as part of the arrangement."Related: Can MoviePass save the multiplex?Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) itself is a problem for the movie theaters: Why go out and see a mediocre movie when you can sit on the couch and binge the second season of "Stranger Things" instead?Netflix, along with Amazon (AMZN, Tech30), Hulu and top cable networks have splurged on big budget shows with top actors and directors.It's why many call this the golden age of television, or peak TV.Still, there's hope for movie theaters.It's a simple formula: People will put down their phones and go the multiplex when there's something good to see.That was clearly the case with the recent horror movie smash hit "It."The superhero movies "Justice League" and "Thor: Ragnarok" are coming out in November, and the eagerly awaited next installment in the Star Wars saga, "The Last Jedi," is due out just before Christmas.So there's a good chance people will stop watching Netflix long enough to go spend two hours escaping reality in a movie theater.
Four more women accuse Mark Halperin of harassment, bringing total to at least a dozen:::::Two days after CNN first reported that five women said "Game Change" co-author and journalist Mark Halperin sexually harassed or assaulted them during his time at ABC News, the number of accusers has grown to at least a dozen women, including four who are now sharing their accounts for the first time.Another woman, who shared her account in CNN's initial article on the condition her name not be published, is now speaking out on the record.The new accusations from the four women include that Halperin masturbated in front of an ABC News employee in his office and that he violently threw another woman against a restaurant window before attempting to kiss her, and that after she rebuffed him he called her and told her she would never work in politics or media.The alleged incidents occurred while Halperin was in a position of significant authority at ABC News, while the women were young and had little power.Halperin denies that he masturbated in front of anyone, that he physically assaulted anyone, or that he threatened anyone in the way described in this story.In a statement provided to CNN Friday evening, Halperin said, "I am profoundly sorry for the pain and anguish I have caused by my past actions.I apologize sincerely to the women I mistreated."Halperin said that in recent days, as he has read accounts of women he worked with at ABC News, he has felt "profound guilt."He said that for several years, around his departure from ABC News, he "had weekly counseling sessions to work on understanding the personal issues and attitudes that caused me to behave in such an inappropriate manner."He additionally said that his behavior had not continued after he left ABC News.(Halperin's full statement appears at the bottom of this article.)Related: Five women accuse journalist and 'Game Change' co-author Mark Halperin of sexual harassment The first of the four new accusers, who was at the time of the incident an ABC News desk assistant in her early 20s, told CNN she asked Halperin if she could meet with him for career advice in either 1997 or 1998.It was after 10 p.m. when she went into his office, she said.During their conversation, Halperin began to masturbate behind his desk while staring at her, the woman said."I sat in a chair across from him," she told CNN."He was behind a wooden desk so I couldn't see him from the waist down.As we had our conversation about my career he was masturbating.There was no question about it.""I pretended like I didn't know what was going on and we talked a bit more and then he abruptly wrapped up the conversation," she continued.The woman told CNN it was clear what Halperin was doing."There was an up and down motion," she said."I don't know if he made any sound at the end or how it was clear to me that he had climaxed," she said."But it was clear that he was satisfied -- like he stopped making that motion and stopped staring at me."A longtime friend of the woman's told CNN that the woman had told him her story years ago.The second woman told CNN she met Halperin in the late 1990s while she was interning at the White House."At the end of my internship, Mark said to me, 'When you graduate from college, if you're looking for a job, call me.'And I was super flattered and really excited.So when I graduated, I called Mark Halperin," she said.The woman told CNN that Halperin took her to lunch in Midtown Manhattan.They didn't talk about her career or jobs at all throughout the lunch, but she assumed that he knew it was why he called and that the topic would be addressed later.At the end of the lunch, after they walked out of the restaurant, she said, she extended her hand for him to shake it.Halperin, she said, had other ideas."He put both hands on my arms and threw me against the window of the restaurant hard.So my head banged against the window hard, in a way I thought people inside were going to think something terrible had happened to me," she said, adding, "This was rough, and hard, and violent.And not in a seductive way -- in a way that telegraphs some anger and meanness.""And he lunged at me," she continued, "with his body pressed against mine against the window and came at me with his open mouth."The woman said she was able to avoid his attempt to kiss her, get out from under him and walk away.About 10 minutes later, she said, he called her."I was really hoping he would be calling to apologize.And he said something to the effect of, 'You are never going to get a job.You're never going to be hired in politics or media.Why would anyone ever hire you?'And that's when I broke down and started crying," she told CNN.Two friends of the woman told CNN that the woman had told them about the incident more than a decade ago.A third woman, who worked as a desk assistant on "World News Tonight," told CNN that Halperin hit on her in the office during the Fall of 2006.The woman provided CNN excerpts from the journal she kept at the time that she told CNN referenced Halperin, although it only referred to the man as "an older man who is involved with someone else and has a powerful position at ABC.""He cornered me in the coffee closet, and introduced himself," the journal said."And knowing of course who he is, his national significance, and his importance in news, I squandered (sic) in nervousness.I noticed he had been eying me... he's in the newsroom a lot... but figured he was looking at the monitors behind me."Later, the woman wrote in her journal, the man pulled her aside when she was alone and "He whispered -- how old are you, do you have a boyfriend, and do you understand how important it is that we remain secretive?With that he told me he wanted to meet me in his office before I left for the night.Knowing perfectly well that his intentions were wrong, I went to him anyway -- if anything to save my dignity and stand up for myself for seeming more interested or suggestive than I was."At that time, the woman's account in her journal said, the man told her he was "extremely attracted" to her.The woman told Halperin it was best if they remained professional, but he didn't listen."As I gathered my things to leave, he leaned in to kiss me.I turned my head away, but he would not relent," she wrote in the journal."So in the awkwardness and pressure of the moment, I let him put his lips on mine.It was nothing -- not a kiss, just lips on lips.And he smelled like makeup.I went home, wanting to cry and vomit."The woman told CNN that what Halperin did was "part of the reason I didn't go for an off-air position," the term ABC News used to describe reporters who were embedded with presidential campaigns."I didn't want to work with him," she said, later adding the whole episode contributed to her decision to leave journalism all together.The woman, at the time, confided in a close friend.The friend told CNN she had told him the story years ago.A fourth woman, who was a 19-year-old ABC News intern in the summer of 1995, told CNN she was assigned to the political unit.She said she was working on a project when Halperin personally volunteered one night to assist her.He said he would go with her to a museum in New York City to review some archived CBS footage."I remember thinking to myself he's got a million associate producers, so why is he going with the intern to do research?"the woman recalled to CNN, but said at the same time she was "very impressed" by him and thrilled he'd want to help her with the assignment.The woman said the booths for reviewing footage at the museum were only meant for one person, but Halperin told her "he want[ed] to share" one.It was a tight fit, the woman said, so "our cheeks [were] touching.""And then I look over and he has a massive boner.And our legs are touching," she said."And at this point, I just flew up and got up.And he said, 'The night's not over!We need to end it with a margarita.'"The woman said she declined.The four new accounts bring the total number of women who have accused Halperin of sexual harassment to at least one dozen.Five women made accusations in CNN's original report Wednesday night, the Washington Post included an on-the-record account in an article it published Thursday night, journalist Emily Miller wrote on Twitter that she had been "attacked" by Halperin in the past, and on Thursday night a former CNN producer published an op-ed on CNN.com in which she accused him of sexually harassing her in his office at ABC News when she was just out of college, before she went to work at CNN.Related: Why I'm speaking up about Mark Halperin, and why I stayed silent so long In a Friday statement, an ABC News spokesperson told CNN that the company takes issues of harassment seriously and would like to encourage anyone who has been subjected to such treatment to "come forward so we can address them immediately.""While Mark left ABC News over a decade ago and no complaints were made during his tenure, we hold everyone at ABC News accountable for their behavior and how they conduct themselves," the spokesperson said."We know that our people do their best work in an environment where they feel respected, safe and supported.Harassment or retaliation of any kind is never acceptable."In addition to the new accounts, Lara Setrakian, who was one of the five women whose stories were included in CNN's Wednesday night report without her name attached, is now going on the record, both with CNN and in an op-ed for the Washington Post published Friday afternoon.In CNN's original article, she said Halperin had grabbed her breasts during an encounter in his office; he had denied doing so.She told CNN on Friday that Halperin's denial is false."I understand why he feels the need to deny it," Setrakian said."But it's not true.What he said is not true....There's absolutely no question of what happened in terms of unwanted physical contact."Setrakian said it "hurt to see [Halperin] rise and rise without any accountability.""It felt like the world was so stacked," she told CNN."It felt profoundly unfair to have feelings of anxiety as a woman in media while watching someone who was clearly misbehaving rise and rise in our industry with no apology, no thought as to how we felt before, no effort to apologize.No effort to reach out to us."Setrakian said now she is happy Halperin issued a form of an apology, but she wants to know what Halperin will do "to make it right."She told CNN the incident changed her."It made me hyper-conscious.First, it made me much more skeptical of people's intentions," she said."I think it made me hyper-sensitive to the idea that my career will depend on who finds me sexually attractive.And if the time comes when they don't I will be at a massive disadvantage.That upset me tremendously.And it made me move away from television.It made me feel like I had an expiration date."Mark Halperin's full Friday evening statement: I am profoundly sorry for the pain and anguish I have caused by my past actions.I apologize sincerely to the women I mistreated.The world is now publicly acknowledging what so many women have long known: Men harm women in the workplace.That new awareness is, of course, a positive development.For a long time at ABC News, I was part of the problem.I acknowledge that, and I deeply regret it.As I said earlier in the week, my behavior was wrong.It caused fear and anxiety for women who were only seeking to do their jobs.In recent days I have closely read the accounts of women with whom I worked at ABC News.I have not read these accounts looking for discrepancies or inconsistencies.Instead, in almost every case, I have recognized conduct for which I feel profound guilt and responsibility, some involving junior ABC News personnel and women just starting out in the news business.Many of the accounts conveyed by journalists working on stories about me or that I have read after publication have not been particularly detailed (and many were anonymous) making it difficult for me to address certain specifics.But make no mistake: I fully acknowledge and apologize for conduct that was often aggressive and crude.Towards the end of my time at ABC News, I recognized I had a problem.No one had sued me, no one had filed a human resources complaint against me, no colleague had confronted me.But I didn't need a call from HR to know that I was a selfish, immature person, who was behaving in a manner that had to stop.For several years around my departure from ABC News, I had weekly counseling sessions to work on understanding the personal issues and attitudes that caused me to behave in such an inappropriate manner.Those who have worked with me in the past decade know that my conduct in subsequent jobs at TIME, Bloomberg, NBC News, and Showtime has not been what it was at ABC.I did not engage in improper behavior with colleagues or subordinates.If you spoke to my co-workers in those four places (men and women alike), I am confident you would find that I had a very different reputation than I had at ABC News because I conducted myself in a very different manner.Some of the allegations that have been made against me are not true.But I realize that is a small point in the scheme of things.Again, I bear responsibility for my outrageous conduct at ABC News.I hope that not only will women going forward be more confident in speaking up, but also that we as an industry and society can create an atmosphere that no longer tolerates this kind of behavior.I know I can never do enough to make up for the harm I caused.I will be spending time with my family and friends, as I work to make amends and contributions both large and small.
Harvey Weinstein's New York haunt: Former servers describe harassment, tantrums and revolving door of women:::::When Harvey Weinstein allegedly propositioned actress Lupita Nyong'o to skip dinner and join him in a "private room upstairs," she said in a first-hand account in The New York Times that her meeting with him took place at one of New York's most iconic restaurants, Tribeca Grill.Trish Goff, a model who has been on the covers of Vogue, Cosmopolitan and Elle, told The New York Times that when Weinstein allegedly groped her, it too, happened at Tribeca Grill.A downtown Manhattan haunt favored by the famous, Tribeca Grill opened in 1990 and is co-owned by actor Robert De Niro.The restaurant is located in the heart of affluent Tribeca.Above the restaurant sits The Weinstein Company's New York headquarters and Weinstein's now former office.The restaurant's impressive ambiance belies some of the shocking behavior that allegedly took place when Weinstein showed up to dine.The mogul routinely subjected servers to his tantrums and frequented the restaurant with young women who often disappeared with him for hours at a time before returning to their table to food that grew cold, according to three former restaurant employees who witnessed the behavior.Those sources described to CNN a pattern of behavior that includes groping and pushing alcohol on women who didn't want to drink.Their accounts bear a striking resemblance to what Goff and Nyong'o allege in their personal testimonies about their encounters with the now disgraced Hollywood heavyweight."Weinstein was notorious for taking all sorts of 'meetings' with all sorts of young women," said one former employee who worked at the restaurant for nearly a decade starting in 2005."We'd always go, 'Oh there's Harvey Weinstein at the table with another young girl.'"Servers often got a "heads up" from one of Weinstein's assistants that he was on the way to the restaurant with a "client."He was typically seated at "his table" in the back of Tribeca Grill near the kitchen and away from the public's prying eyes.What happens next was always the same, according to the former restaurant employees.Two of three people CNN spoke to did not want to be identified because they still work in the restaurant industry and are worried about the implications of speaking publicly about a past customer, while the third still has friends at the restaurant and did not want to hurt those relationships.Weinstein would order alcoholic drinks, one for himself and one for his female guest.The food order varied, but he favored caviar, sources said.According to two former servers, the woman would "almost always" turn down his drink order and ask for a non-alcoholic beverage.But the former servers said they were instructed by management to "do whatever Mr. Weinstein says."This means the female guest was served alcohol whether she ordered it or not."The server was not allowed to go with what the female said," said one former server who worked at Tribeca Grill for five months in 2015."The server had to go with what Harvey said and regardless of whatever the female said we still had to bring the beverage to the table."A spokesperson said in an email that Tribeca Grill does not condone the actions described by the restaurant's former employees who spoke to CNN."We support the hard-working people of the Tribeca Grill every day for the last 27 years.We would never allow any customer to be rude or harass any staff member.It would not be tolerated," the spokesperson said."We do not defend for a second the actions of Mr. Weinstein and it is inaccurate to try to portray us as part of his dysfunction."Those who waited on Weinstein were given a handwritten piece of paper by a manager or a host that would "tell us how to handle the table," according to two former servers."Harvey was one of the biggest VIPs we had [come to the restaurant] and there were only a few people that were allowed to serve his table," said a former server."Mainly, the senior servers because he was so incredibly specific on the things that he liked."Nyong'o's account includes a similar instance in which she ordered juice during a lunch meeting with Weinstein at a different restaurant that she did not name.Weinstein told the waiter to bring her a vodka and diet coke saying, "Get her what I tell you to get her.I'm the one paying the bill."Nyong'o declined to comment for this story.The actress ordered juice again when the two met at Tribeca Grill a few months later, much to Weinstein's dismay, according to Nyong'o account."We ordered drinks and starters," she wrote."Again he was offended by my non-alcoholic beverage choice but he didn't fight me on it as hard."What typically happened after drinks and appetizers arrived was like "clockwork," the former employees told CNN.Weinstein and his guest would leave the table with the food untouched and exit through the back door, which leads to his office upstairs or outside.When they returned, sometimes hours later, the two would appear "visibly quiet," one former server said.Weinstein would send the kitchen into a "tizzy" when he complained that the food was cold upon his return.The mogul's tantrums were legendary at the restaurant."He would get angry over little details like if the wrong drink was brought over," said a former server who left Tribeca Grill in 2016 after two years of employment."In fact, if things didn't go the way he wanted he wasn't above taking the lemons out of his drink and throwing it at the servers.We would put a lemon or lime on a glass of water or a drink and he would take it off the drink and chuck it at the servers to get their attention and make sure he hit them."Another former employee said, "His sense of entitlement was like none other, the entire staff would cringe when he would come in.One specific time he came into the kitchen and began yelling at a girlfriend of mine who was a server and began calling her 'stupid' because she wasn't getting his food quick enough."New York Post's Jade Budowski, who was once a server at Tribeca Grill, wrote a firsthand account of what it was like to wait on Weinstein."The staff could usually tell that the woman was there to meet him before she had even said a word," she wrote."If a woman waited for him at the bar, he'd bellow furiously at more than one of us for not having seated her prior to his arrival, despite the fact that she'd insisted on it.'Why the f- -k isn't she at the table?'he'd say."Budowski declined to comment for this story.The inappropriate touching and groping that some women alleged in their accounts since The New York Times broke the Weinstein story three weeks ago were sometimes on display at Tribeca Grill."He used to say goodbye by embracing [the women] and the embrace would also entail cupping her a**.I've seen him do that more than once," a former employee said.The New York Times and the New Yorker Magazine published back-to-back stories earlier this month that detail nearly three decades of sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations, including charges of rape.The explosive stories have prompted more women, including Goff and Nyong'o, to come forward and share their experiences.Weinstein, through a spokeswoman, has "unequivocally" denied "any allegations of non-consensual sex."Goff told the New York Times she was subjected to Weinstein's groping when she turned down his advances at a meeting at Tribeca Grill."I said I wasn't interested in an open relationship, but he was relentless, and I kept trying to shut that down and move on," Goff said."Then he started putting his hands on my legs, and I said, 'Can you stop doing that?'When we finally stood up to go, he really started groping me, grabbing my breasts, grabbing my face and trying to kiss me.I kept saying, 'Please stop, please stop, but he didn't until I managed to get back into the public space."When the initial Weinstein story broke, several former and current restaurant employees texted with one another, a former server said."When this story dropped all of us who used to work there ... we all said this a**hole got what was coming to him," the server said."Because he was so terrible to all of us."

Department by a coworker."But on NBCs Megyn Kelly Today, Kelly refuted that claim, saying she had complained about OReilly while they were both working at Fox News, and blasted the culture of silencing sexual harassment victims at the network and beyond.George H.W.Bush, former president In a Tuesday Instagram post that has since been deleted, actress Heather Lind recounted the story of when she met former president George H.W.Bush four years ago to promote one of her TV shows."He touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side," Lind wrote."He told me a dirty joke.And then, all the while being photographed, touched me again."The former president apologized on Wednesday.President Bush would never under any circumstance intentionally cause anyone distress, and he most sincerely apologizes if his attempt at humor offended Ms. Lind, Jim McGrath, a Bush spokesman, said in a statement.Leon Wieseltier, magazine editor A number of women who worked with prominent literary editor Leon Wieseltier at The New Republic magazine have accused him of sexual harassment, The New York Times reported.Wieseltier worked at the magazine for more than three decades and was set to head a new magazine to launch next week.After learning of the allegations, the organization that was backing the new magazine pulled out of the project."Upon receiving information related to past inappropriate workplace conduct, Emerson Collective ended its business relationship with Leon Wieseltier, including a journal planned for publication under his editorial direction," the Emerson Collective told The New York Times Tuesday.Wieseltier apologized in an email to the Times on Tuesday."For my offenses against some of my colleagues in the past I offer a shaken apology and ask for their forgiveness," he wrote."The women with whom I worked are smart and good people.I am ashamed to know that I made any of them feel demeaned and disrespected.I assure them I will not waste this reckoning."Mark Halperin, political journalist Allegations against "Game Change" author Mark Halperin surfaced in a CNN report, which quoted five anonymous women as saying Halperin sexually harassed them when he was a top political journalist at ABC News.Halperin, who has since become a senior political analyst and frequent contributor for NBC News and MSNBC, acknowledged that he had engaged in "inappropriate" conduct.In a statement to CNN, Halperin apologized for pursuing "relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me."He denied inappropriate touching.Halperin left ABC News in 2007 after two decades with the network.ABC News said no complaints were filed during his time there.Four of the women have since left ABC News.We find the story and the allegations very troubling," NBC News said in a statement."Mark Halperin is leaving his role as a contributor until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood.

Strange Days Ahead: No Letting Go of 'Stranger Things' Obsession:::::Here's the strange thing about last month's Emmys: The biggest victor didn't take home a trophy.Nobody expected Shannon Purser, nominated for her brief turn as the eminently sensible, ill-fated high school student Barb on "Stranger Things," to win.Then again, fewer expected her to be nominated.Purser's guest-actress nod marked a fitting triumph of sorts for a show built around oddball underdogs and kids playing kids' roles.It also spoke to the sense of loyalty coursing through a drama that celebrates friendship as the key to slaying monsters.The sci-fi breakout that turned TV and the Emmys upside-down last year returns to Netflix for a second season Friday in a bid to eek out more unlikely wins.Rose McGowan Makes First Appearance Since Weinstein Claim Actor and director Rose McGowan made her first appearance in public since she accused film producer Harvey Weinstein of rape, giving a rousing speech against sexual harassers at the Women's Convention in Detroit.(Published Friday, Oct. 27, 2017) The 1980s-set Duffer Brothers' sleeper hit landed, at least on the surface, as an ode to Steven Spielberg's "E.T."glory days, with screeching echoes of "The Goonies" and "Gremlins."But nostalgia alone doesn't explain the generations-wide devotion to the show, whose first season centered on the search for Will Byers a 12-year-old geek sucked into a netherworld known as the Upside Down.Will's fellow Dungeons & Dragons-loving buddies, Mike, Lucas and Dustin led the charge, peddling their bikes furiously while battling schoolhouse bullies and a government conspiracy.Winona Ryder, as Will's unhinged lioness of a mother, and David Harbour, as a haunted small town police chief, turned in career-best performances as the two adult believers who found hope in blinking Christmas lights.But Millie Bobby Brown, who played Eleven, the short-haired, Eggo-loving forgotten child with fearsome telekinetic powers, shined brightest.Eleven appeared to exit as a martyr who disintegrated while saving her buddies from the dreaded Demogorgon (the kids D&D-inspired nickname for the monster).But a hint near end of Season 1 and Season 2 previews suggest her number isn't yet up.'Tonight': Fallon Reads #DogHalloweenCostumes Hashtags Jimmy Fallon reads his favorite holiday tweets with the hashtag #DogHalloweenCostumes.(Published Friday, Oct. 27, 2017) It's unclear whether the same could be said for Barb.But fans likely won't give up rooting for her return.Stranger things, after all, have happened.Hester is Director of News Products and Projects at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism.He is also the author of "Raising a Beatle Baby: How John, Paul, George and Ringo Helped us Come Together as a Family."Follow him on Twitter.Copyright NBC Owned Television Stations

Fats Domino Stirred New Orleans Flavor Into Rock 'n' Roll:::::He was one of the first 10 honorees named to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Rolling Stone Record Guide likened him to Benjamin Franklin, the beloved old man of a revolutionary movement In appearance, Fats Domino wasn't a typical a teen idol.He stood 5-feet-5 and weighed more than 200 pounds, with a wide, boyish smile and a haircut as flat as an album cover.But Domino sold more than 110 million records, with hits including "Blueberry Hill," ''Ain't That a Shame" and other standards of rock 'n' roll.Domino, the amiable rock 'n' roll pioneer whose steady, pounding piano and easy baritone helped change popular music even as it honored the grand, good-humored tradition of the Crescent City, died early Tuesday.He was 89.Mark Bone, chief investigator with the Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, coroner's office, said Domino died of natural causes early Tuesday morning.His dynamic performance style and warm vocals drew crowds for five decades.One of his show-stopping stunts was playing the piano while standing, throwing his body against it with the beat of the music and bumping the grand piano across the stage.Domino's 1956 version of "Blueberry Hill" was selected for the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry of historic sound recordings worthy of preservation.The preservation board noted that Domino insisted on performing the song despite his producer's doubts, adding that Domino's "New Orleans roots are evident in the Creole inflected cadences that add richness and depth to the performance."He was one of the first 10 honorees named to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Rolling Stone Record Guide likened him to Benjamin Franklin, the beloved old man of a revolutionary movement.Domino became a global star but stayed true to his hometown, where his fate was initially unknown after Hurricane Katrina struck in August 2005.It turned out that he and his family were rescued by boat from his home, where he lost three pianos and dozens of gold and platinum records, along with other memorabilia.Many wondered if he would ever return to the stage.Scheduled to perform at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in 2006, he simply tipped his hat to thousands of cheering fans.His friend Haydee Ellis said then that Domino was "OK, but he doesn't feel up to performing."But in May 2007, he was back, performing at Tipitina's music club in New Orleans.Fans cheered and some cried as Domino played "I'm Walkin'," ''Ain't It a Shame," ''Shake, Rattle and Roll," ''Blueberry Hill" and a host of other hits.That performance was a highlight during several rough years.After losing their home and almost all their belongings to the floods, his wife of more than 50 years, Rosemary, died in April 2008.Rose McGowan Makes First Appearance Since Weinstein Claim Actor and director Rose McGowan made her first appearance in public since she accused film producer Harvey Weinstein of rape, giving a rousing speech against sexual harassers at the Women's Convention in Detroit.(Published Friday, Oct. 27, 2017) Domino moved to the New Orleans suburb of Harvey after the storm but would often visit his publishing house, an extension of his old home in the Lower 9th Ward, inspiring many with his determination to stay in the city he loved."Fats embodies everything good about New Orleans," his friend David Lind said in a 2008 interview."He's warm, fun-loving, spiritual, creative and humble.You don't get more New Orleans than that."The son of a violin player, Antoine Domino Jr. was born Feb. 26, 1928, to a family that grew to include nine children.Antoine and Rosemary Domino raised eight children in the same ramshackle neighborhood where he grew up, but they did it in style in a white mansion, trimmed in pink, yellow and lavender.The front double doors opened into an atrium with chandeliers hanging from the ceiling and ivory dominos set in a white marble floor.As a youth, he taught himself popular piano styles ragtime, blues and boogie-woogie after his cousin left an old upright in the house.Fats Waller and Albert Ammons were early influences.He quit school at age 14, and worked days in a factory while playing and singing in local juke joints at night.In 1949, Domino was playing at the Hideaway Club for $3 a week when he was signed by Imperial record company.'Tonight': Fallon Reads #DogHalloweenCostumes Hashtags Jimmy Fallon reads his favorite holiday tweets with the hashtag #DogHalloweenCostumes.(Published Friday, Oct. 27, 2017) He recorded his first song, "The Fat Man," in the back of a tiny French Quarter recording studio."They call me the Fat Man, because I weigh 200 pounds," he sang."All the girls, they love me, 'cause I know my way around.""Fat Man" sold more than 1 million copies and has been called the first rock 'n' roll record.That's not a unique claim in the music world, but Domino, with help from songwriting partner Dave Bartholomew, shaped the new genre by providing Imperial with rhythm and blues hits for the next five years, including "Rockin' Chair" and "You Done Me Wrong."In 1955, he broke into the white pop charts with "Ain't it a Shame" in which he sang the lyrics as "ain't that a shame."It was covered blandly by Pat Boone as "Ain't That a Shame" and rocked out years later under that title by Cheap Trick and many others.Domino enjoyed a parade of successes through the early 1960s, including "Be My Guest" and "I'm Ready."Another hit, "I'm Walkin,'" became the debut single for Ricky Nelson.Domino appeared in the rock 'n' roll film "The Girl Can't Help It" and was among the first black performers to be featured in popular music shows, starring with Buddy Holly and the Everly Brothers.He also helped bridge rock 'n' roll and other styles even country/western, recording Hank Williams' "Jambalaya" and Bobby Charles' "Walkin' to New Orleans."Like many of his peers, Domino's popularity tapered off in the 1960s as British and psychedelic rock held sway.His last song to reach the charts was a 1968 remake of the Beatles' "Lady Madonna," featuring a pumping piano riff in the Domino style.'Late Night': Mikey Day on His 'David S. Pumpkins' Special Seth Meyers chats with "Saturday Night Live" writer Mikey Day, who chats about his hit sketch "David S. Pumpkins" and his worst "SNL" pitches ever.(Published Friday, Oct. 27, 2017) Domino told Ebony magazine that he stopped recording because companies wanted him to update his style."I refused to change," he said."I had to stick to my own style that I've always used or it just wouldn't be me."But his old recordings kept selling, his concerts kept selling out, and his influence continued to be felt.You could hear it in Bob Dylan's "Nothing Was Delivered," in numerous songs by Randy Newman, and, at least in spirit, on Van Morrison's horn-driven tribute, "Domino."A Philadelphia chicken plucker named Ernest Evans changed his name to a parody of Domino's, Chubby Checker, and found dance floor immortality performing "The Twist."Domino sang and played in Las Vegas for more than 10 years, where he passed time between shows in the gambling room.In the 1974 Ebony interview, he said he lost more than $2 million before he was cured of the gambling habit in 1972.In 1988, all of New Orleans seemed to be talking about him after he reportedly paid cash in one pop for two Cadillacs and a $130,000 Rolls-Royce.When the salesman asked if he wanted to call his bank about financing, Domino smiled and said, "I am the bank."'Tonight': Lin-Manuel Miranda Freestyles With The Roots Lin-Manuel Miranda joins The Roots to freestyle a rap inspired by a "Tonight Show" audience member.(Published Wednesday, Oct. 25, 2017) In 1998, he became the first purely rock 'n' roll musician to be awarded the National Medal for the Arts.But he cited his age and didn't make the trip to the White House to get the medal from President Clinton.That was typical.Aside from rare appearances in New Orleans, he dodged the spotlight in his later years, refusing to appear in public or even to give interviews.

Off-Broadway Production of 'Too Heavy For Your Pocket' Spotlights 1960s Black Resistance Movement That Still Strikes Chords Today:::::Tucked away in the sub-basement of the Roundabout Underground in Times Square, just a few blocks away from where some are paying otherworldly ticket prices for "Hamilton" or Bruce Springsteen's one man show, may be one of Off-Broadway's best kept secrets."Too Heavy For Your Pocket," a new play written by Jirh Breon Holder starring Brandon Gill, Hampton Fluker, Eboni Flowers and Nneka Okafor, was just extended one week and will now conclude its run at Roundabout's Black Box Theatre on Nov. 26.The play chronicles the lives of two African American couples in the early 1960's during the heat of the civil rights movement.Their futures are thrown into turmoil after one of their group decides to forsake a life-altering college scholarship to join the Freedom Riders.The original Freedom Riders consisted of 13 African American and white civil rights activists who launched the Freedom Rides on May 4, 1961 -- a movement that consisted of a series of bus trips through the American South to protest segregation in interstate bus terminals.The Freedom Riders attempted to integrate facilities at bus terminals along the way into the Deep South.African American Freedom Riders tried to use whites-only restrooms and lunch counters, encountering violence from white protesters along the route while drawing international attention to their cause.Gill, who the plays the character of Bowzie Brandon, was introduced to the project when the playwright said the part was written specifically with him in mind."The writer was a friend first and he writes to your strengths.So there are a lot of characteristics between Bowzie and myself that we definitely share," Brandon says."There are similarities in terms of being a dreamer and wanting to reach outside the little space that you grew up in."Flowers, who plays Gill's bold and sassy wife Evelyn, says the material spoke to her in a deeply instinctual way."As a southerner, especially being from Montgomery, I feel like these conversations and dialogue were always prevalent in my family," she says."So I was familiar with Dr. King's journey and that of the Freedom Riders and the four little girls [murdered on Sept. 15, 1963 after a bomb detonated beneath the steps of the 16th Street Baptist Church].These have always been active conversations in my family.So this is just a deeper dive into the narrative."Both performers believe that while the play focuses on the events of the 1960s, it has never been more relevant than it is today, in 2017, as professional athletes take a knee in the face of social injustices and women across the country speak out against sexual harassment and abuse in the form of the #MeToo movement."There's never an opportune time for people of color to speak out against adversity," says Gill. "It always seem an inconvenience to privilege or disrespectful in some way.At the same time it has to be done.So just do it when you're ready."Adds Flowers, "It doesnt stop with the Freedom Riders.They are part of a much bigger picture.I think about #MeToo and the women's struggle thats happening right now with being transparent about things that have been going on.There are so many different things to be active about, including being a black person, and the things that we need and want and the dignity that we continue to fight for."The extension week will include three special performances reserved for New York City students from schools affiliated with Roundabout's expansive education program.Information regarding tickets for the show can be found on the Roundabout website.

Mario Gets Help in 'Mario+Rabbids: Kingdom Battle' Video Game:::::In video games, Mario, the intrepid princess-saving plumber, does not usually pair up with anyone outside of the Mushroom Kingdom.There are exceptions for special events, like Mario teaming up with Sonic the Hedgehog for the Olympics, but generally, the most iconic video game character doesnt use backup.Until now.The Mushroom Kingdom is in danger from an outside force in Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, a new video game for the Nintendo Switch gaming console.Mario and friends are getting help from the Rabbids, crazy rabbit-like creatures who speak in gibberish, yelling "BWAAAH!"very often, from another gaming company, Ubisoft.Creative director Davide Soliani said he and his team wanted to bring something to the Mario universe of games that no one had seen before, and using the Rabbids and their penchant for chaos and slapstick violence provided the perfect injection of new ideas for a bold take on Mario.He said there is a familiarity in the overall look and feel of the game, but surprises are waiting around every corner.We used these contrasts as a focus to bring new ideas, new game mechanics, new environments, and thats why you are in the Mushroom Kingdom, but it is twisted, Soliani said.Mario is very well known as a hero, a brave guy.And the Rabbids are quite the opposite, quite different.How cool it could be if Mario, throughout the game, teaches to the Rabbids how to become heroes?And Mario learns from the Rabbids how to crack a joke, to take it easy.Mario is joined by his friends Princess Peach (no rescuing needed this time), Yoshi, and Luigi.They team up with four Rabbid heroes who mimic their Nintendo idols, taking costumes to look like the original gang.In the campaign, these characters will form teams of three to find a way to fix the Mushroom Kingdom by visiting different worlds and battling enemies.We wanted make something that Mario players would recognize, like jumping and stomping, Soliani said.But at the same time, we were using the Rabbids to inject in those mechanics new ways to spice up the combat, new ways to spice up the Nintendo characters as well.The development team at Ubisoft specialized in tactical and strategic games.Making a new game with such beloved characters presented challenges, but Soliani said a turn-based strategy shooter made the most sense to maximize the divergent ideas of gameplay and abilities in the game.We should try to stay true to the Mario universe and mix tactical phase, combat phase, which is more in line with the Mario world, he said.Finding treasure chests, collect coins to buy new weapons, meet new heroes and be challenged by new enemies.When he came up with the idea for the mashup, Soliani knew he would have to not only convince his own company, Ubisoft, he would have to sway Nintendo to allow him to use their characters.He met with Shigeru Miyamoto, the man who created the Mario character, originally called Jumpman, in the classic video game Donkey Kong in 1981.Solaini said presenting his idea to the most legendary game designer in the world was intimidating.When we first presented the game to Miyamoto-san, we had only three weeks in-house to come up with a prototype.When we presented the prototype to Miyamoto-san, he was surprised that we had, in our prototype, Mario and Luigi.Miyamoto asked how Solaini got the character designs for Mario and Luigi in the prototype.Solani told him his team made them from scratch for the presentation, impressing the Nintendo game designer.Early reviews of the game have been very good, mentioning the different elements of gameplay and the creativity used to bring Mario and the Rabbids together.The style of combat is reminiscent of another turn-based shooter, X-COM, with a variety of weapons and the use of cover for defense.However, Solaini said their inspiration came from another popular game.Im a big fan of X-COM, the original one from Julian Gollop and the new one from (Jake) Solomon, he said.But our reference was not X-COM but Mario Kart.We wanted to bring the dynamics, the surprise that you have in go-cart racing to our combat system in a strategy game.With delightful and recognizable characters, whimsical environments and dialog, and a battle system that combines movement and shooting into strategic combat, Solaini and his team were proud of what they accomplished.Those were the basic foundations that we built up for the rest of the game.When we did that, we said, OK, I think we have something very strong, something that we should explore even more.He invited all fans, including diehard Nintendo fans, to experience something different.Mario+Rabbids: Kingdom Battle is available now for the Nintendo Switch.It is rated E+10 for everyone 10 years of age or older due to cartoon violence, comic mischief, and mild language.

Pets in the City: How to Make Apartment Living Work for You and Your Pup:::::When you bring your new shelter dog home, there are a few things you should keep in mind.First up: learn how to read your pup's body language to know his or her mood.Living in an apartment with your canine companion isnt much different from living with a human roommate: They don't clean, they dont pay for groceries and you're starting to suspect they don't even have a job.But canine roommates present additional, unique challenges.Arguably the biggest challenge for dog owners in apartments is having to escort their furry friend outside for all exercise and all bathroom breaks.That means rain, shine, sleet, snow, 6 a.m. or 3 a.m. or 11:30 p.m. buddy, youve got to put on your pants.The Luxurious Lifestyle of New York's Poshest Pooches Ashley and Cooper get a taste of the high life, New York style.From a five-star hotel exclusively for dogs to a puppy pool party in the Hamptons, it's clear that NYC really has gone to the dogs!(Published Thursday, Aug. 17, 2017) "If youre living in an apartment with a dog, first and foremost the onus is more on you to get the dog out for all of his or her needs," says Mike Kaviani.Kaviani is the Director of Lifesaving Operations at the no-kill shelter Austin Pets Alive!in Austin, Texas, and he says apartment living can in some cases actually benefit your pup."As long as the owner is committed to getting the dog out for fun outings, the dogs actually end up getting more activity and more outings and more time with their person," he says.Kaviani knows from personal experience: He lived in a studio apartment with the first dog he owned as an adult, and he recalls having to "leash him up and go out there.""As long as you're willing to do that I mean, he had so much activity."With multiple daily outings, Kaviani realized he and his pup were both getting more activity because of their apartment lifestyle."So, I actually think it can be a real win for the dog," he said.6 Health Benefits of Owning a Pet Anthony Newman, a canine behavior consultant in New York City, echoes Kaviani on the activity level of house dogs versus that of apartment dogs."Often, in fact, I find dogs in suburban areas suffer from 'suburban dog syndrome,' lacking adequate socialization, exercise and leadership due to lack of regular daily owner-led walks, obedience work and daily off-leash social play in dog parks," Newman says.He says he noticed his family's dogs, while growing up in the suburbs of St. Louis, had behavior issues stemming from lack of discipline and socialization."City dogs can end up being the calmest, most social, peaceful and obedient dogs around," Newman noted.No matter how committed you are to your apartment dog, however, you're going to have to leave him or her alone sometimes.And since apartments do not have doggie doors, your pup can't just stroll outside for business purposes.If you know that you wont be able to get back to walk your pup at the usual time, thats fine you can hire a professional or convince a trusted neighbor to come by to walk your dog.There is likely a dog-walking service of some kind in your neighborhood research online and ask other dog owners in the area to find a service that works for you.Try to meet the person wholl be walking your dog if theyre going to be doing so on a regular basis.6 Free Apps for Pet Owners You should also give a trusted person in your building a set of your keys; if youre away and the building needs to be evacuated for any reason, youll want someone to help get your pup out, too.Speaking of neighbors, they present another significant difference between apartment dog life and house dog life.You should make an effort to introduce your dog to your apartment neighbors, especially those who live on your floor and those directly above you and below you.Its also a good idea to introduce yourself to anyone in your building with young children you can let parents know whether your dog is cool with kids.Make clear to your neighbors what your dog's boundaries are, and be consistent in your interactions with them.Another thing about apartment neighbors is their physical proximity to you.It's important to remember that dogs are not silent.Barking is not the only noise dogs make they like to play, to run around and toss and catch.And its fine to play those games indoors with your dog, but if you have people below you, just keep in mind what time of day or night it is when you break out that hard plastic toy your dog likes to throw against the floor.If your floors arent carpeted, getting an area rug (probably not an expensive one) will help muffle noises for people below and will also help protect hardwood floors from scuffing.Tips for Keeping Your Pet Safe in the Summer Heat With record temperatures around the country, it is important to keep your dogs in mind when it comes to keeping cool.Check out these tips for keeping your pets safe in the heat.(Published Friday, Aug. 4, 2017) If your dog reacts to your absence by barking herself hoarse while you are gone, this is a problem (unless you never leave, but that actually sounds like a different kind of problem).Not only will this incessant row irritate your neighbors maybe enough to complain to your landlord its also a sign that your pup isnt able to relax when you go out to do the human stuff you have to do."Separation anxiety," says Newman, can be a problem for your nervous pet, and then for you and even your neighbors some dogs bark, or whine, to express their anxiety.To help curb some of that separation anxiety, Newman emphasizes the importance of creating a calm, relaxing space for your pup within your apartment.If she views the apartment as the place where you and she play around and have fun and not as the place where you do that AND the place where she hangs out and sleeps in her own bed "when you leave, [s]he barks and tears the place up.Also guarding, digging, chewing, and other destructive behaviors" can present as symptoms of separation anxiety.How to Train Your Dog Like a Pro The most important thing to know about training your new pup, according to Petco dog trainer Chloe Sternlicht, is that dogs respond best to positive reinforcement.So be patient when Fido makes a mistake and smother him with praise and treats when he get it right.Sternlicht gives some tips for getting your dog to respond to basic commands.(Published Monday, July 24, 2017) Newman says to help your dog get accustomed to chilling solo in a new living environment, it's best to make sure your pet's "exhausted and fulfilled mentally, physically and socially, and feeling comfortable at home with her bed, toys and chews" before leaving her alone in the place.Kaviani recommends teaching your dog new tricks or providing them with brain-stimulating puzzle toys indoors to keep them entertained in the smaller space.So, if you've got an apartment but want a dog, or if you've got a dog but want to move into an apartment, you should start by considering your dog's needs and temperament, Kaviani says."If the dog can handle being in an elevator with strange people, and sometimes strange dogs," he shouldn't have an unusually rough time adapting to apartment lifestyle.Tips for Keeping Your Pet Safe in the Summer Heat With record temperatures around the country, it is important to keep your dogs in mind when it comes to keeping cool.Check out these tips for keeping your pets safe in the heat.(Published Friday, Aug. 4, 2017) "Where it can go poorly, or where youll find some challenges, though, would be if the context or living environment isnt conducive to the dogs needs," says Kaviani.He cautions that if you have a dog with some shyness or some fearful behavior, they may not be comfortable hopping in and out of elevators or winding their way through crowded hallways and staircases.You should do your best to find a living space that won't cause too much additional stress on your pet.But, he says, "don't overthink it.""Dogs dont need a mansion to live in.They dont need a certain amount of square footage to meet their standards.Really, when theyre home, they just want to chill with you, their person."The living arrangement would only become a problem, he says, if your work or life schedule isn't "conducive to spending a good amount of time with your dog."Retriever Fever: America's Most Popular Dogs, in Photos Apartment living with your dog requires a more serious commitment than living with your dog in a house with a fenced-in yard.Anthony

Annabella Sciorra alleges Harvey Weinstein raped her, joining dozens making accusations:::::Dozens of women have come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.Interested in Harvey Weinstein?Add Harvey Weinstein as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Harvey Weinstein news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Oscar winners Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Mira Sorvino have claimed that they rebuffed Weinstein's unwanted advances.Other women have alleged sexual harassment and sexual assault."Any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein," a spokesperson for the movie executive told The New Yorker."Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.Mr. Weinstein obviously cant speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual," according to the full statement from Weinstein's spokesperson."Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path.Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.Weinstein was terminated by the board of the Weinstein Company in light of the allegations and later resigned from the board of directors.He was also expelled by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.Here is a list of women who spoke out on the record, along with their allegations against Weinstein.(ABC News has reached out to Weinstein for comment on the recent allegations, but did not hear back.)Annabella Sciorra The actress whose films include The Hand that Rocks the Cradle and who was nominated for an Emmy for her role in the hit TV show, The Sopranos, told The New Yorker that she was raped by Weinstein in the early 1990s and was sexually harassed by him for several years after that.Ben Gabbe/Getty Images FILE Sciorra alleges that one night after a dinner event in New York, Weinstein offered to drop her off at her apartment and then a while later, when she was in her nightgown, he barged into her place and violently raped her.For months afterward, Sciorra said she told no one and never went to police.Like most of these women, I was so ashamed of what happened, she said.The actress said she felt she was retaliated against after the alleged assault.I just kept getting this pushback of We heard you were difficult; we heard this or that.I think that that was the Harvey machine, she said.Natassia Malthe The actress and model claimed in a press conference that in 2008, Weinstein barged into her London hotel room, where he forced sexual intercourse on her and then masturbated in front of her."It was not consensual," she said."I laid still and closed my eyes and just wanted it to end.I played dead."After that encounter, she said she accepted a meeting with him at a Los Angeles hotel to discuss a potential movie role.Though She said he promised her the get-together would be strictly professional, his assistant ushered her into his suite, where she said Weinstein asked her to engage in sexual activity with him and another woman.She declined."Afterward, I called Harvey and yelled at him," she said."He became angry and said that he had given me an amazing opportunity and that I was an 'ungrateful c---.'"After that, Malthe said she gave up on the possibility of the film and eventually, moved out of the United States."I felt that my dreams had been shattered," she said.Malthe did not file a police report.Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, has said the Weinstein Company should create a fund for women who can prove they were victimized.Dominique Huett The actress, who has sued The Weinstein Co. for negligence, claimed in a court document that she met with Weinstein at a hotel seven years ago to discuss her career.However, she alleged, the producer asked to move the meeting to his suite, where he demanded a massage, forced oral sex on her, and then masturbated in front of her.The actress is seeking at least $5 million in damages, as she's alleged that board members were aware of Weinstein's misconduct and did nothing to prevent him from hurting women.Representatives for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment, though Bob Weinstein, a co-founder of the Weinstein Co. and Harvey Weinstein's younger brother, told The Hollywood Reporter earlier this month that he and his fellow board members "did not know the extent" of the allegations.Mimi Haleyi At a news conference in New York City, Haleyi said she met Weinstein in 2004 in London at the European premiere of "The Aviator."She ran into him again two years later and reached out to him to see whether she could help on one of his productions, she says.Haleyi said he invited her to his hotel room to chat and then asked for a massage, which she declined before leaving.She said she and Weinstein connected again two years later and he offered her a production job on a TV show he was producing.After accepting the job and keeping up a cordial relationship over the next few meetings, she said, he started showing up at her apartment and even invited her to Paris.Haleyi said she declined because she thought he intended for it to be a romantic trip.Haley said Weinstein assaulted her in 2006 when he invited her to his home in New York City, where he backed her into a room and allegedly forced himself on her."He held me down on the bed," she said."I tried to get away....He then orally forced himself on me."Haleyi said she has yet to go to police but will discuss the matter with her lawyer, Allred.Zelda Perkins Perkins told The Financial Times that two decades ago, she was working as Weinstein's assistant at Miramax in London when, she claims, he sexually harassed her and sexually assaulted a female colleague.She says the two women ultimately settled with Weinstein for 250,000 (over $330,000), and in return, they signed non-disclosure agreements that prevented either of them from ever discussing the agreement."I want to publicly break my non-disclosure agreement," she told the publication."Unless somebody does this, there wont be a debate about how egregious these agreements are and the amount of duress that victims are put under.My entire world fell in because I thought the law was there to protect those who abided by it.I discovered that it had nothing to do with right and wrong and everything to do with money and power.In response, Weinstein's spokesperson told The Financial Times: "The FT did not provide the identity of any individuals making these assertions.Any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances."Brit Marling The actress penned an essay for The Atlantic in which she detailed a 2014 meeting with Weinstein that she said was moved from a hotel bar to his suite at the last moment.During that encounter, she claims that Weinstein asked her if she wanted a massage, champagne and strawberries before suggesting that they shower together."It was clear that there was only one direction he wanted this encounter to go in, and that was sex or some version of an erotic exchange.I was able to gather myself together -- a bundle of firing nerves, hands trembling, voice lost in my throat -- and leave the room," she wrote."I later sat in my hotel room alone and wept.I wept because I had gone up the elevator when I knew better.I wept because I had let him touch my shoulders.I wept because at other times in my life, under other circumstances, I had not been able to leave."Heather Kerr Kerr claimed that in 1989, she was an aspiring actress and met Weinstein through the entertainment business manager for whom she was working at the time.She said Weinstein offered to meet with her to discuss her career, but when she arrived at his office, he allegedly unzipped his pants and forced her to touch his genitals."He spelled it out for me: He told me that first I would have sex with him and then he would take me to parties and show me who I had to sleep with after that but that first he needed to know how 'good' I was," she said."He told me that I was not that good-looking but that he would be willing to help me anyway like he was doing me a favor."Kerr said she left his office, and soon thereafter, resigned from her job and quit acting."I felt so powerless," she said."I didn't think anyone would believe me.I was nobody.Why would they?"Lupita Nyong'o Nyong'o described in a personal essay in The New York Times an uncomfortable encounter with Weinstein that she says took place in 2011.Fred Lee/ABC The actress, 28 at the time, says she was invited to the producer's Connecticut home, where he asked to give her a massage in his bedroom.Nyong'o says she declined, instead offering to give him a massage and remain in control.But when she did that, she says, Weinstein began to take off his pants, and she objected and quickly left.Nyong'o says that at a later dinner with Weinstein, he asked her up to his hotel room alone and told her that if she wanted to be an actor she "had to be willing to do this sort of thing."Weinstein, through a spokesperson, has denied the claims by Nyong'o."Mr. Weinstein has a different recollection of the events, but believes Lupita is a brilliant actress and a major force for the industry," the spokesperson said.Lena Headey The "Game of Thrones" star appeared in "The Brothers Grimm," a Miramax film, opposite Matt Damon in 2005.(Miramax was found by Harvey Weinstein and his brother.)"At one point, Harvey asked me to take a walk down to the water," she wrote on Twitter Tuesday."He stopped and made some suggestive comment, a gesture.I just laughed it off.I was genuinely shocked.I remember thinking it's got to be a joke."Headey said she replied to Weinstein, "Oh, come on mate?!It'd be like kissing my dad!""I was never in any other Miramax film," she added.Eva Green The "Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children" star told Variety over the weekend in a statement, "I met [Weinstein] for a business meeting in Paris where he behaved inappropriately and I had to push him off.I got away without it going further, but the experience left me shocked and disgusted."Rosdiana Ciaravolo/WireImage/Getty Images Green said that she kept silent until now because she wanted to "maintain my privacy.""But I understand it is important to do so as I hear about other womens experiences.Women are often condemned when they speak out and their personal reputations tarnished by association," she added."We should recognize that this sort of behavior exists everywhere and is not unique to the entertainment industry.The exploitation of power is ubiquitous.This behavior is unacceptable and needs to be eliminated.Paula Wachowiak The 62-year-old told ABC News affiliate WKBW in Buffalo that she was a production assistant on one of Weinstein's earliest films when she was allegedly harassed.She said she worked mostly with an accountant on the film and took checks to get cashed at the local bank.One day she said she was asked to take some checks to Weinstein's room to be signed.She entered his room and realized he was holding a hand towel around his waist, she alleged.At one point, Weinstein removed his towel and sat down completely naked, she claimed.After reviewing the checks, she claimed he asked for a massage.She said she declined his overture.He signed the checks, she said, and she was then able to leave, she claimed.She said she later ran into Weinstein at the end of the shoot.According to Wachowiak, he asked her, "Was seeing me naked the highlight of your internship?"She said she responded, "No, Harvey, actually you disgust me."Lysette Anthony The British actress and star of "Hollyoaks" told the Sunday Times that she was only 19 years old when she met Weinstein in 1982.The actress said she and the producer kept in touch over the next few years, including having lunch in London from time to time."We had become friends," she said.But she told the Sunday Times that one night she met Weinstein for a drink and ended up back at his rented home where, she said, "The next thing I knew he was half-undressed, and he grabbed me."She can't say exactly when this happened, saying she is bad at remembering dates.She says she fled but tels the Times that then one evening when she was home with a friend her doorbell rang, and it was Weinstein."He pushed me inside and rammed me up against the coat rack."She said she tried pushing him off but he was too heavy."Finally I just gave up."Anthony alleges Weinstein then raped her.She said that last week she went to the local police."I can't stand by and see all these brave women tell the truth and not stand up alongside them," she told the paper.British actress Lysette Anthony has told the police she was raped by Harvey Weinstein in the late 1980s

actress claimed in an Instagram post that Weinstein once asked her to join him in his hotel room for a "general meeting," but after she claimed it made her uncomfortable, they met in a restaurant instead.Kelly claimed that after a five-minute conversation about film, Weinstein promised to give her "a lavish life" if she agreed to be his girlfriend."All I knew was not to offend this very powerful man and to get out of the situation as quickly as possible.I told him while flattered, I'd like to keep things professional," she wrote.She alleges, "He said 'Fine.I trust you won't tell anyone about this.'I said 'Of course not.Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me,' - the only way I could think to shut it down gracefully and excuse myself."I told him while flattered, I'd like to keep things professional - Minka Kelly Kelly added that she regretted her response and was speaking out in support of the other women who had come forward with their own stories about the film executive.Sophie Dix The English actress told The Guardian newspaper that in the early 1990s she went to Weinstein's hotel room to watch footage of her new film.He tried to pin her down and undress her, she alleged."He was really forceful," she said.After running to the bathroom, she said she opened the door to find him masturbating and later ran out when room service arrived.I decided if this was what being an actress is like, I dont want it, she said.Florence Darel Darel, a French actress, told Le Parisien that despite her reservations, she agreed to meet Weinstein in his hotel room in the mid-1990s at the behest of her agent.At the time, the film executive was still married to his first wife, Eve Chilton, so she was taken aback when he allegedly propositioned her."I told him I was very in love with my companion.He replied that it did not bother him at all and offered to have me become his mistress a few days a year.So we could work together," she claimed.She alleges that the implication was "basically, if you want to continue in America, go through me."Darel said she declined Weinstein's alleged advances.Claire Forlani The actress claimed on Twitter Thursday that she "escaped" from Weinstein on five different occasions.She claimed that at two meetings at the Peninsula Hotel nearly 20 years ago, she "ducked, dived and ultimately got out of there without getting slobbered over," and alleges that over the course of three dinners, he bragged to her about his famous conquests."I knew Harvey was a master manipulator," she wrote."I always thought I was a pro at handling these guys.I'd had a fair amount of experience.Sometimes I got angry.Really angry.I wondered why I had 'prey' stamped on my forehead."Kate Beckinsale Patrick McMullan via Getty Image The actress took to Instagram Thursday, claiming that she "was called to meet Harvey Weinstein at the Savoy Hotel when I was 17."Beckinsale, 44, said she assumed they'd meet in a conference room, but instead claimed she was told by the reception desk "to go to his room."He opened the door in his bathrobe - Kate Beckinsale "He opened the door in his bathrobe.I was incredibly naive and young and it did not cross my mind that this older, unattractive man would expect me to have any sexual interest in him.After declining alcohol and announcing that I had school in the morning I left, uneasy but unscathed," she claimed.Heather Graham Vivien Killilea/Getty Images The "Boogie Nights" actress wrote in Variety that Weinstein had allegedly implied that she had to sleep with him to be in one of his films."There was no explicit mention that to star in one of those films I had to sleep with him, but the subtext was there," she claimed."A few weeks later, I was asked to do a follow-up meeting at his hotel," she alleged."I called one of my actress friends to explain my discomfort with the situation, and she offered to come with me.En route, she called me to say she couldnt make it.Not wanting to be at the hotel alone with him, I made up an excuse -- I had an early morning and would have to postpone.Harvey told me that my actress friend was already at his hotel and that both of them would be very disappointed if I didnt show.I knew he was lying, so I politely and apologetically reiterated that I could no longer come by."Graham, 47, said she was "never hired for one of his films, and I didn't speak up about my experience."Cara Delevingne The actress said on social media Wednesday that she's had two allegedly inappropriate incidents with Weinstein.Delevingne, who has said that she is bisexual, alleged Weinstein once called to advise her against ever going public with a same-sex relationship for the good of her career.She also alleged that a year or so after that "odd and uncomfortable call," Weinstein brought her to a hotel room after a business meeting for an upcoming film, where she claims he asked her to kiss another woman before making a sexual advance himself.She rebuffed him and left.She shared that she later landed the role in the movie, but always questioned why.Delevingne and Weinstein worked together on the 2017 film "Tulip Fever.""Since then I felt awful that I did the movie.I felt like I didn't deserve the part," she wrote."I was so hesitant about speaking out....I didn't want to hurt his family.I felt guilty as if I did something wrong.I was also terrified that this sort of thing had happened to so many women I know but no one had said anything because of fear."La Seydoux The French actress wrote in The Guardian that she saw Weinstein allegedly acting inappropriate several times throughout her career.Seydoux also detailed one alleged incident when Weinstein invited her to "his hotel room for a drink."A female assistant then left

to give him an inch without him taking a mile.She said she confronted him and emerged physically unharmed by the experience but it was nonetheless shocking.Lauren Sivan In 2007, Sivan was a news anchor on Long Island 12, a local cable channel in New York, when she said she met Weinstein at a New York City restaurant.We talked about news, we talked about politics, we talked about our love of

with 20/20, Bindi alleges that Weinstein attacked her in 2010.At the time, she was a 29-year-old massage therapist working in Hollywood and said she met the film executive at a movie screening she attended with a friend.Bindi, who said she already had other high-profile Hollywood clientele, said Weinstein arranged for a massage appointment with her at the Montage Hotel.Then, he arranged for a second appointment.That time, she said, he was wearing a bathrobe when she walked into the hotel room and disrobed in front of her.Startled, Bindi said she stepped into the bathroom for a few moments.When she came back out, Bindi said he was lying on the massage table and she started the massage, though he cut it short.Bindi said Weinstein then got up and began asking her about his genitals.She said she ran into the bathroom and he followed her and started masturbating in front of her.Im like, Please, this is not appropriate, I do not feel comfortable.No.Do not do this in front of me.This is not OK.This is not professional behavior, she said.He continued to do it, and I tried to get by him.He grabbed me, started groping on my chest, and he kept going, and I pushed him away."Bindi told 20/20 she was shocked by what happened.She went to quickly pack up her massage stuff and then said Weinstein asked her if she wanted a book deal.I said, Sure, Bindi said.What am I going to do?...In just one second he could've destroyed my career, destroyed my reputation.The book deal never went through, she said, and she has never spoken publicly about what she said happened until now.He just faded away, she said.He invited me to some of his movie premieres, which I took friends to.I went because I wanted to meet people to get them as clients.I'm ashamed, but, what do you do?The only reason Im coming forward now, which I wasnt going to, Bindi continued.[Is] because there were 10 girls already who came forward.Paula Williams Williams said she was a working model and an aspiring actress who had been living in Los Angeles for about a year when she said she met Weinstein at an Oscar party in 1990.She said Weinstein then invited her to a dinner party he said he was having with other people she should meet.On the night of the party, Williams, then 20 years old, said Weinstein sent a car for her that took her to a house in Hollywood Hills.I walk in, and its just Harvey, she told 20/20.He immediately starts massaging my neck as I walk in so I know right away that this is going to be uncomfortable.Williams said she excused herself to go out on a balcony to smoke a cigarette and compose herself.When she went back inside, Williams said Weinstein had opened a bottle of champagne, and said, I dont think I had a sip and he exposed himself.Williams said she quickly went to the door and walked out.She said she zigzaged her way through neighbors backyards, trying to get away from the house, and never looked back.She said she hasnt spoken publicly about her experience until now, and has lived in shame of what she said happened ever since.The reason why I didn't like talking about it and the reason why I would never come public with it before is, it was a deep shame, Williams said.[When] Gwyneth [Paltrow] said something in the press about it, and she had experiences as well.And all of a sudden I just felt it lifted.
Ashley Judd opens up to Diane Sawyer about Harvey Weinstein allegations:::::When actress and activist Ashley Judd was debating whether to come forward with allegations that movie producer Harvey Weinstein had sexually harassed her, she had no idea whether anyone would care about or believe her accusations or similar ones from dozens of other women.Interested in Harvey Weinstein?Add Harvey Weinstein as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Harvey Weinstein news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest "I'm very blessed to be here," Judd told Sawyer in her first television interview about her Weinstein allegations.I made the most important decision I'll ever make years ago, which is to turn my will and my life over to the care of a loving God, and it was like, I'm so taken care of.I'm totally going to do this, Judd said she also talked with her parents about going forward, and she said her mother, singer Naomi Judd, told her to go get him.Perpetrators are shameless, Ashley Judd said.And they put their toxic shame onto their victims, which we then internalize and carry around with us.Judd, 49, is one of more than 60 women who have come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against the movie mogul.Nearly 20 women allege the misconduct occurred in the late 90s around the same time Judd said she had an inappropriate encounter with him.Judds coming forward helped spark a conversation and an online campaign called, #MeToo, in which people used the hashtag to reveal they had been victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment, was shared millions of times on social media."Some of my friends have come forward, and some of them have not," Judd said."We have more #MeToo's to help liberate others."Oscar winners Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow, Lupita Nyong'o and Mira Sorvino claimed that they rebuffed Weinstein's unwanted advances.Other women have alleged sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape."I'm very sorry for Gwyneth," Judd said."I am delighted that she came forward.I think it's incredibly powerful she did.At the time, I didn't know that I knew anything."Weinstein has denied all allegations.A spokesperson for the movie executive told The New Yorker: "Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr.Weinstein.""Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.Mr. Weinstein obviously cant speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual," according to the full statement from Weinstein's spokesperson."Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path.Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance."Play Twenty years ago, the Kentucky native was a young actress filming the movie Kiss the Girls when she said Weinstein invited her to a Beverly Hills hotel for a business meeting."I had a business appointment which is as-- that's, you know, his pattern of sexual predation.That was how he rolled," she said.But when she got there, she said Weinstein, now 65, had her sent up to his room."And I was like, ugh, are you kidding me?'"she said.At the time, Judd said, she had already experienced sexual predation.She has written about being sexually assaulted as a young girl and the terror of feeling trapped during such situations.When she got to Weinstein's room, Judd said Weinstein asked to give her a massage and then asked for her to give him one, she added."I fought with this volley of nos, which he ignored," Judd said."Who knows?Maybe he heard them as maybe.Maybe he heard them as yeses.Maybe they turned him on."She said he steered her into a hallway near a closet and asked her to pick out his suit to wear for the day."I have totally frozen in my mind the floor plan... and where the door was behind me, and then eventually where that closet was," she said.Judd said she wouldn't sit down, but remained standing as she cowered in the hall for a few minutes.At one point, she said Weinstein asked her to come into the bathroom and watch him take a shower.Exasperated, Judd said she offered a sort of deal to Weinstein to get him to back off so she could leave."He kept coming back at me with all this other stuff," she said."And finally I just said, 'When I win an Oscar in one of your movies, OK?'And he was like, 'Yeah, when you get nominated.'I said, 'No, when I win an Oscar.'And then I just fled.'"After she left Weinstein's hotel room, Judd said she told her parents some details about what had happened said they could see she was visibly shaken.She said she also told agents and others who worked in Hollywood, but no action was taken."I knew it was disgusting," she said."And if I could go back retrospectively with a magic wand and say ...I wish I could prevent it for anyone always.'And, no, I don't know that I would have been believed.And who was I to tell?"At the time, Judd said, she didn't feel powerful enough to come forward.She recalled once sitting at a table with a few other actresses in the late-1990s and Weinstein walked by."And I was like, 'Let me just make sure that you know this, in case it hasn't happened to you yet,'" Judd said of what she told the other women."And they were like, 'Oh, yeah, yeah, he did that.Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.'And I was like, 'Oh, my gosh.'"Judd said she was at a dinner event in 1999 when she decided to confront Weinstein.She said Weinstein was talking to her and said, "Remember that little agreement we made?Think I've got that script for you.""He was across from me at a table, and...I had come into my own.I had come into my power.I had found my voice, and I was coming right at him," she said."And he looked at me, across the table and he said, 'You know, Ashley, I'm going to let you out of that little agreement we made.'""And then I said, 'You do that Harvey, you do that.'And he has spat my name at me ever since."Judd first came forward with these allegations three weeks ago in an interview with the New York Times.She had also previously shared these allegations in a 2015 interview with Variety, though she didnt name Weinstein at that time.In the wake of the allegations, Weinstein was terminated by the board of the Weinstein Company and later resigned from the board of directors.He was also expelled by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.After Judd came forward, Weinstein released a photo of him and Judd holding hands at a Vanity Fair Oscar Party, but Judd said the photo shows a terrified woman."I hoped I wouldn't pass him, but I did and he, obviously, grabbed my hand," she said."It's like the look on my face is abject terror.I can see it in my eyes.""It's very gross.It's very gross.I feel bad for that 28, 29-year-old woman," she said of her younger self.Play Looking back what happened, Judd said that part of her feels ashamed that she didn't say "no" at the start and part of her is proud of herself for getting out of that situation."We all do the best we can, and our best is good enough," Judd added."And it's really OK to have responded however we responded."Judd said she wasn't sure if she could ever confront Weinstein again.When asked if she thought he belonged in jail, Judd said, "If he's a rapist, he absolutely should go to jail.""I believe that there is hope and help for everyone.It has to be the appropriate help.And there has to be a real, profound understanding on the part of the sexual predator that what they were doing was wrong and criminal."She has turned to her faith to find peace."When I spoke at the United Nations on the modern slave trade, I said my prayers beforehand," she said."I actually prayed last week and I said, 'Dear God, in case I forget to pray, please let this be the prayer.'"Play What she would say to Weinstein today, she said, "is, 'I love you and I understand that you are sick and suffering, and there is help for a guy like you, too, and it's entirely up to you to get that help."Judd said this is just the kind of person she is."Frankly, it's an easier way to roll through the world than the alternative," she said.

Kelly Clarkson's 'Meaning of Life' is a mature, soulful record:::::Kelly Clarksons Meaning of Life **** Meaning of Life is the eighth album from the original American Idol, Kelly Clarkson, and it is a mature, deeply soulful record with a lot of grit and a lot of heart.Throughout the set, Clarkson sings with a bellowing rasp that seems informed by years of listening to classic Aretha Franklin records.Mostly, with its combination of classic soul and blues elements combined with modern electro-pop engineering, she ends up sounding a bit like an American answer to Joss Stone.This album builds off of 2015s Piece by Piece, but while that record was mostly rooted in a lovable retro-eighties nostalgia, this record has deeper, older roots, even if you Love So Soft also works as a possible pop banger of sorts.Amazon This may be pop but it isnt juvenile.Clarkson is singing with the voice of a grown woman.One listen to the sensual Slow Dance or the authoritative calland-response, pseudo-Stax stomp of Whole Lotta Woman and it is no doubt that Clarkson is a downright stunning talent.Her voice is versatile and can bend in a variety of directions.The high flourishes on Cruel recall a young Mariah Carey while the title track goes from a classic lullaby to a near marching-band strut and all along Clarkson effectively serves an anchoring leader.Clarksons now extensive collection of hit records since her debut proves that the fact that she won the first season of American Idol was no fluke.Few singers working in pop today are as flexible and malleable as Clarkson.You can hear her influences all over the place but at the same time, she still sounds like herself.Shes aiming to be a legend.In a way, Meaning of Life does fit in the modern pop universe but at the same time, it also sounds like Clarkson is following her muse, knowing that if she delivers something powerful, hits will come.She often sounds like she is singing straight from the core of her being This album sounds simultaneously engineered and organic.That is a truly rare combination.Focus Tracks: Slow Dance How did you go from being a Mamas Boy to a Ladies Man?Clarkson sings, as if she is in the process of a deep swoon.This is one of the best and most affecting songs in her entire catalog.It is rich with sweat and skill.It sounds like a classic ballad.Go High This booming electro number is a fascinating way to close the record, awaking Clarksons inner disco diva.Even the pitch-shifting effects sound cool in the mix.Move You Another vintage-sounding number, this takes a subtle build and makes it sound like something momentous.Clarkson slowly raises her voice and it creates quite a stir.When she lifts into another octave, it adds some power but mostly this is a deeply nuanced performance.You cant obtain this level of vocal control.Missed reviews on the latest from Rachel Platten and Weezer here.
Rose McGowan tears up amid strong support at Women's Convention:::::Today, Rose McGowan stepped out of the shadows and away from the virtual public forum of Twitter to speak at the Women's Convention in Detroit.Interested in Harvey Weinstein?Add Harvey Weinstein as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Harvey Weinstein news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The actress Rose McGowan made her first public remarks since she became one of the dozens of women accusing now-disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct."I have been silenced for 20 years," McGowan said."I have been slut-shamed.I have been harassed."McGowan delivered the opening speech on Friday morning at the event that included forums and discussions arranged by organizers of the Women's March using what they call "nonviolent resistance ... committed to dismantling systems of oppression.""What happened to me behind the scenes happens to all of us in this society," McGowan said."That cannot stand and will not stand ... We are free.We are strong.We are one massive collective voice."The actress, well known for her starring role in the series "Charmed," was among the women cited in an initial New York Times report earlier this month as having settled harassment claims against Weinstein.McGowan didn't comment for the article.Aaron Thornton/Getty Images Since that time, McGowan has used Twitter to support other accusers and to seemingly accuse Weinstein of raping her."I told the head of your studio that HW raped me," she wrote on Twitter a couple weeks back.She later confirmed she was referring to Weinstein in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter the next day.Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images, FILE McGowan did not name Weinstein in her talk today but may have been alluding to him in her reference to "the monster" who is dominating headlines and in comparing herself to a small-town girl assaulted by a local football star, only to see the crime covered up.She also didn't name President Donald Trump by name but appeared to allude to comments he made about women in an exchange with a television host in 2005."Grab them by the p----," Trump is heard saying in the recording that became public during the 2016 presidential campaign.Then-candidate Trump issued a statement describing the exchange as "locker room banter" and apologizing "if anyone was offended."McGowan told the crowd at the Women's Convention today, "I came to be a voice for all who have been told we are nothing.""For all of us whove been looked down on, for all of us who have been grabbed by the mother f------ p----.No more," she said.The actress also spoke to the roaring audience about "monsters," saying it's time for women to speak out."No more will we be shunted to the side, no more will we be hurt," McGowan said."Its time to be brave in the face of unspeakable actions."She referred directly to Hollywood, calling it a male-dominated environment, "Its time to clean house."Through representatives, Weinstein has repeatedly denied allegations of rape, with a spokesperson for Weinstein saying again Tuesday in a statement to ABC News, "Any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr.Weinstein."The board of the Weinstein Co. terminated the producer, and he later tendered his resignation from the board.He was also expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the Producers Guild of America has voted to begin proceedings to oust him.A final determination in that case will be made next month.McGowan later spoke at an afternoon panel called "Fighting for survivors of sexual assault in the age of Betsy DeVos."She noticeably teared up at the start while she was being introduced and when she talked about her social media movement of followers called "Rose Army."She said her supporters online are a "virtual flash mob" who call out injustices.McGowan later spoke about how assault is depicted in films, saying that men from a young age learn by watching movies that a "real man" is macho and a fighter, like Rocky Balboa.She also mentioned "Game of Thrones" in connection with concerns about female characters being abused on screen and referred to Seth MacFarlane's controversial joke at the 2013 Oscars about "we saw your boobs," all as signs of the problems for women in society."We have no rights, there is no such thing as sexual harassment laws" in Hollywood, McGowan said.The actress said she has been doing advocacy on this issue for years and plans to continue it on and off the internet."Monsters have been after me for years and years trying to do everything possible to eradicate me from this Earth and I will not go," she said to a standing ovation.
Mandy Moore praises mother and 2 brothers who came out: 'Nobody is hiding who they are':::::After Mandy Moore revealed last year that her mother left her father for a woman and that her two brothers are gay, the "This Is Us" star is opening up about her family dynamics.Moore, 33, told People magazine that her family is "extraordinarily close" and she's happy the three had the courage to come out."Nobody is hiding who they are.There are no secrets in our lives," she continued."I love and support my mom and my brothers with my whole heart.And nothing makes me happier than seeing anybody live their authentic self and to choose love."If anyone can find love, I support it, I salute you, and I celebrate that," she added.Moore and Dawes frontman Taylor Goldsmith got engaged last month, after meeting on Instagram.Andrew Toth/Getty Images "I feel a certain amount of protectiveness," Moore said of her family.She added that she "definitely won't stand for" any kind of intolerance against gays and lesbians."But I feel like we're at a time in our culture when we're able to have a much more open dialogue," she said in the magazine."I'm encouraged and excited that eventually we're going to get to a point where none of this matters.Sexual preference or orientation just won't factor in anymore.I think we're inching closer to that."It's part of why Moore loves portraying Rebecca Pearson, the matriarch on the hit show "This Is Us," about a family through the years."I've never been a part of a project where people are willing to be so vulnerable," she said of the series."The dialogue that this has engendered is mind boggling.Every day that I drive in to work, I think, 'Thank you, universe.I don't know what I did.'"But music lovers, don't fret.There's still hope that Moore will return to music.Her most recent album, "Amanda Leigh," was released in 2009.HPA via Newscom Moore told ABC News' "Popcorn With Peter Travers" earlier this year that she misses making music."I miss writing.I miss performing.I miss making records," she added.Moore's 1999 debut song, "Candy," was an immediate hit.But she said it wasn't necessarily the kind of music she would create today."I hadn't even lived a life that warranted singing about anything that I knew at that point, you know?I hadn't really loved anyone or, like, had my heart broken at 15 or 16," she said."Now I could write all about that stuff with my eyes closed.A divorced woman," she said, referring to her 2015 split from indie rocker Ryan Adams, her husband for nearly six years."I have so much to say."

nearly he's yet no small.Those are local and pieces the stuff on the walls are masters as so it would animal handlers out we go back to that and make a fresh mold.Most are molds or plaster we do have fiber glass and plastic and.And how do you decide what to do I mean you've got aliens you've got looks like some sort of vampire thing I mean.Are you are you getting customer feedback as it demand like more vampires mark how to decide what crazy weird thing to do.I think mostly we kind of watch what the cultures up to you know there's a lot of vampire movies well tried to vampires.But a lot of it's just.What would be weird what would people want you know trying to figure out what the next big thing is has been a challenge for forty years trying to figure that out.What has been the trend this year for the last couple years LG.You know who.I think that big thing in the last probably five years or more has been zombies prior to that it was vampires in this league.So weeks we've sold a lot of of zombies which is one of my favorites I'd like zombies and aliens I'm not so much and amp arts especially.Attractive teenage campers they don't ask.Territory.Problem.Beat yeah I was gonna say

you're telling me about.You had a mask of the month club are still doing and know that we replaced it with monster of the shadows and it's more like.Every quarter but this this was your room.That is what will now see this once kind of special and dear to my heart yen.We the first mass bicycle it was Andromeda and so this is the fourth version of Andromeda and the last version and that.And so that

Former NHL player Sean Avery on new memoir Video:::::Transcript for Former NHL player Sean Avery on new memoir Welcome inside the ABC studios in Manhattan New York Nikola Causley here with the great one Rangers agitator former enforcer.Former vogue intern and now author Sean Avery Sean played on it and thanks around me the great one the GR a TE it not to be confused with the way yes I am confused and laser.Yeah.But.All right so let's break it down I mean how did.Writing a book compare to getting mentally prepared for an NHL season.Yeah I mean I figured.Which seemed because.So the book.Is based off of a template.By Jim bowden's ball four which I think is.One of the most famous and and while written sports memoirs in the last forty years.I cottages rolled into it what I did was I actually use the schedule.From my first year to my roster and I use that as assert in my memory markers arms look at.Game one of my first season in the NHL.And then everything served to kind of flat open or general in the pal only talks calling first further their goals or assists.And it's CO replete Chicago that night Bob crow worked one to kill me Scotty Bowman save my life.Now months in the next months or it was a fun process.Take a lot of go back after all all the different box yeah it was.It's amazing how much.How much information there is online now and you and and that that they do a great job of showing the history of select you can find anything.As far as minutes played shots on call the whole the whole gamut so.It did it took a few months to initially dipped at the time line and sort of the the rough bones and outlined by the there it was a two year process altogether did you go back to the fights and the OPEC insurers which one you thought he had dealt with the best ones to write about yet and I I talked about the I think that the good thing about the book is that.I'm very vulnerable and I don't talk about just my goals and and the great moments the man there's there's a lot of there's a DV west caught fire it is the first fight ever had in the end NHL that I got knocked down and so interest in stuff that you know.I'm not a embarrassed talk about the about fights because.You can have is is in May whether this is that you're not fifty you know in your in your NHL career you go losses and those of the fund stories.Yet but and you an unbelievable job I think what I found most interesting is how you UN indeed few you're in your love life urine and the good and the bad of Sean Avery.And a lot of the book is controversy when she was like you followed you throughout your NHL career.Why do you think that was what was so controversial.About Sean Avery.Well I think that.Over certain amount of time it became more about the person.Then the actual.Incidents like if you look at the sloppy seconds incident.Yeah noticed the leaks have meter rehab for thirty days with with drug addicts and alcoholics.It's funny because I. I asked for the report from facility in Malibu.And it took them a few months to get its me because I was gonna put it in the pocket and it was two pages and I called them back and said.Did you guys for debt tabs the more pages assuming that you know I was there for thirty days medically they probably have more records.And they said now that said you know.Worried we'd see you you were really.Weren't supposed to Clean Air Act and both pages set I was in our success which I said to you know of course from a narcissistic and an athlete.Most athletes are narcissus you have to be in our system to be grade at and at spore.So I think.The crimes didn't fit the punishments a lot of the time and certainly as time went on an acre as account mascara there are trying to.Get ahead of me on certain extent.Do you think that your reputation wishing to procedure were you able to use that's your advantage on the ice towards the later parts of your career were you able to.To intimidate players are cause more Havoc just based off of that the villain as you say that you play.Yeah I mean I'm sure Marty Broder wrote the schedule the start of the season saw when he was playing the Rangers.Before.The season even started and we hadn't even created any friction that based on the previous season.You know that that the timeline of Rangers doubles so I had done advantage where I know guys could look at the schedule.I also know that before games coaches would say you know.Don't let Avery get in your head type of thing and I think that when that was the conversation I was doing my job and ours ours to right.One coaches is talking about you pregame and then then you ready won the battle.Back to the allies are copper comments just because it stood out to me it's the one thing that you seem to regret and I think rightfully so you know.But I'm sure if she'll fall the Rangers last year's playoffs I believe it was Kreider who fought for enough now.The legend of Sean Avery returned to advise G they'd did you hear the.Chan yeah I mean listen that the ranger fans are.They're they're not very forgiving and the sense that.They're also New Yorkers and blur are rated.Type of of of commentary in a game is unlike any other Dan.So I I'd definitely sap back and and saw what was going on as far as talking about it in the block.I talk about it the sense that.I don't regret anything that I've ever set over the course of my career.But not certain instance.There is a person that I was.Intimately.Involved.With in my life for for big part of my life and you don't I regret.Bringing her into a conversation.And I think that bouts when I look back about it I can't keep saying I regret this because I don't immigrants here is not that you hurt someone much.Yes there somebody that you know I had.A personal relationship with that that everybody else really wasn't privy to so I think its interest seen.When.You make mistakes like that I think it's you know and you wind you have to come to peace with that person and then you try and move downwards after.You talk about you're you're part of your game was an act.Was that the only time in your career worthy act crossed over into your off ice life.I think that that's.That's sicker question no I I think that you know.World where what were person right what sports and what's amazing about sports is.They give you this cost human they'll allow you to do things that you're not allowed to do in your regular life.And the lines sometimes can crossed you know were allowed to do things as athletes and we're actually.Promoted when we do things as athletes that you can't do in your regular life but you're still that person's still.You walk away it is you have to look at yourself at the end of the nine Amir.So that was probably the the most obvious time weren't word life smeared Mir at the game.He talked about in the book the NHL doesn't promote its players very well I think that's accurate they that they don't like.Or they don't really shine on personalities in less it's the big guns and you see it.With yield back in the day.You can say there was controversy and and I understand that but someone in today's game like PK issue bonds who is known first charity work and is this an is that.And you see him getting.Hated on by certain analysts turn dance in pregame murder you know for further at this style of his game do you think that that kind of his.The NHL way.Yeah I do I think.I think it's it's ridiculous because when these people criticize.Somebody like Putin Sudan.There are only doing it for clicked it's it's it's concerts such a selfish place because.I know the fans love it.The love that that the fans are craving.For athletes to show some of their personality.The conversation now today is were so sick and tired or hearing the same conversation.From athletes after the game.And there's a great part in the book which I pick was the most fun I hadn't writing a book right do.Sort of a mock interview had.Which is unrelated to the full deeds hello Andre it that's sick extremely.That's what's going in are now on in our had and you could play a sound bite.And initially replace the guy's face and it would be the same sound bite from every single player in the league.And you know the fans don't want to hear they're tired of it.And you see the one guy who now gets a bit of the exception is doctor Wright but even you go back yard is playing days in Washington.He was malign he got traded to the Rangers for Anson Carter like it was a giveaway and he revived his career in New York right before you got there.There's a threshold I think where once a player reaches a certain point that's when the NHL allows their personality out but it's a jogger watt.Fourteen years in the league to get there.Yen you know our yards is one of the most interest being funny.European players that I ever played wrath and I don't think can tell he got to in new York and he sort of assert a carver relationship with Larry Brooks that you saw.They use his how much he loved the game one.How much of a big kid he was and how funny and and sarcastic and self deprecating years at times a lot of the time.And they don't show that it's always Crosby overmatched in.Let's just show the head to head for the 38 time in the last three years and it's boring you know the fans don't want to see it.There's a great story about jogger and how superstitious he has now.How long did his tone als actually get now I mean ever get to a point where it was dangerous because if you took a shot.If you if you got a shot off its four.You know it is toenails would basically explode off of its toes.So.Yards as a crazy soup I mean I saw him sometimes in games he did his skates sharpened fifteen times.There is one of the I've never seen a player so particular about their creme and and so superstitious about everything from cuttings state.Two.Obviously cutting its tone and cut his stage I mean how many times he retired his state before.He would take a bite or I wouldn't put anything past or are crazy.It's you know I look at it as being.Focus on on a level that regular people don't understand.There are that it just that it takes over his life.How big of a role do you think and be played in their perception of Sean Avery because.You say the bucket and it's accurate or somebody who lived through the heart of the Sean Avery error as as a kid.And who loved every second of the garden chanting Avery.You are probably the most talked about third liner ever in the NHL and that is where you don't see.He even hardcore fans of the average Joseph can't name the average third line out there in the NHL do you think that that and be played a role in why people.Tried to shut down Sean Avery.Yeah I think it's what it's one of the reasons why.I was actually even given an opportunity in the league is that when I came in on Detroit there was no anti there is no.There is there wasn't anyone in addressing a room that worst you know upset that that I was who otherwise there was.Eleven hall of famers there were all extremely comfortable with where they were in their life where they were and their career.And then as you start going.And and certainly when I got now weigh in and you sit across from guys that are saying themselves poll wise this guy popular he's the same type players Siam.There we make the same amount of money I've actually played more NHL games in hand.So that was always a four find balance that I ever benched in story weren't worth to grow over time LA who.He got to realize that because slew convinced Pollard for a long time there's always something that I bounced in and there was always something that.It was tough there was it was difficult to manage.They sound that comes from the winning culture that Detroit established Detroit you know that's a little thing that they're gets swept under the rug and you talked about the difference between.Detroit and maybe that's one of of them the mattress.In the NHL's Faris organization's go now and then you go to LA it's before they were winningest before called a TARP quick.It's after Gretzky you know there are no man's land almost out there in LA is that a losing out of.To almost the attic dig through the winning organizations don't nip here they don't.They don't micromanage.Day let.The morning guys 25 guys certainly in the hockey world.They let them police the room and that's one thing I talk about also aware.Certainly when we talk about the pro guard situation.Taking a guy out of an environment where it's a safe zone and the and players police each other.Is that.The biggest detriment an organization can put on our on a dressing room and coaches that micro managed general managers and micromanage.They're Indian party put me on double secret probation when I get when I was an LA.He hadn't even met me yet you know I that was my first meaning I had with them and r.s thirty on double secret probation.At that point I don't even know fight ever even been suspended in the NHL so.It's it's it was always an interest in old school mentality that I was always fighting against and you know that this tried to stints there had a bit to a certain extent.Do you think that you would be perceived differently in in today's show you hit on your internship at vogue in the block the and become lower and groom her end who will.And he Shea back and it's really not that long ago but it's a much different world today that it was.Then do you think your perception because you never.Its not like you're out there committing crimes and you hit on that the difference between York.Issues in the NHL I'd like every other sport and even other players in the NHL who get.You wanna say free passes by know it happens it's handled it's done it doesn't follow them around whereas your stuff.You know followed you for your entire career and it wasn't.Caught.He I mean I think now it's it's too it's too it's a double what sort of their because.Everyone has the ability tip to creative movement through social media.So anyone can sit at home and say I don't like the sky.I don't like what he just said and I'm gonna rally all the troops behind me and we're gonna bang down some doors and tell.You know he pays the pays a price.So and that.Situation I think.It would've been it was there was an advantage to calmer earlier increased social media sort of say.The other part part of that is the perception in.I did an inter chip evoke.Few years later became the hot cool thing to do right Dwyane Wade did one and GQ were or men's vogue after me.Certainly fashion now is accepted across the board and sports it's almost it's promoted.It's.The Cam Newton did.His interviews after the game the alpha or talked about more than the comments on top and and and were ten years ago it was our walked on a plane in Dallas with a short certain they told me to go home and change and plane waited like.It's a totally dip different space now but I think it's it's it's more dangerous because of the effect assertion mean in how people can.You know fight these wars.Without really being informed Bryant that mob mentality do you think you could count our acted as though by having a voice because it.At that time I mean outside beat writers social media wasn't a thing.The the message was controlled by the week down yeah I definitely think com.Me personally it would have been an advantage because I don't back down on on my social channels and I don't get I don't get afraid.That initial wave of people trying to start that movement right.You can't be intimidated by a when you believe.That where you're saying is is is not the double.And you know about street in trouble that's for guys that's really where guys are afraid to speak up and why EC certainly the NHL.It's not worth it for guys now they don't want to take the risk.Our I want to get back to to Andy Cohen because you were really one of the first professional athletes to to come out.In support of equality say you know and gay marriage and all that and now it's much.More weights except that entered into its spoken about regularly and rightfully so.But.What you did then does it really get the coverage that it probably should dessert.Yeah I mean I think that what doesn't get talked about is the fact that Jim Dolan who's the owner of the Rangers.In.Allowed me to do a public service announcement for marriage equality in New York State NN New York ranger Jersey.And I think that.Todd I had an owner.That I was somewhat nervous.Bouts.Expressing my position on and marriage equality.I would never gone nearest.Iris lucky to have a guy like like.Like Jim don't do the owner of the team where I understood that.He embraced personalities.Is a loyal guy.Very open minded.I was in a position to be the lucky to be able to do something like that's when when the they passed.I said yeah no problem.I'd also played into markets and lived in.West Hollywood and an ally owners claim for the kings and MI came in new York and lived in Chelsea's are surrounded by.The LG BT community and and it was just part of who I was at that point.But stand alone because he.For the most part is vilified a new York and I think one thing that I found very interesting and an ice capades here.Was that you humanize.James don't you and you call him one of the best owners in sports here's a guy who doesn't want on the while.But he always putting the money.And to these teams had it easy nothing he does is the reason they loses as far as additions and at some decisions he makes report.But it's not for a lack of after no I mean from a player standpoint.I would.There would be tough to find a player that says that Jim dawns not the best owner in sports because.We have the best planes we have the best hotels are the best food we have the best equipment we have the best trainers.We have the best of everything Rainier are paying Knick or ranger.And as an owner there's nobody more loyal as well that's part of what gets him in trouble I think sometime certainly the Isaiah situation.Look at you know he hired Isiah Bach he's a loyal loyal man that that really respects.His athletes.And I think that.And I got in trouble in California got arrested at my house and moral can infer.And there's a party and some cops there were a little bit there you know been about mirrored nerves about situation.And before I know it.I'm at the station.And I have Blair Berk who represented Mel Gibson and a lot of big big names is my lawyer.Duct income from anyone other than the top of the rangers' organization.Dots as a player you can't get a better owner than it's as good as it deaths.That's awesome your.And I think that's a opinion of him that is it might be widespread among suppliers but it's not.Shared publicly you know outside an inch in storyline for certainly in New York when.In it's the bash.Dolan train ride.But if you know they have gardeners dreams they have stayed they are an organization.From a business standpoint.That do so much for the city of New York.And I guess the good thing is that with the exception of a few occasions.Jim Dolan doesn't.Get fazed by it he's a pro with the media.He is understood the New York market and how to manage it as well as anybody could considering how much heat.The guy takes.Gregory and you know staying with the Rangers here and dole and John Turturro plays a huge team in this book yeah.Was it is bad as.I mean as a fan and I so morrow followed the Rangers I didn't really grasp how bad it was your relationship which order Ella was that bad.Yeah yeah I mean as somebody told us for a story yesterday that hacked I just kind of shook my hand.Where fifth.A reporter's phone rang.And a scrum after a game he would kicked them out of the meeting.And that was the mentality of back guy he micro manage everything there's a story about me being on the set a money ball.And day a call from turner rallies to do these as these checking calls with me.And I think it was to see that I was somewhere that didn't agree with the hockey world.And annexing an arm on a plane coming home from California I never ended up shooting the movie.That was that the relationship.And as soon as you tell me that I can't do something it always goes in the opposite direction.Why do you think that was because throughout the book due keeps they can it your goal to win them over and your your play.Rightfully so what time should have won them over you were a key piece.On some very good ranger teams maybe not the most talented teams in the league but I will say it seemed like toward a relic got a lot as far as hardworking.Talent goes from his players in her beloved by long quest say they're like Xu.Your your friends with cabaret coo who tore Eloise had problems with but.Is there's do you think there's something looking back that you could've done better to win over him or did you are are you happy with the effort that he put into that.No I mean I think if violent dark and think you're fire out of wanted to continue being a hockey player the best thing action I would have done is as had mean traded.As quick as possible when I Kieran of the turnaround situation you know.That was less sour relationship this was.Nonexistent from the moment that I came into the situation because he had previously written me on television Canada and you know.It was a whole thing so.I couldn't have done anything different for that.Relationship I worked as hard as I can.It's really a testament to how much I love new York and how much I love the Rangers really is as how I stock through it.It's tough corner work every day when you know your boss is doing everything in his power to accurate if he does his success today in Columbus surprise you.Now I mean.You know I think.Nothing surprises me in sports at this point and he's a prepared coach he puts the time men.He.Has won before.When I tiger a people in my relationships in the book.I talk about my relationships and I don't generally for the most part trying.At an attack the work that they've put in more they've got I criticized some of these coaches and say.It's tough for them understand hockey player when they never played.Diapers they think if I'm running a billion dollar business the guy that's running it.Has been in the trenches doing exactly what he's telling people they need to do.So sports is a funny thing it's it's it's an inch seam path where.Sometimes people learn positions that.They say the right things and they do that do all the right things at times and that's at different thing behind closed doors now.Interest and.Let's let's get to the Rangers here.Any other good stories in the book we can't go into details about the one story about long quest and it yeah I had if you wanna phony story that that should make you laugh.Read the book because it it's great about the king outside of that other any other Hendrick Lundqvist stories that the public doesn't know.Yeah I mean I thick I talk a lot of our tanks focus and how prepared he is going into games.And we're always catered the soundtrack before game two to Hanks.Desires.And I think that.The Swedish singer Robin she had a big song early on.And we listened to that song probably for six years in a row you know that song I I heard that song every single day for so many years.Well pass the top chart topping years of that Sandra sighting is just inches seeing when you see the the the little tidbits of guys your favorite player things that.He never really hear about my and you know there's another goalie in this area but you had some run ins with and I mean some Robinson Marty Brodeur.Was there anything.That was off limits and our rivalry with Brodeur.No I mean you know.More I think about me when I trash talked and ever made things up.I always dues that's apparent in the book I always use things that were reality.And like if something's true.If you've done something and your characters questioned because because of that then army to use that as an opportunity.To really go right to the core of it.Because my job.It's very clear I need to do whatever I can to put my team in an advantage.An outside of you know.Going in Sioux.Certain things like.Disease.Alcoholism.Sexuality.Preference.Those are the things that I stayed away from everything else was on the table and I'll never apologize for it.Because that's what I was there to do you work.The the the eight every rule was he saying anything to you when yours then there.Look at him in the eyes now the only fled the fighting about doubts Chris jury came over and whispered something in and to my year.And he he said yeah I'll paraphrase without the without the with that with the PG rating out of it minority.They're gonna they're gonna get you.I was basically lectures sent.Birders eyes just went from there was like in a cartoon received that the boiling water come up and two others into the characters' eyes.That's who was happening repairman at the whites of his eyes just are going router.And redder and tell they got to the top and and he looked like.A it was like the double he wanted.He he was so confused and so up sat at that moment and I'll never forget it because I'm the only one that had privy to those eyes through the mask.And it's something I'll never forgot.And and less than thirty seconds later what makes it great it's not just the act of dancing in front of a with a hand in his face.It's got to be the goal and that Ed and and that's just a good hockey play here in the right position.What was his reaction when you scored after that entire ordeal.I could see.It was like letting in the air out of it was like popping a kids balloons.And I think that's the best way I could put it just the ultimate.Deflation.At the a moment and obviously we were at home and it was a big game.He it was a series of events that I'll never forget because I I just had such a great vantage point four.Yeah I mean I've gone back and watched those videos on YouTube but he doesn't shake your hand.That is one of the most underrated I think rivalries in sports because you torture and out a hall of Famer and now we're talking in a guy who's probably considered.A top three goaltender in NHL history.Yeah you know.I was I had the city of New York behind me.And when you feel that that momentum wave come over you.One you don't want to ever disappointment.To you feel untouchable.And there's no better feeling when when a city like this gets behind you and and and roots for your views.You're on top of the world I mean.I think that's what everybody is craving for in the movies and in in your dreams is to it to be able to take over the city of new York and certainly.Ranger fans now with now is as good as a cup for me.And you did it wasn't just Brodeur.We could talk about Mike Richards you know there are few rivalries that you created shear that.I mean the way you word to word and MSG is reserved for.The greats I mean right now the only remote Lee come parable excitement that a player brings outside of long quest.Is may be you corral opening it's in a different way I mean I'm.Superstars.Through the last decade outside of yarder weren't adored by the fans like Sean Avery Y.As the I mean I I had this uncanny ability to.The arena.Champ my name bridge I've seen a few.Athletes have the ability to do it our son incredible.Night one night when LeBron scored fifty points in the garden and their chanting his name.Hendrick Lundqvist could could curator at the drop of our hot in the heyday.It's inch seeing now you go to games and it it's sort of lost that magic in somebody's been asking me what which you say if you're on the Rangers right now Howard you're trying get them out of their funk.What I say it's their team that has the pleasure playing in and New York Madison square earned its use that as an advantage.Tap into that marine and tap into the fans.And make that that the most exciting place that you get to walk into on a daily basis are locked in their MSG.You talk about these fights the famous concerts I got to go in their forty times a year.You know bouts of privilege that no awfully.Should take for granted and and that you should taken squeeze every.Minute of that and use that as your seventh ban.The Rangers are struggling this year do you think they're missing.A little bit of that juice and is that it and NHL wide thing because fighting his way down you know.It's not even slowly but surely anymore it's trying to be.Removed.From that game.Do you think that plays a role in the lack of energy especially MSG.Yeah army in you see it.The results grounds there's known as a talker wrote in the book you went to see you Sean Avery when he was playing for the Rangers.And it was a coin toss you had no idea what was gonna happen there could have been a brawl on warm up.And there could have been a bench clearing brawl by it the first period their curb I mean you never knew what was gonna happen.Now I went to a game my first game since I I retired.Rangers against torture all last week.Nothing happens I mean you could falsely literally the most exciting part of the game was seeing the funny videos.Up on the screen so.I don't know why.Guys have in.Taken the advantage to stand out and it's very.Mundane.Of environment across the board.Now equality in the product of the play is better than an ever happens.Superstars now on the leader taking over at nineteen years all of that didn't happen when I was playing.Compare superstar Danny Heatley to Austin Matthews announced no comparison.So it's an inch seen time and and in the anarchy for sure.Do you think Sean Avery if he was born five years later and has in the NHL today it would wreak more Havoc considering.There's so many less people that play the way.You did it it's almost a dying breed and news talk about heart now and the book.Chris Neil you know there's you guys who.Who do what you did and maybe they've had some seasons where they've put up more points Adams.It's a role where you walked a fine line between the enforcer because.I mean your five foot ten and and I'm sure your you're built like a brick wall.But compared to the Derek who guards you weren't fight in those guys you know in today's game when you don't have to worry about it Derek who guard or.Really eat there's very few people to be as afraid of now a comparison to that do you think that he would just read half.Well I thicker air wetter it's it's inching question because.I would've had to cater my game.Two of how well I would play in this in this day and age because like it's being moved the puck with the best players in the world so.Our hot I would've had to enjoy scoring goals now more than eight then I was privy to prior because.I would have been able to do it.Ed it's a different game where it would have been able to thrive so.You know.I can say right now that me in the NHL today I'm one of the best players in the week.Because.Nobody is really pushing the envelope and nine other direction and it's still.One of the most useful tools.In in and sports.Richard Sherman.In the NFL as a prime example.The that the villain and the antagonist in the guy that has the ability to put all the attention on himself as a still an effective role.And I would love to have played now you know would have been fine I also might have got run animal league.At a much earlier.Pace because of how.Outside the box I would look now you know I still have the luxury of having guys in the league like Jeremy Roenick or.There were characters in the league when Bristow plane so I could deflected a little pepper and now it's not the case.What do you think the Rangers need to do in today's.Right now to to fix their issues and and let's talk about your your I'm sure you're still very good friends with them long quest has age.Caught up to the king.Or do you think he still has it in until rebound and the team needs to be planned better front.Law I've played with a Dominick hasek when years forty years old and won a Stanley Cup in Detroit and Ager wasn't an issue for him not here Hanks a very similar goalie actually in a lot of ways not from a style standpoint but.From a body type tamp.Standpoint from a focus standpoint.Hanks got a lot left in the tank.I I really come back to and I think they need to embrace the city that they plan more and that arena and use the fans and really kind of get that feeling back again.Do you think they're guys on the roster that can do that or is that going to be outside moves to.I don't think there's a Sean Avery in the NHL right now like guys who who well play a little bit more gritty style 'cause right now other Rangers are way more wide open.Yeah yeah oh yeah I mean I I think.Listen you don't understand the importance of guys like Ryan Callahan.Dan Girardi who've Dan Girardi is a real warrior when you look at.NHL standards.It's not all about the sloshing and the fights it's about being able to have that gritty.Athlete that can handle big minutes and I think that that's what they're locked in now on certainly losing Derek Stepan that's become even more apparent.Where you've got a guy that can handle those 45 minutes a night itself.Woolsey we'll see little cigarette happens with them.Do you think your stats that I can't measure about Mikey said that the Girardi though the warrior a fact it's hard.I think now with advanced that's making a major push into the league and and numbers.And you can't measure heart you know there's no heart factor there that.It is tough to measure do you think that the wrong.It's Lou lost its touch almost.I think that.It's starting to become somewhat on an unidentifiable.Yeah now.I think the salary cap has has been a big factor in that because of turnover in the and that it's difficult to keep guys in place for a long time now.There's always going to be warriors and sports it's never it's you're never gonna lose that.But couldn't I think that.Trying to keep those guys is the hardest job a general manager has found its.Enough about the Rangers were Sean -- been up to outside of this book house war and 77.And the other ventures that the public doesn't know about.You have it subsidiary.It's eighteen months ago a friend in my computer ever premium movie and called patriots then.I was on the train ride home and just thinking about.The fact that.Those a couple of days on set felt the closest feeling that I had to wires planet at MS shoes.Here on the street there's tour 300 people around and all ascendant director says action and all the energy goes into that two people.It's arguments in new York and and now from Los the year in Africa and studying and a studio and in the city and the future Sean Avery is our mother going to be broke out of work actor confirmed to be a working actor in film television or in in the theater Sybase.Because I can't lie to myself anymore and I have to try and I have to I have to find that rush and that's the thing in sports is people are always.Trying to figure out now.CT and how to they have guys make the transition part you have to be honest with yourself and understand that.You're chasing that high and until you can find something that replaces.You're gonna be lost and I've found some thin now are just now I you know.Here are gonna Tommy that I can't do anything right so it's exciting time right now on the book was was was along side of that.You know this time that I could reflect an open up and become vulnerable on it's all related to each other.Are there any rules that you have lined up for the future.Yeah and actually doing repeat purchase new movie mile torn in two.Where it's too which is mark wall hurts the star and again and that's starts shooting a few weeks and Milan M Bogota February if awesome now.Our show Walt thank you for joining me and I'm sure.And he shot every fans out there at the book is an absolute must read for hockey fans wouldn't even get into jelly ghost and Brett hall.At some of the stories that you know are an ABC approved.But it was a fantastic read parent and thanks thanks for taking a time project you.This transcript has been

A moment of reckoning for men and predatory behavior? Video:::::Transcript for A moment of reckoning for men and predatory behavior?The flood Gates are open against sexual harassment now.There 300 sexual allegation against to back and mark Halper Halperin.Both are denying it.Now Ellen DeGeneres is catching some heat for tweeting this picture with the message it's time to bring out the big balloons.People are asking if a guy did that would we be okay with that.First of all it's a play-off lyrics from her song.They're all laughing at the joke.I think it's important not to confuse a moment among people that are comfortable with power plays and using sexual acts for favors.I have a bit of double standard on this because Ellen and poor Sha are gay.I think this is the reason.I think it's more important people that are gay are normalized.If you don't know a friend or someone you know, maybe you only see it on your social media feed.Like it's important to see healthy body image because we're feeding our brains all day long I think it's important for people that don't have much diversity see that this is okay.It's Normal.My brother is gay.I think it's important more than anything in this picture.This picture does more good than bad.It's important to know all three were in it together.They're laughing.They're friends.You're not feeling intimidated or assaulted by my particular actions.I don't think you can necessarily use that argument if a guy were to do this everyone would be offended.If a guy did that I would feel intimidated.If you have a relationship and it's funny and you're in a group and laughing and making a play on some of my lyrics -- You have lyrics?I don't sing.I wouldn't like it.I think if a guy did this we would all be up in arms given the current environment where we are finally as women coming forward and talking about sexual harassment and sexual assault.I just never think sexualizing and objectifying a woman is ever funny.That's just my view.You don't like this?I don't.I don't like it either because I've had this done to me before.I mean I'm not a skinny girl.I've had really big boobs since I was 15.I think sometimes people think it's a party trick of some kind.I've had to tell people please don't take -- a good friend of mine took a picture like that on my birthday.I'm like could we not make a face when I'm wearing a low cut dress.If Katy Perry is okay with it, fine, whatever.I think any time when you're talking about women's bodies especially right now.Nothing to do with the fact they're gay or not gay.There's such hyper sensitivity right now.For me I'm relieved we eerp finally having these conversations.Mark Halperin is very well-known political journalist.He wrote game change about my father's campaign.I believe he won a golden globe award.They're commanding the narrative of all forms of media.I'm happy we're finally calling them out.I'm glad people -- men who maybe behave a certain way should know we're at a tipping point right now.You better start behaving like the gentlemen I hope your mother raised you to be.Exactly.If not corporate culture need to get involved.Do men need to be trained to behave like decent human beings in the workplace?The important part is this was posted on social media.Typically predatory behavior is when you get people by themselves and silence in the am Mo.It's bad timing.Bad timing.It's bad timing.Poor taste and bad time.We know Ellen.We all know Ellen.She's -- what we're talking about and what she's doing is two separate things.I think people were saying if a guy -- if they knew the gentleman -- if it was a guy and this was put out, would we have a different standard?It seems like we're split.Uh-huh.Maybe we would.Maybe we wouldn't.We're not sure.I think the most important thing here is that women have now made it dangerous for men to behave that way.Yes.It is now -- there is a danger of you losing everything.That's what it takes.Finally.Well, yeah because women got together and said you know what we don't have to take this.What the hell.And to -- also I want to say there will be times then there will be mistakes made.Yeah.So we have to also be very diligent so we're not sucking up everybody into this.We need to make sure we're really diligent about this.We really only want to stop anybody who thinks this behavior is okay.This behavior could now cost you everything, everything.Yes.It should have always been that way.If you think about it a federal judge ruled in 1977 that this kind of behavior was illegal.So it's been 30 years and we are still talking about it.I mean aye any that hill that was a water shed moment.Everyone was like we are really gonna -- women aren't going to be sexually harassed in the workplace.That was a long time ago.Remember when you said Meghan you wished someone would have warned you.Yes.In one of these allegations when the girl came home and said to the agent and that was really uncomfortable and he said yeah I heard that before.Why would you've send someone into that situation.I agree the picture is really bad timing.There's a difference between a photo on social media and sexually assaulted a woman no hotel room.It's not the same thing at all.I agree with you that we need to start at least analyzing it a little bit more.Also, not putting yourself in those types of situations as well.I have a friend of mine that came up to me regarding director Toback and said he came up to her in a grocery store.He came up to her and said I want to make you a star.That's a tell tale sign.In the phone call he said I need to get to know you on a sexual level.She said okay good.She knew right there.She cut off any type of contact with him.Yeah.There is no -- there is no upside to getting your integrity -- offering and allowing somebody to take your integrity.There's no upside to that.You will not feel good in five years.You'll always have that in the back of your head.I've said this before sometimes it takes a little longer.When it's you and you did it yourself, nobody can take that from you.Nobody can point and say you got that because.I'm just saying.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not

Harvey Weinstein sues The Weinstein Co. Video:::::Transcript for Harvey Weinstein sues The Weinstein Co.This new fallout following the Harvey Weinstein scandal.This morning we are learning Weinstein is now suing his own former company and our chief legal analyst Dan Abrams is here with those details.Harvey Weinstein suing to gain access to e-mails he sent and received but what -- is it a valid argument to say he wants his own e-mails back.I'm sitting here with my jaw dropped after listingen to that piece on Toback.Those details, I can't even focus on the Harvey Weinstein for a moment.Getting back to the legal issue, Harvey Weinstein is suingp his own company saying I want the personnel file on me.I want my old e-mails.Now, people forget when you send e-mails from your company e-mail, even when you're one of the owners of the company, the company owns those e-mails.So he's now saying, how can I defend myself in any of these lawsuits?How can I help defend the company if I can't see potentially exculpatory e-mails that could help and the company's response is, at least from the company's perspective no thank you.We don't want your help in defending these cases.It's not going to be easy.In particular because one of the argument he's making is I want my personnel file so I can sue you.And the company's perspective is, of course, that's not going to happen.Now if there are lawsuits and specific lawsuits, he may be able to request and get in the context of discovery particular e-mails, he may be able to get specifics from his personnel file, but right now, he's just asking for access to everything which I think is very unlikely.Can you explain just so people can understand that Weinstein doesn't own his own e-mails even though he was an owner in the company.That's right.Because again he still has an employment contract even as one of the people who run the company and has a fiduciary obligation to the board and to the investors and to all those other people.And as a result, he can't just take the e-mails with him.Now, if he had been smart and I would recommend this by the way to anyone putting aside sexual harassment if you work at a company any e-mails you send belong to the company.Use your personal e-mail.This isn't intended to give Harvey Weinstein advice.This is for everybody else.In terms of using your personal e-mail because if you leave a company, the company gets to keep all of those e-mails that you sent and received on your company e-mail.And that's what's happened here to Harvey Weinstein and apparently he says, all of the e-mails that he sent, all were from the company e-mail account so there is a ton of information on those e-mails.We're seeing here the Weinstein company facing such huge legal fallout whether it's even going to stay in this.We're seeing it across the board right now as you see companies cut ties with anyone accused of sexual harassment.They're trying to avoid any kind of legal action.Look, their position is, we fired you.You don't now have a result to get access to this information.But no question, you're seeing companies cut ties and I will tell you something, we're going to see more heads roll in the next, I would say, two to three months.There are going to be other big name people in media and entertainment who are going to come down as a result of these kinds of investigations.Wow.Absolutely true.All right.Dan, thank you.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
Annabella Sciorra alleges Harvey Weinstein raped her, joining dozens making accusations:::::Dozens of women have come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.Interested in Harvey Weinstein?Add Harvey Weinstein as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Harvey Weinstein news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Oscar winners Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Mira Sorvino have claimed that they rebuffed Weinstein's unwanted advances.Other women have alleged sexual harassment and sexual assault."Any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein," a spokesperson for the movie executive told The New Yorker."Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.Mr. Weinstein obviously cant speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual," according to the full statement from Weinstein's spokesperson."Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path.Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.Weinstein was terminated by the board of the Weinstein Company in light of the allegations and later resigned from the board of directors.He was also expelled by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.Here is a list of women who spoke out on the record, along with their allegations against Weinstein.(ABC News has reached out to Weinstein for comment on the recent allegations, but did not hear back.)Annabella Sciorra The actress whose films include The Hand that Rocks the Cradle and who was nominated for an Emmy for her role in the hit TV show, The Sopranos, told The New Yorker that she was raped by Weinstein in the early 1990s and was sexually harassed by him for several years after that.Ben Gabbe/Getty Images FILE Sciorra alleges that one night after a dinner event in New York, Weinstein offered to drop her off at her apartment and then a while later, when she was in her nightgown, he barged into her place and violently raped her.For months afterward, Sciorra said she told no one and never went to police.Like most of these women, I was so ashamed of what happened, she said.The actress said she felt she was retaliated against after the alleged assault.I just kept getting this pushback of We heard you were difficult; we heard this or that.I think that that was the Harvey machine, she said.Natassia Malthe The actress and model claimed in a press conference that in 2008, Weinstein barged into her London hotel room, where he forced sexual intercourse on her and then masturbated in front of her."It was not consensual," she said."I laid still and closed my eyes and just wanted it to end.I played dead."After that encounter, she said she accepted a meeting with him at a Los Angeles hotel to discuss a potential movie role.Though She said he promised her the get-together would be strictly professional, his assistant ushered her into his suite, where she said Weinstein asked her to engage in sexual activity with him and another woman.She declined."Afterward, I called Harvey and yelled at him," she said."He became angry and said that he had given me an amazing opportunity and that I was an 'ungrateful c---.'"After that, Malthe said she gave up on the possibility of the film and eventually, moved out of the United States."I felt that my dreams had been shattered," she said.Malthe did not file a police report.Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, has said the Weinstein Company should create a fund for women who can prove they were victimized.Dominique Huett The actress, who has sued The Weinstein Co. for negligence, claimed in a court document that she met with Weinstein at a hotel seven years ago to discuss her career.However, she alleged, the producer asked to move the meeting to his suite, where he demanded a massage, forced oral sex on her, and then masturbated in front of her.The actress is seeking at least $5 million in damages, as she's alleged that board members were aware of Weinstein's misconduct and did nothing to prevent him from hurting women.Representatives for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment, though Bob Weinstein, a co-founder of the Weinstein Co. and Harvey Weinstein's younger brother, told The Hollywood Reporter earlier this month that he and his fellow board members "did not know the extent" of the allegations.Mimi Haleyi At a news conference in New York City, Haleyi said she met Weinstein in 2004 in London at the European premiere of "The Aviator."She ran into him again two years later and reached out to him to see whether she could help on one of his productions, she says.Haleyi said he invited her to his hotel room to chat and then asked for a massage, which she declined before leaving.She said she and Weinstein connected again two years later and he offered her a production job on a TV show he was producing.After accepting the job and keeping up a cordial relationship over the next few meetings, she said, he started showing up at her apartment and even invited her to Paris.Haleyi said she declined because she thought he intended for it to be a romantic trip.Haley said Weinstein assaulted her in 2006 when he invited her to his home in New York City, where he backed her into a room and allegedly forced himself on her."He held me down on the bed," she said."I tried to get away....He then orally forced himself on me."Haleyi said she has yet to go to police but will discuss the matter with her lawyer, Allred.Zelda Perkins Perkins told The Financial Times that two decades ago, she was working as Weinstein's assistant at Miramax in London when, she claims, he sexually harassed her and sexually assaulted a female colleague.She says the two women ultimately settled with Weinstein for 250,000 (over $330,000), and in return, they signed non-disclosure agreements that prevented either of them from ever discussing the agreement."I want to publicly break my non-disclosure agreement," she told the publication."Unless somebody does this, there wont be a debate about how egregious these agreements are and the amount of duress that victims are put under.My entire world fell in because I thought the law was there to protect those who abided by it.I discovered that it had nothing to do with right and wrong and everything to do with money and power.In response, Weinstein's spokesperson told The Financial Times: "The FT did not provide the identity of any individuals making these assertions.Any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances."Brit Marling The actress penned an essay for The Atlantic in which she detailed a 2014 meeting with Weinstein that she said was moved from a hotel bar to his suite at the last moment.During that encounter, she claims that Weinstein asked her if she wanted a massage, champagne and strawberries before suggesting that they shower together."It was clear that there was only one direction he wanted this encounter to go in, and that was sex or some version of an erotic exchange.I was able to gather myself together -- a bundle of firing nerves, hands trembling, voice lost in my throat -- and leave the room," she wrote."I later sat in my hotel room alone and wept.I wept because I had gone up the elevator when I knew better.I wept because I had let him touch my shoulders.I wept because at other times in my life, under other circumstances, I had not been able to leave."Heather Kerr Kerr claimed that in 1989, she was an aspiring actress and met Weinstein through the entertainment business manager for whom she was working at the time.She said Weinstein offered to meet with her to discuss her career, but when she arrived at his office, he allegedly unzipped his pants and forced her to touch his genitals."He spelled it out for me: He told me that first I would have sex with him and then he would take me to parties and show me who I had to sleep with after that but that first he needed to know how 'good' I was," she said."He told me that I was not that good-looking but that he would be willing to help me anyway like he was doing me a favor."Kerr said she left his office, and soon thereafter, resigned from her job and quit acting."I felt so powerless," she said."I didn't think anyone would believe me.I was nobody.Why would they?"Lupita Nyong'o Nyong'o described in a personal essay in The New York Times an uncomfortable encounter with Weinstein that she says took place in 2011.Fred Lee/ABC The actress, 28 at the time, says she was invited to the producer's Connecticut home, where he asked to give her a massage in his bedroom.Nyong'o says she declined, instead offering to give him a massage and remain in control.But when she did that, she says, Weinstein began to take off his pants, and she objected and quickly left.Nyong'o says that at a later dinner with Weinstein, he asked her up to his hotel room alone and told her that if she wanted to be an actor she "had to be willing to do this sort of thing."Weinstein, through a spokesperson, has denied the claims by Nyong'o."Mr. Weinstein has a different recollection of the events, but believes Lupita is a brilliant actress and a major force for the industry," the spokesperson said.Lena Headey The "Game of Thrones" star appeared in "The Brothers Grimm," a Miramax film, opposite Matt Damon in 2005.(Miramax was found by Harvey Weinstein and his brother.)"At one point, Harvey asked me to take a walk down to the water," she wrote on Twitter Tuesday."He stopped and made some suggestive comment, a gesture.I just laughed it off.I was genuinely shocked.I remember thinking it's got to be a joke."Headey said she replied to Weinstein, "Oh, come on mate?!It'd be like kissing my dad!""I was never in any other Miramax film," she added.Eva Green The "Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children" star told Variety over the weekend in a statement, "I met [Weinstein] for a business meeting in Paris where he behaved inappropriately and I had to push him off.I got away without it going further, but the experience left me shocked and disgusted."Rosdiana Ciaravolo/WireImage/Getty Images Green said that she kept silent until now because she wanted to "maintain my privacy.""But I understand it is important to do so as I hear about other womens experiences.Women are often condemned when they speak out and their personal reputations tarnished by association," she added."We should recognize that this sort of behavior exists everywhere and is not unique to the entertainment industry.The exploitation of power is ubiquitous.This behavior is unacceptable and needs to be eliminated.Paula Wachowiak The 62-year-old told ABC News affiliate WKBW in Buffalo that she was a production assistant on one of Weinstein's earliest films when she was allegedly harassed.She said she worked mostly with an accountant on the film and took checks to get cashed at the local bank.One day she said she was asked to take some checks to Weinstein's room to be signed.She entered his room and realized he was holding a hand towel around his waist, she alleged.At one point, Weinstein removed his towel and sat down completely naked, she claimed.After reviewing the checks, she claimed he asked for a massage.She said she declined his overture.He signed the checks, she said, and she was then able to leave, she claimed.She said she later ran into Weinstein at the end of the shoot.According to Wachowiak, he asked her, "Was seeing me naked the highlight of your internship?"She said she responded, "No, Harvey, actually you disgust me."Lysette Anthony The British actress and star of "Hollyoaks" told the Sunday Times that she was only 19 years old when she met Weinstein in 1982.The actress said she and the producer kept in touch over the next few years, including having lunch in London from time to time."We had become friends," she said.But she told the Sunday Times that one night she met Weinstein for a drink and ended up back at his rented home where, she said, "The next thing I knew he was half-undressed, and he grabbed me."She can't say exactly when this happened, saying she is bad at remembering dates.She says she fled but tels the Times that then one evening when she was home with a friend her doorbell rang, and it was Weinstein."He pushed me inside and rammed me up against the coat rack."She said she tried pushing him off but he was too heavy."Finally I just gave up."Anthony alleges Weinstein then raped her.She said that last week she went to the local police."I can't stand by and see all these brave women tell the truth and not stand up alongside them," she told the paper.British actress Lysette Anthony has told the police she was raped by Harvey Weinstein in the late 1980s https://t.co/AQEMmL4X6q pic.twitter.com/cZRF6S8R9a The Sunday Times (@thesundaytimes) October 15, 2017 Rose McGowan The New York Times reported that in 1997, Weinstein paid a settlement of $100,000 to McGowan following an incident in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival.McGowan has alluded to the alleged incident on social media."I told the head of your studio that HW raped me," McGowan wrote this week in a tweet directed at Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos."Over and Over I said it.He said it hadn't been proven.I said I was the proof."Noam Galai/WireImage/Getty Images, File We are reviewing our options for the projects we have with The Weinstein Co, Amazon told The Hollywood Reporter this week.A spokesperson for Amazon did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.1) @jeffbezos I told the head of your studio that HW raped me.Over & over I said it.He said it hadnt been proven.I said I was the proof.rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) October 12, 2017 Minka Kelly The actress claimed in an Instagram post that Weinstein once asked her to join him in his hotel room for a "general meeting," but after she claimed it made her uncomfortable, they met in a restaurant instead.Kelly claimed that after a five-minute conversation about film, Weinstein promised to give her "a lavish life" if she agreed to be his girlfriend."All I knew was not to offend this very powerful man and to get out of the situation as quickly as possible.I told him while flattered, I'd like to keep things professional," she wrote.She alleges, "He said 'Fine.I trust you won't tell anyone about this.'I said 'Of course not.Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me,' - the only way I could think to shut it down gracefully and excuse myself."I told him while flattered, I'd like to keep things professional - Minka Kelly Kelly added that she regretted her response and was speaking out in support of the other women who had come forward with their own stories about the film executive.Sophie Dix The English actress told The Guardian newspaper that in the early 1990s she went to Weinstein's hotel room to watch footage of her new film.He tried to pin her down and undress her, she alleged."He was really forceful," she said.After running to the bathroom, she said she opened the door to find him masturbating and later ran out when room service arrived.I decided if this was what being an actress is like, I dont want it, she said.Florence Darel Darel, a French actress, told Le Parisien that despite her reservations, she agreed to meet Weinstein in his hotel room in the mid-1990s at the behest of her agent.At the time, the film executive was still married to his first wife, Eve Chilton, so she was taken aback when he allegedly propositioned her."I told him I was very in love with my companion.He replied that it did not bother him at all and offered to have me become his mistress a few days a year.So we could work together," she claimed.She alleges that the implication was "basically, if you want to continue in America, go through me."Darel said she declined Weinstein's alleged advances.Claire Forlani The actress claimed on Twitter Thursday that she "escaped" from Weinstein on five different occasions.She claimed that at two meetings at the Peninsula Hotel nearly 20 years ago, she "ducked, dived and ultimately got out of there without getting slobbered over," and alleges that over the course of three dinners, he bragged to her about his famous conquests."I knew Harvey was a master manipulator," she wrote."I always thought I was a pro at handling these guys.I'd had a fair amount of experience.Sometimes I got angry.Really angry.I wondered why I had 'prey' stamped on my forehead."Kate Beckinsale Patrick McMullan via Getty Image The actress took to Instagram Thursday, claiming that she "was called to meet Harvey Weinstein at the Savoy Hotel when I was 17."Beckinsale, 44, said she assumed they'd meet in a conference room, but instead claimed she was told by the reception desk "to go to his room."He opened the door in his bathrobe - Kate Beckinsale "He opened the door in his bathrobe.I was incredibly naive and young and it did not cross my mind that this older, unattractive man would expect me to have any sexual interest in him.After declining alcohol and announcing that I had school in the morning I left, uneasy but unscathed," she claimed.Heather Graham Vivien Killilea/Getty Images The "Boogie Nights" actress wrote in Variety that Weinstein had allegedly implied that she had to sleep with him to be in one of his films."There was no explicit mention that to star in one of those films I had to sleep with him, but the subtext was there," she claimed."A few weeks later, I was asked to do a follow-up meeting at his hotel," she alleged."I called one of my actress friends to explain my discomfort with the situation, and she offered to come with me.En route, she called me to say she couldnt make it.Not wanting to be at the hotel alone with him, I made up an excuse -- I had an early morning and would have to postpone.Harvey told me that my actress friend was already at his hotel and that both of them would be very disappointed if I didnt show.I knew he was lying, so I politely and apologetically reiterated that I could no longer come by."Graham, 47, said she was "never hired for one of his films, and I didn't speak up about my experience."Cara Delevingne The actress said on social media Wednesday that she's had two allegedly inappropriate incidents with Weinstein.Delevingne, who has said that she is bisexual, alleged Weinstein once called to advise her against ever going public with a same-sex relationship for the good of her career.She also alleged that a year or so after that "odd and uncomfortable call," Weinstein brought her to a hotel room after a business meeting for an upcoming film, where she claims he asked her to kiss another woman before making a sexual advance himself.She rebuffed him and left.She shared that she later landed the role in the movie, but always questioned why.Delevingne and Weinstein worked together on the 2017 film "Tulip Fever.""Since then I felt awful that I did the movie.I felt like I didn't deserve the part," she wrote."I was so hesitant about speaking out....I didn't want to hurt his family.I felt guilty as if I did something wrong.I was also terrified that this sort of thing had happened to so many women I know but no one had said anything because of fear."La Seydoux The French actress wrote in The Guardian that she saw Weinstein allegedly acting inappropriate several times throughout her career.Seydoux also detailed one alleged incident when Weinstein invited her to "his hotel room for a drink."A female assistant then left the two of them alone."That's the moment where he started losing control," she alleged.That's the moment where he started losing control - Lea Seydoux "We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me," she claimed."I had to defend myself.Hes big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him.I left his room, thoroughly disgusted.I wasnt afraid of him, though.Because I knew what kind of man he was all along."Ashley Judd Judd told The Times that about 20 years ago, she was invited to a Beverly Hills hotel, where Weinstein asked for a massage or to

accepted when he offered to give her a tour of the downstairs kitchen area.But when she got there, she realized the area was empty and said she became uncomfortable.Hes blocking the exit with his body, she claimed.He leaned in to kiss me at that point, and I recoiled.I realized, Oh, this is a bad situation.I apologized to him.I said, Im so sorry if I gave you the wrong idea.Im in a relationship.He said, 'Just stand there and be quiet,' Sivan alleged.A day or two later, Sivan said Weinstein called her and asked to meet up with her again.She said she told him she wasnt interested

with 20/20, Bindi alleges that Weinstein attacked her in 2010.At the time, she was a 29-year-old massage therapist working in Hollywood and said she met the film executive at a movie screening she attended with a friend.Bindi, who said she already had other high-profile Hollywood clientele, said Weinstein arranged for a massage appointment with her at the Montage Hotel.Then, he arranged for a second appointment.That time, she said, he was wearing a bathrobe when she walked into the hotel room and disrobed in front of her.Startled, Bindi said she stepped into the bathroom for a few moments.When she came back out, Bindi said he was lying on the massage table and she started the massage, though he cut it short.Bindi said Weinstein then got up and began asking her about his genitals.She said she ran into the bathroom and he followed her and started masturbating in front of her.Im like, Please, this is not appropriate, I do not feel comfortable.No.Do not do this in front of me.This is not OK.This is not professional behavior, she said.He continued to do it, and I tried to get by him.He grabbed me, started groping on my chest, and he kept going, and I pushed him away."Bindi told 20/20 she was shocked by what happened.She went to quickly pack up her massage stuff and then said Weinstein asked her if she wanted a book deal.I said, Sure, Bindi said.What am I going to do?...In just one second he could've destroyed my career, destroyed my reputation.The book deal never went through, she said, and she has never spoken publicly about what she said happened until now.He just faded away, she said.He invited me to some of his movie premieres, which I took friends to.I went because I wanted to meet people to get them as clients.I'm ashamed, but, what do you do?The only reason Im coming forward now, which I wasnt going to, Bindi continued.[Is] because there were 10 girls already who came forward.Paula Williams Williams said she was a working model and an aspiring actress who had been living in Los Angeles for about a year when she said she met Weinstein at an Oscar party in 1990.She said Weinstein then invited her to a dinner party he said he was having with other people she should meet.On the night of the party, Williams, then 20 years old, said Weinstein sent a car for her that took her to a house in Hollywood Hills.I walk in, and its just Harvey, she told 20/20.He immediately starts massaging my neck as I walk in so I know right away that this is going to be uncomfortable.Williams said she excused herself to go out on a balcony to smoke a cigarette and compose herself.When she went back inside, Williams said Weinstein had opened a bottle of champagne, and said, I dont think I had a sip and he exposed himself.Williams said she quickly went to the door and walked out.She said she zigzaged her way through neighbors backyards, trying to get away from the house, and never looked back.She said she hasnt spoken publicly about her experience until now, and has lived in shame of what she said happened ever since.The reason why I didn't like talking about it and the reason why I would never come public with it before is, it was a deep shame, Williams said.[When] Gwyneth [Paltrow] said something in the press about it, and she had experiences as well.And all of a sudden I just felt it lifted.
Kelly Clarkson's 'Meaning of Life' is a mature, soulful record:::::Kelly Clarksons Meaning of Life **** Meaning of Life is the eighth album from the original American Idol, Kelly Clarkson, and it is a mature, deeply soulful record with a lot of grit and a lot of heart.Throughout the set, Clarkson sings with a bellowing rasp that seems informed by years of listening to classic Aretha Franklin records.Mostly, with its combination of classic soul and blues elements combined with modern electro-pop engineering, she ends up sounding a bit like an American answer to Joss Stone.This album builds off of 2015s Piece by Piece, but while that record was mostly rooted in a lovable retro-eighties nostalgia, this record has deeper, older roots, even if you Love So Soft also works as a possible pop banger of sorts.Amazon This may be pop but it isnt juvenile.Clarkson is singing with the voice of a grown woman.One listen to the sensual Slow Dance or the authoritative calland-response, pseudo-Stax stomp of Whole Lotta Woman and it is no doubt that Clarkson is a downright stunning talent.Her voice is versatile and can bend in a variety of directions.The high flourishes on Cruel recall a young Mariah Carey while the title track goes from a classic lullaby to a near marching-band strut and all along Clarkson effectively serves an anchoring leader.Clarksons now extensive collection of hit records since her debut proves that the fact that she won the first season of American Idol was no fluke.Few singers working in pop today are as flexible and malleable as Clarkson.You can hear her influences all over the place but at the same time, she still sounds like herself.Shes aiming to be a legend.In a way, Meaning of Life does fit in the modern pop universe but at the same time, it also sounds like Clarkson is following her muse, knowing that if she delivers something powerful, hits will come.She often sounds like she is singing straight from the core of her being This album sounds simultaneously engineered and organic.That is a truly rare combination.Focus Tracks: Slow Dance How did you go from being a Mamas Boy to a Ladies Man?Clarkson sings, as if she is in the process of a deep swoon.This is one of the best and most affecting songs in her entire catalog.It is rich with sweat and skill.It sounds like a classic ballad.Go High This booming electro number is a fascinating way to close the record, awaking Clarksons inner disco diva.Even the pitch-shifting effects sound cool in the mix.Move You Another vintage-sounding number, this takes a subtle build and makes it sound like something momentous.Clarkson slowly raises her voice and it creates quite a stir.When she lifts into another octave, it adds some power but mostly this is a deeply nuanced performance.You cant obtain this level of vocal control.Missed reviews on the latest from Rachel Platten and Weezer here.
Blue Planet II: 22 things to know about the new series:::::A year after the epic Planet Earth II, Sir David Attenborough is returning to our screens with a follow-up to 2004's Blue Planet.No spoilers, but we've seen the first episode and as sequels go we can confirm it's better than Sex And The City 2.We've also been to the press conference and spoken to some of the team behind the new series.Here are 22 things you need to know about Blue Planet II - complete with behind-the-boat info and what you can expect from the first episode.1.Five babies were born to crew members in the time it took to film.Blue Planet II involved "125 shoots, 6,000 hours filming underwater and 1,000 hours filming in submersibles", explains production manager Katie Hall.But away from the shoots, she adds, it was also a busy time for the crew: "We had three weddings.Four houses were bought.Five babies.Two babies on the way."That's what happens when you're filming for four years."2."Oceans cover 70% of the surface of our planet, and yet they are still the least explored," says Sir David Attenborough in the opening sequence."Hidden beneath the waves, there are creatures beyond our imagination," he continues.Roughly translated, we think he's saying: "Look, I know you might have seen Finding Dory multiple times but this is the real deal."3.Hans Zimmer is doing the music again.It's bad news for Fifth Harmony fans as the soundtrack has already been sorted by composer and general legend Hans Zimmer."We actually put the music out to tender, we weren't sure who we wanted to do it," explains executive producer James Honeyborne."And although we loved Planet Earth II [which Zimmer also did the soundtrack for] we wanted to keep this feeling fresh."But Hans came to us with such an impassioned pitch as to why he wanted to do it, which was incredible."4.There will be seven episodes in the series.And they're split into different habitats - like deep ocean, the coral reefs, the open ocean and the coastlines."Once you start dividing those up, you start to see where some of the stories would naturally fit," says James.5.We wouldn't fancy filling out the risk assessment form for this show."When we green light each shoot, we're constantly mitigating risk," says Katie."But bar a couple of earaches, a little bit of water at the bottom of a submersible, and one cameraman stubbed his finger, we were extraordinarily lucky."But the planning that goes into every single shoot, and managing the risk - whether that's financial risk or health and safety - you don't see any of that."Shame.6.There's some serious dramz in the opening episode.Spoiler alert etc, etc.In the opening episode, we meet some birds.Who sometimes like to fly down to the ocean and chill out a bit on the surface.Unfortunately for them, there's some rather hungry giant trevallies (ie big scary fish) lurking under the water.And they have a particular taste for birds.We won't give much more away, but it's safe to say you're about to see some snakes and iguanas-level drama go down.7.Fish are Facebook-friendly.The trailer for the new series has already built up 43 million views on social media.Which is all part of a new digital strategy this year, according to Tom McDonald, who is (deep breath) head of commissioning at the BBC's Natural History and Specialist Factual unit."One of the interesting things about Planet Earth II was that more people watched it than the X Factor results show when they were up against each other last year," he says."So if there is a younger audience out there that is going to consume natural history content, we should focus our digital strategy on them, which is what we've done this year."8.New technology was built to film the series."We built a huge piece of housing which we called the megadome which allowed us to slice the sea in half so you can see above and below at the same time," James says."We also built a tow-cam which can be pulled behind a boat which allowed us to travel with really fast-moving animals like dolphins and tuna."9.They've brought back those 'making of' segments at the end of the episodes.Remember on Planet Earth II, you'd get 50 minutes worth of TV show, and then 10 minutes of how the episode you've just seen was shot?Half the time, the "making of" bit was even more interesting and eventful than the show itself.Well, they've brought that bit back - and this series will have a segment called Into The Blue at the end of each instalment.10.There's some stuff in the series that even Sir David Actual Attenborough didn't know about."When we first showed him some clips, he was like, 'Oh I didn't know this' and 'I didn't know that'," James says."Genuinely he was surprised.It's always good if you can surprise David, it doesn't happen often."11.One Walrus has clearly been watching Titanic.At one point in the first episode, a walrus tries to seek refuge from a preying polar bear on a floating iceberg.Problem is, there are already some walruses (walri?)on said berg.Clearly, this walrus watched Titanic, and, like the rest of us, thought there was plenty of room for Kate Winslet to shift over and make room for Leonardo DiCaprio on that piece of wood.Unfortunately, the extra weight of this particular walrus on this particular iceberg causes it to collapse, ruining the party for everybody (there's always one).12.Bottle-nosed dolphins are super-cute They just look so friendly don't they, you'd definitely go for a drink with one.13.Dolphins surf, Sir David explains, "to strengthen friendships, develop social skills, and for the sheer exhilaration of it".Coincidentally, this is also why humans do karaoke.14.The show doesn't shy away from the impact of pollution."You can't go out there and make a series like this without seeing some really big issues unfolding in front of you," says James."You can go to the middle of the ocean and find plastics from many different continents coming together."The impact that has on the wildlife can be devastating."In the show, we hear Sir David comment: "There are worrying signs that conditions in the oceans that have remained relatively stable for millennia, are changing radically."15.Warning: The first episode includes "mating".In case you're planning to watch with your parents.Fortunately, the mating involves this handsome chap.16.Some shots weren't filmed on location.Earlier this week, The Guardian said some footage had been captured in "controlled laboratory conditions".After the report was published, James explained the series was overwhelmingly shot on location, but in a few select instances, such as rock pools in the Coasts episode, labs were used."Filming in the wild would have been too disruptive for the wildlife," he said."It would have been impossible to film close-ups of this magical world, so we worked with scientists to accurately recreate a rock pool in the controlled conditions of the lab."17.It wasn't originally going to be called Blue Planet II."The series was commissioned as Oceans," explains Tom."It was a very easy commission, instinctively the channel understood it was a brilliant thing to do and it felt like it was the right time to go back to this habitat."It was never designed so that we'd have Planet Earth II last year and Blue Planet II this year, so now it looks like it was a brilliant strategy, but it wasn't exactly conceived that way."18.Tusk fish are determined little creatures.There is one tusk fish who travels to the edge of the coral reef every morning, Sir David explains, looking for some breakfast.While most of us would grab some Special K from the cupboard, this guy travels quite some distance in search of a small clam.Using his mouth, he takes it back to his "kitchen" - which is essentially a massive rock, against which he starts bashing the clam repeatedly in order to crack it open."It's not easy when you have no hands," Sir David observes.19.Not all of the plans for the series came off."There were lots of shoots that failed, to put it bluntly," says Tom."The team set out to capture particular babies, and when you watch this, I think James and his team make it look really easy."And when I think about the number of variables when it comes to filming in the ocean, I think it's remarkable what they were able to capture."20.In true W1A style, the show has led to more collaborative BBC working."Some of the new technologies that were invented specifically for this series are already being deployed by the Natural History Unit on future projects," says Tom.James adds: "There was a sequence on The One Show last week about sturgeon [not Nicola], and they borrowed our probe lens, which is great - we built it, they were able to use it."21.There's going to be a podcast to accompany the series.So make sure you're all caught-up on Serial.22.So...Planet Earth II.Blue Planet II.What's next?"We have a big landmark series for next year which is very different to Blue Planet II," says Tom."It's been announced already, it's called Dynasty, not to be confused with Carringtons and Colbys, so who knows if it will stay that title."But the premise of each film is we take one animal family and follow them for a number of years to see the ups and downs of their family lines."I'm already viewing episodes of it, and it's incredibly visceral.It feels so different to this."There's more."One other thing I'm really excited about is a series the NHU have made which is on in January called Animals With Cameras, a really simple proposition."We've built bespoke cameras for different species, that the animals wear, so we can see the world from an animal's point of view."There's meerkats in it," he adds."That's my innovation for 2018, more meerkats."Blue Planet II begins on BBC One at 20:00 GMT on Sunday.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Harvey Weinstein claims: Sopranos actress Sciorra alleges rape:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Sopranos star alleges that the producer raped her in New York in 1992 Italian-American actress Annabella Sciorra, who starred in US TV series The Sopranos, has accused disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein of rape.She told The New Yorker that Weinstein forced his way into her New York apartment and assaulted her in 1992.She alleges that he sexually harassed her in the subsequent years.In the article actress Daryl Hannah also says she was harassed by Weinstein.His spokeswoman again said the producer denies claims of non-consensual sex.On Thursday another actress, Natassia Malthe, accused the producer of raping her in a London hotel room in 2008.More than 50 women have now accused Harvey Weinstein of a range of allegations ranging from rape to sexual harassment.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Malthe held a press conference with lawyer Gloria Allred, who is representing a number of Weinstein's accusers Ms Sciorra told the New Yorker's Ronan Farrow that the assault happened in 1992 after she had filmed The Night We Never Met, which Weinstein produced.The producer forced himself into her apartment in New York while she was getting ready for bed after he had dropped her off following a group dinner.She said Weinstein "pushed the door open" and refused to leave when asked, before shoving her onto the bed and raping her."I struggled, but I had very little strength left in me," she said."Like most of these women, I was so ashamed of what happened.And I fought.I fought.But still I was like, Why did I open that door?...I felt disgusting."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Charmed and Scream actress Rose McGowan has also accused the producer of rape 'The Harvey Machine' The actress said she did not report the incident to the police, but alleges her career began to suffer and did not work again until 1995."I just kept getting this pushback of 'We heard you were difficult; we heard this or that.'I think that that was the Harvey machine."She said the producer continued to pursue her, including turning up at her hotel room at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival wearing only his underwear.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Actress Daryl Hannah also came forward on 27 October with harassment allegations Actress Daryl Hannah, who starred in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill series that Weinstein produced, also came forward with new allegations.She said Weinstein tried to force himself into her hotel room when they were promoting Kill Bill and its sequel.The films were written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, who has admitted that he had some prior knowledge of Weinstein's behaviour.Hannah said that on one occasion the producer asked to grope her and then requested that she expose herself.Since claims against him began to surface in early October, Mr Weinstein has joined a sex rehabilitation programme, but he has "unequivocally denied" all allegations of non-consensual sex.
Fat Friends writer Kay Mellor 'fixated' on losing weight:::::Image copyright PA Writer Kay Mellor says she became "fixated" on losing weight as she was researching her TV series Fat Friends.The hit ITV drama, starring James Corden, aired between 2000 and 2005 and focused on a slimming group in Leeds.She attended a group to help her writing, but was then told by the leader she needed to lose weight.The 66-year-old told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs: "I started to want to lose weight so I could please her and please all the class."The Bafta award-winning writer said she had been surprised to be told she was overweight.She said: "I stood on the scales, she looked at me and I looked at her and she said: 'We'll start half a stone at a time'."And I went: 'Sorry?'- looked down at the thing - and she said: 'You're two stone overweight."'Mellor added: "But then, slowly, I became fixated, myself."'I was so naive' Mellor also told Desert Island Discs host Kirsty Young about her shock at becoming pregnant at the age of 16."I didn't know anything, really, I was so naive," she said."Literally, the second time I'd had sex I was pregnant, because I'd never heard of the pill, and then for ages I was missing my periods and I didn't even realise I was pregnant."Mellor said she did not find out she was expecting until she was four and a half months pregnant.The teenager and her boyfriend Anthony decided to keep the baby and get married, but their vicar refused to marry them because he thought "it wouldn't last".They got married at a register office - and will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary this year.The Leeds-born writer chose the Fat Friends theme tune - the Beautiful South's Perfect 10 - as one of her Desert Island Discs, because "every time I heard that I used to get excited and get butterflies".She said: "It was such a lovely time of my life, it was a drama that was really important to me because I thought I had something to say about weight and body image."The series, which also featured actors Ruth Jones, Alison Steadman and Sheridan Smith, has now been turned into a musical and starts touring next month - starring ex-England captain Andrew Flintoff.He has also been cast in Mellor's new TV drama Love, Lies and Records which will air on BBC One this autumn.
We went to watch BBC's new pop show, Sounds Like Friday Night, and this is what happened:::::Image caption Jason Derulo, Greg James, Jessie Ware, Charlie Puth, Dotty and guitarist wrap up the first episode of SLFN "I cannot stress it enough: this is a gig."Warm-up man Stuart Holdham is laying the ground rules for the studio audience at Sounds Like Friday Night, a brand new pop show on BBC One."Don't clap along to the music because you should be dancing," he continues."And if I see any dad dancing, you'll be removed from the studio, driven to Manchester and forced to watch six hours of Jeremy Kyle."For all of his humour, there's no mistaking it: this is a big deal for the BBC.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jessie Ware performs Alone on Sounds Like Friday Night Since Top of the Pops and CD:UK died in 2006, there hasn't been a dedicated pop programme on mainstream TV.It has become industry consensus that audiences don't want to see live music in their living room.That's why, X Factor aside, pop bands have had to fight for slots at the end of The One Show or the end of Graham Norton.Always at the end.Always as the credits roll.So Sounds Like Friday Night is something of a gamble.(A gamble which bizarrely, and perhaps unintentionally, borrows its title from a short-lived Leo Sayer show in 1978.)Image caption Greg James and Dotty: "It felt like this was a confident start" "It's a truly remarkable thing," says host Greg James, a couple of days before the programme launches."The BBC have gone, 'Do you know what?Let's do a live music show and put it on BBC One!'"He says he's "obviously very nervous" at launching a new programme, but "I don't feel it's something I can't do"."It's not rocket science.It's a half-hour show with some great music and some fun bits that people can hopefully sit down at the end of the week and enjoy."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jason Derulo performs If I'm Lucky on Sounds Like Friday Night Ah yes, the "fun bits".This is what stops #SLFN (as it's known on social media) being a mere reboot of Top of the Pops.The chart countdown has been consigned to the dustbin, and the show is peppered with sketches and interviews, which are instantly available to share on YouTube and social media."It's a lot more than music performances," says James's co-host Dotty."We're hoping we can create moments that live outside of the show."How did it do in the ratings?Sounds Like Friday Night had an average audience of 2.2 million viewers for its first show - lower than average for that timeslot, but respectable for a new show.It has been given a challenging slot, pitting it against ITV's Coronation Street - which attracts an average audience of 6.8 million viewers.A Question of Sport, which regularly takes the same slot on BBC One, averages three million viewers per episode.Top of the Pops, which was also scheduled against Friday night's episode of Coronation Street towards the end of its 42-year run, attracted an average of 2.4 million viewers to its last four episodes on BBC One.However, the BBC has avoided setting a public target for Sounds Like Friday Night's viewing figures.Instead, it hopes the show will have a "second life" on social media, with clips and sketches being shared on YouTube and the BBC iPlayer for weeks after the initial broadcast.The template is Adele's successful "At The BBC" show, which mixed chat and performances with a sketch in which the star auditioned as an Adele impersonator.That clip has been watched more than 82 million times on YouTube.Record labels will be watching sales and streaming figures on Saturday to see whether SLFN's first guests - Jason Derulo, Charlie Puth and Jessie Ware - receive a similar boost from their appearance on the programme.But whatever happens, music fans are eager for a new pop show.The studio audience for the first episode came not just from the UK but from Sweden, Germany, and even the US.Image caption Music fans Dan, from Devon, and Brooke, from Rhode Island, were amongst the studio audience "I watched Top of the Pops growing up," said Dan Law, who travelled from Devon to be first in the queue."It was a shame when it ended, but this seems like a class show.I think it's a modern way of looking at music.""Everyone likes music," said Brooke, originally from Rhode Island, "so it's fun to add the comedy and things to it"."It's a different kind of entertainment," agreed Ozlem Halibryam and Khadijah Ahmed, two Charlie Puth fans who were "too young" to remember the original Top Of The Pops."I think it's a nice way to chill on a Friday night," added Ahmed."I think it would be good to have more shows like this, more often."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Charlie Puth performs How Long on Sounds Like Friday Night Inside Television Centre's Studio One, the audience were greeted by a vast, multi-storey coliseum that appeared to have been borrowed from a steampunk production of West Side Story.The fans screamed when Derulo swivelled his hips and swooned when Jessie Ware sang her lush ballad Alone.But the sketches were more divisive.A clip in which Foo Fighters star Dave Grohl impersonated a BBC One continuity announcer was met with befuddled silence.Better received was a sketch featuring Jason Derulo's attempts to play basketball while being pelted with tennis balls - but even that dragged on too long.In the end, the audience just wanted music (this was a gig, after all) and enthusiastically joined in with Derulo's acoustic rendition of Want To Want Me at the end of the show.Reaction to the first show: After the credits rolled, James turned his back to the camera and let out a huge sigh of relief as he hugged Jessie Ware."We'll watch it back and I'm sure there'll be loads of things we'll change," he said backstage, "but in the studio it felt great."Dotty was similarly relieved - despite realising 10 minutes into the show that she hadn't taken the label off her brand new jeans."You can walk through these things and get your bearings in the studio, but there is nothing like when you're live and there's an audience there.So it was insane.""The thing I'm really proud of is it felt like it was a confident start," added James."We did not want to apologise for doing a show like this.There's no reason why these enormous artists shouldn't have a home on TV."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption One Direction star Liam Payne hosts next week's episode Future episodes will feature Liam Gallagher, Demi Lovato, Plan B, London Grammar Loyle Carner and Liam Payne (who tells the BBC he'll "do a song on there that I've not done before") .But who would be the host's ideal musical guest?"Obviously Swifty, if we can get her out of that kebab shop," laughs James, referring to Taylor Swift, who filmed a music video in a London cafe earlier this week."And Liam Gallagher will be incredible next week," says Dotty."But nothing's off limits."Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

George Michael goes back to number one:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Listen Without Prejudice features such songs as Praying for Time and Waiting for That Day Pop star George Michael has topped the UK album charts, 10 months after his death.An expanded version of his second solo album, Listen Without Prejudice Vol 1, beat Niall Horan and Pink to become the week's best-selling record.It means Michael's album has spent two weeks at number one, 27 years apart.But CD sales have collapsed in the meantime.In 1990 the album sold 423,577 copies to top the chart.This week, it shifted just 56,000 copies.Nonetheless, Michael was 30,000 sales ahead of Pink, his nearest rival, whose Beautiful Trauma album fell one place to number two.She overtook Horan, whose debut album Flicker had been number two in the midweek sales update.The Irish One Direction star ended up at number three instead.Top five albums Artist Title 1) George Michael Listen Without Prejudice, Vol 1 2) Pink Beautiful Trauma 3) Niall Horan Flicker 4) Liam Gallagher As You Were 5) Ed Sheeran Divide Source: Official Charts Company In the singles chart, Post Malone celebrated a fourth week at number one with his breakthrough track, Rockstar.He held Camila Cabello's Havana at bay for a third week, outselling the former Fifth Harmony singer by just 5,000 copies.Mysterious DJ and producer Marshmello - who keeps his identity a secret - looks set to challenge both artists next week, after his song Silence rose from nine to three.Cabello could also see a boost after releasing the video for Havana on Tuesday.Filmed as an campy, old-school Spanish soap opera, the clip has already been watched 21 million times.Image copyright Epic Records Image caption Camila Cabello will appear at the MTV Europe Music Awards in November Ed Sheeran's romantic ballad Perfect also returned to the Top 10, rising four places to number seven.It initially charted at four when his album, Divide, was released in March.Taylor Swift claimed this week's highest new entry with Gorgeous at number 15, while Rita Ora returned at 20 with her new single, Anywhere.Liam Payne's Bedroom Door debuted at 28, while Krept and Konan's collaboration with Stormzy, Ask Flipz, was a new entry at 30.Top five singles Artist Title 1) Post Malone ft 21 Savage Rockstar 2) Camila Cabello Havana 3) Marshmello ft Khalid Silence 4) Avicii ft Rita Ora Lonely Together 5) Sam Smith Too Good At Goodbyes Source: Official Charts Company Listen Without Prejudice Vol 1 was re-released last week to coincide with a new TV documentary about Michael, titled Freedom.Featuring the singles Praying for Time and Freedom 90, it outsold his debut album in the UK but was a relative flop in America - something Michael blamed on a lack of support from his US label.In 1992 he took Sony to court, alleging they treated him as "no more than a piece of software".He eventually lost the case, but it kept him away from music for five years and permanently affected his career in the US.In Freedom, the documentary he was working on shortly before his death on Christmas Day 2016, the star said he regretted the legal action.David Austin, Michael's former manager and childhood friend, said he was "incredibly proud" to see Listen Without Prejudice return to the top spot.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

X Factor shake-up sees viewers left in charge of voting on live shows:::::The X Factor has scrapped the sing off, as it makes major changes to the show's format.The shake-up means voters at home will be in control of which contestants leave the show - not the judges.In previous series, the two performers who got the fewest public votes would have to perform their song again to try to stay in the competition.Now the contestant with the fewest numbers will leave immediately, which means an end to deadlock as well.There are going to be more contestants being voted off the show too.In the past it was Saturday's show that would see performances and public votes, while Sunday's show was all about the sing off and eviction.Now one contestant will leave each night, voted for by the viewers.The judges will be there to provide critiques, but won't be able to vote.The idea is to make sure the most popular acts with the public are the ones who make it through to the final stages of the competition.Presenter Dermot O'Leary explained some of the changes to the Radio 1 Breakfast Show, including a new prize element.For the first time ever, The X Factor will reveal the winner of each live show.The winner of Saturday's show and the winner of Sunday's show will then battle it out in a sing off to win a "money can't buy prize".He said: "It's just a bit of fun on a Sunday, and whoever wins, wins a prize for that week.There are no other consequences though.Some of the prizes are fantastic."Nicole Scherzinger's overs and Simon Cowell's groups will perform on Saturday.She has Kevin Davy White, Tracy Leanne Jefford and Matt Linnen.He has CutKelvins, Rak-Su and Sean and Conor Price.Sharon Osbourne's girls and Louis Walsh's boys will perform on Sunday.Sam Black, Lloyd Macey and Spencer Sutherland are representing Louis.Grace Davies, Holly Tandy and Rai-Elle Williams are the girls' finalists.Some things haven't changed though.There are still big live performances from artists.This weekend will see Liam Payne and Stormzy take to the stage.Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat
Does the Bridge Theatre's opener deserve top Marx?:::::Image copyright Manuel Harlan Image caption Rory Kinnear (centre) plays the title role in Richard Bean and Clive Coleman's play Leading lights from the UK's theatrical community rallied round on Thursday to help launch London's latest playhouse.Jonathan Pryce, Sam Mendes, Sir Lenny Henry and Dame Penelope Wilton were all in the audience for the first night of Young Marx at the new Bridge Theatre.Richard Bean and Clive Coleman's play is the first to be staged at the 900-seat venue, next to Tower Bridge.The theatre is the brainchild of Nicholas Hytner and Nick Starr, the former bosses of the National Theatre.Helen McCrory, Mark Gatiss, Andrew Scott and Sir Tom Stoppard were also in attendance at Thursday's opening night.London's mayor Sadiq Khan - whose City Hall office is directly adjacent to the theatre - also made an appearance.Image copyright Manuel Harlan Image caption The play finds the famous thinker living hand to mouth in 1850s London The critics have broadly welcomed Young Marx, a comic look at philosopher Karl Marx during his exile in London in the 1850s.The Evening Standard called it "populist entertainment with a gently subversive undercurrent" and praised Rory Kinnear for his "attractively flamboyant" Marx.The Telegraph, meanwhile, divided its praise between Kinnear's "spot-on comic timing" and the venue's "capacious yet intimate" auditorium.In the Hollywood Reporter, though, Stephen Dalton said the play - while featuring "sustained bursts of brilliance" - was "a less solidly constructed affair" than its "beautiful" surroundings.Image copyright Philip Vile Image caption The theatre is part of Berkeley's One Tower Bridge development Speaking after Thursday's press night, Starr said that he and Hytner had wanted to create a theatre "where a lot of people could come together in a relatively small space"."It's incredibly intimate for the number of eyeballs that there are in the room," said Kinnear, who will be seen at the National next year as Shakespeare's Macbeth.Future offerings at the Bridge Theatre include a promenade staging of Julius Caesar and a play about Bach starring Simon Russell Beale.Young Marx runs until New Year's Eve and will be broadcast live into cinemas on 7 December.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

Curb Your Enthusiasm uses Cardiff as Los Angeles' double:::::Image copyright Google Image caption Los Angeles or The Hayes in Cardiff?Viewers of Curb Your Enthusiasm may have been left confused to see Cardiff doubling as Los Angeles.The Hayes was used as a backdrop in the hit HBO show, when star Larry David is seen walking with his therapist in a recent episode.With the Welsh weather vastly different to California, producer Jeff Schaffer admitted the choice was like "using a Los Angeles stock shot for Antarctica".But he said the city "looked beautiful".The scene involved The Hayes doubling as west Los Angeles and was featured after Mr David left a furniture store with his therapist, played by Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston.Speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Good Evening Wales programme, Mr Schaffer joked: "Sometimes a scene needs a special stock shot."They showed us the Los Angeles stock shot and we said 'no', they showed us London and we said 'no', they showed us the Edinburgh stock shot and we said 'no'."And finally, we said 'bring us the Cardiff stock shot' and then you know only the Cardiff stock shot can start a scene this special."Image copyright HBO Image caption Larry David created and stars in Curb Your Enthusiasm as a semi-fictionalised version of himself The series is filmed around Los Angeles and after shooting in a furniture shop, the crew had to quickly move on to another location.However, their lorries were all parked outside the shop, making it difficult to get a clear view of the street."It was also a dismal stretch of west Los Angeles, not very cinematic and in editing we needed something that looked like sunny Los Angeles," he added."It also needed to be somewhere that looked like it may have a furniture shop on it."It is not the first time the capital has doubled as other cities, with it also used as London for the BBC Wales-produced drama Sherlock.
Love Island's Jamie: I feel guilty for posting modelling pics on Instagram:::::Love Island star Jamie Jewitt says he feels guilty that he posts photos on Instagram that "aren't real".The model says young people can get disheartened by seeing images on the social media site and he wants to show "it's just a job"."The images are not the real me and they very rarely portray the real person," he said.He's now writing a book and giving a talk about the effect of social media on self-esteem.In May, Instagram was revealed to be the worst social media platform when it comes to its impact on young people's mental health.In response, Instagram said keeping the platform a safe and supportive place for young people was a top priority."Young girls and boys that I know are quite addicted to social media and get disheartened by seeing these images that are just not real," says Jamie."Coming from a modelling background, I thought I was part of the problem.I'm trying to make people realise that it's just a job."Jamie signed up to Instagram as part of a work contract for the reality TV show Taking New York in 2014.He now posts regularly to his 819,000 followers - a number which ballooned following his appearance on Love Island this summer.He says he is told by his modelling agency he has to post his photos online and will continue to do so while it's a part of his career."I know I'll be called a hypocrite by certain people," Jamie admits."That comes part and parcel with modelling but if I can't say what I've done candidly, and what people should focus on... then I don't know who can."I feel a bit guilty for being a part of it and what I'm made to post.It's important to make the audience aware of what exactly they're looking at."Jamie is giving a TEDx talk about the modern day influence of the digital world on Saturday.He says the influence of social media means that people are now able to judge themselves against billions of other people in the world."I don't think we're quite built to have that much competition in front of our eyes, being a competitive species."Young people see it, get confused by it and have trouble feeling good about themselves."A lot of these images are falsified, they're not real versions of people's lives - so it's about trying to call out the things that are false."Jamie reveals that he has wanted to quit modelling a couple of times, but was persuaded to keep going by his parents.Jamie says he was reluctant to sign up to Instagram initially and ultimately it cost him work."My career started to go down the pan because I didn't have a following.Even when my work was disappearing, I still refused to get it."Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat
Are these 00s singers still relevant?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption L-R: Diana Vickers, Ms Dynamite and Kate Nash Earlier this week, Kate Nash took to Twitter to criticise BuzzFeed for their article about noughties singers who are no longer in the charts.The listicle features 33 artists who "only exist in the memories of British millennials", but Nash was quick to argue that a lack of recent chart success doesn't stop them from being active or credible musicians."I have huge problems with how the industry disposes of artists," she tweeted, "it's a difficult career to maintain."BuzzFeed told the BBC: "We love Kate Nash and really did want to be her!Many of our posts reference nostalgia for things we love and this list is one of those, definitely not intended to be taken literally."But Nash's comments raised questions about the wider issue of how much high chart positions and record deals equate to success in the music industry.The 30-year-old's last top 40 hit may have been in 2010, but she has recently written for Willow Smith and Rita Ora, and will release a new album next year.Nash also has several film and TV credits and is currently filming the second series of hit Netflix show Glow.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rebekka Johnson, Sydelle Noel, Kate Nash and Kia Stevens all star in Netflix's GLOW Peter Robinson, music writer and creator of Popjustice, told the BBC: "Hit records have a magical ability to take us to a specific time or place in our lives so it's fair to say Kate Nash's hits will have a special significance for a certain age group."But several entries in the article might have benefitted from a brief visit to Wikipedia."The musicians on the list included Ms Dynamite, Blazin' Squad, Diana Vickers, Mis-Teeq, La Roux, 5ive, Rachel Stevens, The 411, and So Solid Crew."If you're a fan, it's natural to be excited when your favourite artist does well commercially, and disappointed if their latest release looks like a failure, particularly because labels tend to drop acts when sales take a dip," Robinson said."But if you're ignoring new music because it's not selling, and if you're allowing your tastes to be dictated by whose records are selling well, then, well, enjoy your Bradley Walsh album."The BuzzFeed piece refers to millennials - people that grew up in the 00s.But according to singer Sandi Thom, who is also one of the 33 artists on the list, they are not as fickle as some may think.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sandi Thom performing at her album launch in 2008 "Some of my biggest fans are kids under 10, and with the new era of Spotify anyone is discoverable or re-discoverable," she told the BBC."I couldn't care less what a journalist writes about me and my career."Making music is a privilege and if you can continue to do so throughout your career like all of the artists have been doing that were mentioned in the article, you're one lucky person!"Robinson also addressed Nash's tweets about the mental health impact of being an artist who is trying to make it in the industry.Skip Twitter post by @katenash Also the reason I cant let this slide is because I happen to be in a great, happy place in my life.Which is difficult for anyone 2 achieve Kate Nash (@katenash) October 24, 2017 Report Skip Twitter post 2 by @katenash But I am and there have been many times over the past 10 years when I havent been ok.

Gregory Porter: Glad far-right has 'shown its face':::::US singer Gregory Porter says the rise of white nationalism is no surprise as "we knew it was there".In August, white supremacists marched in Virginia and last week protesters disrupted a speech made by far-right lobbyist Richard Spencer in Florida.Porter told BBC Music News LIVE: "We saw it disguised a whole bunch of different ways."Like my mother always said, 'I'm glad when it shows its face, that way I know it's here and I'm not guessing'."'Serious time' The singer releases a new album of Nat King Cole covers on Friday, and has spoken of his hope that music should be used to connect people from all walks of life."In a way it's time for artists and thoughtful people to get to work," he said."It's a serious time and I think that opposition will be reflected in the music."People will rage against that machine but there will also be some thoughtful people who will find some craft or word to speak directly to the people who allow for this type of negative energy."It's why the last line of [Nat King Cole's] song Nature Boy is important to me: 'The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return'."Image caption Porter, seen here during a rehearsal, performed at the Royal Albert Hall earlier this year Porter, who performed at the Royal Albert Hall in September, suggested one of his own recent tracks was written as a direct message to US President Donald Trump, who was criticised for what some saw as a sluggish condemnation of white nationalists who attacked protesters in Charlottesville during the summer."It's the number one reason why I recorded my song When Love was King, it's a direct message to our leaders, to my president, absolutely and I don't know if they hear but I hope they do."Image copyright Rosanne Cash/Facebook Image caption Johnny Cash's family shared a statement after a white supremacists was pictured in a t-shirt bearing his name Porter's comments follow on from those made by the family of late country singer Johnny Cash, who denounced a far-right protester wearing a T-shirt bearing their father's name on the Charlottesville march.In a statement, they said they "were sickened by the association".Porter said: "That shows you how big a fool a person is, marching in a Nazi protest with a Johnny Cash T-shirt.Johnny Cash's first wife was black you fool.he definitely wouldn't agree with you."Nat King Cole & Me is out now.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

Maxine Peake: Why Big Lil is a better role model than Kim Kardashian:::::Image caption Maxine Peake has written a new play but won't appear in the cast She's known for her acting on stage and screen, but Maxine Peake has another career - writing plays about fearless women who overcame the odds in a man's world.It took four policemen to physically hold Lillian Bilocca back when she tried to stop a trawler leaving port in Hull in 1968 at the height of her campaign for safety at sea.Three ships and 58 lives had just been lost and emotions were high."Big Lil" was a fishwife, and her husband, father and son all worked on the trawlers.She had had enough.She tried to board under-manned ships to prevent them from departing and took a petition with 10,000 signatures to the government.For their efforts, she and her fellow "headscarf revolutionaries" were met with disdain, misogyny and even death threats by some Hull men and trawler owners.She was blacklisted and never worked in the fishing industry again.But the campaign worked.The law was changed, and lives were undoubtedly saved.Image caption Lillian Bilocca died in 1988 at the age of 59 Bilocca is the heroine of Maxine Peake's latest play The Last Testament of Lillian Bilocca, which opens in Hull next week."It felt an important story to tell," the actress and playwright says."It's about women putting their head above the parapet, and she did get punished for it by the community."One of Britain's most sought-after performers, Peake has starred in TV dramas including Shameless, Silk and Three Girls, and films like The Theory of Everything.But she also has a burning desire to tell her own stories - mostly about unsung British heroines whose achievements have been swept under history's carpet.Before The Last Testament of Lillian Bilocca, she wrote Beryl, about Beryl Burton, the champion cyclist who went faster than her male rivals, as well as Queens of the Coal Age, about four miners' wives who tried to save pits from closure by occupying a mine.'Determination and fearlessness' The Bolton-born actress and writer wants to celebrate "ordinary women who had led extraordinary lives", she explains.She says: "There's a determination and a fearlessness in those women that I really gravitated towards.They were 'get up and go and sod the consequences'."I sort of aspire to [that].They really spoke to me.They didn't let being a woman obviously it was an issue, but they didn't feel it was something that ever stopped them or became a barrier.They knew what they wanted to do."With Beryl and with Lil, they had a passion and they followed it.I suppose that's what I've always tried to do, although it's not always easy."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Maxine Peake isn't keeping up with the Kardashians There are some "amazing role models out there" today, Peake says - but she believes Beryl, Lil and the rest set better examples than some celebrities who are held up as idols for young women.She's looking at you, the Kardashians."Look at our role models," she says."I won't mention her name, but there's a family, you know, and it's all about beauty and looks, and that drives me insane."For young women now it's about education.That's our weapon.If you want to fight, as they say, the pen is the sword."Social media 'holding us back' The smartphone may not be the sword, though - especially if social media gets in the way of our path to personal freedom.Peake continues: "It's about following your dream and being brave and - I know it's difficult - but we get very stilted by what other people think of us in this media age now."I feel in some respects lucky that it wasn't part of my generation.It feels like it's even more [about] the body beautiful and selfies and Twitter, and people getting held back by what other people think about them and opinions about them."You just want to say to girls and young women, 'You can.Think big.Even if you don't get to where you're going, you'll get somewhere along the ladder.'"Image caption Prepare the Baftas: Maxine Peake in Three Girls Peake herself is near the top of the acting ladder, despite saying she's never taken the most obvious career opportunities.Her high-profile roles have been peppered with projects like a concept album about the Pendle Witch Trials, playing Hamlet on stage - and now writing a play about a Hull fishwife."Sometimes people go, 'Why are you doing that now?You had quite a good acting career there,'" she says."But that's me.If the path's going one way, I have to jump off."If I feel like if there's a few too many people on that path with me then I want to jump off and find another one."She's not the only person celebrating Lillian Bilocca's story, almost 50 years after her campaign and 30 years since her death from cancer at the age of 59.As well as Peake's play, which is being staged at Hull Guildhall in a production by Hull Truck theatre, a TV drama is in the works from Red Production Company, which made shows like Trust Me and Happy Valley.'Lingering hate' against Lil And by coincidence, another play is being staged in Hull at the same time as Peake's.Lil has been written by Hull playwright Val Holmes, who was 15 when Bilocca was fighting for better safety.Growing up, she recalls how Bilocca's name was "often used with this lingering hate".Men in the fishing industry often felt women shouldn't be interfering with their business, while the extra measures her campaign won - like full crews, radio operators for all ships, improved safety equipment and a "mother ship" with medical facilities for all fleets - were blamed for the economic decline of the industry, Holmes explains."The awareness is there now about what she actually achieved," the writer says."It's in the schools.But up to about 15 years ago, no.They forgot all about what she'd actually achieved and the fate of the fishing industry was laid at her door."I think people are just realising what she did actually achieve.The thousands of lives that were saved because of her and the other women's actions."I think they really do appreciate that now.And thank goodness."The Last Testament of Lillian Bilocca is at Hull Guildhall from 3-18 November.Lil is at Jubilee Central, Hull, from 6-11 November.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Russell Brand: Society is collapsing:::::Image caption Brand's latest book deals with his own addictions to drugs, alcohol, sex and fame Addiction and mental health may not be the kinds of issues you'd normally expect to be addressed at a stand-up comedy gig.But Russell Brand has never been your conventional comedian - and it's precisely these subjects that he's tackling in his new book and at one of his upcoming London shows."Society is collapsing," the comedian tells the BBC, "and people are starting to recognise that the reason they feel like they're mentally ill is that they're living in a system that's not designed to suit the human spirit."People are realising 'Hold on a minute, is it natural to work 12 hours a day?Is it natural that I live in an environment that is designed for human beings from one perspective but not from a holistic perspective?'Breathing dirty air, eating dirty food, thinking dirty thoughts.So really what this is, is a time of transition."Yes, the conversation is changing because the communication is becoming so much more expedient, but what's really changing is people are starting to notice that the system is not working for them."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The comedian says he prefers theatres to large arenas when it comes to performing comedy The 42-year-old's latest book - Recovery: Freedom From Our Addictions - is released this month, and sees him discussing his own addictions, namely drugs, alcohol, sex and fame.But, he says, the book isn't just for people who have had chemical addictions, and argues that pretty much all of us have some kind of vice."Everyone's living their lives on addictions really," he says."Everyone is living their life thinking they've got the answer to their own little problem.If there's something they get, something they do, they're going to feel a little bit better."Addicts are just a more pronounced version, and end up usually with a drug issue, but look at what people can do to themselves with food."People can destroy their lives with food, and so addiction really, we're all on the spectrum, we're all on the scale, it just depends how severe we are, and I think that unless you're happy in your life, there's room for a program.He continues: "Unless you're like 'I'm really happy with my job, my diet, my relationship, my body', if that's how you feel, that's fine.You deserve to feel like that, people should feel like that.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Brand has turned to activism more recently and attended an austerity march in London in 2015 "I'm not talking about stupid simple pleasures like eating an ice lolly, that's only very temporary, we're looking at peak and contentedness which we can find our way to, if we're willing to change the way we think."Brand clearly isn't going to be short of material when he discusses the topic at a special gig at the Hammersmith Apollo on 1 November.In addition to his usual stand-up show, he's going to turn up early to do some readings from Recovery."It's the only time I'm ever going to do it," he explains."So if people want to come at 6.30, I'll read from the book, and then do the show, Rebirth."It's interesting that Brand is playing somewhat smaller venues than the arenas we've seen other A-list comics perform at in recent years.Image caption Michael McIntyre and Chris Rock have both toured arenas in recent years The recent generation of "rock star comedians" like Michael McIntyre, Chris Rock and Peter Kay are more likely to sell out the O2 than play an impromptu gig at the Comedy Store, but Brand says he prefers the intimacy of slightly smaller venues."People that have played both arenas and theatres, most people prefer theatres, and I'd say the same," he says."It's a great privilege to perform in front of 20,000 people at once like at the O2, it's lovely, but there's all sorts of reasons for not doing it... but I love doing stand-up comedy, so I'm happy to do two nights in Brixton and two nights in Hammersmith rather than one night at the O2, and it is a better experience for the audience and for the performer."Speaking about his own live dates, Russell adds: "The stand-up is full of audience interaction.The thing that excites me most is what people create when they come together in groups."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Brand has become increasingly vocal as an activist and campaigner in recent years Despite his recent activism, which has included charity work, austerity protests and endorsing Jeremy Corbyn, it's unlikely that Russell will be entering the world of politics anytime soon."If you think the political process doesn't work, why would you think, I'm going to get involved with it?"he asks."If you swap the word 'political process' for 'car', you wouldn't think 'I'm going to get in that car and try and drive it in a different direction.If you think people should be riding horses, start riding a horse."So just do what you think is the correct thing to do.If you think your school should be run differently, start running your school differently, and then when you find obstacles to that, confront the obstacles, but never alone, always in groups."The thing I've learned from recent conversations from people who are experts, like Prof David Harvey, is to start establishing systems you believe in, and operate within them.So the work I'm doing already is the work that I think should be done."So I think if people start communicating honestly and openly, they'll realise, 'Everyone is more similar to me than I imagined.'"Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Dolly Parton's nine-to-five approach to music:::::Image caption Dolly Parton is known as much for her business acumen as her song-writing skills Even when she's talking about cold, hard cash, Dolly Parton manages to seem down to earth.She's promoting her new children's album "I Believe in You" and is in top, self-deprecating form, talking to the BBC."It's hard for me to spend money on tonnes of stuff because I'm going to look the same, no matter what I wear.If I wear diamonds I'm still going to look like a rhinestone," she tells me.Still, if Dolly was inclined to buy diamonds, she could afford them.She's known as much for her business acumen as her song-writing skills.At the start of her career she took lessons from her dad, she says: "Even though he wasn't an educated man, he wasn't able to read and write, daddy had a great sense of business.Image caption Dolly Parton at Glastonbury - in the past year she's earned some $37m "He said, 'Don't let other people take advantage of you, keep your mind on your business.'So when I got into the music business I thought of it as a business."Early on she launched her own publishing company and hung on to the rights to her songs, and she says that other artists should do the same."As soon as you start making money, you should invest and get into other businesses that you can fall back on if you don't make it big, or if you make it big and you fall on hard times."That attitude has served her well over the years and continues to do so, according to Forbes magazine's Celebrity 100 list.It claims Dolly earned $37m (28m) in the year to June 2017, with most of this coming from her Pure and Simple concert tour and income from her Dollywood theme park in Tennessee.Image copyright Jason Davis Image caption Dolly visits Vanderbilt children's hospital in Tennessee Brian Warner, founder of website CelebrityNetworth.com, estimates her total fortune to be $500m (379m) but says this is conservative."We think that Dollywood alone is worth around $200m; $100m for the land itself and $100m for the brand - you could class it as an intangible asset."On top of that she makes a lot of money from touring and has had a 50-year career in which she's sold millions of records and has also written songs for other artists."Mr Warner says "I will always love you", a hit Dolly wrote and recorded in 1973, has made her more than $20m in total.He explains that although individual music contracts may vary, "as the writer of a song you might be keeping 50% of the revenue or more and as a writer and performer you could be getting 80%".Image copyright Wes Ramey for Dollywood Image caption The Barnstormer ride at Dollywood Dolly's own version of "I Will Always Love You" was a big commercial success, topping the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart twice, in 1974 and 1982.Whitney Houston made the song a hit all over again when she recorded a version for the 1992 film The Bodyguard.It was number one for 10 weeks in the UK charts and for 14 weeks in the US.The song had another resurgence in 2012 after Ms Houston's death.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: The proceeds from Dolly's latest album won't be adding to her fortune, though; instead they'll be going to the Imagination Library.Set up in 1995 it aims to improve child literacy by distributing free books to children in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia.Image copyright Keystone Image caption Dolly in London in 1977 Dolly says her own impoverished childhood in Tennessee inspired the library and has shaped her attitude to money in general."Being brought up poor means I don't take things for granted, and no matter how much money I make, I'll always count my blessings quicker and more often than I count my money.She has "always realised the value of a dollar", too."Even now if I go in a store it's hard for me to pay a huge amount of money for one item.I say 'good Lord', what could mummy and daddy have done with that!"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dolly's Imagination Library scheme provides books for children At 71 years old, Dolly's career has spanned more than five decades and following her Glastonbury performance in 2014 she's reached a whole new audience.So what's the secret of her longevity?"I think a lot of people can relate to me, because of my upbringing and because I'm from a big family.I think people see me as an aunt, an older sister or a cousin.I've been around so long I'm part of their family."Dolly will be hoping that this loyal fan base will support ambitious plans to expand her empire.The DreamMore hotel at Dollywood, opened in 2015, is "doing well" and she is thinking of franchising it.She'd also like to do more kids projects and launch a line of wigs, cosmetics and clothes."I've still got a lot to do...I'm going to be an old lady before I get it done but at least I'm going to be working till I fall over dead!"Dolly Parton is a force of nature and a tremendously successful one at that; it's hard to imagine her ever stopping.
Chanje Kunda: The poet using pole dancing to explain particle physics:::::Image copyright Miselo Kunda Image caption Chanje Kunda wants to celebrate "female sensuality and eroticism" Poetry, pole dancing and particle physics don't often meet.But they do in a new theatre show by a performer who wants to reclaim the way the female body is portrayed.Poet, playwright and performance artist Chanje Kunda took lessons in several forms of dance to prepare for her latest one-woman show Superposition - ballet dancing, contemporary dancing, pole dancing and lap dancing.The latter two are normally performed in certain clubs for certain men, but Kunda is reinventing them for her own positive purpose."I wanted to explore female sensuality and eroticism because female sensuality within the media has been commodified and cheapened and exploited, and I wanted to try and find new ways as a feminist to be able to celebrate that," she says.It was her movement director who suggested she have pole dancing lessons.Image copyright Miselo Kunda Image caption Kunda compares particle physics with the workings of a nightclub "It's not for people who want to become strippers - it's about how to be confident with your body, with your own sensuality, and also it's about fitness and strength and doing the things that make you feel fabulous regardless of your size," she says."It's about being comfortable in your skin and being able to celebrate your sensuality."In one section of the show called The Lonely Chair, Kunda "uses the movement vocabulary of erotic dance to express feelings of loneliness and sadness".With a chair.She combines movement and dance with her linguistically luscious poetry, which riffs on the big questions of life and the universe, such as "what are the real laws of attraction?"Kunda explains: "I decided to research the laws of attraction by interviewing particle physicists, a professor of philosophy and also attend a lap dancing course, because they might have a different take on laws of attraction."I found that research absolutely fascinating, very intellectually stimulating and very inspiring."'Body and intellect' So, in one part of the show, she explains attraction by drawing parallels between the workings of particles and the workings of nightclubs - while pole dancing.She gives an example of one of her lines: "If an atom was a nightclub, the nucleus would be dancing in the middle of the dancefloor and the electron would be orbiting the nucleus getting to see its sexiness from all angles."So I'm explaining about how atoms and particles work, whilst spinning."Movement is married with scientific themes throughout the show.It's a deliberate attempt to "celebrate and elevate your body, your physicality, your beauty" while at the same time "being valued for your intellect and your thoughts", she says.Image copyright Miselo Kunda Image caption She was one of the BBC Radio 3 The Verb New Voices winners in 2015 The second full theatre show from Kunda, Superposition launches at The Lowry theatre in Salford on Thursday.The title is making the point that she can't be pigeonholed."I am many faceted and many things at the same time and I'm in superposition," she explains."You can't locate me here or here.I'm in superposition in the show and as a human being."Her last show Amsterdam premiered in 2014 and toured for three years.She was also one of the winners of BBC Radio 3 The Verb New Voices writing competition in 2015.As a result, she made a short film for the BBC titled Physics - which was one of the seeds for Superposition.But her career nearly didn't get off the ground at all.Kunda was turned down for Arts Council England funding to stage Amsterdam because, she says, she wasn't an established theatre artist at the time.PPI to the rescue "It just made me more determined because I thought, I'm not going to let people dictate to me what I can do with my life and what I can't do."She did find the the money, but from an unusual source - a PPI claim."I had a director, a choreographer and a sound designer, and I had rehearsal space, but I didn't have any funding," she recalls."They only found out I didn't have any funding on the first day of rehearsal."Somebody approached me on the street saying, 'You can claim back for PPI'.I thought, actually, I've had several credit cards over the years, so I filled out all the forms and it was successful.I was using that to pay the creative team."Begged, stole and borrowed She raised the rest of the money by starting a gardening company called Titan Trimmers and mowing her neighbours' lawns at evenings and weekends.Meanwhile, she persuaded her sister to donate her tax rebate and asked friends if they would like to "invest in some art"."So I begged, stole and borrowed and scrimped and worked my butt off," she says."But I paid the choreographer, I paid the director, I paid the sound designer, I paid the rehearsal space, I paid for all the marketing materials, costume, props -

Does Cambridge University need to widen a 'whitewashed' reading list?:::::A group of 100 Cambridge students have called for the university to include more black and ethnic minority writers in its English Literature curriculum, leading to a row over race.But the university has condemned the backlash and says it supports debate over its reading list.The literary row started with a letter written in June by the students to the university's English faculty, asking it to "decolonise" its curriculum by including more BME writers.The letter, mainly signed by white students, stated: "This is not a call for the exclusion of white men from reading lists... it is a call to recentre the lives of other marginalised writers."One of the students, Lola Olufemi, women's officer for Cambridge University's student union, then explained the position in an article for the university's student newspaper Varsity.She wrote that it was "simply not enough" for the university to offer one optional course to read post-colonial BME texts at the end of a three year degree.Image caption Cambridge University defended its student Lola Olumfemi Her picture was splashed on the front page of the Daily Telegraph on Wednesday under the headline: "Student forces Cambridge to drop white authors".The paper then faced criticism for "twisting the facts" and "demonising" Ms Olufemi.The university has responded by saying it supports "robust academic debate" and that "very early" academic discussions had already been held on this issue.But for now it said, there "has been no decision to alter the way English is taught at the University of Cambridge".So what do students studying English Literature at Cambridge read and why?The course outline advises students they will be studying a full range of "English literature from the Middle Ages to the present day".Across the three years, it lists four compulsory papers that must be taken by all students: English Literature and its Contexts 1300-1550 Shakespeare Practical Criticism Tragedy There are also more than 20 optional papers - "which change regularly", with lecturers providing suggested reading lists and students making decisions on what books to study based on that guidance.But some students say all too often they are steered towards white, male writers.Issues of Britishness One of the lecturers is Dr Priyamvada Gopal, who teaches postcolonial literature.She says she has noticed "more assertiveness" from students about what kinds of issues they want to explore.Because many have not learned about the British Empire while at school, she says, this makes them keen to study books that examine the issues of Britishness or Englishness, and "how that relates to questions of race, immigration and even class".So what should be on the agenda?Dr Gopal has five books she suggests are worthy of inclusion: Dr Gopal's top five BME reads Image copyright Getty/BBC Image caption Writers Olaudah Equiano, CLR James, Sam Selvon Recommended reading from Dr Priyamvada Gopal, Reader in Anglophone Literatures and Fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge: The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano by Olaudah Equiano Olaudah Equiano was a black African writer whose experiences as a slave prompted him to become involved in Britain's abolition movement.His autobiography was first published in 1789 and was immensely popular.The Lonely Londoners by Sam Selvon The son of an Indian father and a Scottish-Indian mother, Sam Selvon moved to England in 1950 after serving in the Trinidadian navy.The Lonely Londoners is perhaps his best-known and commercially most successful novel and was his first to address the migrant experience.The Black Jacobins by CLR James Caribbean intellectual and political activist Cyril Lionel Robert James moved to England from Trinidad in 1932.Six years later he published the historical account, The Black Jacobins, his seminal work on the Haitian slave revolt.The Emperor's Babe by Bernardine Evaristo Born in London to an English mother and Nigerian father, Bernardine Evaristo is an award-winning author and current professor of creative writing at Brunel University London.Published in 2001, The Emperor's Babe is a mash-up of culture and history, set in Roman London.The Times crowned it the "Book of the Decade".Feminist Fables by Suniti Namjoshi Indian-born Suniti Namjoshi's first book of fiction, Feminist Fables, was published in 1981.An important figure in contemporary Indian literature in English, she is known for exploring issues of gender, sexual and cultural identity.'Entire degree without BME' Image caption Mariam said the discussion "had been happening in non-academic circles for a long time" Mariam Ansar, who helped draft the open letter, said it came as a "result of years of frustration felt as an undergraduate, as a student of colour studying English at Cambridge".The 22-year-old from Bradford graduated this summer and said: "This discussion had been happening in non-academic circles for a long time."Fellow graduate Rebecca Hirst, 21, from Chester, said: "At the moment a system exists at Cambridge whereby a student could complete an entire literature degree without studying the writings of a person of colour or the context of slavery and colonialism in any depth."'Disheartening and alienating' Image caption Lizzie said adding to the list of authors would help "challenge" conceptions of Englishness Cambridge student Lizzie Bowes, 19, from Peterborough, criticised those who are "too quick" to fall back on the argument that there are no BME authors of the same calibre as William Shakespeare, Geoffrey Chaucer or John Milton."As a BME student myself, being constantly told that BME authors are excluded from the canon and the curriculum simply because they're 'not good enough' is hugely disheartening and alienating," she said.Miss Bowes said adding to the list of authors would help students "challenge and interrogate the dominant conceptions of Englishness".Stella Swain, in her second year at Cambridge, pointed to the "disturbing lack" of non-white authors on the course and said it made the English Literature degree appear "archaic".'Schools whitewash too' Image caption Finley claims most academics "don't seem to take BME writers into consideration" Cambridge student Finley Kidd, 19, from Norwich, who signed the letter, said the problems with the English literature curriculum begins well before university level.She said: "Britain's history of colonialism, empire, and institutional racism is one such context that has been so fundamental in shaping our literature that we can make no excuses for ignoring it."My high school English curriculum was similarly whitewashed.I have had some incredible lecturers and supervisors during my degree who have encouraged my reading of authors such as Chinua Achebe and Ngugi wa Thiong'o, but the majority of academics I've come across don't seem to take BME writers into consideration."The onus should not be on students to reach beyond reading lists - many may not realise they are even allowed [to do so] - but on academics to diversify their reading lists."
How Wim Wenders put the snap back into Polaroids:::::Image copyright Wim Wenders Image caption Wim Wenders chose himself as a subject for some of his photos Wim Wenders became a major film-maker when, in the 1970s, German cinema became cool around the world.His hits included The American Friend and Paris, Texas.But Wenders was privately experimenting with one of the most straightforward of visual technologies - the Polaroid stills camera.Thousands of those shots were thrown away - but now a selection of surviving images has gone on display in London.Wenders says when he started taking Polaroid pictures in the mid-1960s it had nothing to do with art.Image copyright Getty Image caption Wim Wenders says taking snaps was useful to his film-making and it was fun "It was just part of my life.I would photograph things to do with movies I was making, or when I travelled.It was useful and fun - which I think is what Polaroids were for most people."Instant photography - doing away with a separate and lengthy process of developing film outside the camera - arrived commercially in 1948.It was the creation of Polaroid's founder Edwin Land.In the early years the images were black and white.The big step forward was the arrival of the Polaroid sx-70 camera in the early 1970s."It was science fiction and nobody had seen anything like it.You pointed the camera and took the picture and then it came out - an empty, blank bit of white paper."And before your eyes it slowly turned into the image you had shot a few moments before.It was exhilarating in its colours and brightness.Image copyright Wim Wenders Image caption New York is given the Wim Wenders treatment "You have to remember that at this time people didn't have even VHS tape - we were in a simpler, analogue world.So to be able to create and record a visual image almost immediately seemed extraordinary."Now some 200 of the images are on display in London, under the title Instant Stories.Some of them show well-known people the director worked with such as the actor Dennis Hopper.Others are landscapes or pictures of odd corners in places Wenders visited such as New York or Sydney.There are also close-up images of a TV set showing the 1956 film The Girl Can't Help It, with appearances from Eddie Cochrane and Gene Vincent."It's still my favourite rock and roll movie.And suddenly with a Polaroid you could photograph something you enjoyed and you had it in front of you to hold, almost at once.At the time it was extraordinary.Image copyright Wim Wenders "The other great thing is that if friends were in the image you could give it to them - and that's what happened to many of the pictures I took."I'd had traditional cameras since I was six or so and I enjoyed using them.But there was a whole new spontaneity with the Polaroid which I think some people are now starting to rediscover the way they've rediscovered music on vinyl."Everyone says, 'oh the kids aren't interested in physical objects any more: they don't want a book or a newspaper or a CD.'"But the kids will regret it when they're older: if you're 25 you have to realise that the phone which seems so great now will one day be yesterday's technology and lots of the digital images we all have will be hard or even impossible to look at."Image copyright Wim Wenders Image caption Dennis Hopper invented the selfie in the Wenders movie The American Friend, says the director But doesn't a modern smartphone produce images far more sophisticated than any Polaroid camera did 40 years ago?Wenders says the basic character of the technology was part of the appeal."I think people who look at the images will find a sort of beauty here.The colours the process produced are great, though the monochrome images are attractive too."The director points out a particular black and white picture."It's the Hoboken Terminal in New York and I was shooting a film 30 years ago there called Lightning Over Water.These places are mainly gone."For a long time the pictures just went up on Wenders' refrigerator and then were stored away in cigar boxes."But they remain unique: they only existed once and there's no negative and you can't duplicate it.Forty years later they seem quite precious."Wenders remembers that at the time a new Polaroid model or a big technical development was the equivalent of an Apple launch today."So when the sx-70 came out we were delighted to get hold of it early to use in the film Alice in the Cities (1974)."The new show in London plays on a loop the scene from The American Friend in which, says Wenders, "Dennis Hopper invents the selfie with a Polaroid camera."Image copyright Wim Wenders Image caption There was something "sacred" about the instantaneity of the Polaroid, says Wenders There was also a use behind the camera."So at this time there's no video playout and you only see your rushes three days later.The Polaroid camera can be a real help setting up a shot."But in the 1980s Wenders abandoned Polaroids entirely."I was starting to take stills photography more seriously and I started to use large-size cameras".But he retained one of his old Polaroid cameras and only recently gave it to Patti Smith to replace one she was having problems with.Wenders thinks digital photography is now so problem-free and so cheap that a lot of the creativity has gone."It's so easy for a professional photographer to take hundreds or even thousands of pictures of a particular face or of a scene and of course a few of them will be good and the rest are wiped.It can be an impersonal, industrial process."The Polaroid was instant but it was still connected to the original idea of photography.There was always something sacred about the act of stealing an image from the world."Instant Stories: Wim Wenders' Polaroids is at the Photographers' Gallery in London until 11 February 2018.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Everything Everything on how they've turned a 'nightmare' into pop music:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Everything Everything perform Can't Do at BBC Music Introducing Live 2017 "There's a tide and it's coming in now," sings Jonathan Higgs on Night Of The Long Knives, the latest single from Everything Everything.The title refers to Hitler's bloody purge of the Nazi party in 1934, drawing a parallel to the rise of the right-wing politics in the last two years.Only Higgs isn't convinced that fascism will sweep everything in its path."They're saying it's a wave but it feels like a dribbling mouth," he sneers in the single, questioning whether the alt-right are a powerful force, or just a bunch of idiots."And the answer is both," he says."It depends how we react to it.If everyone [panics and] says, 'Oh God!'the next thing you know, they're the prime minister."But if you go, 'Ha, ha, ha, you're idiots,' well... they'll probably still become prime minister.But you have to keep your head about it."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Everything Everything play Night Of The Long Knives on Annie Mac's Radio 1 show It's surprising to hear Higgs make a plea for perspective.After all, this is a man whose last album, Get To Heaven, was a "wretched and anxious" response to Islamic State militants, beheadings, mass shootings and political corruption."I was in a dark place," he told the BBC on its release."I was essentially trying to inhabit the minds of the [extremists] and that's a really horrible thing to face."Everything Everything's new album dials back on the paranoia and dread - partly because Higgs thinks the world has caught up with him."I'm not less in that headspace, but I think everyone else is in it more," he says."But the album's a bit more abstract, a bit more personal.Away from politics and all that stuff, it's about the human relationships we all have."The album is called A Fever Dream, a reference to the "surreal, nightmarish things happening, day after day" - especially the absurdity of modern politics.It's there in Big Game, a pomposity-pricking parable about Donald Trump ("Even little children see through you"), and it's there in Run the Numbers, a song that explores Michael Gove's comment that "people in this country have had enough of experts"."Is it the first song to be inspired by Michael Gove?Yes, and it should be the only one.Let's leave it at that."Image copyright Sony Music Image caption A Fever Dream reached number five when it was released in August - the band's best chart position to date Higgs is smart enough to be aware that he comes from a position of privilege, and his liberal views are out of step with the prevailing political climate.There's a song on the album called Ivory Tower, where people threaten to "come and crush me in the Waitrose aisle".On the title track, he sings: "I hate the neighbours, they hate me too / The fear and the fury make me feel good.""It's admitting that I sort of enjoy arguing," he explains."I think we all do on some level.It's certainly popular.""With anonymity you can go much further than you ever could in real life," Higgs agrees."People become very extreme very quickly.It feels good to give yourself over to that emotion."This leads to a discussion of the fake news stories that spread in the wake of this month's mass shooting in Las Vegas.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Everything Everything are named after the first two words on Radiohead's Kid A album "I just can't begin to find a way into that mindset," says Higgs."But the whole idea about what's true has been thrown up in the air: Who do we trust?Why do we trust our journalists?Is it just because we're used to it?""There are codes of practices in place, right?"interjects his bandmate, Jeremy Pritchard."But does the Daily Mail care?Does Fox News care?I don't think so."Higgs says keeping up with the news "feels like a bad dream - sometimes it's scary and frightening and sometimes it's electrifying and exciting".He adds: "That's why there's a reference to being asleep or dreaming or waking up in every single song.There's a feeling of 'is it real, or is it not?'"If this all sounds pretty heavy, it's worth noting that Everything Everything have always dressed up their angst in a cathartic explosion of melodic pop.That's how they sneak songs like Cough Cough (about greed for oil), My Kz Ur Bf (airstrikes) and Night Of The Long Knives onto daytime radio.Image copyright Sony Music Image caption "Musically, A Fever Dream's a bit more electronic but also heavier with guitars and riffs," says Pritchard (second left) In concert, this results in fans bellowing out the lyrics to No Reptiles - a song about feeling passive and useless and alienated from society.There's something bizarre, I observe, about hearing 3,000 people chanting: "It's alright to feel like a fat child in a pushchair.""You're telling me," laughs Higgs."We're always surprised by what people's favourites are," adds Pritchard."And we're still towards the beginning of that process on this album."We've written them, we've recorded them and now we're seeing what works in the live arena - where the energy is, how to play it."But the "fat child in a pushchair" remains the bassist's favourite part of the set, every night."I don't have to play anything at that point in the song," he says, "So I always take my earphones out and listen to the crowd.It's incredible."A Fever Dream is out now.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Why Tina Turner came out of retirement:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Adrienne Warren will play Tina Turner in the musical, which opens in April A new musical based on the life of Tina Turner is set to open in the West End in 2018 - and the singer even came out of retirement (somewhat reluctantly) to work on it."Retirement is wonderful," Turner says as she launches Tina: The Musical in London."You sleep long, do what you want, decorate the house two or three times.Just easy things that you dreamt about when you were working and that's all you did."She says her lifestyle when she was famous involved spending most of her time on tour buses, planes and cars, adding: "That was work and that's sometimes what you had to do."But you had a dream not to have to do any of it."'Learning and experiencing' Turner, whose hits include The Best and What's Love Got To Do With It, was initially reluctant to sign up for working on the show, which opens at London's Aldwych Theatre in April."I didn't want to because I didn't really understand it or agree with it, whatever there is - the magic between stage and music is totally different," she says."So I'm learning and experiencing what musicals are about."The producers of Tina had to fly out to Switzerland, where Turner now lives, to convince her to give the project her blessing.Image copyright CRAIG SUGDEN Image caption The pair performed together at the launch of the musical in London this week Turner was eventually won over, and now comments: "This took me out of retirement...I'm very excited to be a part of it."But the big question of course, was who was going to play Tina in the show.This week, the theatre world got its answer: Adrienne Warren."She can sing," Turner says."She will do the dancing.Maybe she hasn't done the type of dancing that me and my girls would do, but she can do that.She's pretty.And we're giving it a try."'Motivation and inspiration' Giving audiences a flavour of what they can expect, Warren performed three songs at the launch, including two duets with Turner, proving in the process that she definitely has the voice to pull this role off.Speaking after the performance, the Virginia-born actress said: "She's a motivation, inspiration to all women, and especially women of colour."It's the first time I ever realised that I could grow up in the South and have dreams that would take me all over the world.I wouldn't have become a performer if it wasn't for Tina Turner."Image caption Adrienne Warren said audiences will find the musical "inspirational" She adds: "When you haven an opportunity like this, I call it a responsibility.Because I'm a Tina Turner fan first, so that's a responsibility and I don't take that lightly."Details of the plot and songs included in the show haven't been announced yet, but producers say it will be a fairly comprehensive telling of Turner's life story - not shying away from issues such as the domestic abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband Ike.Describing the show's content, Adrienne said: "Dark?No.Inspirational?Yes.It is the truth of her story.Sometimes the best things in life come out of the worst things in life, so that's what's so appealing about this show."There are challenges, the stamina that is required for this show was something like I've never seen before, and actually having Tina as my coach as I do this is something quite interesting as well, so I love every second of it."It shows all of us that no matter what obstacle comes your way, whether it's your family not supporting you, whether it's bullying, domestic violence, don't ever let that stop you achieving your dreams."Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

Philip Pullman's La Belle Sauvage hailed as 'a stunning achievement':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 17 years after His Dark Materials, Philip Pullman reads from its new "equel" Philip Pullman's return to the world he created more than 20 years ago for His Dark Materials has been greeted with eager delight by most critics.The author's new book, La Belle Sauvage, arrives 17 years after the His Dark Materials trilogy ended.It is worth the wait, according to the Washington Post, while the Daily Telegraph gave it a five-star review.The New York Times praised a "stunning achievement" but had some reservations, saying the novel "sometimes lags".La Belle Sauvage is set a decade before Northern Lights (titled Golden Compass in the US), the first book in the His Dark Materials trilogy, which was published in 1995.The trilogy's heroine, Lyra, is a baby in the new book - she is cared for by nuns before being protected by Malcolm, 11, who lives at a nearby pub.Image copyright Getty Images In Pullman's alternate reality, Malcolm is drawn into an underground resistance movement trying to fight a fascist religious organisation that rules over an autocratic state.The book takes its title from the name of the pub's canoe - which Malcolm and Lyra use to escape a flood, chased by a terrifying villain, Bonneville.La Belle Sauvage is the first instalment in a new trilogy, The Book of Dust.Pullman has said the next two instalments will be set after His Dark Materials.The Washington Post's Elizabeth Hand said the past 17 years disappeared "in a blink as one reads the enthralling, enchanting first instalment"."The first half of The Book of Dust reads like a thriller," she wrote."The story becomes darker, deeper and even more engrossing when a cataclysmic flood overtakes southern England."Bonneville was "one of the most frightening villains in contemporary literature", and the new book felt "more earthbound - in the best way - than the earlier trilogy".Hand added: "Too few things in our own world are worth a 17-year-wait: The Book of Dust is one of them."Slate's Katy Waldman was even more enthusiastic, predicting people would love the book "with the same helpless vehemence that stole over them when The Golden Compass came out in the mid-90s, or even when they first met their partners or held their newborn children".She wrote: "I absorbed La Belle Sauvage in intense, immoderate bouts of pleasure, horror, pain, and love."Part of this heightened experience relates to the electric emotional content that Pullman so deftly handles; part of it is his sure command of centuries of resonant English poetry and philosophy."'Dark and mysterious' The Telegraph's Sam Leith found a "slight question mark over who the book is for" because "the pretty childish and the very adult share space in its pages".Leith added: "In the foreground is a straightforward adventure story - even a slightly trad one: Five Get Into Trouble In A Theocracy sort of thing, or perhaps Dust William - of great pace and interest."Yet its Swallows and Amazons qualities, as it goes on, rub against something altogether darker and more mysterious."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Amber Spyglass was named Whitbread Book of the Year in 2002 In The New York Times, Sarah Lyall said her view the new book did not quite live up to the original trilogy may have been coloured by her "impossibly high expectations".And she hoped Pullman was "biding his time, laying down the groundwork for what is yet to come".She wrote: "It's a stunning achievement, the universe Pullman has created and continues to build on.All that remains is to sit tight and wait for the next instalment."Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
