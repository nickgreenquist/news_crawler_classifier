(AP) -- Devin Singletary ran for 244 yards and four touchdowns as Florida Atlantic scored 22 fourth-quarter points to roll past Western Kentucky 42-28 on Saturday night.FAU (5-3, 4-0 Conference USA) is off to its best start since 2007.Herb Miller's interception to start the fourth quarter set up Singletary's 60-yard touchdown run three plays later that tied the game at 28.Jason Driskel threw a 49-yard touchdown pass to Willie Wright, and Singletary scored from 5-yards out to cap 10-play drive with 5:21 remaining.Singletary had 12 and 1-yard TD runs in the first half, and finished with a career-high 36 carries.Mike White threw for 371 yards and two touchdowns with pair of interceptions for Western Kentucky (5-3, 3-2 Conference USA).Deon Yelder's 1-yard touchdown run gave the Hilltoppers a 28-20 lead late in the third quarter.
UCF scores on offense, defense, special teams in dominating win over Austin Peay:::::ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- McKenzie Milton threw for 275 yards and three touchdowns and scored another on the ground and No.18 UCF reinforced its reputation for having one of the most explosive offenses in the country with a 73-33 win over Austin Peay on Saturday night.The 73 points scored was a school record for the Knights, who lead the nation in scoring.UCF scored on 11 of 12 possessions.It's the first time in program history that the Knights have started the season 7-0.Milton completed his first 14 passes and finished the game 24 of 26.He scored on a 3-yard run before going to the bench in the middle of the third quarter.Dredrick Snelson caught five of Milton's passes for 90 yards and two touchdowns.Mike Hughes had a 91-yard kickoff return for a score and Shaquem Griffin returned a fumble 20 yards for a touchdown.Austin Peay (5-3) had some good moments offensively but couldn't match UCF's speed and depth.Governors wide receiver Kyran Moore scored on a 91-yard kickoff return and 35-yard touchdown reception while rolling up 346 all-purpose yards.The game will be remembered as much for its bizarre plays as the final score.There were two kickoff returns for touchdowns (one each); a fumble return for a touchdown (UCF); a tipped pass for a touchdown (Austin Peay); going four-for-four on fourth-down conversions (two each); a lineman scoring a touchdown after recovering the second of two fumbles on a 5-yard run (Austin Peay); an unsportsmanlike penalty on a head coach (UCF); and a 27-yard touchdown pass in the final seconds.Hughes' 91-yard kickoff return was matched stride-for-stride by Kyran Moore during a wild second quarter when the two teams combined for 50 points.Griffin's fumble return for a touchdown was part of the action and Taj McGowan scored twice on runs of two and four yards.Austin Peay had plenty of highlights, too.Governors guard Ryan Rockensuess scored when he fell on teammate Michael Hoover's fumble in the end zone, after Hoover had scooped up Ahmaad Tanner's fumble that started the play.Trey Pruitt ran on to a tipped pass and got his feet down inbounds to finish off a 12-yard scoring play.Not to be outdone, Moore got credit for a 35-yard touchdown reception when he snatched the ball out of midair after UCF safety Antwan Collier dropped a sure interception.THE TAKEAWAY Austin Peay: The Governors were 41-point underdogs and hung with UCF for much of the first half before running out of steam.UCF: The final score was lopsided, but UCF will spend a lot of time watching film of missed tackles, poor special teams coverage and penalties.Nonetheless, UCF is the lone unbeaten team in the American Athletic Conference and still a candidate for a major bowl bid.UP NEXT Austin Peay: At Tennessee Tech next Saturday.UCF: On the road for an AAC game at SMU next Saturday.
Comeback! No. 6 Ohio State rallies to beat No. 2 Penn State:::::COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- J.T.Barrett hit Marcus Baugh with a 16-yard touchdown pass with 1:48 left in the fourth quarter and No.6 Ohio State rallied from 11 down in the final five minutes to hand No.2 Penn State its first loss, 39-38 on Saturday.Barrett played one of the best games of his decorated career, going 33 for 39 for 328 yards and four touchdown passes, three in the fourth quarter after the Buckeyes (7-1, 5-0 Big Ten) were down 35-20.Penn State led 38-27 with 5:42 left and it looked as if the Nittany Lions (7-1, 4-1) were going to knock the Buckeyes out of the College Football Playoff race and put a firm grip on the Big Ten East.Saquon Barkley scored two long touchdowns for Penn State, but it was Barrett who surged into the Heisman Trophy race in what was billed as the Big Ten game of the year and lived up to the hype.Barrett hooked up with Johnnie Dixon for two touchdowns in the fourth and then got the ball back down five with 3:20 left.The Buckeyes quickly marched down the field and then Barrett found his big tight end Baugh open for the lead.The blackout crowd at the Horseshoe poured onto the field to celebrate with the Buckeyes after Barrett took a final knee.He calmly wandered through the mayhem, receiving pats on the back.The fifth-year senior, who some fans wanted bench after the Buckeyes' offense struggled in a September loss to Oklahoma, had just delivered a performance to quiet any remaining doubters.THE TAKEAWAY Penn State: The Nittany Lions were in big trouble as soon as they had to drop back and pass and try to block Ohio State's talented defensive line, with Nick Bosa and Tyquan Lewis.Penn State got the ball back with 1:45 left at its own 41 and Ohio State was all over quarterback Trace McSorley.He threw three incomplete passes and was sacked as the Nittany Lions turned the ball over on downs.Ohio State: The Buckeyes' now control the Big Ten East.Their path to the playoff might still be muddled by that loss to Oklahoma, but right now they are the Big Ten's best shot.NEXT Penn State: The Nittany Lions face a third straight ranked opponent when they go to No.16 Michigan State.Ohio State: The Buckeyes go to Iowa next week.
Out of reach: Houston's late TD gives USF its 1st loss of season, ends win streak:::::TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- D'Eriq King kept Houston's hopes alive with a 30-yard completion on fourth-and-24, then finished a game-winning drive with a 20-yard touchdown run with 11 seconds remaining, lifting the Cougars over No.17 South Florida 28-24 on Saturday.The sophomore who has split time between receiver and quarterback replaced starter Kyle Postma in the first half.He began slowly before leading Houston (5-3, 3-2) on three long scoring drives to position themselves for an upset.King threw a 39-yard TD pass Courtney Lark early in the third quarter.Mulbah Car scored on a 4-yard run to make it 14-14, and King finished a 75-yard march with a 3-yard TD that made it 21-all with 6:20 remaining.Quinton Flowers, who threw for 325 yards and scored on runs of 1 and 3 yards for USF (7-1, 4-1), did all he could to give the Bulls a chance to remain unbeaten.Emilio Nadelman's 30-yard field goal gave USF a 24-21 lead, but also left King with 1:46 to end the nation's longest winning streak at 12 games.The quarterback's 30-yard completion to Lark prolonged the winning march.King finished 12 of 20 passing for 137 yards and one TD.He also accounted for 83 of Houston's 255 yards rushing, most of it in the second half.A week after letting a 17-point halftime lead slip away during a 42-38 home loss to Memphis, Houston gave itself a chance by playing solid defense early against a high-powered offense that had scored at least 30 points in a record 24 consecutive games.USF led 7-0 at halftime, with help from the Cougars turning the ball over on downs at their 37 early in the second quarter.Darius Tice ran for 18 yards on fourth-and-1 to keep the ensuing drive alive, then scored on fourth-and-goal from the 2.Houston's defense thwarted two other threats, stopping the Bulls on downs at the Cougars 11 and 27 in the opening half.THE TAKEAWAY Houston: King gave the Cougars a spark offensively, and the defense rebounded after yielding 42 second-half points in last week's loss to Memphis.USF finished with 462 yards total offense, but it wasn't nearly as easy as the numbers suggest.South Florida: The Bulls, who've won five games by at least 20 points, weren't as sharp as usual, offensively or defensively.But in their first real test of the season, they proved resilient and didn't flinch after Houston tied the score on three different occasions in the second half.POLL IMPLICATIONS USF slipped one spot in last week's rankings after squandering most of a 27-point lead while holding off Tulane 34-28 on the road.Sputtering against Houston probably ended any hopes the Bulls had of reaching the top 10 this season.UP NEXT Houston: Returns home to face East Carolina on Nov. 4.South Florida: at Connecticut on Nov. 4.
No contest: Florida outgained, overmatched in blowout loss to Georgia:::::JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Sony Michel put third-ranked Georgia up big early and put Florida away late, scoring on two long runs in a 42-7 drubbing Saturday that might have been the final game for Gators coach Jim McElwain.Michel finished with 137 yards rushing on just six carries and helped the Bulldogs remain unbeaten and in control in the Southeastern Conference's Eastern Division.Nick Chubb also scored for the Bulldogs (8-0, 5-0 SEC), who ended a three-game losing streak in "The World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party" and started 8-0 for the first time since 2002.Lift a glass to Georgia.Pour one out for McElwain?Florida (3-4, 3-3) started the day by responding to a tweet from a sports lawyer who said Florida and McElwain's agent, Jimmy Sexton, have engaged in buyout negotiations and are "miles apart."Athletic director Scott Stricklin released a statement several hours before the game saying the buyout report was inaccurate."No one representing the University of Florida or our athletic department has had any conversations with Coach McElwain or his representatives regarding a buyout of his contract," Stricklin said.But Stricklin stopped short of giving McElwain a vote of confidence after one of the strangest weeks in program history.McElwain created a firestorm Monday when he said Florida players and families received death threats amid the team's struggles.Stricklin met with McElwain in hopes of gathering more information and helping alleviate any safety concerns.McElwain rebuffed their efforts, prompting a statement from the athletic department that essentially criticized McElwain for being uncooperative.McElwain backtracked a bit Wednesday but stopped short of apologizing and again refused to provide details about the threats.His reaction raised questions about his relationship with Stricklin and prompted speculation about whether he even wants to be at Florida any longer.Here are the big questions: Would Florida attempt to fire McElwain with cause and avoid a $12.9 million buyout or are they ready to part ways regardless?Florida's performance against Georgia surely doesn't bode well for McElwain's job security.The Bulldogs scored on their first three possessions and led 21-0 before the Gators picked up a first down.Georgia used three huge plays to build a three-touchdown lead.Jake Fromm -- the guy one Florida player openly questioned early in the week -- found D'Andre Swift in the flat for a 39-yard gain that set up Chubbs' 6-yard touchdown run.Dominick Sanders intercepted Feleipe Franks' pass on the ensuing possession, and Fromm threw a perfect, 17-yard pass to Javon Wims in the corner of the end zone.Michel added his first of two scores, a 74-yarder midway through the second quarter.Michel added 45-yarder in the third, and the rout was on.The only questioned that remained -- other than McElwain's future -- was whether Georgia would end Florida's NCAA scoring record.The Gators haven't been shut out since a 16-0 loss to Auburn in 1988.They scored with 2:42 remaining to extend the record to 368 games with points.TAKEAWAY Georgia: The Bulldogs are clearly the best team in the East and look like they could make a run at top-ranked Alabama in the league title game.Florida: The Gators are dealing with the kind of mess that only a coaching change can correct.It's no longer a matter of if, but when.UP NEXT Georgia: Hosts South Carolina next Saturday.The Bulldogs could clinch the East next week, but only if Kentucky has loses to Tennessee later this Saturday.Florida: Begins a two-game road stretch at Missouri.They play at South Carolina the following week.

Astros' Yuli Gurriel suspended first five games of next season for racist gesture:::::Houston Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel will miss the first five games of next season for making a racist gesture toward Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish during Friday night's World Series Game 3.Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred announced the suspension Saturday, hours before Game 4 of the Fall Classic."I wanted the burden of this discipline to fall primarily on the wrongdoer," Manfred said."I was impressed in my conversation with Yu Darvish by his desire to move forward, and I felt that moving the suspension to the beginning of the season would help in that regard."After Gurriel homered off Darvish in the second inning Friday, he put his fingers to the side of his eyes and said "chinito" a derogatory Spanish term that translates literally to "little Chinese."Darvish was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and Iranian father.He played professionally in Japan from 2005-11 before joining the Texas Rangers in 2012.Darvish, who was dealt to the Dodgers at the July 31 trade deadline this year, expressed anger about what happened."Acting like that, you just disrespect all the people around the world," he said in Japanese through a translator.Gurriel, who was born in Cuba, apologized after the game.Speaking in Spanish through a translator, Gurriel said that he was "commenting to my family that I didn't have any luck against Japanese pitchers here in the United States."On Saturday, Gurriel released a formal statement saying his gesture was "offensive" and "indefensible.""I sincerely apologize to everyone that I offended with my actions," Gurriel said."I deeply regret it.""There is no place in our game for the behavior or any behavior like the behavior we witnessed last night," said Manfred, who later added, "There is no excuse or explanation that makes that type of behavior acceptable."Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow said in a statement that the club was "surprised and disappointed" by Gurriel's actions."Yuli has always demonstrated respectful behavior and is extremely remorseful for his actions," Luhnow said."He had no intention of offending anyone, but now recognizes the perceived offensiveness of his actions."Gurriel's homer came as part of a four-run second inning, which chased Darvish from the game and propelled the Astros to a 5-3 victory.Houston leads the best-of-seven series 2-1.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Malik Rosier, Braxton Berrios help lift Miami past UNC to remain undefeated:::::CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Malik Rosier threw for a career-high 356 yards with three touchdowns to help eighth-ranked Miami hold off North Carolina 24-19 on Saturday.Rosier had a 51-yard touchdown throw to Christopher Herndon IV late in the first half and a 78-yarder to Jeff Thomas to open the third quarter.His 5-yarder to Braxton Berrios gave the Hurricanes (7-0, 5-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) a 24-13 fourth-quarter lead.Still, Miami had to come up with a couple late plays after UNC made it a one-score game.First the Hurricanes recovered a fumble by Jordon Brown after the Tar Heels had pushed near the Miami 35 with 2:11 left.Then Rosier ran for a chains-moving keeper near the 2-minute mark, allowing Miami to run out the clock.Nathan Elliott threw for one touchdown and three interceptions for the Tar Heels (1-8, 0-6) after starter Chazz Surratt was knocked from the game in the opening quarter.THE TAKEAWAY Miami: The Hurricanes went from squeaking by in their last three wins by a combined 13 points to struggling much of the day against a 1-7 team relying on a third-string quarterback.Not the best way to go into the November stretch run, even as they remain unbeaten.UNC: The Tar Heels responded to last week's blowout loss at Virginia Tech with a better showing.Still, UNC's offense struggled in the red zone by getting just three points on three first-half trips.And the defense repeated its habit of surrendering a couple huge plays to wipe out long stretches of solid execution.UP NEXT Miami: The Hurricanes host No.13 Virginia Tech on Nov. 4 in a key Coastal Division matchup.UNC: The Tar Heels have an off week before going to Pittsburgh on Nov. 9.
Houston Texans owner makes second apology for 'inmates running the prison' remark:::::Houston Texans owner Bob McNair reportedly met with the team Saturday morning and apologized for his comments that "we can't have the inmates running the prison" during a meeting of NFL owners about players who protest by kneeling during the national anthem.McNair's remarks caused a firestorm of criticism from athletes inside and outside the NFL and prompted an initial apology from the 79-year-old Friday."I know they were upset," McNair told the Houston Chronicle about his meeting with the players."I wanted to answer their questions.I told them if I had it to do over again I wouldn't use that expression."Two Texans players, star wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins and running back D'Onta Foreman, left the team's Friday practice after McNair's remarks were initially made public.The Chronicle reported that every player on the team was planning to make the trip to Seattle for the Texans' game against the Seahawks."We decided to go to work," offensive tackle Duane Brown told the Chronicle Saturday."The situation's not over.It's something that we'll reconvene and talk about again, but we had practice."McNair released a second statement Saturday afternoon and insisted he wasn't referring to the players with his "very regretful comment."Instead he says he was "referring to the relationship between the league office and team owners and how they have been making significant strategic decisions affecting our league without adequate input from ownership over the past few years."He then apologized to NFL players saying: "I am truly sorry to the players for how this has impacted them and the perception that it has created of me which could not be further from the truth.Our focus going forward, personally and as an organization, will be towards making meaningful progress regarding the social issues that mean so much to our players and our community."The comment was published in an ESPN The Magazine story about two recent days of meetings among owners, players and others to discuss the protests that have drawn the ire of President Donald Trump.Players, following the lead of former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, say they kneel to protest social injustices, particularly against African-Americans.Trump has sharply criticized the protests and even called on NFL owners to fire players.The meetings earlier this month did not result in a policy change that would require players to stand for the anthem.Owners and players are expected to meet again next week to discuss initiatives.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Preview: Coyotes at Devils, 3:30 p.m., FOX Sports Arizona Plus:::::Streaming live on FOX Sports GO FOX Sports Arizona Plus channel finder Louis Domingue will be back in goal tonight against the New Jersey Devils as the Arizona Coyotes as they try to halt a season-opening 10-game losing streak.The Coyotes had held out hope that starting goaltender Antti Raanta would return from a two-week absence after he had an encouraging practice on Friday, but coach Rick Tocchet said Saturday morning that Domingue would get the start.In Raanta's absence, Domingue (.858) and Adin Hill (.880) have both struggled.Raanta had a .911 save percentage in his three starts and is a career .917 goaltender."If I could make the choice, I would already be playing," Raanta told Craig Morgan of ArizonaSports.com on Thursday, "but I just need to listen to the guys who are a little bit smarter than me and who know something about the human body.I'm not sure what the timetable is right now but hopefully a couple more good practice days."The Devils (7-2-0) had six days off before their 5-4 shootout win against the Ottawa Senators on Friday night, and they may have Cory Schneider back Saturday.He may have been ready to return Friday but missed the game due to the birth of his daughter earlier in the day, so he may be back to face the Coyotes.Whether it's Schneider or Keith Kinkaid for a second night in a row, the Devils know they can't take anything for granted against the Coyotes."That's a team that's going to be coming out flying," Devils forward Jimmy Hayes said."They're looking to get a win for themselves, but at the same time we're a team that prides itself on hard work, so we can't have any letdowns.If we continue to play the right way, we'll get the results we want."The game will feature three of the top rookies in the league in Arizona's Clayton Keller, New Jersey center Nico Hischier, who was the No.1 pick in this year's draft, and Devils defenseman Will Butcher.Keller leads all rookies with seven goals and 11 points.Hischier has two goals and five assists, and Butcher has 10 assists already.The Devils are hoping the same thing that benefitted them Friday will be there Saturday -- contributions from everyone in the lineup.Three of their four goals were finished by three different forward groups and a fourth goal was scored by defenseman Damon Severson."We're finding a lot of depth," said the Devils' Taylor Hall, who had an assist Friday."That's a huge thing for any good team, they find ways to get contributions from different lines on a nightly basis, it's going to help out in the big picture."
Preview: Suns at Trail Blazers, 6:30 p.m., FOX Sports Arizona:::::Streaming live on FOX Sports GO PORTLAND, Ore. -- Things have changed considerably for the Phoenix Suns since their embarrassing 124-76 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers at Talking Stick Resort Arena to begin the 2017-18 regular season -- the largest margin of victory in NBA opening-night history.Coach Earl Watson was relieved of his duties and replaced as interim head coach by assistant Jay Triano, a former lead assistant for Terry Stotts of the Trail Blazers.And starting point guard Eric Bledsoe was sidelined indefinitely -- the Suns have never used the term "suspended" -- after tweeting, "I don't wanna be here" with the club starting the season 0-3.Since Triano took over and Bledsoe was shut down, Phoenix has gone 2-0, knocking off Sacramento and Utah to take a 2-3 record into Saturday night's rematch with the Trail Blazers (3-2) at Moda Center.Triano expects his troops to gain a little motivation from their undressing by Portland at Talking Stick."I hope that it stings a little bit, and that we go in there looking for a little bit of revenge," Triano told the Arizona Republic."It seems like a long time ago right now, but it should be in the back of our minds, for sure."Forward Marquese Chriss (ankle) was a limited participant in Friday's practice and is questionable for Saturday's game.If Chriss is unable to go, Triano might go small and start veteran swing man Jared Dudley, who is working his way back from offseason foot surgery.Dudley has played just five minutes in one game this season.The statistics don't line up well for a Suns victory.Portland ranks seventh in the NBA in scoring (110.8 points) and Phoenix yields the second-greatest average (117.8).The Blazers are the second-most accurate 3-point shooting team in the league (.443), and the Suns allow opponents to shoot the second-best percentage (.431).Without Bledsoe, the Suns must dig deeper to contend with Portland point guard Damian Lillard, who has averaged 32.4 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.4 assists in his last five games against Phoenix.Portland has won eight of the last 11 meetings between the teams dating to the start of the 2014-15 campaign.The Blazers, though, have struggled with their offense to start a stretch of schedule that includes 10 home dates in 11 games.They shot .375 in a 103-93 win over New Orleans on Tuesday and were at .393 in a 104-103 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday."We haven't played great offensively," said Lillard, who was a combined 10 of 35 from the field in the two games."That's part of our growth as a team -- being able to find ways to win games without exploding at the offensive end."We don't want to have it that way, but we have to be able to win games when it's not going for us (on offense).To do that, you have to get stops and limit other teams' second-chance opportunities."The Blazers will focus their defensive efforts on Phoenix guard Devin Booker, who is averaging 21.8 points in his last five appearances against Portland.Booker, who turns 21 on Monday, leads the Suns with a 17.8-point average while grabbing 6.2 rebounds and delivering 4.0 assists per game.

Preview: Hungry Panthers host slumping Red Wings:::::TV: FOX Sports Florida TIME: Pregame coverage begins at 6:30 p.m. SUNRISE, Fla. -- Perhaps now -- with four more home games in a row -- is when the Florida Panthers make their move up the standings.The Panthers are just 4-5-0 overall, but they are 3-1-0 at home after routing the Anaheim Ducks 8-3 on Thursday.It was Florida's most goals since 2009."That's what we've talked about -- taking advantage of this homestand," Panthers rookie coach Bob Boughner said."We want to make sure that when we get into November, we are over .500 and start climbing a bit."Florida Panthers on FOX Sports Florida On Saturday night, the Panthers continue their five-game homestand by hosting the Detroit Red Wings, who have lost six straight contests, earning just one point during that span.Detroit will have to contend with a top Panthers line that seems to be clicking.Center Aleksander Barkov and left winger Jonathan Huberdeau are tied for the team lead with 10 points each, and right winger Evgeni Dadonov has nine.Barkov, 22, has three goals and four assists in his past four games, showing why he is regarded as one of the best young centers in the NHL.He had three points on Thursday, including two slick assists to set up Dadonov goals."'Barkie' is a beast out there," Boughner said."He's dynamite."Boughner added that "teams are trying to keep their big boys (best scorers) away from him," which is a reference to Barkov's defensive prowess as well.If there is a concern on the Panthers, it is depth among their forwards.Florida is in excellent shape at center, where is has Barkov; Vincent Trocheck, who also has 10 points; Radim Vrbata, who had a hat trick on Thursday; and captain Derek MacKenzie, who mans the fourth line and is known for defense and penalty-killing.But on the wings, the Panthers have been caught short thanks to upper-body injuries to Connor Brickley and Colton Sceviour and a lower-body injury to Jared McCann.To try to address that problem, Florida on Friday recalled forward Chase Balisy from Springfield of the American Hockey League.Balisy, 25, scored 17 goals and had 45 points in 76 games for Springfield last season.The Panthers, who are missing starting goalie Roberto Luongo for the moment, are grateful to have James Reimer in the nets.He is 3-3-0 this season, and part of his success on Thursday was a direct result of the Panthers standing up for each other.After Reimer was run over, defenseman Alex Petrovic came to his rescue and pushed back on the Ducks.And after Barkov was cross-checked to the face, Panthers winger Michael Haley started a fight.That's what winning teams do, and right now, Florida's next opponent, the Red Wings, are not getting it done in advance of their visit to the BB&T Center.Last season, Detroit missed the playoffs for the first time since 1989-1990 -- an impressive run halted.This season, the Red Wings are relatively healthy -- only defenseman Danny DeKeyser (lower body) shows up on the injury report -- but are still struggling with a 4-6-1 record and their recent slump.Jimmy Howard, 33, is still a solid goalie, but Detroit's defense has become slow and plodding, and Detroit is below average offensively as well.Part of the problem is that some of the Wings' biggest stars have aged north of 35, including 37-year-old defenseman Niklas Kronwall and 37-year-old left winger Henrik Zetterberg.In addition, 23-year-old center Andreas Athanasiou -- one of the team's young stars -- held out in a contract dispute and didn't play his first game until Thursday.After scoring 18 goals last year, he has zero points so far."We're looking for a jolt," Red Wings coach Jeff Blashill told the media this week."Hopefully, (Athanasiou) can give us that jolt."
Preview: Heat look to snap 7-game losing streak in series vs. Celtics:::::TV: FOX Sports Sun TIME: Pregame coverage begins at 7:30 p.m. MIAMI -- The Miami Heat are looking for payback.The Heat (2-2) play host to the Boston Celtics (3-2) on Saturday night, and there is interesting history between the two teams.Boston has won seven straight games against Miami, including their past four times invading AmericanAirlines Arena.The Celtics swept last season's series, 4-0.This past offseason, Boston beat Miami again by signing forward Gordon Hayward, a player the Heat coveted as their No.1 target in free agency.However, Hayward broke his leg on opening night and is out for the season.Miami Heat on FOX Sports Sun Celtics coach Brad Stevens told ESPN Boston that he expects Hayward to be back in the team environment next week so that he can be actively engaged as a mentor."We're going to throw him different assignments that we're working on as a staff," Stevens said."We want him to give our younger players his insight."Meanwhile, Miami did score one victory, in a sense, signing former Celtics power forward Kelly Olynyk as a free agent this past summer.This will be Olynyk's first game against the only pro team he had ever known prior to this season.So far, Olynyk has delivered as expected.He is averaging 9.5 points, which is also his five-season career norm.His rebounds are slightly up from last season, from 4.8 to 6.5, and his assists are also on pace for a career high at 3.0.Olynyk is getting increased playing time due to the absence of injured center Hassan Whiteside, who is expected to miss his fourth straight game due to a bruised knee.Heat president Pat Riley, who was inducted into the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce Sports Hall of Champions on Thursday, said it is too early to assess his team."Let's get Hassan back," Riley said told The Miami Herald."That (injury) was sort of a bummer."The Celtics have their own injury issues.Aside from Hayward, forward Marcus Morris (knee) has yet to play this season, although he could return early next week.Boston center Aron Baynes (right elbow) is also banged up.He played all five games this season, starting twice, but he is questionable for Saturday's game.That leaves some interesting matchups for Saturday's contest, including Boston point guard Kyrie Irving (20.8 scoring average, 6.2 assists) against Miami counterpart Goran Dragic (19.8 points, 4.0 assists).In the post, the Heat will rely on the 7-foot, 240-pound Olynyk, 6-9, 250-pound James Johnson (13.5 points, 6.0 rebounds) and 6-10, 245-pound rookie Bam Adebayo (2.0 points, 4.0 rebounds).Boston will counter primarily with 6-10, 245-pound Al Horford, who is averaging 15.8 points and 8.8 rebounds.Finally, on the wings, Miami boasts emerging talent Josh Richardson, veteran scorer Dion Waiters, defensive-minded Justise Winslow, three-point shooter Wayne Ellington and combo guard Tyler Johnson.Boston's wings include two of the bright young stars of the game in 19-year-old rookie Jayson Tatum, who is 6-8; and second-year pro Jaylen Brown, 21, who is 6-7.They combine to average 31 points per game.Brown was the third overall pick in the 2016 draft, out of Cal.Tatum was the third overall pick this year, out of Duke.Two more players the Celtics have drafted in the first round -- 23-year-old guards Marcus Smart and Terry Rozier -- are more proof of the stable of young and talented players on the Boston roster.They combine to average nearly 21 points per game.And given the absence of players such as Hayward and Whiteside, look for both teams to go small and bomb away from three-point range.Stevens and Heat coach Erik Spoelstra both love "position-less basketball," and even the big men on these teams can shoot.
Preview: Florida aims to throw wrench in Georgia's perfect season in annual rivalry showdown:::::TV: CBS Time: 3:30 p.m. JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida's Jim McElwain and Georgia's Kirby Smart took detailed notes during their time at Alabama.Organizational structure.Recruiting tactics.Practice techniques.Leadership qualities.Game management.It was basically How to Build a Successful Program 101.More Florida Gators news Or How to Become Alabama 2.0.One of Nick Saban's former assistants sure seems like he has a better grasp on the subject matter than the other.McElwain and Smart appear headed in opposite directions as unranked Florida and unbeaten Georgia prepare to play their annual rivalry game Saturday at EverBank Field, a Southeastern Conference matchup better known as "The World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party."The Gators (3-3, 3-2 SEC) have lost two in a row, are two-touchdown underdogs and are coming off a bizarre week.McElwain said Monday that Florida players and families received death threats amid the team's struggles.He did not contact police and declined to say whether he personally received threats.School administrators, including athletic director Scott Stricklin, met with McElwain in hopes of gathering more information and helping alleviate any safety concerns.McElwain rebuffed their efforts, prompting a statement from the athletic department that essentially criticized McElwain for being uncooperative.McElwain backtracked a bit Wednesday, but stopped short of apologizing and again refused to provide details about the threats.Couple that strange situation with McElwain's inability to develop a quarterback or improve a woeful offense, and it hardly would be a surprise to learn that the administrators are growing weary of McElwain even though he led the team to consecutive Eastern Division titles."I know a lot of people are doubting us right now, so it's up to us to prove everybody wrong," Florida linebacker Jeremiah Moon said.The third-ranked Bulldogs (7-0, 4-0) have way more believers .Freshman Jake Fromm ranks second in the conference in pass efficiency.Nick Chubb and Sony Michel are one of the best running back tandems in the country.Georgia's offense is averaging 43 points a game in league play, and its defense is fourth nationally in scoring.Throw in Smart's recent recruiting run, and there's plenty of hope beyond 2017."He's got things going," McElwain said.Keeping them going is the challenge.The Gators have won three in a row and 21 of 27 in the series, which has had its share of upsets over the years.The Bulldogs don't want to be on the losing end again, something Smart made clear during a team meeting Sunday night.Smart asked players to stand up if they had beaten Florida."No one stood up," Georgia nose tackle John Atkins said."The road to win in the East goes through Florida, so you have to be able to beat them.It's a big rivalry.You don't want to lose to a big rival."Here are some other things to know about Georgia and Florida: RETURNING GATORS: Florida expects to have big-play receivers Tyrie Cleveland (ankle) and Kadarius Toney (shoulder) back from injuries along with defensive end Jabari Zuniga (ankle).Receiver Josh Hammond (back) is considered "very questionable."TRAVELING DOGS: Georgia fans have gobbled up tickets for road games this season and even had a noticeable presence at Notre Dame.They had equally impressive turnouts at Tennessee and at Auburn, raising speculation that they could outnumber Florida fans in the neutral-site game."Whatever the magic potion has been, it's been good for our players," Smart said."We certainly hope it continues in Jacksonville."TRASH TALK: The Gators made headlines early in the week with choice words for their rivals.Hammond was the most outspoken, saying "They might be the No.(3) team in the country, but they can't beat Florida."McElwain responded by saying he "would hope they're confident."He also expects Smart to take advantage of the bulletin-board material ."I'm sure he's got it all up.No doubt."RED-ZONE SCORING: The game features two of five Football Bowl Subdivision teams that are perfect in the red zone this season.Georgia is 29 of 29, with 20 touchdowns; Florida is 15 of 15, including 11 touchdowns."We've done a decent job once we get down there," McElwain said."The key is getting down there more often."HALL OF FAME: Quarterback Tim Tebow (Florida), cornerback Lito Sheppard (Florida), running back Knowshon Moreno (Georgia) and linebacker Randall Godfrey (Georgia) headline the Florida-Georgia Hall of Fame for 2017.
Preview: UCF, Austin Peay meet in matchup created in wake of Hurricane Irma:::::TV: ESPN3 Time: 5 p.m. ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Austin Peay coach Will Healy wants his team to enjoy its trip to Florida, and for the Governors to upset Central Florida -- in that order.The Governors weren't even scheduled to make this trip, but since his FCS program was added to 18th-ranked UCF's schedule Healy is treating it like a bowl game for Austin Peay.The team arrived in Orlando on a special charter flight on Thursday -- a day early -- with the coaches' families in tow.Once on the ground, the Austin Peay contingent immediately headed to Disney World Theme Park for six hours of fun.Austin Peay plans on Friday enjoying some time at Cocoa Beach, which is about an hour away.They will take care of some business as well, going through a walk-through practice.The Governors will start to lock in and mentally prepare for their matchup Saturday with UCF (6-0) in what they jokingly have dubbed the "Peay Bowl.""I wanted to treat this like a bowl game, down to having a bowl gift on their beds when they got there," said Healy, Austin Peay's second year coach."I wanted to make sure these kids can never have a better experience playing a college football game than what our guys are going to do this week."It could be dubbed the Hurricane Irma game.Neither team was scheduled to play this weekend when the season begun, but storm forced the Knights to cancel their September home game against Georgia Tech.UCF needed an extra game and Austin Peay (5-3) was available.Healy and his players made it work with a few conditions."This is going to be like a Super Bowl for them," UCF coach Scott Frost said of the Governors."They're coming down here and treating this like a bowl game.I've been on a team like theirs when I was (an assistant coach) at Northern Iowa and when you get to play an FBS team there is nothing you want more in the world than to knock a team off and beat them."So I know they are going to come down here hungry and our guys have to ready."Healy, whose team entered the season ranked last in Division I football after losing 27 straight, isn't expecting anything less than the Knights best.He understands what's at stake for UCF."They're fighting for something a lot bigger than just this week," Healy said of Frost and the Knights."He's got those kids' attention and they know they can do something really special this year and I think they will."Some other things to watch when Austin Peay visits No.18 UCF: ON TARGET: UCF quarterback McKenzie Milton continues to have an outstanding second season, ranking second in the nation in passing efficiency (196.3) and third in passing yards per completion (16.4 yards).HIGH OCTANE: The Knights offense struggled last week against Navy by its standards with just four touchdowns and 31 points.But UCF still has the top scoring offense in the country with 47.3 points per game.BIG TURNAROUND: The Governors came into the season on a 27-game losing streak, which included going 0-11 during Healy's first year.They are 5-3 now and have a realistic chance of making the FCS playoffs if they can win their final three games.COMING OFF THE EDGE: Senior Tony Guerad has been the Knights most productive defensive lineman for two seasons now.Last week against Navy, he led the D-linemen with nine tackles against the Midshipmen's triple option.Guerad also leads UCF's defensive linemen for the season 23 stops to go along with 4.5 tackles for loss.NEW KID ON THE BLOCK: Freshman reserve Otis Anderson got his most extensive work in the Knights backfield during their game-sealing drive against late in the fourth quarter against Navy.Anderson, who is actually listed as a receiver on the depth chart, had a couple of nice runs on the drive and capped it with his first career rushing touchdown -- a 10-yard run that gave UCF the 31-21 win.
Preview: No. 8 Miami looks to avoid letdown against dismal UNC:::::TV: ESPN2 TIME: Noon CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Eighth-ranked Miami is unbeaten and a big favorite heading into Saturday's game at injury-depleted North Carolina.Still, coach Mark Richt doesn't expect an easy game."We're just finding way to win at the end of games," Richt said."We're not foolish enough to think that we've arrived yet.I don't think they believe that.They know we have to earn it."The Hurricanes (6-0, 4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) haven't had an easy win in October, even though they sit as the lone unbeaten in the league's typically unpredictable Coastal Division.There was a win at Florida State on a touchdown with 6 seconds left, followed a week later by a win against Georgia Tech on a field goal with 4 seconds left and last weekend's 27-19 win against Syracuse.The visit to North Carolina (1-7, 0-5) comes before two pivotal home games -- first against No.13 Virginia Tech followed by one against No.9 Notre Dame -- that will factor into whether Miami reaches its first ACC championship game and contends for a spot in the College Football Playoff.Things are very different for the Tar Heels, who seem like they're just trying to get through each week.UNC is off to its worst start in league play since going 0-6 in 2006, done in by inexperience compounded by a dizzying number of injuries.Most glaringly, the traditionally high-scoring offense has a combined 38 points in the past four games and has twice needed fourth-quarter touchdowns to avoid the first shutout of the Larry Fedora era.UNC is coming off a 59-7 loss at Virginia Tech, the most lopsided loss of Fedora's six-year tenure, two seasons after winning 11 games and reaching the ACC title game."I wouldn't know how to answer that other than that I can tell the fans that I wish we were playing better," Fedora said when asked what he would say to fans questioning the direction of the program."And I wish we were winning football games.And nobody wants it more than these players and these coaches, I assure you.But I can't really worry about people that are fickle.And if they really truly understand the game of football and they really, truly love this program, they'll understand what's going on."Here are some other things to know about Saturday's Miami-North Carolina game: THIN ROSTER: The Tar Heels' injury report listed 21 players as out for this game, 17 of those being out for the season.The list of those out specifically for this game includes freshman tailback Michael Carter -- who had big games against California and Virginia -- and safety Donnie Miles.STREAKING: Miami has won 11 straight going back to last season, the second-best active streak in the country behind only South Florida's 12.The Hurricanes have also won their last eight ACC games, the best current league streak ahead of North Carolina State (five), Boston College (two) and Virginia Tech (two).HISTORY LESSON: Miami is 124-8-1 as a Top 10 team when facing an unranked opponent.But one of those eight losses came at North Carolina in 2004 -- and there are similarities between then and now.Miami also entered that game 6-0, the Tar Heels had a losing record (3-4 then), UNC was coming off a blowout loss (46-16 to Utah in 2004), and the 2004 matchup also was on Halloween weekend.CARDIAC 'CANES: Miami's last three wins by a combined 13 points marks its closest margin for back-to-back-to-back wins in the same season since 1992.That year, the Hurricanes beat Arizona (8-7), Florida State (17-16) and Penn State (17-14) by a combined five points.The Hurricanes went on to play for the national title that season, losing to Alabama in the Sugar Bowl.LINE PLAY: The Tar Heels have to get something more from an underachieving offensive line, which has struggled despite having several veterans."They've got to play better," Fedora said."They know it.Nobody knows it better than them."

J.T. Barrett boosts legacy in memorable comeback for Ohio State:::::J.T.Barrett connects on three touchdowns in the fourth quarter, including the go-ahead score to Marcus Baugh, and the Buckeyes knock off Penn State 39-38.(2:30) COLUMBUS, Ohio -- J.T.Barrett's legacy at Ohio State is safe.Barrett threw 13 passes in a fourth quarter while his program's hopes of a win, a Big Ten title shot and a return trip to the College Football Playoff hung in the balance.He completed all 13 of them.The fifth-year senior, some six weeks removed from his fan base questioning whether he belonged in the starting lineup, threw for 328 yards and four touchdowns, leading his team in a comeback that will long be remembered at the Horseshoe.He and the No.6 Buckeyes spent more than 50 minutes trying to climb out of a two-touchdown hole before Barrett found tight end Marcus Baugh in the back of the end zone with less than two minutes left to hand Penn State its first loss, 39-38.J.T.Barrett completed 33 of 39 passes - including 13 in a row during the fourth quarter - for 328 yards and four touchdowns in the win over No.2 Penn State.Aaron Doster/USA TODAY Sports No.2 Penn State has owned the first quarter in all eight of its games this year.The Nittany Lions did again in Columbus, but the fourth quarter belonged to Ohio State's veteran quarterback.After setting a conference record for career touchdown passes in the second quarter, Barrett passed for three more of them -- all in the final quarter.He connected with Johnnie Dixon on a 38-yard pass through the middle of Penn State's defense -- a group that led the nation in points allowed before surrendering 39 to Ohio State's revived attack.That came on the heels of a blocked punt.Seven minutes later, Dixon came open again in the end zone, this time from 10 yards out.Baugh, who dropped a pass when things were spinning against his team in the first few moments, redeemed himself on the go-ahead drive.His touchdown capped a five-play drive that went 58 yards.Two yards on the ground for Barrett, followed by four straight completions.Penn State called timeout with 39 seconds left, giving Barrett one more chance to take a knee at center stage before his teammates and Buckeyes fans spilled onto the field to celebrate.He has put himself and his team in position to negate an early season loss to Oklahoma that started the questions swirling about his ability to win big games.Those are quelled for now.Four more outings stand between the Buckeyes and an unbeaten league record.From there, a chance to play for a championship might be waiting for them.
University of Florida administrators discussing if they can fire coach Jim McElwain following his claims his family and players received death threats.:::::Jim McElwain says he hasn't been told anything about his job status and calls Florida a "dream job."(1:15) JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- University of Florida administrators are discussing whether they can fire coach Jim McElwain with cause, multiple sources told ESPN.After failing to find any evidence to substantiate claims made by McElwain this week that his family and players received death threats, Florida administrators have worked to see if the coach's allegations were enough to relieve the university from paying his full buyout of $12.9 million if he were to be fired.The news came amid another tough result on the field for the unranked Gators (3-4, 3-3 SEC), who were dismantled 42-7 by No.3 Georgia (8-0, 5-0) on Saturday in Jacksonville.When asked about the speculation after the defeat, McElwain said he first heard about buyout negotiations while walking into team breakfast earlier Saturday."It's the first I've heard of it," McElwain said."We'll see."Sources believe the university has enough cause to fire McElwain without having to pay his buyout.Sources also said that if McElwain were to be relieved of his duties, defensive coordinator Randy Shannon would be asked to be the team's interim coach."At the end of the day, we were all brought here to win, and we haven't done it," McElwain said."The concern isn't about my job.It's about the players and my staff.That's the concern.It isn't about me."McElwain said he spoke to athletic director Scott Stricklin on Thursday, but the possibility of losing his job wasn't mentioned."Nothing in this world surprises me," McElwain said."I know what I was brought here to do: to fix the offense.And we haven't done that.We haven't won enough, and we haven't won championships."Prior to Saturday's game, Stricklin released a statement dispelling rumors that the school was working on a buyout with McElwain."No one representing the University of Florida or our athletic department has had any conversations with Coach McElwain or his representatives regarding a buyout of his contract," Stricklin said in a statement."Our focus is on this great Florida-Georgia rivalry today in Jacksonville."The buyout talk coupled with the blowout loss capped a tumultuous week for McElwain and the Gators.On Monday, the coach told reporters unprompted during his news conference that his family and players received death threats."There's a lot of hate in this world and a lot of anger," McElwain told reporters."And yet it's freedom to show it.The hard part is obviously when the threats [are] against your own players, the death threats to your families, the ill will that's brought upon out there."When asked to expand on his claims, McElwain wouldn't go into detail about the nature of the threats and said he wasn't planning to contact law enforcement."A lot of angry people," McElwain said."In this business, we're the ones that you take the shots at.That's the way it is."Two days later, McElwain said that he was wrong to bring up the death threats that he said "happened in the past."After the Georgia loss Saturday, McEwain reiterated his regret for what transpired with the talk of death threats."When you look back, I've made mistakes in my life," he said."And yet I stand by everything that occurred.It is what it is."Florida officials were unaware of McElwain's claims until he discussed them during the Monday news conference.The school released a statement regarding possible death threats but added that after meeting with McElwain, he "offered no additional details.""The University Athletic Association takes the safety of our student-athletes, coaches, staff and families very seriously,'' team spokesman Steve McClain said in the statement."Our administration met with Coach McElwain this afternoon, and he offered no additional details.''McElwain, who was hired in December 2014, entered Saturday with a 22-11 record and had won the SEC Eastern Division in back-to-back seasons, becoming the first SEC coach to make it to the SEC championship game in each of his first two seasons.His 19 wins entering the 2017 season were the second-most by any SEC coach in 2015 and '16.Those 19 wins tied Steve Spurrier for the second-most victories by a Florida coach in his first two seasons.
Houston Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel won't be suspended for any World Series games following his gesture and comments about Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish:::::MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred states that Yuli Gurriel will be suspended five games without pay at the start of the 2018 season for his disrespectful actions toward Yu Darvish in Game 3 of the World Series.(1:29) HOUSTON -- Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel will be suspended for five games -- but none during the World Series -- for racially insensitive behavior directed at Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish, baseball commissioner Rob Manfred said Saturday.Gurriel disrupted the World Series here Friday night when he used his fingers to slant his eyes in a gesture that is offensive to people of Asian descent and mouthed a derogatory word in Spanish after hitting a home run against Darvish and returning to the Astros' dugout in the second inning of Game 3.Editor's Picks Manfred's leadership was tested with the Gurriel incident -- and he passed Under the spotlight of the World Series and with the Astros two wins from their first title, the commissioner had to address the racially insensitive behavior from one of Houston's stars.And he did so with pragmatism.Manfred met Saturday with Gurriel and said the 33-year-old rookie, a native of Cuba, "expressed remorse."He also noted Darvish's desire to "move forward" from the ugly incident.But Manfred said he also couldn't allow Gurriel's actions to go unpunished, leaving him to determine only the length of the punishment and when to enforce it.In deciding to wait until the beginning of next season, Manfred explained he wanted to make sure Gurriel's penalty included docking his $12 million salary -- he will lose $322,581.He also didn't want to punish the rest of the Astros players for the behavior of one individual."There is no question that it is a difficult decision as to when the appropriate timing was," Manfred said."Obviously World Series games are different than regular-season games, and I used my best judgment as to where the appropriate disciplinary level fell.I understand that people may have different views.But it was my best judgment that this timing was appropriate."Another part of Manfred's calculus involved trying to make sure Gurriel didn't exercise his right through the players' union to appeal his suspension.The union announced in a statement that it will not appeal.In a separate statement, Gurriel described his actions as "indefensible.""I sincerely apologize to everyone that I offended with my actions," Gurriel said."I deeply regret it."As part of the punishment, MLB will require him to undergo "sensitivity training" in the offseason.Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow released a statement in which he said the team was "surprised and disappointed by the behavior displayed by Yuli Gurriel" and announced the club will donate the first baseman's lost salary to a charity that supports diversity efforts.But Gurriel also remained in the Astros' Game 4 lineup Saturday night, playing first base and batting fifth.Gurriel grounded out into a double play in his first at-bat.When he approached the plate, he was largely met with applause.Houston leads the best-of-seven series, 2-1.Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, whose mother is Japanese, lauded Darvish's handling of the situation."The way that Yu responded I think on camera, through social media, I completely commend him, support him, echo his thoughts that we need to learn from this.It's obviously not acceptable," Roberts said.Speaking through an interpreter after the game Friday night, Gurriel said he made the gesture because he hasn't had success in the past against Japanese pitchers.He also explained that both the gesture and the word -- "chinito," loosely translated as "little Chinese boy" -- are commonly used in Cuba, although he admitted he realized they are considered offensive in many places, including Darvish's native Japan.Gurriel played one season in Japan in 2014.Based on Saturday's meeting, Manfred said he believes Gurriel understands the meaning behind his actions."He maintains that he did not intend to be offensive, but he understands that he was.And that's what's important," Manfred said."I think that we all need continuing reminders and education in this area as to what's appropriate and not appropriate, and I do feel like [the sensitivity training] is an important part of the entire package."Manfred declined to discuss specifics of his conversation with the players' union other than to say it was "supportive of the general proposition that this type of behavior was not appropriate in our game."MLB went beyond its precedent for penalties for similar behavior.In 2012, then-Toronto Blue Jays infielder Yunel Escobar received a three-game suspension for wearing eye-black with a homophobic slur written in Spanish.Earlier this season, Blue Jays center fielder Kevin Pillar and Oakland Athletics outfielder Matt Joyce were each suspended two games without pay for yelling an anti-gay slur, Pillar at an Atlanta Braves pitcher and Joyce at a fan."I think that the two [games], that was kind of the standard that had evolved over three of four incidents was inadequate to deal with the particulars of this situation," Manfred said, "and I will continue to deal with each situation on its own merits."
Martellus Bennett of Green Bay Packers says he's 'pretty sure' he'll retire after this season:::::GREEN BAY, Wis. -- When veteran tight end Martellus Bennett signed a three-year, $21 million contract with the Green Bay Packers this spring, he never offered any hint that his stay would be much shorter.But Bennett might be calling it quits after just one year in Green Bay.Bennett, 30, posted an Instagram story on Saturday saying he is considering retirement after this season, his 10th in the NFL."After conversations with my family, I'm pretty sure these next eight games will be the conclusion of my NFL career," Bennett wrote."To everyone that has poured themselves and time into my life and career.These next games are for you.Thank you."Packers tight end Martellus Bennett has 24 catches for 233 yards and no touchdowns this season, his 10th in the NFL.Larry Radloff/Icon Sportswire A Packers source confirmed Saturday that the team is aware of Bennett's possible retirement after the season.Green Bay, which is on a bye this week, has nine games to go in the regular season.Even after he signed with the Packers, Bennett maintained his home in Long Grove, Illinois, a northern suburb.Bennett spoke frequently about the return trips he made there to see his wife and daughter."It's only two-and-a-half hours from here, so it's been a blessing," Bennett said last spring during OTAs.Bennett got off to a slow start this season and battled drops, but he has 24 catches (fourth-most on the team) for 233 yards without a touchdown.Before Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers broke his collarbone, Rodgers said he needed to make sure he got Bennett more involved early in games.Earlier this month, Bennett said he wasn't disappointed in his relatively limited production because he was still getting used to playing with Rodgers, and the Packers were winning.They were 4-1 at the time but have lost two straight since Rodgers went down."It's a long season," Bennett said earlier this month."The season's still getting started.For me, I left a couple of plays on the field here and there, but it's just getting used to and getting acclimated to playing in a game-type situation with Aaron and the team and the flow of things.So just try to figure out that, try to get in a good rhythm.I haven't really been able to get in a rhythm yet.But we're just getting started, and we're winning games.That's all that really matters."It doesn't matter if I have 10 catches or two catches.There's a lot of stuff I'll make an impact in the game with.It doesn't matter if I'm getting the ball or not.If my impact on this week's game is chipping a lot, I'm going to try to do the best job I can do chipping.If they need me to catch 10 balls, I'm going to try to go catch 10 balls.Every single week is different.I know a lot of the outside people look at statistics, but I just look at Ws."The Packers signed Bennett after they decided to let tight end Jared Cook leave in free agency.Cook then signed a two-year, $10.6 deal with the Raiders.
Players coalitions seeks meeting with Bob McNair of Houston Texans, Roger Goodell, Colin Kaepernick:::::On the heels of Bob McNair's controversial "inmates running the prison" comment, a coalition of NFL players has extended an invitation to the Houston Texans owner, commissioner Roger Goodell and unsigned quarterback Colin Kaepernick to a Monday meeting in Philadelphia at which they hope to address players' "immediate concerns before additional progress can be made."A copy of the letter was obtained by ESPN.Editor's Picks Source: Apologetic McNair meets with Texans Texans owner Bob McNair met with his players Saturday morning and expressed regret for his "inmates running the prison" comment.How the NFL, players forged anthem detente amid gaffes, TV ratings concerns The behind-closed-doors story of how the NFL and players forged a shaky alliance over the national anthem as owners navigated the collision of financial worries and social activism.1 Related The coalition consists of 11 players, including Malcolm Jenkins and Anquan Boldin, who have been attending meetings with NFL executives in recent weeks to discuss, in part, player involvement in communities and with law enforcement."Many players have been deeply troubled by the disturbing comments made by Texans' owner Bob McNair," the letter said."It is ironic that such a quote would emerge in the midst of an ongoing struggle to highlight injustices suffered by people of color, including our nation's deeply flawed approach to criminal justice and inhumane treatment of imprisoned people.The events that have unfolded the past several days have upset and angered many players and continues to demonstrate the lack of seriousness that some league officials are approaching our discussions.It is this lack of earnest words and actions that provoke and reinforce the continuation of our protest."As long as the prevailing reality of our league includes a culture where owners feel such behavior and language is permissible, our cause will continue to be stifled and progress will remain elusive.This isn't about being a player or a club owner -- but basic human decency."Regardless of our views, our disappointment and our frustration, we believe dialogue remains the only path forward, though our patience is being continually disrespected and is wearing thin."The coalition called the proposal of the meeting "an act of good faith.""Until the league publicly demonstrates its commitment to an actual process of listening to our grievances, we will continue to peacefully demonstrate for equality and justice for all," the letter said.It was not immediately known if McNair, Goodell or Kaepernick would attend.A league spokesman had said earlier this week that Kaepernick was expected to be invited to the next meeting between NFL players and owners.During the owners meeting in New York earlier this month, McNair said, "We can't have the inmates running the prison," in reference to ongoing player demonstrations during the national anthem.The comment was made public in an ESPN The Magazine story published Friday that looked in detail on what went on at an Oct. 17 meeting of select NFL owners, players and union leaders and the full owners meeting the following day at which McNair made the comment.McNair apologized for the comment Friday and again Saturday, saying: "I am truly sorry to the players for how this has impacted them and the perception that it has created of me, which could not be further from the truth."On Saturday morning, he met with Texans players and expressed regret for the initial comment.One day earlier, Texans players considered a walkout from the team facility, and two players -- star wideout DeAndre Hopkins and backup running back D'Onta Foreman -- were listed as Did Not Practice-Not Injury Related on the injury report, absences that sources said were directly related to the what McNair said.Information from ESPN's Adam Schefter and Josina Anderson was used in this report.
Anthony Barr of Minnesota Vikings claps back at Aaron Rodgers of Green Bay Packers:::::MINNEAPOLIS -- Minnesota Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr explained his version of events after Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers went on Conan O'Brien's late-night talk show and detailed what happened after the play where he suffered a broken collarbone.Barr's hit on Rodgers, which knocked the quarterback out of the game in Week 6 and for the foreseeable future, has added to the vitriol of the Vikings-Packers rivalry.Editor's Picks Rodgers says Barr gave him finger after hit Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said that Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr gave him the finger and the "suck it" sign after the hit that broke his collarbone.Rodgers had screws inserted in collarbone Packers QB Aaron Rodgers said screws were inserted to repair his broken collarbone.1 Related Fox's television cameras caught Rodgers yelling in Barr's direction as he walked off the field and only kept the quarterback in frame until the next play began.On "Conan," Rodgers said the cameras missed Barr giving him the finger and a "suck it" sign.Rodgers said that Barr gestured to him, so Barr started yelling at the quarterback.Barr says the opposite occurred -- that Rodgers yelled profanities first, and Barr responded by gesturing at him.Barr replied on Twitter."smh this guy got y'all fooled man," Barr's tweet said."after the play i go back to the huddle, don't even look or say a word to him.once he gets up i'm waiting for the play call, and hear someone shouting all kinds of profanities.i look over and it's y'all mans calling me all kinds of names, F you this F you that as he's walking off the field.so naturally, i responded.i don't care if you aaron rodgers or Mr. Rodgers, if you say something like that you're gonna get a response from me.i could go on a talk show every weekend and complain about the 'disrespectful' things players say or do.if he takes the lick and keeps it pushing we aren't STILL talking about this.get over it.#13dayslater."Barr initially said he could not make out what Rodgers was saying."I wasn't really paying attention," Barr said the day he was removed from the NFL's concussion protocol."I saw the replay kind of blurred his mouth out.He wasn't happy, and I understand.He probably realized that he was injured at that time, and he wasn't happy.I probably would have had that same reaction.It's fine."Barr's hit on Rodgers was not deemed illegal, but the NFL gave the linebacker a $9,115 fine for head-butting Packers WR Davante Adams in the same game.The Vikings are in London preparing to face the Cleveland Browns on Sunday.Kickoff is set for 9:30 a.m.ET.
Dartmouth Big Green assistant coach punches window at Harvard Stadium:::::A Dartmouth coach was so incensed when his team fumbled a punt against Harvard that he punched a hole through the glass at Harvard Stadium on Saturday.Dion King, a defensive quality control coach for Dartmouth, was located in the press box above the field when he broke the glass, sending shards down below.Aftermath of the Dartmouth coach's tantrum.Harvard 25, Dartmouth 22. pic.twitter.com/lmpEJK9JOd WHRB Sports (@WHRBSports) October 28, 2017 King was escorted out of the stadium by security.In a statement, Dartmouth head coach Buddy Teevens said King "let his emotions get the best of him.""Dion and Dartmouth Football are terribly sorry for his actions and any harm caused by them.We hold ourselves to high standards, and in this instance we failed to conduct ourselves appropriately.Dion, Dartmouth Football, and I apologize wholeheartedly to everyone impacted, as well as to Harvard and Dartmouth," Teevens said.With Dartmouth ahead 14-0 in the second quarter, Danny McManus fumbled the punt in question, which Harvard recovered and turned into a touchdown after a six-play, 38-yard drive.Harvard would rally to win, 25-22.
Rob Manfred's leadership was tested with Yuli Gurriel's racially insensitive behavior, and he passed:::::MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred states that Yuli Gurriel will be suspended five games without pay at the start of the 2018 season for his disrespectful actions toward Yu Darvish in Game 3 of the World Series.(1:29) HOUSTON -- Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred issued Yuli Gurriel a five-game suspension on Saturday with full knowledge that some segments of the baseball community -- and perhaps people who have never even seen a baseball game -- would be upset by the timing or the message or the perceived inadequacy of the response.This is an occupational hazard of holding a position of authority in a $10 billion industry in which events play out every night on a live stage.One minute, you're sitting in the crowd with 43,282 fans showering Texans defensive end J.J. Watt with love as he throws out the ceremonial first pitch while on crutches.And two innings later, your cell phone is buzzing with a heads-up that Houston's first baseman has responded to a home run off the Los Angeles Dodgers' starting pitcher with racially insensitive behavior in the Astros' dugout that was captured for all the world to see.And then you have a few hours to interview Gurriel to gauge his level of contrition, determine Yu Darvish's willingness to move on, weigh the interests of the two teams and consider the historical implications of the decision -- all before asking the folks at the Major League Baseball Players Association for their opinion on the topic.Sometimes, leadership is all about threading the needle and making the best of a bad situation.Manfred made the best of a bad situation Saturday afternoon, when he announced that Gurriel would be suspended for five games without pay at the start of the 2018 season.To his credit, Manfred didn't bury the lead.Upon taking his seat in a packed interview room four hours before Game 4 of the World Series, Manfred laser-focused on the heart of the matter."There is complete unanimity -- me, my office, both owners, both clubs and the MLBPA -- that there is no place in our game for the behavior or any behavior like the behavior we witnessed last night,'' Manfred said."There is no excuse or explanation that makes that type of behavior acceptable.''This is not a situation anyone wants or could have possibly foreseen.The Astros are raising the spirits of a city and a region that were devastated by Hurricane Harvey less than two months ago.Game 3 was a veritable lovefest at Minute Maid Park before Gurriel cast a blemish on the proceedings.MLB always has to be vigilant for replay glitches, fans leaning over outfield fences to catch fly balls or even the impromptu beanball confrontation that takes the focus off events on the field.But there's not much of a roadmap to navigate the problem of racially insensitive behavior being dispensed from the dugout.People are free to draw their own conclusions about Gurriel and what he did.He'll have to live with the fallout of opinions expressed on social media.As Astros manager A.J.Hinch recently observed, questionable bullpen decisions are enough to subject people in his profession to a "public slaying'' on Twitter.Racially insensitive expressions, regardless of intention, are a completely different ballgame.The reactions of the two main parties helped lower the temperature.Gurriel was remorseful and contrite over his actions, and Darvish took the high road, and his reasoned and sensitive response quickly advanced the notion that everyone is best served to use what transpired at Minute Maid Park on Friday night as a teachable moment.So what could baseball do to send the proper message?If Manfred had tried to drop the hammer immediately, the union could have appealed, and the machinations of a grievance proceeding would have become an unwelcome sideshow to the sport's crown jewel event.Gurriel has already agreed to not appeal, and we'll be spared any news updates involving MLB's independent arbitrator, Mark Irvings, over the coming days.Given the examples on the books, a five-game suspension for Gurriel seems like a logical progression.In 2012, Toronto shortstop Yunel Escobar received a three-game suspension for displaying a homophobic slur on his eye black.This year, Toronto's Kevin Pillar and Oakland's Matt Joyce were both hit with two-game suspensions for anti-gay slurs in May and August, respectively.Gurriel will take part in sensitivity training as part of his discipline, and Manfred hopes that will be viewed as more than just a footnote to the story."I think it's important,'' he said."I think we all need continuing reminders and education in this area as to what's appropriate and not appropriate.''No amount of training or counseling can ensure we won't see similar situations down the road.But the public censure for Gurriel's transgression was strong enough that the next player who crosses the line will have only himself to blame.Manfred's response was authoritative and pragmatic in a way that marked his tenure as baseball's labor lawyer under Bud Selig and bodes well for his commissionership.For a few hours Saturday, Manfred's job became less about shaking hands and presenting awards than setting an example for crisis management.His leadership skills were tested on the fly, and he passed the test.
Insanity at Iowa State: Cyclones knock off another Big 12 unbeaten:::::Emmanuel Acho and Chip Kelly break down Iowa State's big win over Iowa State and how this might be bad news for the Big 12 in the College Football Playoff.(2:02) AMES, Iowa -- Iowa States October of knocking Big 12 contenders from prime position in the College Football Playoff race came to a raucous and resounding end on Saturday.The No.25 Cyclones, ranked for the first time since 2005, upset No.4 TCU 14-7 to leave the league without an unbeaten as the CFP committee prepares to unveil its first rankings of the season Tuesday.The storybook resurgence under second-year coach Matt Campbell continued as ISU (6-2, 4-1) claimed a share of first place in the Big 12 with TCU and Oklahoma State, pending the result of Oklahomas meeting with Texas Tech on Saturday.The Cyclones, bowl-eligible for the first time since 2012, own the tiebreaker over the Horned Frogs and Sooners -- both victims in a month for the ages at Iowa State.The Cyclones have won four straight games since a Sept. 28 home loss to Texas.Matthew Eaton helped Iowa State move into a tie for the Big 12 lead with a 17-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter.David Purdy/Getty Images One of six remaining Power 5 teams before Saturday without a loss, TCU (7-1, 4-1) scored for the 314th consecutive game only on KaVontae Turpins 94-yard kickoff return to open the second half.Otherwise, Iowa State held the Horned Frogs, averaging 41.6 points through seven games, to 307 yards and four of 14 third-down conversions.Iowa State defenders J.D.Waggoner, JaQuan Bailey and Willie Harvey teamed to sack TCU quarterback Kenny Hill and force and recover his fumble on a second-and-goal play from the ISU 3-yard line with 7 minutes, 11 seconds to play.Marcel Spears' interception of Hill at the Iowa State 44-yard line with 1:16 left in the game clinched the victory.So now, what happens to the Big 12, which was shut out of the playoff in two of its first three years and is the only Power 5 conference without a semifinal victory?Well see on Tuesday if the committee looks fondly on the Sooners, the Horned Frogs or the Cowboys.One-loss Oklahoma State visits Iowa State on Nov. 11 after a Bedlam and likely CFP-elimination game next week against Oklahoma in Stillwater.As for the Cyclones, theyre happy to serve as a disruptive force.Iowa State simply took the action to TCU on Saturday.The Cyclones silenced Hill by blanketing his receivers with an underrated secondary, daring the Horned Frogs to run.When Iowa States Joel Lanning, the middle linebacker who converted in the offseason from quarterback, wobbled to the sideline with a second-quarter injury, TCU used the opportunity to gash the Cyclones for runs up the middle of 22 yards by Kyle Hicks and 17 by Darius Anderson.Iowa State had a defensive answer, getting strong tackles behind the line of scrimmage from Waggoner and Spears to snuff the Horned Frogs best opportunity of the second half.Meanwhile, Iowa State found little trouble generating early offense against a unit that ranked as the Big 12s best in allowing yards and points per game.David Montgomery consistently ran for tough yards, and Kyle Kempt, the unlikely senior standout in his fourth start, connected with seven receivers for 15 completions before halftime.Kempt hit Matthew Eaton for a 17-yard score midway through the first quarter and Hakeem Butler on a third-down throw in the back of the end zone with 3:29 to play in the half.
Lowe: Ten things I like and don't like, including Giannis ruling the game:::::Rachel Nichols says Giannis Antetokounmpo is not the "future" of the NBA anymore, his time to shine has come.(2:27) And we're back!Let's bounce around the league for the first time this season.10 things I like and don't like 1.I, for one, welcome our new Giannis overlord Holy god.What are you even supposed to do with this guy?Play off of him, and he uses the open space as a runway.If Giannis Antetokounmpo is barreling at a flat-footed defender in the paint, it's over.Your natural instinct -- the only thing you can do, really -- is to backpedal, and most defenders open their hips in one direction as they do.That gives Antetokounmpo a straight line to paydirt.Somehow hold your ground, and Antetokounmpo buries his head in your chest, tips you off-balance, reaches up, and lays the ball in over your head.Press him, and he zips around you.He doesn't even need to blow past you; if he just gets side-by-side, he reaches his arm to a spot you can't, and flicks the ball up.The only answer is to send help, and that is old hat for Antetokounmpo now.He sees every possible pass, and with arms that long, almost every pass is possible.When Thon Maker is at center and the Bucks slot four shooters around Antetokounmpo, they will get a high-value shot every single time.He's getting better at everything.His passing advanced last season.So did his rim protection.He has a soft little floater now, and a Dirk-ish slide-back jumper for post-ups late in the shot clock.He knows how much defenses fear him.He is mastering little tricks that play on that fear -- subtle acts of cruel puppetry.Watch how he spooks the entire Portland defense into gearing up for a drive, only to pivot into a handoff that gets Tony Snell a wide-open triple: Antetokounmpo is thinking one and two steps ahead.LeBron's place as the league's best player should remain unquestioned until he can't reach peak levels in May and June.But Giannis is coming.2.The sluggish Nuggets It's too early to panic about The Curse of the Exiled Powder Blue infecting Denver's offense, but something is amiss.Denver ranks 23rd in points per possession after bumrushing the league last season once they belatedly started Nikola Jokic.The inversion of their shot selection profile from last season to this one suggests a team that has time-traveled back 15 years.Editor's Picks The Lowe Post Zach talks to ESPN's Kevin Arnovitz about the rise of Giannis Antetokounmpo, the future of the Bucks, the surprising Grizzlies and more.Three Bledsoe trades that work for both sides Kevin Pelton looks at three potential destinations for Eric Bledsoe, including a title contender and two teams trying to get to the playoffs.The Bucks' wild strategy to take down the Warriors Five years ago, the Bucks bet their future on building the NBA's longest roster.Now, behind an aggressive defense and young core -- led by Giannis Antetokounmpo and his 7-foot-3 wingspan -- is Milwaukee ready to cash in?2 Related Some of this was inevitable, and will turn as Denver adjusts to new challenges.Teams plan for Jokic's backdoor passing now.Paul Millsap spends more time inside than Danilo Gallinari, his predecessor at power forward, meaning those cutting lanes to the basket are a little more cluttered.But the early issues go deeper; after all, the Nuggets scored like bonkers when Jokic shared the floor with Kenneth Faried.It looks like the entire team contracted mononucleosis from Juancho Hernangomez.Last year's gleeful creativity is gone.Denver is crawling at the league's sixth-slowest pace after humming at the seventh-fastest a year ago.Possessions die after one or two actions, and Denver doesn't have the scoring or passing oomph along the perimeter to make do with isolations and impromptu pick-and-rolls.Gary Harris pulls up one dribble early.Emmanuel Mudiay can't shoot from anywhere, or defend anyone.Jamal Murray's 3-pointer remains theoretical.On one stagnant trip against Charlotte Wednesday, Mason Plumlee attempted a post move.It went badly.The whole team is barfing up turnovers.Start calling Phoenix-area hair salons!3.Oklahoma City, splitting you The Thunder have had predictable hiccups integrating three stars on offense.For everyone but the Warriors, this is a real problem.One fun solution: have two -- Russell Westbrook and Paul George -- screen for each other off the ball in a Golden State-style "split" action.A tap from George is enough; Westbrook explodes to top speed so fast, he needs only the teensiest crease to rampage to the rim.He has long had dormant potential as a lethal cutter.Smart teams will switch the Westbrook-George dance, but George is ready: He sniffs out the switch, and slips to the rim before Minnesota can toggle assignments.George has been a savvy off-ball mover since he arrived in the NBA.Oklahoma City is too talented to scuffle for long.They are feeling out the Westbrook-George and Westbrook-Carmelo Anthony pick-and-roll combinations -- how defenses will respond, and the best counters to those responses.The Thunder's real issue: finding the fifth guy to play alongside their core four.No defender is ever going to be in Andre Roberson's ZIP code; dude is air-balling free throws.His minutes are down.There will be no place to hide Alex Abrines on defense against good teams.Jerami Grant has played zero seconds alongside the Westbrook-George-Anthony-Steven Adams quartet, and Billy Donovan may consider any lineup with George as the nominal shooting guard a little too big.I'd try it -- with Grant or Patrick Patterson.Raymond Felton is ... Raymond Felton.Oklahoma City needs another rotation guy -- badly.4.The random veering of Nerlens Noel Noel is the only big man who regularly apparates out of position: That almost looks like a jump cut.Kosta Koufos doesn't even mean to bait Noel with that bogus handoff, but Noel rushes at the ball like a cat chasing the laser pointer.This kind of stuff drives cantankerous, old-school, stick-to-the-freaking-scheme coaches insane.Noel is a serial gambler.He wins more bets than any man his size should, and it looks incredible when he does.But the bad beats outnumber the improbable steals.Noel might be a massively impactful defender if he learns to modulate the aggression.Boy, do the miserable Mavs need it.Dallas ranks 28th in points allowed per possession, and they can't rebound anything.Their level of investment in Noel has wavered since he turned down their four-year, $70 million offer.He had barely logged any minutes alongside the Dirk Nowitzki-Harrison Barnes combo before Rick Carlisle started that trio in a home-and-home against Memphis.Noel played 12 minutes in Monday's blowout loss against the Warriors.(Foul trouble resulting from his wayward, no-chance reaches hasn't helped.)Fitting the Barnes-Nowitzki-Noel trio is a challenge, but the Mavs need to try to make it work with Noel.It's not as if they are teeming with young, mobile bigs.5.Caris LeVert, contortionist LeVert presents one classic young player dilemma: The process looks much better than results.LeVert maps the floor at a sophisticated level.He understands how defenses rotate, where open teammates should be, and how to manipulate all the chess pieces with his dribble.He moves with an arrhythmic, buffering stop-and-start that confounds defenders.None of that matters much if you shoot 38 percent overall, and 14 percent from deep.But his method of finding those shots -- and generating them for teammates -- is so intriguing, and so damned smart, that you wager on those shooting percentages catching up as LeVert gains experience.He is especially clever in tight spaces -- a whirling blur of fakes, spins, and semi-blind wraparound dishes.LeVert can get a little too daring -- almost arrogant.He tries impossible passes, and stops the ball now and then to launch off-the-bounce midrangers.Defenders are already ducking under picks against him, and ignoring him off the ball.But the raw material of a solid starting wing is here.6.The old West standbys, not going anywhere We know the Spurs are never going away, but it is mildly surprising how easily they rolled three quality teams (and the Bulls) without Kawhi Leonard.Something lit a fire under LaMarcus Aldridge's ass; he's shooting almost 60 percent on post-ups, and grinding on defense.Rudy Gay is providing solid minutes at both forward positions -- and even some spot time at center in Miami on Wednesday.Dejounte Murray is a menace.Slow-Mo Anderson is tea-timing his way to buckets.Brandon Paul is a plus defender already.You look at the roster, and it's almost hard to figure out how in the hell the Spurs are doing this -- again.Some of their greatness is hard to see.It exists in the absence of small mistakes other teams make a dozen times a night.The Spurs make a few, but the difference between a few and a dozen adds up to a handful of points -- the difference between a win and a loss.Watch Manu Ginobili and Danny Green negotiate this artful bit of switchery: That DeMar DeRozan drive is a common method of attack against a fronted post; ball handlers use the post-up almost as a two-man screen, knowing they'll have daylight behind it.Quashing that gambit requires pinpoint synchronization.It has to be perfect.It has to be instant.Any gap results in an open shot.Some teams blow that.Ginobili and Green, with so much shared knowledge between them, nail it.Look how nonchalantly Murray and Green defang this fake Kyle Lowry-DeRozan pick-and-roll -- Toronto's version of a two-man ruse you see across the league: The margin of error for the defense there is paper thin.One false step -- one confused pause, one slight lean the wrong way -- and Lowry is drilling an open triple, or watching DeRozan drop the hammer.The Spurs don't flinch.I remember debating the Pau Gasol signing with a Spurs official two summers ago.I was underwhelmed.He was astonished anyone could feel that way about even the creaky, aging version of Gasol."He knows how to play," the official said.He kept repeating that.He seemed confused that I didn't find "knowing how to play" a super-compelling reason to sign someone.But you get it when you see it in action -- five guys who know how to play, working from the same script.They don't foul.They leave the right shooters open, never the wrong ones.They move the ball to the right place, at the right time.Maybe the Spurs err a little too far toward "knowing how to play" at the expense of athleticism and other talents.Maybe that places a ceiling on them in playoffs.But it also wins a gargantuan number of games, every damned year.Meanwhile, Memphis is starting two fringe NBA players in Andrew Harrison and Jarell Martin.That is not an exaggeration; the Grizzlies reportedly told Martin they were going to cut him in camp!How many fans had heard of James Ennis III -- another starter!-- two years ago?And yet here they are, 4-1, with wins over Golden State and Houston.They find hard-playing, tough guys who make you earn it every night.They've got something in Dillon Brooks on a weirdo bench unit.Chandler Parsons is moving more like a human, and less like a mummy.Tyreke Evans is bombing 3s.(This won't last.)More than anything, they lean on the low-wattage, high-IQ brilliance of Mike Conley and Marc Gasol, entering decade No.2 of their dribble handoff tap-dance duet.They take care of the ball -- Memphis has sported one of the league's 10 lowest turnover rates for five seasons running -- and wring something from every possession.They are calm and precise amid the hothouse of crunch time.Gasol is defending and rebounding at a high level again.He looks like a cast member from "300."7.Atlanta, maybe overdoing it?The Hawks have dialed back the trapping frenzy those Al Horford-Millsap teams deployed to swarm ball handlers, snare turnovers, and (in theory) run open shooters off the 3-point arc.They should dial it back even more.Like, what is the point of trapping a Spencer Dinwiddie-Trevor Booker pick-and-roll 25 feet from the hoop?It's not Stephen Curry and Draymond Green!If Dinwiddie or Booker wants to launch, just let him!That's a way better outcome than harassing Dinwiddie, and unlocking an easy corner 3 for Joe Harris -- an actual good shooter -- two basic passes away.Opponents have jacked 35 triples per game against the Hawks, the second-highest mark in the league.The Hawks have yielded 10 corner 3s per game, second most overall.This is not a new problem.About 35 percent of enemy shots came from deep last season -- the fourth-highest such share.No team allowed more triples during that magical 60-win campaign in 2014-15.This style amounts to chasing defensive perfection.Softer schemes concede open midrange jumpers.This mania, if executed cleanly, can take away everything.That can (sometimes) work when you have the collective wingspan of Milwaukee's starting five.It can work with Horford and Millsap, two of the league's fastest and handsiest bigs -- and a smart cast of veterans flying around behind him.It will not work as well with Mike Muscala, Ersan Ilyasova, and untested kiddos.Perfect becomes the enemy of good.Atlanta has long understood the risks."We did not like giving up all those 3s," Mike Budenholzer, Atlanta's coach, told me two seasons ago."It's a constant battle: You can't put pressure on the ball like we do without exposing yourselves a bit."Yup.8.Golden State, revisiting something good Psst ... Golden State is back to opening most second and fourth quarters with a lineup of Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, Kevin Durant and David West.It is unfair to run that group out against opposing second units.It is huge and switchable on defense, with two legit offensive superstars and four guys who can post up mismatches.That lineup is plus-4 in 35 minutes so far.It blitzed opponents by more than 13 points per 100 possessions in 167 minutes last season before Steve Kerr went away from it in mid-January The Warriors are smart to give it another look.9.Domantas Sabonis, being mean Would you look at what happens when a large human with some skill does more than stand around the arc delivering dribble handoffs and trembling in fear of missing any shot off a pass from Russell Westbrook!Sabonis has rediscovered the paint, and he's cramming all over fools.He dunked 15 times all last season; he's up to four after just five games in Indy.Sabonis has effectively played center next to Thaddeus Young and T.J.Leaf while Myles Turner recovers, and those guys cede the lane to him.He's slinking into open space on the pick-and-roll, and making plays -- short jumpers, and mean-spirited drives to the rim.He's shooting 58 percent!The go-go Pacers zoom into side pick-and-rolls before the defense can gird itself to keep Darren Collison and Victor Oladipo from slicing into the middle, and bouncing easy pocket passes to Sabas: Hanging around the rim has reawakened Sabonis' offensive rebounding; at this rate, he'll grab more before Thanksgiving than he did all of last season.There are downsides, of course.Almost any lineup with Sabonis at center will struggle on defense; the Pacers rank 29th in points allowed per possession.He has played only five minutes alongside Turner -- all in the ludicrous speed opener against Brooklyn -- and it's unclear how those two fit.They each shoot well enough to make it work on offense, but juggling assignments on the other end might be tricky.Still: Indy has to be thrilled with the early-season play of the Paul George return.Oh, Matt Devlin, you clever, coiffed wordsmith.I am 100 percent in favor of this metric system nickname for Toronto's new bench gunner, flinging up 13.5 triples per 36 minutes -- an audacious, giddy number no rotation player has even approached over a full season.Kilometres doesn't even care if he's facing the basket when he catches the ball; he'll twirl around -- in mid-air, mind you -- and heave that sucker up.What in the hell has gotten into the staid Raptors?The Drakes are pulling 36 triples per game after averaging only 24 attempts from deep last season.The corresponding decrease has come almost entirely from the midrange area; the Raptors haven't (so far) sacrificed shots at the rim or free throws transforming themselves into the Rockets of Canada.This is part personnel, and part Dwane Casey coaching outside of his comfort zone to reinvent an offense that craps the bed every postseason.Kilometres is at the center of it, bombing away as part of a delightful five-man bench mob.
Kevin Pelton's weekly mailbag, including the volume vs. accuracy of 3-point shooting:::::This week's mailbag features your questions on the home teams in Southern California, length of games, and more.You can tweet your questions using the hashtag #peltonmailbag or email them to peltonmailbag@gmail.com."Are NBA players not getting better at 3-point shooting despite the emphasis on shooting 3s?"- Kevin Pelton Time for the occasional question that pops into my own head, in this case while I was reading Michael Grange's fascinating piece on the Noalytics software the Toronto Raptors are using to track -- and hopefully improve -- players' accuracy during shooting sessions at the team's practice facility.Grange wonders how much all the shooting players do without feedback is really helping, noting that the league's 3-point percentage hasn't gone up much since the league moved the line back to its current distance in 1997-98.(I've noted that other basketball leagues have also settled in at similar percentages from 3-point range.)I think the issue here is, as teams hunt for more 3s, that has inevitably meant attempting more difficult ones.For example, over the four full seasons for which we have tracking data, the percentage of 3s taken off the dribble (pull-ups, in the parlance of NBA.com/Stats) has increased from 23.5 percent of attempts to 25.0 percent.Since pull-up 3s are much lower percentage (32.3 percent last season) than catch-and-shoots (36.9 percent), that will serve to decrease accuracy relative to actual improvement.Consider also how many more players have the green light to shoot 3s now.In 1997-98, 109 NBA players attempted at least 100 3-pointers.Last season, that number was 232 -- nearly half the players who appeared in a game (486).If we somehow had the ability to give players from different eras the exact same quality of shots in terms of defensive coverage, catch-and-shoot vs. off-the-dribble and the ability of the shooter, I suspect we'd see a dramatically greater improvement in 3-point percentage that is apparent looking only at league average.Also, do they have a advantage or disadvantage for losing home games (or having extra aways)?#peltonmailbag Huge Nerd (@Atom_Jak) October 24, 2017 This is a really fascinating question because it gets at the thorny one of what creates home-court (or field, depending on the sport) advantage.Among the major American sports, the LA Clippers and Los Angeles Lakers are the lone two teams who both share a home field and play each other on a regular basis.(The NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets, like all teams in opposite conferences, play each other once every four years in the regular season.)Since the two teams moved into Staples Center in 1999, they've met 72 times.When the Lakers are the home team, they've gone 23-13 (.639) with a plus-2.6 point differential.When the Clippers are the home team, they've gone 19-17 (.528) with a plus-1.3 point differential.With travel, sightlines and other factors constant, that implies the home crowd (and I suppose the home jerseys and the actual court) are worth almost four points per game -- about two-thirds of the league-wide home-court advantage (6.3 points per game) over that span.While that could be attributed to the motivation provided by home fans, it's also consistent with what Tobias Moskowitz and Jon Wilner argued in their book "Scorecasting," that home advantage is mostly a product of how referees react to home crowds."The NBA made it very clear over the summer that they wanted to increase the flow of the game and make it go faster to get fans attention and tune into the games, rather than tune out.I've noticed a lot of games will end early, whether it's a blowout or close game Like if a game starts at 8 p.m. and it's a close one down the stretch, it ends right on time (10:30 p.m. or earlier).Can you compare time of game from past seasons compared to this season?Is there a major difference?"-- Deven Parikh The website Inpredictable.com tracks game time, and creator Michael Beuoy put together a chart showing the average length of games by year excluding overtime games and other outliers: Michael Beuoy/Inpredictable.com While shorter games weren't necessarily the NBA's intent (their explanation, as Deven notes, focused more on the flow of games than their overall length), I too have noticed watching games that they seem to be ending earlier.So I'm a little surprised the decline in game time from last season isn't steeper -- less than half a minute, on average, though the average time is way down from the mid-2000s.Beuoy further notes that second and fourth quarters have been faster -- which makes sense given the removal of a mandatory timeout in those periods -- but that the first and third quarters have been slower on average.It will be worth keeping an eye on the average length of games as the season goes on and the sample gets more robust.How has trade value of draft picks been altered due to lotto reform?Will any unprotected 1st rd picks be moved going fwd?#peltonmailbag G Close Encounters (@GlennQSpoonerSt) October 20, 2017 I suspect the most important impact would be what you mention: Teams won't want to trade unprotected first-round picks because of the increased possibility they could win the lottery without being one of the league's worst teams.No scenario comes back to haunt a front office more than giving up what turns out to be a top-three (top-four going forward) pick via trade.Of course, the example of the multiple lottery picks the Boston Celtics got from the Brooklyn Nets has already caused teams to move toward trading their own first-round picks, though with protection.As far as I can tell, there has been only one trade in all of 2017 in which a team gave up its own first-round pick completely unprotected (so not counting the Celtics trading the Nets' pick in the Kyrie Irving deal), and that was by the Houston Rockets, who already knew their 2017 first-round pick wouldn't end up in the lottery.So I'm not sure we'll see a dramatic difference in trade value because of lottery reform.would you like to have a relegation system as in European soccer (ignoring that the owners would never approve this)?#peltonmailbag anieb1 (@anieb1) October 20, 2017 No, even though relegation and promotion have been quite effective in European sports, I dislike the way the threat of relegation forces bad teams to adopt a short-term mindset that leads to frequent midseason coaching changes and younger players getting benched in favor of more reliable veterans.Moreover, hypothetically, moving toward promotion and relegation would force the NBA to completely rethink player development after making progress in turning the G League into a true minor league.So I think it would severely hamper the NBA's ability to develop young players, and I don't think the increased competitiveness of games late in the regular season is enough to offset that.
Week 8 NFL predictions: Scores for every game:::::NFL Nation reporters predict the outcomes and scores for Week 8 games on Sunday and Monday: PickCenter Theres no way the Vikings lose this game, right?Minnesota traveled to London riding a three-game winning streak after its defense held the Ravens to 208 yards on 64 plays, the fewest yards allowed in Mike Zimmers four-year tenure.While the injury report was pretty full for the Vikings, including a chest injury that limited quarterback Case Keenum in practice, the Browns are far worse in that department.Spencer Drango is starting at left tackle in place of injured veteran Joe Thomas.His first assignment is to block Everson Griffen, who is looking for his eighth consecutive game with a sack.Despite some hiccups, Minnesotas offense has played well enough to stay in games and is in far better shape with its uncertain quarterback situation than Cleveland, which is going back to DeShone Kizer after he already was benched this season.If you believe in trap games, thats fine, but this isnt one.Barring a monumental collapse, the Vikings will head into their bye at 6-2.Vikings 30, Browns 14 -- Courtney Cronin Myles Garrett is in concussion protocol, Joe Thomas is recovering from surgery and DeShone Kizer is the team's best option at quarterback despite a league-high 6.0 interception rate.The biggest loss: Thomas, whose absence will be easily noticed against a nasty Mike Zimmer defense.Vikings 19, Browns 6 -- Pat McManamon PickCenter That giant exhale you heard coming from Oakland last week was a sigh of relief from the Raiders' offense to the tune of 417 yards passing and three touchdowns from Derek Carr, plus 11 catches on 19 targets for 210 yards from Amari Cooper against the Chiefs.Sure, the sideshow that would be Marshawn Lynch returning to face the franchise that drafted him in 2007 will be missed as he serves his one-game suspension for making contact with an official.But the Raiders need to take advantage of a beat-up Bills secondary that has surrendered an NFL-high 350 yards passing per game since Week 5.And unless weather totally grounds Carr & Co., the good times should continue for the Raiders, who also enjoyed a lengthy mini-bye after having played on Thursday night.Or, as new middle linebacker NaVorro Bowman told Carr before beating Kansas City, You handle that O, and Im going to get this defense right.Raiders 27, Bills 23 -- Paul Gutierrez The Raiders' passing offense, which gained 417 yards last week against the Chiefs, might have awakened at the right time.Since Week 5, the Bills' defense ranks 30th in opposing Total QBR (73.5), 32nd in passing yards per game (350.5), 31st in net yards per pass attempt (8.76), 26th in third-down conversions (46.2 percent) and 21st in points allowed per game (23.5).With safety Jordan Poyer (knee) and cornerback E.J.Gaines (hamstring) uncertain to play Sunday, the Bills will have their work cut out for them against Derek Carr and his receivers.Raiders 28, Bills 21 -- Mike Rodak PickCenter The Colts are about to face a Cincinnati defense that's not as good as Jacksonville's, but they can expect the Bengals to put plenty of pressure on quarterback Jacoby Brissett after he was sacked 10 times against the Jaguars in Week 7.Cincinnati has the No.5-ranked defense in the NFL and the unit already has 18 sacks.Sunday will be a perfect opportunity for the Bengals to improve their 29th-ranked offense.That's because the Colts have gotten worse and worse each week on defense.They're 31st in the league in yards allowed, 31st against the pass and last in points allowed at 31.7 a game.The downward spiral to the season continues for the Colts.Bengals 38, Colts 14 -- Mike Wells ESPN's Football Power Index gives the Bengals an 85.4 percent chance to win, their highest percentage since the 2009 season.The Bengals are going to be able to get pressure defensively against a team that gave up 10 sacks last week, and their days of struggling to run the ball likely will end against the Colts 26th-ranked run defense.The Colts 31st-ranked pass defense probably won't do much better containing A.J.Green, either.Bengals 28, Colts 9 -- Katherine Terrell PickCenter The Chargers will be competitive in this one because of the defenses ability to create pressure up front.The Chargers will use a ball-control offense and try to play keepaway from Tom Brady.But the Patriots will exploit the Chargers weakness on defense -- stopping the run.The Chargers allow 141 rushing yards per game, second worst in the NFL.Patriots 27, Chargers 23 -- Eric Williams The Chargers' pass rush, led by Melvin Ingram (8.5 sacks) and Joey Bosa (7.5 sacks), is a concern, and Tom Brady has stressed the importance of getting the ball out quickly.Brady already has been sacked 18 times this season, and not all of those were solely the result of protection; there were times he could have got rid of the ball quicker.That's the storyline of the week, and why this game could be closer than some anticipate.Patriots 24, Chargers 20 -- Mike Reiss PickCenter The Bears magical two-game winning streak ends in the Superdome for one reason: They cant score points without defense and special teams.Chicago is ranked 26th in points per game with 17.4.The Saints boast the NFLs fourth-highest scoring average at 28.5.Chicagos defense has been great the past two weeks -- six takeaways and three defensive scores -- but that wont last forever.Saints 27, Bears 14 -- Jeff Dickerson Bears QB Mitchell Trubisky has thrown 48 passes in three career games, while Saints QB Drew Brees has thrown 48 passes in a single game 33 times in his career.The Bears defense has been playing great, but so has New Orleans defense.So if the Saints can avoid game-changing mistakes, they should be able to take advantage of the quarterback disparity at home.They also should be able to lean on their dynamic RB duo of Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara, who both went over 100 yards from scrimmage at Green Bay last week.Saints 27, Bears 19 -- Mike Triplett PickCenter The Falcons are in the midst of a three-game losing streak and have averaged just 13.6 points per game during the skid.One would expect better from a team that averaged 33.8 points per game last season, but the transition from Kyle Shanahan to new offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian hasn't been seamless.That being said, the Falcons seem intent on fixing their mistakes against a Jets team that allows 23 points per game."We just have to make sure everybody communicates,'' wide receiver Julio Jones said.If the Falcons stay committed to the running game (coach Dan Quinn wants high 20s in rushing attempts), fix their third-down woes, score touchdowns in the red zone and keep the Jets under 100 rushing yards, they should get back on a winning track.Falcons 23, Jets 17 - Vaughn McClure What happens when two teams that can't hold a lead face each other?It could get wild at MetLife Stadium.The Falcons are in a serious offensive funk, but they still have enough playmakers to win this game.The Jets struggle against elusive runners such as Devonta Freeman, and their corners will have trouble with Julio Jones.The Jets have allowed 583 passing yards and six touchdown in the past two games.They blew 14-point leads in each game (both losses), the ideal elixir for Matt Ryan & Co.Falcons 31, Jets 24 -- Rich Cimini PickCenter The Niners have lost 10 consecutive games in the Eastern time zone and are coming off a 30-point loss while Philadelphia is riding the wave of a five-game winning streak.Beyond that, the Eagles have a dominant defensive front (3.81 yards per carry allowed, 18 sacks) matching up with a banged-up Niners offensive line that's trying to protect a rookie quarterback in C.J.Beathard making his first road start in the NFL.Even history is against the Niners, who at 0-7 are trying to become just the second team in 16 tries to beat a team that's 6-1 or better in the Super Bowl era.Eagles 34, 49ers 13 -- Nick Wagoner The forecast in Philly calls for heavy rain Sunday, with 1 to 2 inches expected.Depending on the accuracy and timing of the predicted weather, it could make for a sloppy game.Perhaps that would benefit the 49ers, who enter as heavy underdogs and could use the help of outside elements to topple the 6-1 Eagles.Otherwise, it could be a long day at the office for a winless team that will be facing MVP candidate Carson Wentz and the third-ranked offense in football.Eagles 30, 49ers 16 -- Tim McManus PickCenter It's not that the Panthers have been stagnant offensively the past two weeks.They just keep having turnovers and negative yardage on key situations to stop long drives.The Bucs, meanwhile, aren't stopping anybody, allowing 408.5 yards a game and ranking last in the NFL with seven sacks.The lack of pressure on quarterback Cam Newton should allow him to get back on track.Panthers 23, Bucs 20 -- David Newton The Bucs are 6-1 at home since Week 10 of last season, tied with the Packers for the best home winning percentage during that span.But they're struggling big time on defense right now.They can't get off the field on third down, they can't pressure the quarterback and they surrendered 144 rushing yards to LeSean McCoy and Tyrod Taylor last week and 134 yards to Adrian Peterson the week before.That doesn't evoke much confidence with Cam Newton coming to town.Panthers 27, Bucs 24 -- Jenna Laine PickCenter With Deshaun Watson under center, the Texans feel they have a chance in any game, but the Seahawks defense could slow him down on Sunday.Watson has thrown for 12 touchdowns in three games but faces the No.1 defense in points allowed per game.It will be a close one -- and Watson will keep the Texans in the game -- but Houston will lose its fifth consecutive game to an NFC West opponent.Seahawks 20, Texans 14 -- Sarah Barshop Watson has looked like the real deal, but he faces a tough challenge on the road against a Seahawks defense playing as well as it has in recent memory.The Seahawks have allowed only 33 points during their three-game winning streak, elevating them back into their familiar place as the NFL's top scoring defense.And this game is at CenturyLink Field, where the Seahawks are 4-0 against rookie quarterbacks since 2011 while allowing only 179 passing yards per game, according to ESPN Stats & Information.Seahawks 27, Texans 21 -- Brady Henderson PickCenter Since losing the de facto NFC East championship game in Week 17 in 2012 at FedEx Field, the Cowboys have won four consecutive games at Washington.Three of the four games have been decided by eight total points.Over the past four seasons, the Cowboys are 19-8 away from home, including 2-1 this season.Why?Their offense has traveled well.In their eight road wins over the past two seasons, the Cowboys have scored touchdowns on 21 of 27 red zone possessions.This season, Washington has allowed touchdowns on 11 of 17 red zone possessions.Only three teams are worse.Cowboys 27, Redskins 23 -- Todd Archer The Redskins are banged up along the offensive line, with four of the five starters dealing with injuries -- and there's a chance at least two will sit out Sunday.That's problematic facing a team that records a sack on 9.5 percent of dropbacks, seventh best in the NFL.The Redskins will have to use a lot of bootlegs and rollouts to compensate, or stay in manageable third downs against a defense that ranks 26th in this area.Quarterback Dak Prescott can burn them with his poise and off-schedule plays.The Redskins have been hurt by mobile quarterbacks Alex Smith and Carson Wentz this season.In the second meeting vs. Washington last season, Prescott averaged 3.05 seconds before each throw (his third highest of the season).That resulted in key third-down conversions and big plays downfield.Indeed, in three combined games vs. Wentz and Smith, the Redskins allowed 22 of 38 third downs to be converted compared with 11 of 40 vs. other teams.It's not a coincidence.Third-down defense and injuries are too much this week.Cowboys 24, Redskins 21 -- John Keim PickCenter The Steelers' defense is hitting its stride, allowing 49.5 rushing yards per game over the past two weeks, while holding all receivers to 61 yards or less since Week 1.Pittsburgh has won each of its past six Sunday night games with a 20.3-point average margin of victory.Ben Roethlisberger loves playing in domes, completing 72.8 percent of his passes for 1,517 yards, seven touchdowns, two interceptions and four wins in his past five starts indoors.The Lions' receivers are beat up.The Steelers will enter the bye 6-2.Steelers 24, Lions 20 -- Jeremy Fowler Detroit may have used its bye to get healthier, but the Lions still are hurting at left tackle, where Brian Mihalik or Bryce Harris could get the start.If you're wondering who those players are, you're not alone.Considering Pittsburgh's pressure-packed pass rush that is sacking quarterbacks on 11.1 percent of pass attempts, that does not bode well for Matthew Stafford.If the offense is disrupted, that'll give more chances for the Steelers' balanced offense to wear down Detroit.The Lions stay in it, but Pittsburgh is the better team.Steelers 28, Lions 24 -- Mike Rothstein PickCenter The Broncos have had more than a few clunkers in their visits to Arrowhead Stadium, and last year's 33-10 blowout loss on Christmas night is certainly on the list.They've lost three of their past four games, have an offense that has put together just three touchdown drives in those four games and are coming off their first shutout loss in a quarter of a century.Quarterback Trevor Siemian and all involved in the team's offense have to be better, have to finish drives, and even when things aren't working, the group simply has to play mistake-free.Or this year's visit will look a lot like last year's disaster.Chiefs 24, Broncos 13 -- Jeff Legwold The Chiefs are the one team that seems to know how to score consistently against the Broncos.They have 29, 30 and 33 points in their past three games against the Broncos, and as a result their three-game winning streak in this series is their longest since 2000.Big plays often have decided recent games between the teams.The Chiefs have three offensive touchdowns of 70 yards or longer in the past three games against Denver and a fourth on a kickoff return.The Chiefs, who have six touchdowns this season of at least 60 yards, could easily add to that total.Chiefs 27, Broncos 23 --

Biggest Week 8 NFL questions, stats and predictions:::::Taking a spin around the NFL to get you ready for Week 8: The big questions Can Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz continue his MVP push without Jason Peters?Wentz was already having a terrific 2017 season, but those who slept through the first six weeks sat up and took notice last week when Wentz and the Eagles put on a show against the Redskins.In the process, he pushed the Eagles to the top of the list of Super Bowl contenders and put himself squarely in the MVP conversation.But if history is any indication, Wentz's job just got more difficult after losing left tackle Jason Peters to a season-ending knee injury.Through his first season and a half, Wentz has been far more effective with both Peters and right tackle Lane Johnson available.Eagles QB Carson Wentz could find himself on the run more after the loss of LT Jason Peters to injury.Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports On 404 dropbacks with his bookend tackles, Wentz has 21 touchdown passes and six interceptions for a total QBR of 67.5.On 525 dropbacks without at least one of Peters or Johnson, Wentz has 12 touchdowns and 12 interceptions for a total QBR of 52.4.One thing that could bode well for Wentz's continued success is his mobility.If he finds himself on the run more often without Peters, that's not necessarily a bad thing.Wentz has scrambled for 153 yards this season, second most among quarterbacks and 13 more yards than he had rushing all last season.Are we getting closer to some clarity on NFL parity?Last week in this space, we discussed the glut of NFL teams all bunched together in the land of mediocrity and wondered when we would get a better idea of which teams were for real.Week 7 mostly left that conversation as clear as mud.Heading into Sunday, there are 25 teams with three, four or five wins, which is the most through Week 7 in the Super Bowl era.The previous high was 24, which happened last season.From 2002 to 2016, there was an average of 19.3 teams per season with three to five wins through seven weeks.In 2015, there were only 14 such teams through the first seven weeks.All of that said, it does seem as if order is starting to be restored when it comes to the race for division crowns.While five of eight NFL divisions have only two games separating first place from last place, four of those leagues have a clear favorite, according to ESPN's Football Power Index.Kansas City (89 percent), New England (85 percent), Minnesota (73 percent) and New Orleans (64 percent) have all emerged as favorites despite holding narrow margins over the rest of the teams in their divisions.Those numbers don't guarantee anything, especially in a league in which crazy results have been a weekly occurrence, but if the division winners do turn out to be that predictable, expect the wild-card chase to be wilder than ever.Can Texans QB Deshaun Watson lower the boom on the Seahawks?Watson has been nothing short of electrifying in his first six games, throwing for 15 touchdowns, the same amount the Texans had all of last season.If Watson throws three more this week, he'll tie Kurt Warner for most touchdown passes in a player's first seven NFL games.That won't be easy considering Watson is set to face the toughest test of his young career.Watson and the Texans travel to Seattle to face the famed "Legion of Boom" on Sunday.Through the first six games, Watson faced four teams ranked 19th or lower in opponent QBR allowed.Matchups against Jacksonville (first) and Cincinnati (seventh) were better barometers and Watson struggled, throwing for a combined 227 yards with one touchdown and one interceptions in those contests.Deshaun Watson seeks to become the first rookie QB to win in Seattle since Andy Dalton in 2011.AP Photo/David J. Phillip Seattle sits fourth in opponent QBR but has made life particularly rough on rookie quarterbacks in recent years.The last rookie to win a start in Seattle was Andy Dalton in 2011.The four rookies to start there since are 0-4 with a completion percentage of 58, an average of 179 passing yards per game and a total QBR of 42.Watson already has proven he can alter games with his playmaking ability, but if he can do it against the Seahawks, it will send an even stronger message that he's going to be a force to be reckoned with for the foreseeable future.Numbers that matter 0: That's how many interceptions the Raiders' defense has through the first seven games, the first team in NFL history to hold that dubious distinction.1.2: Looking for a reason why the Saints are one of the league's hottest teams?Look no further than their oft-maligned defense.Since Week 3, New Orleans is giving up 1.2 points per drive.Only Jacksonville has been better in that span.3 for 30: Pittsburgh running back Le'Veon Bell is putting the Bell in bell cow with his workload in the early part of the season.Bell already has three games this season in which he has had 30-plus carries.Only one other player -- Chicago's Jordan Howard -- has reached the 30-carry mark, and he has done it just once.If Bell gets 25 carries against Detroit on Sunday, he will pass Earnest Byner's 141 rushes for the most all time by a player in a calendar month.5: Speaking of dramatic turnarounds, the Los Angeles Chargers are in the midst of an impressive resurrection after a miserable start.If the Bolts beat New England this week, they'll be the fifth team in the Super Bowl era to get back to .500 after losing their first four games.What's more, it would be the second time the Chargers' franchise has done it.They also did it in 1992 and went on to an 11-5 finish, the only team in that group to make the playoffs.6,000: Drew Brees needs 12 completions to become the third quarterback in NFL history to have 6,000 for his career.He would join Brett Favre and Peyton Manning if he gets there against Chicago on Sunday in his 240th career game, which would also make him the fastest to reach that mark.What we'll be talking about after Week 8 A Chargers' run or the Patriots' annual hot streak The Chargers have been one of the league's hottest teams, winning three in a row, their longest streak since early in 2014.Two of those wins have been on the road.A win here would match their total road victories of the past two seasons combined and serve notice that the Chargers' resurgence should be taken seriously.That's easier said than done, especially considering that New England looks to once again be poised to rip off plenty of wins over the season's final half.Since Tom Brady took over as the starter in Week 3 of 2001, the Patriots are 162-46 after the calendar turns to October.That's a .779 winning percentage that is almost 10 percentage points higher than the next-best team (Pittsburgh) in that time.Brady also boasts a 6-0 all-time record in games he starts against Philip Rivers and 7-2 in his career against the Chargers.Something has to give here, but the numbers favor the Patriots continuing to trend toward their expected run of success.Falcons grounded in the AFC East Atlanta started the season 3-0 and again looked set to make a deep postseason run.Then the AFC East happened.The Falcons have lost three straight, all to members of the AFC East.This week, they complete the tour of that division against the Jets.It's important for the Falcons to get back on track, but this game could also serve as a harbinger of what's to come for their playoff chances.If they lose, they'll finish their tour of the AFC East 0-4.Since the new division alignment began in 2002, 89 teams have gone 0-4 against a division other than their own.Only two have made the playoffs.There's no such thing as a must-win game in Week 8, but this one has plenty of meaning for the defending NFC champions.The 'battle' for the first pick of the 2018 NFL draft For the second consecutive year, the winless Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers have given their fans reason to begin looking toward the next NFL draft before Halloween.Another thing the teams have done recently is completely ruin the idea of Sunday Funday.According to Elias Sports Bureau research, the Browns and the Niners are riding the second- and third-longest Sunday losing streaks in NFL history.Cleveland has lost 24 straight and San Francisco has lost 19 straight in games played on Sunday.A loss against Minnesota this week would put the Browns in a tie with the 1976-77 Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the most ever.Stranger things have happened but with the Eagles entering Sunday's game against the 49ers as 91.3 percent FPI favorites and the Vikings as 83.7 percent FPI favorites, there's a strong chance for yet another Sunday Bloody Sunday for the Niners and Browns.
Cleveland Browns get unexpected wake-up call in England:::::LONDON -- The Cleveland Browns received a rude awakening on their first night in England when a fire alarm went off at 5:45 a.m. at the team resort.The team spent an hour in a temporary locker room -- essentially a heated tent -- waiting for the all clear.Officials at Pennyhill Park in Bagshot told the team the alarm was caused by a gas leak near the kitchen.It was a tough way to wake up during the first night after the team had flown through the evening to get to London for Sundays game against the Minnesota Vikings.Coach Hue Jackson moved the schedule back two hours so the team could catch up on sleep.What you need to know in the NFL Statistics Scoreboard 2017 schedule, results Standings The team also made Sundays game at Twickenham an entire team affair.Anyone from the organization who wanted to could travel to England on the companys shillings.Team owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam chartered and paid for a second wide-body plane for those who wanted to attend and enjoy a getaway while working for what is a Browns home game.Sponsors also joined the group and stayed in a London hotel, unlike the players and coaches who were outside the city.Mail room employees right up to the executive office staff were among those in attendance.
Anthony Joshua becomes the king of Cardiff as British heavyweight delivers under huge expectations:::::PRINCIPALITY STADIUM, Cardiff -- The first reaction was booing.Then came the cheers as Anthony Joshua came into focus on the big screen hanging above the ring, the hero of the hour having secured a 10th-round win over Carlos Takam.But it was not the knockout that the crowd and the majority of the watching public expected.The general feeling in the Principality Stadium was admiration for the spectacle they had witnessed and respect for Takam's ability to take an almighty amount of punishment while blood poured from his right eye, but equally an unsatisfied itch on what would have happened had the fight been allowed to conclude on its own terms.Few expected the fight to last longer than Joshua's ring walk, but under the closed roof of the Principality Stadium, 78,000 devotees eventually got what they wanted, a victory for the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world.But it was a night that seemed to carry such an air of inevitability that for it to go to the 10th and end in the way it did left a slightly bitter taste.Anthony Joshua retained his IBF, WBA and IBO heavyweight belts with a 10th-round stoppage of Carlos Takam in Cardiff.Stu Forster/Getty Images "It was a good fight until the ref stopped it," Joshua said."I have no interest in what's going on with the officials.That's not my job."I was watching him.I was trying to break him down round by round, but unfortunately the ref stopped it.I think people wanted to see Takam unconscious on the floor, I'm right?"Cue huge cheers from those who remained to hear Joshua's postfight thoughts."But I didn't have control over the ref's decision.I got the win and now we turn attention to 2018," he said.Joshua's ring walk was to the cheers of the crowd, music absent -- reportedly due to a power shortage -- but, of course, he could create an atmosphere.The smile, the fist-bumps, the confidence of Joshua does that.It is a rare adulation, reserved for the Usain Bolts of the sporting lexicon.And that adoration remains.He will still be the talk of the streets of Cardiff and the boxing world, but Takam won a huge amount of respect here in the Principality Stadium.Twelve days' notice, but wow, the man can take a punch.It was only the second time Joshua had been pushed beyond the seventh round.This was a box ticked, something else to add to Joshua's ever-growing reputation and status as one of Britain's favourite individuals.Respect for their champion brought applause, cheering as he weighed up how the fight went."While rugby is commonly played here under the closed roof, the claustrophobia is greater with boxing; the eyes are all trained on that small lit-up square."Stu Forster/Getty Images There had been some eye-catching performances on the undercard.Katie Taylor became the new WBA lightweight champion of the world in front of a large support.Arms aloft, she soaked it in -- a quiet star, but one who has an army of supporters proud of what she's doing for the sport.And for those with Welsh roots, Joe Cordina's fight against Lesther Cantillano caused folks to rise from their seats to offer support to the man born in this very city.Editor's Picks Joshua 'juggernaut' takes care of tenacious Takam Anthony Joshua was made to work for the 20th win of his pro career before recording a 10th round TKO victory over valiant challenger Carlos Takam in Cardiff.All the while, those sporadic glimpses of Joshua's preparations caused the stadium to erupt.Zlatan Ibrahimovic's cameo drew eager cheers, but all Joshua had to do was smile -- even though probably unaware he was suddenly broadcast to the 78,000-odd crowd waiting to see him dispatch Takam -- and a huge roar rumbled around the ever-filling stadium.A fight indoors is a strange experience.It is intoxicating.While rugby is commonly played here under the closed roof, the 30 players on the pitch mean your eyes are ever-moving, trying to follow the ball or seeing the movement of a player positioning himself to catch it.With boxing, the claustrophobia is greater; the eyes are all trained on that small lit-up square.The heads are dotted around ringside like the dots on a Roy Lichtenstein painting, while the eye can barely pick out those at the top of the upper tier of the stadium.They are shrouded in the shadows, only noticeable by the flash of mobile phones.You could hear the thud of glove on torso when the undercard started nearly six hours before Joshua took to the ring; the stadium was eerily quiet.When the first fight started at 5 p.m., the doors had only just opened, the place was lying in wait to be filled.But come Joshua, the main event, every seat was taken, the queues for beers suddenly dispersed and attention switched to the ring.As the crowd cheered and moved with Joshua's every punch, everyone stood transfixed.Those cheers continued afterward when promoter Eddie Hearn suggested Joshua's next fight would be in the UK, rather than abroad.Joshua stood prodding his broken nose, sustained in a clash of heads early in the fight, but that hero appeal, the natural charisma and stardom that grows fight on fight will only be enrichened by this Cardiff experience.A soldout stadium, 78,000 fans who got their money's worth will go away into the Cardiff night talking about the time they saw the new darling of British sport.He's a hero in this part of the world -- nothing will change that -- not even a slightly underwhelming finish to a fight that deserved a natural end.

When NFL players recover, some turn to 'floating' instead of sleeping:::::ESPN Bengals reporter Katherine Terrell catches up with linebacker Carl Lawson to learn about floatation therapy and why he finds floating helpful to his body.(1:22) WEST CHESTER, Ohio.-- It's around 9 p.m. on a Friday night and Cincinnati Bengals rookie Carl Lawson has just made the 30-minute drive to Tao Float Loft in West Chester, Ohio.With just a few days before the Bengals' game against the Steelers, Lawson has one more item left in his weekly routine.To prepare for the upcoming matchup, Lawson first must find a way to take his mind off the game itself.That's where floating comes in.Lawson stands in front of a giant tank that resembles something from a sci-fi movie.He puts in earplugs and gets inside the tank, which is filled with warm water and 1,200 pounds of Epsom salts.The salt content in the water is high enough that Lawson can simply float on top of the water without any effort.Soon he'll drift off to sleep in the soundproof room."I sleep in here a lot," Lawson said."It might be a little scary if you close [the lid] because you might hear someone snoring in here.""Floating," or the use of sensory deprivation tanks, has gained popularity in the past few years due to a number of high-profile athletes touting its benefits.2016 NBA MVP Steph Curry is among the fans.The tanks have been in use since the 1950s, and Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis used them often while training for the 1988 Summer Games.Lawson, who has 3.5 sacks this season, tries to make floating part of his weekly routine in addition to regular massages."It makes your body feel loose," Lawson said."You're sitting in meetings all day, you're going to practice.Just to be able to relax your body completely, relax every muscle in your body, the Epsom salts are supposed to be able to be good for you anyway."The float tank is designed for users to be able to enter a state of total relaxation.The theory is that a 45- to 60-minute session is equivalent to several hours of sleep and allows the body to feel more refreshed the next day."I feel like, along with massages, it gets all of the soreness and stress and built-up blood from little bruises throughout your body," Lawson said."Its also supposed to be equivalent to four hours of extra sleep.I really like what the float tank does, relaxing my body, making me feel flexible."But it's certainly not for everyone.The user has to be able to embrace the relaxation aspect to get the full effect.Bengals coach Marvin Lewis said several of his younger players, who are always on their phones, probably wouldn't like it."You have to be able to handle peace and quiet," Lewis said."And the guys who can't handle peace and quiet can't stay in there.... You have to be able to separate from your device."Lewis laughed when he said that the famously quiet Geno Atkins, the Bengals' star defensive tackle, was one of the players who has embraced floating the most."He loves it," Lewis said."And that's because it's so quiet."The Patriots and Lions have several players using the tanks, although Lions rookie tight end Michael Roberts said he remembers needing some time to warm up to it."It took a lot of mental toughness," Roberts said."You're just kind of floating there.It's dark.It's warm water.It's warm air.You might get claustrophobic if the water is over your chest.It might get hard to breathe.That's kind of how it was for me....The saltwater kind of got in my face, so my eyes were burning.I actually did get out, showered and got back in.I made myself get back in.It was like, I paid for it, I'm going to see what it's like."Many of the Bengals found out about floating from cornerback KeiVarae Russell, who is known in the locker room for trying every recovery technique -- from acupuncture to cryotherapy.Russell got Lawson and several others to give it a try and even promoted floating on his social media account.This looks like the most relaxing thing EVER.@Bengals CB @Keivarae1 is doing floatation therapy today.Wanna try?pic.twitter.com/17zRWF9XU4 FOX Sports: PROcast (@PROcast) August 18, 2017 "It's hard not to like.It's an intriguing thing, you just lay down and float," Russell said."For as much muscle as I've had, even in high school, I've never floated, I just sink once I get in the water.So that was the first time I've ever floated in the water.I liked it ... "If you're in tune with yourself and you believe in energy and all that, you'll be good....But if you're just waiting for something to change or something to happen, you'll be bored."
Gaffes, TV ratings concerns dominated as NFL, players forged anthem peace during league meetings:::::This story appears in ESPN The Magazine's Nov. 13 issue.Subscribe today!NOBODY KNEW WHERE to sit.Side by side or across from one another?It was the final question raised by a group of 11 NFL team owners as they mingled inside the sixth-floor conference room at the league's Park Avenue headquarters in New York City, minutes before they were to meet with a group of 12 players, one former player and three union leaders on the morning of Tuesday, Oct. 17.The day already had been stressful, and the meeting hadn't even started.League executives had spent that morning as they had the previous four weeks: grappling with a series of events the league and owners could not control, unleashed by President Donald Trump's harsh criticism of the decision by a handful of players to kneel during the national anthem.Morale was bad inside the league office, and the pressure was not letting up.There was the looming notion that sponsors would leave the NFL -- not just because of the protests but because of an array of challenges confronting the league, including the continuing decline in TV ratings.Nearly all of the league's longtime sponsors, from Papa John's to USAA, were rattled, and fissures within the league offices and teams, to say nothing of the players, were starting to expand.Among many league and team executives, the games had become, improbably, an afterthought.These two days of New York meetings held the potential to provide a measure of hope -- a way for owners to formulate a plan with players that would satisfy disenchanted fans and advertisers.It was no secret that commissioner Roger Goodell and the owners wanted the players to stop kneeling during the anthem immediately.A week earlier, Goodell said that he hoped owners and players could "move past" the anthem issue at the meetings.If and how that could be accomplished was unclear.After Goodell's statement, Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys' owner, threatened to bench any player who knelt, the only owner to issue such an ultimatum, one that won praise in Texas and across much of America's heartland.Spurred on by Jones' stance, some hard-line owners looked at the meetings as the opportunity to vote on a mandate that would force all players to stand for the anthem.For weeks, Goodell had tried to get in front of the issue.One owner had complained that NBA commissioner Adam Silver got away with ordering players to stand because, unlike Goodell, he has a good relationship with the union.Another owner had remarked to a colleague that Trump would like nothing more than for players to strike over the protests, maybe forcing a suspension of the season.As owners filed into the large conference room featuring a massive, football-shaped table, everyone feared the discussion could get ugly.NFL executive Troy Vincent, who cared deeply about the players' concerns but had little patience for the protests, called San Francisco 49ers GM John Lynch the Saturday before the meeting.He told him that if safety Eric Reid, one of the most ardent protesters, knelt the next day, he shouldn't "bother to show up" at the players-owners meeting because nobody would take him seriously, according to people briefed on the call.Reid knelt anyway.And he intended to show up.Just before Reid and the other players and union leadership arrived, talk among the owners turned to a final issue, small but symbolic: the seating arrangement.In collective bargaining negotiations, the owners sat opposite players and union representatives.But Goodell told the owners their job that morning was to listen; the session was not a negotiation or anything that could be resolved by a quid pro quo.The owners decided the meeting would have to start with the tiniest of gestures: We'll sit side by side with the players.Polls show that the national anthem protest issue has resonated with millions of fans who insist all players should stand when it is played.AP Photo/Charlie Riedel THE NIGHT BEFORE that meeting, Jerry Jones stood in a suite at Yankee Stadium, watching the Yankees play the Houston Astros in the ALCS but also, perhaps, catching a terrifying glimpse into his future.The Cowboys are what the Yankees once were: America's most iconic team in America's most iconic -- and patriotic -- sport.Jones was a man at the pinnacle of his profession that chilly night, the Hall of Fame owner whose power among his peers is drawn from a relentless skill at growing the NFL's total revenues and the guile to outmuscle everyone.But those who have spoken with him sense a dull panic, as if so much of what the NFL has built -- what he has built since buying the Cowboys in 1989 -- is eroding.Jones and his fellow owners had arrived in New York that day like heads of state, setting up shop at the Four Seasons and in their own apartments with a clear agenda: Stop Trump from attacking our business.Find a way to persuade players to stop kneeling.Get the focus back to football.But the owners had far different ideas about how to accomplish such difficult goals, according to nearly two dozen interviews Outside the Lines conducted with owners, league and team executives, players and lawyers briefed on the two days of closed-door meetings.For one thing, this was not the usual scandal or crisis the league could fight in the court system or the court of public opinion and then march away from.The game itself had come under a monthlong attack by the president of the United States, with no letting up.It was also a prickly regional problem.The players' protests and the president's criticism played far differently in New England and California than they did in Texas, where Jones and Houston Texans owner Bob McNair were fielding an avalanche of complaints from outraged fans.This time, Goodell didn't have to simply manage owners' bruised egos and simmering feuds; this was a national political crisis threatening the league's business and its brand, seen through a different lens by each owner depending on his or her own political leanings and each team's fan base.It would require leadership, diplomacy and, most likely, a little luck.Yet in many ways, the meetings would be a referendum on the same argument owners have been holding in private meetings for years: What is the NFL's identity?Is it a strict entertainment company that Jones and others envision, controlling the behavior of its players in service of its financial bottom line?Or should it attempt to transform itself into a more socially conscious league that would strive, through the forging of a rare and fragile owners-players partnership in this moment, to use its mammoth platform to try to change society for the good, even if the cost of that process, slow and complicated, would likely be measured in short-term declining popularity and lower revenues?Some owners left the Yankees game early, seeking a good night's sleep before the meeting with the players the next morning.Jones could afford to stay out late.Goodell had personally decided which owners would attend, and he had not invited Jones.The commissioner, sources say, wanted to prevent the players-owners meeting from devolving into an argument about whether a player should be benched if he kneels -- an argument that was more likely to break out if Jones attended.For his part, Jones, who declined comment for this story, didn't seem bothered.He beamed in the Yankee Stadium suite alongside his oldest son, Stephen, masking worries over what was now at stake for the NFL in 2017.Polls show that the protest issue has resonated with millions of fans who insist all players should stand for the national anthem; some are calling for an NFL boycott and vowing to never watch another NFL game.Owners are alarmed at how rapidly fans' outrage is eroding many of the league's key business metrics, and executives at some broadcast partners have complained to owners about how the NFL lurches from crisis to crisis.A recent Morning Consult poll revealed that the NFL's net favorability has dropped to 11 percent from a high of 56 percent in May.Jones was furious that local TV ratings in Dallas were down, especially a 19 percent drop for this year's game against Green Bay, compared with last year's."There is no question the league is suffering negative effects from these protests," he would tell reporters after the Cowboys routed the 49ers."All times, I want to do the right thing by [NFL sponsors] and their customers.I have a great responsibility to the people who support us.... We all get great benefits from having a lot of us watching our games.All of us do."Jones arrived in New York to have a good time -- and to deliver a reckoning.The only question was whether his billionaire partners and Goodell would heed that reckoning.Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and Redskins owner Daniel Snyder were angry with 49ers owner Jed York -- they felt that if he had forced quarterback Colin Kaepernick to stand a year ago, the national anthem crisis could have been averted.AP Photo/Michael Conroy AS THE HISTORIC players-owners meeting began, the players, led by retired wide receiver Anquan Boldin and Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins, entered the conference room and shook the owners' hands, an uncommon occurrence at prior tension-filled joint meetings.The players took seats side by side with the owners.Goodell wanted to put the players at ease by allowing every one of their voices to be heard.The players said that they felt the owners -- as a collective more than the small group in the room -- were being duplicitous; they were empathetic to their concerns behind closed doors but not publicly.Fans needed to hear from owners that players who knelt or raised fists were good men who loved their country, they argued.Messages of support couldn't be delivered only inside the locker rooms.Finally, New York Jets linebacker Demario Davis stood up in the center of the room and told owners: "I'm going to break it down for you guys.You guys aren't supporting us, and until you do, there's going to be an issue."Davis' message, and passion, seemed to relieve the tension.Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank later told Davis that he'd "missed his calling" as a great public speaker.A few owners tried to separate their deep dislike of unemployed quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who started the protests a little more than a year ago, from the players' broader message: This wasn't an "anthem protest" but rather an "inequality in America" protest.Knowing that their motives and message had largely been lost in the political chaos, the players told stories of their personal connections to the military and showed a good grasp of the business problems suddenly confronting the league.Left unsaid was the warning issued on Oct. 11 by Buccaneers defensive tackle Gerald McCoy about forcing players to stand: "I think it's gonna be an uproar if that is to happen, because you're basically taking away a constitutional right to freedom of speech."League executives tried to show they understood the players' concerns.Several league staff members presented a three-pronged action plan: expand the My Cause, My Cleats initiative; help convene more meetings with lawmakers to ramp up lobbying for players' causes on Capitol Hill and, through the clubs, in statehouses across the country; and use the NFL's platform to promote it all.The league had scrapped a staff idea to extend an olive branch to Kaepernick -- who in October filed a collusion claim against the owners -- by inviting him to visit the league headquarters.The action plan had met harsh criticism when it was first introduced inside the league office the Thursday before the owners' meetings.Anna Isaacson, the NFL's vice president of social responsibility, chief marketing officer Dawn Hudson and others had presented the plan to Goodell and top executives, including public relations chief Joe Lockhart, chief operating officer Tod Leiweke, chief media and business officer Brian Rolapp and general counsel Jeff Pash.Isaacson characterized the plan as a chance to seize the social moment and make an impact beyond football.There was also a request for a huge marketing budget.The league's business executives ripped it, accusing Isaacson -- who had joined the NFL after working in merchandising and community relations for baseball's Brooklyn Cyclones -- and Hudson of losing sight of the goal, which was to persuade all the players to stand for the anthem.The plan was "too political," they said, and would likely invite further attacks by Trump."How could you possibly present this to owners?"one executive asked.As the proposal was discussed, Goodell remained mostly quiet but seethed because he felt the plan was uninspired.Neither Goodell nor the business executives liked the action plan at that moment, but what worried the business executives was that Goodell was not focused on what they deemed the priority: the very real financial problems facing the NFL.Fact was, they were right.Goodell believed that all players should stand, but he and Vincent had been working with them for more than a year on their concerns, calling them individually and holding meetings, and the commissioner deeply cared about their cause.Now, in the meeting with players, Goodell, despite his initial reservations about Isaacson's plan, supported it "full bore," an owner says.Not only that, the commissioner moved around the room to guide the conversation about its pluses.Many times he told the owners they weren't hearing the players' core arguments."We're all in this together," Goodell told them.The players and the union executives, who have been at odds with Goodell for years, were impressed."It was the proudest I've ever been in the NFL," one owner said later.This was Goodell leading in a manner they'd rarely seen: He was not playing a zero-sum game, he was not risk-averse and his compassion clearly lay with the players in the face of severe pressure from hard-line owners and business executives."He did a great job because he didn't say much," Blank says."I don't mean that in a negative way."The players had arrived at NFL headquarters wanting to be their own voice rather than have the union speak for them.DeMaurice Smith, the players' association chief, was uncharacteristically quiet during the session, having found a way to move forward on this issue with Goodell after a private meeting at Dulles International Airport on Oct. 3.In a similar sort of way, the players concluded that Goodell seemed to be speaking for himself more than for many owners and even the league -- something that stunned them because, after all, some players privately view the commissioner as the puppet of ruthless billionaire owners."There was sincerity on both sides," 49ers CEO Jed York says.The meeting was going so well that even the unintentionally awkward moments were forgiven.At one point, Buffalo Bills co-owner Terry Pegula, moved by Anquan Boldin's story about his cousin being shot and killed by a police officer, complimented him on how impressive he was but kept calling him "Antwan."Then Pegula suggested that Boldin would be the perfect NFL spokesman on social issues not only because he had walked away from the game to pursue causes but because, the owner said, it couldn't be a "white owner but needs to be someone who's black."Some people quickly glanced at one another; others looked down, cringing.But the discussion resumed, and soon the session was running so long -- by 90 minutes -- that nobody knew how to end it.At one point, Robert Kraft mumbled to the two Jets players seated on either side of him, "Can we just shut the f--- up and end this?"Everyone on that side of the table laughed, and the optics of the Patriots owner laughing with two players from his team's rival seemed to have accomplished the mission.But it was hard to tell if it was just optics.Shortly after 1 p.m., Goodell and Smith stepped out of the session to tell Lockhart and union spokesman George Atallah to craft a joint NFL-NFLPA statement, a symbol of rare cooperation.Players were still skeptical that the owners and league executives beyond Goodell were motivated to act -- a week later, Chargers tackle Russell Okung would label the league's lack of urgency "disappointing" and said the players-owners meeting appeared "unproductive at best and disingenuous at worst."Before everyone left the room that afternoon, Davis made one last point: how important it had been that acting Jets owner Chris Johnson, the brother of Woody Johnson, now Trump's ambassador to the United Kingdom, had visited with every player in the locker room to hear their concerns."Guys will stand up if you hear them," Davis told the owners.TWO HOURS LATER, those 11 owners joined their counterparts and league executives in a third-floor conference room at the Conrad Hotel in lower Manhattan.It was uncertain and tense.Most pro-stand owners, like Dan Snyder of the Washington Redskins, had been purposefully excluded from the players' meeting.Inside the conference room, Goodell kicked off the session by asking each of the 11 owners to give his account of the players' meeting.Nearly all offered slight variations on the same theme: It was a very good session; the players were passionate and very impressive; we've got a lot of work to do to address their concerns and to use the NFL platform to address these difficult social, racial and justice issues.The mandate to stand wasn't mentioned.Goodell didn't interrupt anyone, and he summed it up by saying that the two sides were "on a good path to a partnership."Goodell then opened the floor to discussion, and something surprising happened: Nobody debated.Jones asked a pair of benign questions about the process for Isaacson's proposal, a far different occurrence than in the committee meetings three weeks earlier when, according to an owner, he had "hijacked" the protest discussion.Owners were stunned."OK," Goodell said, "let's move on and we'll come back to this."The meeting broke around 5 p.m., and many of the owners left for the night believing that the ones who hated the protests most had relented.But Goodell had purposefully tabled the discussion out of deference to Jones, giving him the evening to speak to owners and gauge the support for a league-wide mandate to stand.NFL commissioner Roger Goodell led in a manner owners had rarely seen: He was not playing a zero-sum game, he was not risk-averse and his compassion clearly lay with the players in the face of severe pressure from hard-line owners and business executives.AP Photo/Julie Jacobson AT THE CONRAD on Wednesday, Day 2 of the meetings began with most owners and team executives back inside the third-floor conference room.While league staffers reviewed mundane legal matters and pored over a PowerPoint presentation showcasing this season's declining TV ratings, a strange suspense lingered over the session, given that the anthem issue remained unresolved: What would Jerry Jones say?By late morning, Goodell finally moved the discussion to the protests.It was a "special privileged session," with only owners plus one adviser allowed.Snyder spoke first.He said that there were real business issues at stake, and he mentioned that in his market, the defense industry and other sponsors were angry about the protests.He didn't put any dollars on it.To many in the room, Snyder's speech felt like an opening act for the headlining band.After Snyder sat down, Jones stood and left no question that it was his floor."I'm the ranking owner here," he said.At first, some in the room admired Jones' pure bravado, the mix of folksy politician and visionary salesman he has perfected.But he was angry.He said the owners had to take the business impact seriously, as the league was threatened by a polarizing issue it couldn't contain or control.To some in the room, it was clear Jones was trying to build momentum for an anthem mandate resolution, and in the words of one owner, "he brought up a lot of fair points."Jones believed he was one of the few showing any urgency on the matter and seemed to be more frustrated that not everybody was listening than he was passionate about the mandate.As Jones spoke, Snyder mumbled out loud, "See, Jones gets it -- 96 percent of Americans are for guys standing," a claim some dismissed as a grand overstatement.McNair, a multimillion-dollar Trump campaign contributor, spoke next, echoing many of the same business concerns."We can't have the inmates running the prison," McNair said.That statement stunned some in the room.Then Kraft, who is close friends with Trump, politely rebuked the hardliners, saying that he supported the league's marketing proposal and predicted the issue would work itself out over time.This argument seemed to find a receptive audience in the room.An unofficial count had only nine owners in favor of a mandate, though the reasons for the opposition varied: Some owners had tired of Jones always commandeering such meetings; some were jealous of his power and eager to see him go down; some saw the players-must-stand mandate as bad policy to invoke in the middle of the season; some owners were angry with Jones' hard-line public stance on kneeling, feeling that it had backed them all into a corner."The majority of owners understand this is important to the players and want to be supportive, even if they don't exactly know how to be supportive," one owner says.Editor's Picks Six days in September: NFL players seized control as league scrambled How the NFL and its team owners, famous for ironclad control, grappled with losing it after an attack by President Trump and a rise of player protests during the national anthem.Now, suddenly, Jones found himself in an unfamiliar position: He wasn't getting his way.He knew it, and everyone knew it.Like the numerous reasons behind the protests, the business concerns were nuanced -- one major sponsor had threatened to pull out if the NFL were to issue a mandate to stand.York spoke next.Though Jones and Snyder were angry with him -- they felt that if he had forced Kaepernick to stand a year ago, this crisis could have been averted -- York and Jeffrey Lurie of the Eagles had emerged as thoughtful leaders.Knowing that many of the players who were still kneeling were on his 49ers, York emphasized that he understood the business concerns and that each market was different, and that he had been talking to his players for a long time and would continue to do so.Lurie had spoken up during the meeting, supporting the players' right to kneel.After the owners finished, Troy Vincent stood up.He was offended by McNair's characterization of the players as "inmates."Vincent said that in all his years of playing in the NFL -- during which, he said, he had been called every name in the book, including the N-word -- he never felt like an "inmate."It was starting to get nasty.Vincent and Jones had a sharp but quick back-and-forth, with Jones finally reminding the room that rather than league office vice presidents, it was he and fellow owners who had helped build the NFL's $15 billion-a-year business, and they would ultimately decide what to do.McNair later pulled Vincent aside and apologized, saying that he felt horrible and that his words weren't meant to be taken literally, which Vincent appreciated.The meetings were already running long and were ending on a raw note -- and there were more agenda items to hit.For the second time in a month, a few frustrated owners grumbled about Lockhart, angry that the league was, as usual, appearing to be reactive in a public relations sense in the face of a crippling crisis.League executives worried that during upcoming events -- Veterans Day and the NFL's Salute to Service -- pro-military groups might stage protests.Goodell left the meeting room to be ushered to a news conference.The final topic of a long morning was the most salient one: the commissioner's next contract.Jones is not technically on the six-person committee that determines Goodell's compensation, but he has willed himself onto it.And so, before everyone could leave, he spoke for 20 minutes, delving into all of the league's problems that everyone knew by heart.He wanted Goodell's contract to be more incentive-based than it is."This is the most one-sided contract ever," he said.This speech, like the one earlier in the day by him, was not vintage Jones: His usual annoying but endearing Jerryisms were replaced by a palpable urgency; it seemed to a few owners as if only Jones could see that an opportunity to regain control of the league was slipping away.As Jones spoke, a few owners wondered what exactly had been accomplished during the week in New York.Had Goodell won?Had the players won?Had Jones lost?For most, it was enough that the owners and players had come together and that perhaps the promise of their newly formed partnership would bury the desire of some players to take a knee or raise their fists again.As a top league executive remarked when it was over, it took a president's attacks to get everyone to come together -- or at least agree to keep talking, as they intend to do at the next owners-players summit, scheduled for Oct. 31, a meeting that the players have invited Kaepernick to attend.Just after 2 p.m., the New York meetings adjourned, two hours late.Owners filed out to meet in the lobby with reporters, explaining the league's baby steps toward turning "protest into progress."All of the reporters waited for Jones.A day earlier, he had tried to duck underneath a staircase at the hotel to avoid them, but about two-dozen reporters swarmed, ready to assume their common position of being his rapt audience.But Jones didn't stop walking.He searched for a way out of the hotel and hit a dead end before turning back and going down an escalator.Jones likes to talk the most when he's selling.For now, at least, he had nothing to sell.But there was a very real sense that he wasn't done fighting, not on the anthem, not on Goodell's contract and not on his worries about the NFL's future.As he left the meeting room, Jerry Jones was silent.And then he was gone, slipping out a hotel side door and out of New York, where so much had been discussed and so little had been decided.
Fantasy Fallout: Can these running backs get you through the byes?:::::As if it wasnt already hard enough to find two running backs you can trust on a weekly basis in fantasy, now we have to deal with 12 teams on byes over the next two weeks.Two of the top five scoring backs in ESPN leagues (Todd Gurley and Leonard Fournette) are off in Week 8, not to mention Aaron Jones, Adrian Peterson and the duo of DeMarco Murray and Derrick Henry.Plus Marshawn Lynch went and got himself suspended for a week for making contact with an official.If your bench is thin, heres the skinny on some options still available in more than 40 percent of ESPN leagues: DeAndre Washington (33.8 percent owned) and Jalen Richard (25.3 percent): Washington was the most added position player in ESPN leagues this week in the wake of Lynchs suspension.But the problem is that Washington and Richard split touches pretty evenly after Lynch was ejected last Thursday, and probably will do the same Sunday at Buffalo.Im not sure I would trust either as a starter for fantasy reasons because it seems like theyll share the load, rather than one being the bell cow, ESPN Oakland Raiders reporter Paul Gutierrez said.Plus, fullback Jamize Olawale should be involved, and the Raiders did promote seventh-round draft pick Elijah Hood from the practice squad on Wednesday.So it should be more of a committee situation.Either guy could be a decent option if youre desperate.Washington had nine carries for 33 yards and a touchdown last week, plus three catches for 7 yards.Richard had nine carries for 31 yards and four catches for 45 yards.And Raiders coach Jack Del Rio praised the two 5-foot-8 backs for being able to bring a little more quickness and pass-catching ability to the offense than the power-running Lynch."If you're playing a little more wide-open, in some respects they give you a little more juice, Del Rio said.Marshawn gives you the power back when you want to finish people in tough situations.But those guys give you more than a change of pace."Its also possible that a big game from one or both of them could shift Oaklands backfield dynamic a bit.Gutierrez said the goal is always to have Lynch be the No.1.But the Raiders running game hasnt had much juice so far this season.With his 2015 ACL injury seemingly behind him, Dion Lewis looks to have gained the trust of the Patriots' coaching staff.Brad Penner/USA TODAY Sports Dion Lewis (46.6 percent): ESPN New England Patriots reporter Mike Reiss gave an even stronger endorsement to Lewis.Yes, the Patriots backfield is even more crowded than Oaklands.But Lewis role has grown steadily this season as he finally seems to have fully recovered from his 2015 ACL tear.You absolutely should trust him, Reiss said.His snaps are up [29 vs.Jets and 26 vs.Falcons], which either tied or led all Patriots running backs.Thats a good sign of how hes viewed by the coaching staff right now.Its safe to say Lewis is now back to his preinjury form.Reiss one warning: The one thing you have to hope for is that Lewis doesnt fumble, since Mike Gillislee was sidelined for 34 consecutive plays after he coughed one up two weeks ago.Wendell Smallwood (51.1 percent): This is another time-share situation with both LeGarrette Blount and Corey Clement in the Philadelphia Eagles' backfield.But Smallwood does have at least 10 touches in the past three games he was healthy.I do think Smallwood will have at least one explosive game this season, and perhaps it comes Sunday in potentially heavy rain against the winless 49ers, ESPN Eagles reporter Tim McManus said.The loss of left tackle Jason Peters is going to affect the Eagles' ground game, and Smallwood has not proved a reliable fantasy option to this point in his career.But if you're in need of a bye-week back, Smallwood is a gamble with some upside.Matt Forte (55.8 percent): Bilal Powell still is probably the best back to start in the New York Jets' time-share.(ESPN Jets reporter Rich Cimini said coaches seem to be emphasizing Atlantas team speed on defense this week, which leads him to believe Powell might be featured more.)But it was pretty close to a 50-50 split between the backs when Powell returned from a calf injury in Week 8.One disclaimer: Forte has yet to score a TD this season.Aaron Jones (74.8 percent): The Green Bay Packers rookie doesnt fit the criteria of this list because hes 75 percent owned, and because the Packers are on a bye.But I had to mention him because Im stunned that he still is available in 25 percent of all ESPN leagues.Are these leagues that dont allow in-season pickups?Jones clearly earned Green Bays leading-man role with 17 carries for 131 yards and a touchdown in Week 8 against the Saints.Jamaal Charles (25.0 percent): It would be awfully hard to trust Charles in your fantasy lineup after he hasnt topped five carries in any of his past three games.But if pickings are slim, this could be the week for an inspired effort against his former team in Kansas City.Replacement receivers With the Pittsburgh Steelers' Martavis Bryant and the Washington Redskins' Terrelle Pryor both being demoted for different reasons, their replacements could have some value in deeper leagues.ESPN Redskins reporter John Keim consistently has suggested that Washington has high hopes that second-year pro Josh Doctson can deliver on his potential.Meanwhile, ESPN Steelers reporter Jeremy Fowler wrote that rookie JuJu Smith-Schuster gives Pittsburgh enough flexibility to bench Bryant for Sundays game against Detroit without punishing the team.Fowler said he likes Smith-Schuster as a possible fantasy pickup because he should get the most targets after Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell, and hes shown a knack for the end zone.But the problem is that even as a No.2 receiver, hes not guaranteed many targets.The New Orleans Saints' offense, meanwhile, is loaded with options for deeper leagues.Ted Ginn Jr.'s production has expanded each week, and he is now on pace for career highs in catches and yards.No.3 receiver Brandon Coleman has only 12 catches, but three of them are touchdowns as he is also on pace for career highs in every receiving category.And Willie Snead is fully healed from his hamstring injury, though he appears to be fourth in the pecking order for now.And in the super-deep department, how about two guys who just showed up in the past week and could instantly become their teams top receiving options: Dontrelle Inman with the Bears and Deonte Thompson with the Bills.More to come from rookie RBs?What you need to know in the NFL Statistics Scoreboard 2017 schedule, results Standings Cincinnati Bengals coach Marvin Lewis said rookie RB Joe Mixon should show maturity after Mixon complained about his lack of touches in the Week 8 loss to Pittsburgh.But ESPN Bengals reporter Katherine Terrell still thinks this will be a good week to start Mixon against a struggling Indianapolis Colts defense that ranks 26th in rushing yards allowed.Meanwhile, ESPN Carolina Panthers reporter David Newton wrote that nobody with the Panthers seems concerned about Christian McCaffrey's lack of big plays so far, including McCaffrey himself, who believes the big plays will come."Worth a click
Hate: Fantasy football picks, sleepers, busts for Week 8:::::In Week 4 of this season, I wrote a "Love/Hate" column with this premise: I sent a text to a bunch of my friends and colleagues here at ESPN and here's what the text said: Editor's Picks Week 8 fantasy football rankings Fantasy football rankings from Matthew Berry, Field Yates, Mike Clay, Eric Karabell and Tristan Cockcroft for Week 8 of the NFL season.Best, worst matchups at all fantasy positions Matchups are a driving force behind weekly lineup decisions in fantasy football.Here are the most and least favorable matchups at QB, RB, WR and TE for Week 8 in the NFL.Last-minute pickups for fantasy football Week 8 Which widely available players should you pick up and start for Week 8?Our experts compile the best options at every position.2 Related Doing a goofy thing for my column tomorrow where I am asking various colleagues to ask me one question -- a self-made interview, if you will -- and I will answer them in my column with attribution.So, if you have a moment, can you ask me one question?Ask anything you want ... about me, about fantasy, about you, about literally anything you might be slightly curious about me or anything else.I'll print under your name and answer.That cool?I got so many amazing questions that, well, we had to cut some of them for length back in Week 4.But the column was well received and I wanted to do something light this week after the past few weeks.(Thank you again for all the messages that keep coming in.I will get to all of them eventually, I swear.It means so very much to me.)Anyway, here are some more of the unedited questions I got back and my responses.Eric Karabell (ESPN Senior Writer, Fantasy Hall of Famer): If your child said he or she wanted to follow your footsteps into the fantasy life as writer and personality, what would you say?TMR: Great question.The boys all play fantasy, though none seem obsessed with it the way I was when I was 14 (and playing in my first game).Obviously, I would support them as much as possible and tell them I would help however I could.But you want your kids to be happy and I have to believe entering this field, where people have such a strong opinion of me (both positive and negative), would be tough on anyone with my last name.So I'd warn them about that, I'd tell them they need to be great, because there is certainly a lot more competition, and analysis has gotten far more advanced than when I was starting out (and while my name might get them in the door, if they aren't any good they won't last long).And finally, I would tell them to read this column I wrote a few years ago about how to break into the industry.Trey Wingo (NFL Live host, upcoming Golic & Wingo radio show, voice of a robot on an ESPN2 show I like a lot): What was your favorite line that you ever wrote for any of the shows that you worked on?TMR: Another tough one.I spent 15 years in Hollywood and wrote on more than 100 episodes of sitcoms, plus a lot of movies that never got made (and, ahem, one that did).A lot of it runs together.The two things I co-wrote overall that I loved the most was a pilot for a reboot of "The Muppet Show" -- I am a Muppet freak.Maybe you've seen a show recently that seems to be inspired by it.I wrote about that here -- and a screenplay called "Undercover Elvis," which was an action comedy with the following premise: "What if all the crazy insane stuff you know about Elvis actually makes sense once you realize he's actually the world's greatest secret agent?"We wrote it more than 15 years ago, before similar ideas came about and we got universal praise for the script at the time.But my favorite line that I can remember is a dumb one.We were in the writer's room for "Married ... With Children" and we were doing a scene between Al and Griff (who worked at the show store with him).It was an insult-off, each of them going back and forth with each other, each insult more outrageous than the last.And we couldn't get out of it, because the lines were so good it led to this point where you couldn't go past and we couldn't just end it.We were so stumped, especially since there are only so many insults you can use.We must have been on that joke for an hour, the whole room pitching different insults to end this scene.Eventually, I pitched, after Griff and Al deliver a string of amazing insults back and forth, this happens: Griff (stumped): Oh yeah?Well ... your mama.Al: My wife!So, so dumb and yet, cracks me up to this day.Brought the house down on show night, too.Watch The Fantasy Show every weekday The Fantasy Show with Matthew Berry airs at 5 p.m.ET on ESPN2 every weekday.We will, however, be on ESPN on Mondays during the season.There are also late night re-airs (check your listings and set those DVRs) and replays are always available on WatchESPN by clicking on the NFL tab.Tedy Bruschi (ESPN NFL Analyst, legend): In all the fantasy leagues you've been a part of, what victory gave you the best feeling?TMR: There were some "expert" leagues while I was trying to establish myself and there have been some nice big-money wins before I got to ESPN (I don't really play for money these days), including one that helped me buy my first wife an engagement ring, but probably the best feeling was winning the "ESPN War Room" league that we play here internally.Many of the faces you watch every day (Trey, Adam Schefter, Chris Mortensen, Field Yates, Stephania Bell and so on), along with NFL producers and former NFL players.It's a 16-team league and almost everyone in the league talks to players and coaches every day as part of their job.So it's super competitive, it's 16 teams and I'm just the guy with some nerdy stats.Because I'm the fantasy guy, I'm always the big target in every league I play in, so to win that league, against super-smart people who are great, plugged-in players that I have so much respect for?That was awesome.Wendi Nix (NFL Live host): What would do for a living if you weren't a fantasy analyst?TMR: Well, I was a screenwriter in a previous life and I enjoyed aspects of that, but if it all went away today I would probably be an entrepreneur.I love the challenge of building something.I had a blast building my old Talented Mr. Roto site and I do it a bit on the side now with the Fantasy Life website and app.I really enjoy the challenges of that, so I'd probably do that.Also, weird, but I have this idea of one day writing a Broadway musical.Just a weird thing I'm sort of fascinated by, despite the fact I don't write music.It would be a twist on the musical, of course, because my mind is wired weird, but yeah, that would be fun to try one day.Basically, I enjoy being creative and solving problems.Kevin Neghandhi (SportsCenter anchor): What was your most satisfying sleeper pick of all time?(The one that you took a big gamble on and it turned out to be right.)TMR: Tough one.Lots come to mind, including two recent ones that I'm particularly fond of.I was all-in on Kareem Hunt this year, even before Spencer Ware's injury, and last year I was hyping Terrelle Pryor in Cleveland (a QB-turned-WR?For the Browns?)and people thought I was nuts, but he wound up as a top-20 WR.But I've made a zillion calls, good and bad.So if I have to pick one, probably my favorite would be Week 5 of 2009.It is Sunday morning, we are on Fantasy Football Now and we get word that Cowboys WR Roy Williams was a surprise inactive.And I said people needed to pick up and start a young wideout they'd never heard of named Miles Austin.Talented kid, all he needed was a chance and today, against Kansas City, was his chance.All morning long, I'm out on a limb for him and this is fairly early in my ESPN career, so I am still trying to establish credibility.That day, Austin goes for 10 receptions, 250 yards and two touchdowns.Giddy up.Dianna Russini (NFL reporter): Have you ever had an NFL athlete give you a hard time about your "predictions"?TMR: Not that much, actually.Maybe it's because I'm not around that many players or maybe they just don't care (or understand) fantasy in a way to get upset.I've actually gotten more thanks from players who weren't well known on the national stage and I would mention them or give them some pub.I can tell you that at different ESPN parties, both Steven Jackson (when he was with the Rams) and Matthew Stafford (early in his career) both have given me good-natured crap multiple times over the years about comments I made about them early in their careers.Both are great guys to meet in person.Matthew Berry's Fantasy Life By fantasy players, for fantasy players.As a gift or just for yourself, gear up and show your pride about the game we all love.-- TMR Michael Smith (The Six): What's your favorite thing to do with your kids?TMR: Great question.I love doing anything with them ... and it's tough, because I have five.The 19-year-old is in college now, and now that's he's an adult, my wife and I actually love going to dinner with him and his longtime girlfriend.It's nice to have more of a normal conversation rather than parent-to-kid type talk.The 17-year-old likes a lot of the same shows my wife and I do, so we often watch "Big Brother" (during the summer -- Paul got jobbed!)together.The three of us now have another drama show we watch and love together, though I am not going to say which one, because we are two episodes behind and I don't want you guys spoiling anything.Any time I can take the 13-year-old fishing or to a game is great.He's an avid fisherman and sports freak, so whether it's picking out a fishing rod or bait (I know nothing, he teaches me) or just seeing a game, that's always fun.And with my twin daughters, who just turned 6, well, anything.They are still excited when I come home, you know?Happy to have me push them on a swing.Anything.Seeing the world through their eyes is always magical.Michele Steele (ESPN reporter): I got my 23andMe results back recently.Do I have the musculature of an elite power athlete yes or no?TMR: Obviously.Michele: I have a genetic muscle composition common in ELITE POWER ATHLETES.I just want everyone to know.TMR: This made me laugh.I love Michele Steele.I love all my friends, actually.Thank you to all who participated!And I still had some left over, so who knows ... there may be a Part III at some point!Let's get to it.As always, thank you to Jacob Nitzberg of ESPN Stats & Information, and "Thirsty" Kyle Soppe of ESPN Fantasy for their help.My weekly reminder that this column is written in the middle of the week, often before all the injury news and other mitigating factors are in, so please, always check my rankings on Sunday morning, as those are my definitive answers about who I would start over whom.This column is geared toward PPR leagues (ESPN's default format) and is about players I believe will exceed or fall short of weekly expectations, whatever those may be.Here we go: Quarterbacks I love in Week 8 Cam Newton averaged 26.6 fantasy points per game in Weeks 4-6, but just 10.2 per game in his other four games.Which Cam will we get on Sunday?Daniel Bartel/Icon Sportswire Cam Newton, Panthers: In the very small sample size of Cam Newton after a 2017 news conference issue, he's elite that weekend.Maybe he's extra motivated, maybe he's just a really good quarterback or maybe, just maybe, it's one game we are cherry-picking.Real talk, however, is I like Cam this week against a Bucs squad that allows 20 points per game to opposing QBs.They've allowed top-four fantasy QB finishes to Eli Manning, Case Keenum and Carson Palmer this season, and part of their issue is getting to the QB.The Bucs are dead last in the NFL in pressure percentage, a number that is unlikely to get better after facing the mobile Newton.Not for nothing, but Cam is completing 66.5 percent of his passes this season when not under pressure.He's coming off back-to-back games with 50-plus rushing yards, which makes him an easy top-six play for me this week.Others receiving votes: You already were starting Carson Wentz in season-long leagues, but against a 49ers team that has given up the second-most yards per attempt the past five weeks, he's worth paying for in DFS, too.... Jameis Winston is averaging more than 344 passing yards per game over his past four full games, and he should have another nice game against a Panthers squad that is blitzing at the second-highest rate in the league.Since the start of last season, Winston leads the NFL in touchdown passes against the blitz.... Tyrod Taylor certainly does not have the most talented receiving corps around, but that should be OK against a Raiders squad that is the only team in the NFL without an interception on defense, that has allowed 10 passing TDs and a 68.9 percent completion rate, fourth highest in the league.... Those going streaming this week should consider Andy Dalton, who has multiple touchdown passes in three of four games under Bill Lazor and gets a struggling Indy team that is allowing the second-most passing yards a game and sixth-most points to opposing quarterbacks during the same time frame (since Week 3)....If you're still searching after Dalton, Case Keenum gets Cleveland, potentially Stefon Diggs back and the chance to impress London.You could do worse and probably have.Quarterbacks I hate in Week 8 It's hard to hate anyone this week with so many guys banged up and six teams on a bye, but I will say, I am less enthused about ... Matt Ryan, Falcons: Disappointing is probably the kindest thing I could say about Ryan's fantasy season so far, especially since he was drafted fourth among quarterbacks.Unfortunately, I don't love his chances at a big game on Sunday.The game is on the road, where Ryan has traditionally played worse and while Josh McCown has been surprising everyone, you'll never guess who else is not nearly as terrible as you think.Did you guess the Jets' defense?You looked ahead, didn't you?It's the Jets' defense that has the third-most interceptions this season and is allowing opponents to complete passes at the ninth-lowest rate in the NFL.Ryan has five (of six) games this season without multiple touchdown passes, so it's hard to generate much excitement for him here.He's merely a midtier QB2, even in a tough bye week.Others receiving votes: Ben Roethlisberger certainly looked better last week than he has, but he's not out of the woods yet.The Steelers hit the road to face the Lions (#RoadBen alert!), a team that has played pretty well at home this year (other than getting lit up by Cam Newton).The Lions are in the top 10 in terms of fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks and they've had two weeks to prepare for this game.Big Ben is merely a QB2 until we see it with more consistency....Even in a desperate week, I feel you'll have better streaming options than Jacoby Brissett, who goes on the road to face a Bengals squad that is getting pressure on opposing QBs at the second-highest rate.Behind a shaky offensive line, that's, what's the phrase ... not ideal.Running backs I love in Week 8 Jay Ajayi, Dolphins: The always dangerous Thursday night guy, but I am putting him here because I am the only one of our rankers with Ajayi in the top five this week.So, by Friday morning I have a chance to be more wrong than others.During the past three weeks, Ajayi is tied with Melvin Gordon for the second-most touches in the league (behind Le'Veon Bell) and that volume should continue against a Ravens defense that has allowed a RB to reach double-digit fantasy points in each of the past six games, and has allowed a 100-yard rusher in three of the past four games.Joe Mixon has scored double-digit PPR fantasy points just twice this season, but the matchup doesn't get much better than Sunday versus Indianapolis.Joe Sargent/Getty Images Others receiving votes: You had me at San Francisco.I expect the Eagles to be up big in this game and running in the second half against a Niners squad that has allowed a running back to reach double-digit fantasy points in all seven games this season.In fact, the 10 total RBs to score double-digit fantasy points vs. San Francisco is the most in the league this season.So I expect both Wendell Smallwood -- the 49ers have given up the most receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns to opposing running backs this year, too -- and LeGarrette Blount (I think he scores) to be top-20 plays this week....Speaking of bad defenses, the Colts have given up the most rushing touchdowns in the league this season, so, you know, Joe Mixon, if ever there were a week ... Game flow should work in Mixon's favor here as well.... With the passing game for Baltimore close to nonexistent and the Dolphins' line playing well and getting pressure, expect even more quick dump-offs for Javorius Allen, who now has 31 catches in the past six weeks.The only running backs with more during that stretch: Christian McCaffrey and James White....It's always a little dangerous to trust a Patriots running back, but with 25 touches during the past two weeks, I'll roll the dice with Dion Lewis as a flex play against a Chargers team allowing 4.9 yards per carry this season, second most in the NFL.Running backs I hate in Week 8 Doug Martin, Buccaneers: Just like quarterbacks (or any position for that matter), it's hard to really "hate" any running back matchup this week.It's very ugly out there, so this week especially, anyone with a pulse, you know?But I have Martin just outside of my top 20 for the same reason I like Jameis Winston this week.I believe Tampa throws here, not runs, as the most rushing yards by a player vs. Carolina this season is 67 (LeGarrette Blount in Week 6).The Panthers have allowed the 10th-fewest yards per rush to opposing RBs this season (3.6) and the second-fewest yards before contact per carry to opposing RBs (1.32).Obviously there's always a chance he scores, but Martin is merely a flex for me this week.Others receiving votes: The most rushing yards by any player in a game against Cleveland this season is 66 (Javorius Allen in Week 2) and the Browns have allowed only two rushing touchdowns to running backs this season and none since Week 3, so I'm not sold on Latavius Murray's chances at a repeat performance this Sunday.Remember, Murray was averaging just 2.37 yards per carry prior to last week....Even in a bye-week situation, I can't see using any Seattle running back until we get some sign of success, so I'm trying to look elsewhere if I have Eddie Lacy or Thomas Rawls.... After being out-snapped last week by Marlon Mack, Frank Gore has expected game flow and a tough matchup with Cincy's eighth-ranked run defense the past four weeks to contend with.... Man, it is brutal out there.Sorry I don't have more names for you, but honestly ... anyone with a pulse this week.Pass-catchers I love in Week 8 Demaryius Thomas is still looking for his first touchdown of the season.This could be the week, as he hopes to bounce back from a disappointing Week 7.Timothy T. Ludwig-USA TODAY Sports Demaryius Thomas, Broncos: I know it's been an up-and-down season for Thomas, but I like him quite a bit on Monday night.The Chiefs defense has allowed a league-high 13 wide receiver touchdowns this season, including 11 in just the past four weeks.With Emmanuel Sanders not playing or limited with injury, I expect an even heavier target share for Thomas, and, as Mike Clay points out in his excellent WR/CB matchup column, Thomas should run about half his routes against Terrance Mitchell, at least based on Thomas' 2017 usage.Well, as Mike points out, players who have lined up against Mitchell have been targeted 69 times (second most), racked up 613 receiving yards (most), scored five touchdowns (second most) and have 127 fantasy points (most).Others receiving votes: It's been an inconsistent year for Alshon Jeffery as well, especially considering how well Wentz and the Eagles' offense is playing.But Jeffery is worth the price in daily, as well against a Niners squad that has given up a receiving score to a wide receiver in six of seven games this season and has allowed four receivers to reach 100 yards.I'd say on Sunday, Jeffery has a good shot at making it five....Speaking of good matchups, the Patriots have allowed a touchdown to an opposing tight end in five of seven games this season.With his snaps continuing to increase, I like the Chargers' Hunter Henry this week as a top-10 play.... Minnesota's Kyle Rudolph is the latest winner of "who gets to play tight end against the Browns."...Carolina's Devin Funchess has cooled off a bit, but with at least eight targets in five straight games in a matchup you know I like Cam Newton in, I'm back on Funchess....So far, Bears QB Mitchell Trubisky hasn't thrown that much, but against the Saints he's probably gonna have to.Enter TE Zach Miller, who has received 12 of 42 targeted passes from Trubisky (28.6 percent), and when lining up in the slot this season, Miller has received 22 out of 54 targets.Small sample size and all, but that's still a 40.7 percent target share against a Saints team that allows the third-most yards and touchdowns to the slot this season.Miller is firmly on the TE2 radar this week....Assuming he plays, JuJu Smith-Schuster will see an increased target and snap share with Martavis Bryant not expected to play for Pittsburgh, and with CB Darius Slay having his hands full with Antonio Brown, JuJu should see some favorable coverage.Pass-catchers I hate in Week 8 For the last time, also slim pickings here with six teams off this week and, of the teams that are playing, many have bad quarterbacks, but: Will Fuller V, Texans: Fuller has been red-hot since making his return to the field, but the scoring rate is unsustainable, considering the lack of targets he gets.Because he's expected to play a lot of his snaps against Richard Sherman on Sunday, it doesn't appear likely Fuller gets into the end zone against a Seahawks team that has allowed just four wide receiver scores in its past nine games, dating back to last year (ding!).In the past four weeks, Seattle is the No.1 scoring defense in the NFL, making Fuller merely a WR4 for me this week.Others receiving votes: As you can tell, I'm down on the Colts this week, meaning it should be another long Sunday for T.Y.Hilton and Donte Moncrief, as the Bengals, among many other impressive stats, allow the lowest overall completion percentage to wide receivers this season....The Bucs allow the seventh-fewest receptions per game to opposing tight ends this season.In fact, only two tight ends have more than two receptions in a game against them this season.The matchup, along with his recent quiet production, makes Ed Dickson a tough play as anything other than a touchdown-dependent TE2.... One of the Redskins' pass-catchers will have a good game.I just don't know who it will be, as Kirk Cousins spreads the ball around.So other than Jordan Reed, it's hard to trust Terrelle Pryor Sr. or Jamison Crowder.I do like Josh Doctson, but until we see it, he's hard to trust blindly.... What can I say?Very bleak week.Defenses to consider streaming in Week 8 Cincinnati Bengals (vs. IND, 43 percent available); Atlanta Falcons (at NYJ, 75 percent available); New Orleans Saints (vs. CHI, 52 percent available).Matthew Berry, The Talented Mr. Roto, is all Q&A'd out.He is the creator of RotoPass.com, the founder of the Fantasy Life app and a paid spokesperson for DRAFT.
Ric Flair discusses health scare:::::Former pro wrestler Ric Flair is eager for fans to get a glimpse of his professional and personal life in the ESPN 30 for 30 film, "Nature Boy".(1:26) ATLANTA -- Pro wrestling icon Ric Flair feels fortunate to be alive after learning from doctors in August that he had a 20 percent chance to live.The 68-year-old Flair, appearing at Thursday's preview of ESPN's 30 for 30 film "Nature Boy,'' talked about how his fiance, Wendy Barlow, helped him survive after he spent 10 days in a coma from various health complications.Those issues, Flair admitted, related to alcoholism and the wild lifestyle he lived as an entertainer.Editor's Picks Charlotte Flair opens up about her past After five years of projecting strength on WWE TV as Charlotte Flair, Ashley Fliehr is finally opening up about her past and what she's had to overcome in hopes of being able to help inspire others who find themselves in difficult situations.30 for 30: Nature Boy Excerpt - Woo Monday Night Raw Recap: SmackDown Live roster joins together to attack Raw superstars The roster of SmackDown Live arrived at Raw and attacked the superstars of the red brand, creating a memorable moment that started the build to Survivor Series.2 Related "My health is much better than it was,'' Flair told ESPN before the preview of the film that puts his life story on display."When I got out of the hospital, I was 206 pounds.I'm back to 220.I'm allowed to drive a car, even though Wendy won't ride with me.So, I'm making a lot of strides, considering I couldn't walk when I got out of the hospital.''Flair entered the hospital on Aug. 11 after complaining of a stomachache.He initially thought it was food poisoning.Then his body immediately started to shut down, sending him to the intensive care unit.Flair didn't recall anything after as he fell into the coma.Barlow, who slept in the ICU every night until Flair was released, shared the details of how Flair's heart started to fail and his kidneys shut down.He was given a pacemaker and put on dialysis.Flair also has an ileostomy bag attached to an opening in his belly.The Undertaker and Ric Flair spend a moment together at the screening of "Nature Boy," the 30 for 30 film that highlights Flair's life.Vaughn McClure/ESPN "If he would have slept through the night with the stomachache and how bad it was, he would have died that night,'' Barlow said."They said he had a 20 percent chance to live when I took him in there.''Flair credited Dr. James Elsey and the team of doctors at Gwinnett Medical Center for saving his life."A 20 percent chance to make it?Yeah, God did me a huge favor,'' Flair said."I'm so self-conscious that every day, I look up and say, 'God, I'm lucky to be here.'And I wanted to make it to tonight's [preview] so bad.And I did.Each day is a gift for me.''After leaving the hospital Sept. 1, Flair spent 20 days at a rehab center."I could stand on my legs but I couldn't walk,'' Flair said."I couldn't even turn the top off a bottle of Gatorade the first two weeks.I was that weak.But now, I feel like I'm doing really well.''The experience has brought Flair closer to his entire his family, particularly his children.He couldn't say enough about the support he has received from Barlow through the whole ordeal."She slept there for 10 straight days and never left my side,'' Flair said."And she takes care of me now like I'm a king of some kind.I don't think anybody will ever get the care I got from her.If anybody gets sick and they have a Wendy, their life is in a good place.''Flair, now content to sit at home and watch "Arrow'' on Netflix, hopes others will learn from his story, particularly as it related to alcoholism.He also has stated that he is no longer drinking."I dealt with it, but I didn't know it,'' Flair said."I'm the kind of guy that I never drank at home by myself.I never did that in my whole life.I've got to be with people.I don't have a flask that I carry around.But I can make friends with a bartender in two seconds, and I Iike to socialize."My word to be is if you have a problem, monitor your health closely and try to alleviate the problem.''Flair had to go through detox while in the hospital."They had me strapped down, big time,'' Flair said."I told this kid, 'Hey, I'll give you $500 if you take these straps off me.'Then he said, 'You don't have your wallet on you.'I went all the way up to $1,000 and I said, 'You know who I am?'And he said, 'You're Mr. Ric Flair, but I'm not going to lose my job.'''Flair received support from celebrities and athletes from across America, including a few text messages from good friend Julio Jones of the Atlanta Falcons.Fellow pro wrestler Hulk Hogan flew a private jet to Atlanta to visit Flair while he was in a coma.Hogan left a Bible and prayed over Flair before leaving."I never knew he was there,'' Flair said."I don't remember Michael Hayes or anybody coming.Afterward, of course I talked to them.''Flair, out in public Thursday for just the second time since his near-death experience, got to share stories with some of his old wrestling buddies, including The Undertaker, prior to the 30 for 30 preview."My best memory is being in the ring at WrestleMania with him in Toronto,'' The Undertaker said."In that setting, in that stadium, looking across the ring at the greatest of all time, it was a pretty cool and surreal moment."With his [health scare], we were worried about him.Only Ric pulls out of something like that.His first words probably were, 'Wooooo.'''
Shanghai roars, then crumbles against the SKT dynasty:::::SHANGHAI -- The League of Legends World Championship semifinal between defending back-to-back champion SK Telecom T1 and home crowd favorite Royal Never Give Up was the loudest, and, simultaneously, the quietest esports event I've ever attended.Editor's Picks SKT, down 2-1, rallies to beat RNG in semis SK Telecom T1 was pushed to the brink by Royal Never Give Up and star AD carry Jian "Uzi" Zi-Hao, but the reigning world champions made yet another comeback to take a 3-2 League of Legends World Championship semifinal victory Saturday in Shanghai.Tipping the scales -- Samsung Galaxy vs Team WE Both teams enjoy drafting late game scaling comps, so which squad has an edge?Will we see long, drawn out battles in the League of Legends World Championship semifinals?Samsung Galaxy's Crown: 'I want revenge' The blue-collar workman in Samsung Galaxy's mid lane, Lee "Crown" Min-ho, hasn't forgotten his League of Legends World Championship finals loss last year and wants another shot at SK Telecom T1.2 Related The excitement was palpable from the Chinese fans on Saturday as I walked into the venue.Although a strong contingent of SKT fans were peppered throughout the stands, the overwhelming majority of the people walking through the doors had "RNG" temporary tattoos on their faces, ready to hopefully see the South Korean dynasty known as SKT come crashing down to the ground in Shanghai.The first game could have not gone better for the home faithful.The ground felt like it was about to part from the cheers erupting around me from all sides.SKT was vulnerable, and the fans, seeing the light at the end of a long tunnel of Worlds futility for Chinese clubs the past few years, jumped at the signs of weakness.For that one game, SKT was not a team made up of superhumans or some unbeatable, unexplained force.Instead, SKT was a team exposed with the same follies other professional teams display on a regular basis.Even from the media room, the echoes of belief could be heard from the Shanghai crowd.Each stumble by SKT was met with a cheer, and by the time RNG went up 2-1 in series and put itself on match point, the crowd didn't need to hope anymore -- the fans knew SKT was wounded, and their team, RNG, a roster of Chinese nationals, could be the one to end the era of one of the most dominant runs in all of esports history.For the third time in four Worlds appearances, SKT fell behind 1-2 in the semifinals.And just as it had twice before, it fell to a knee but never got knocked out, holding off match point in the fourth set before reasserting itself in the climactic game to take the series.What once was a carnival atmosphere had turned into a somber affair.RNG wasn't out of the final set until unforced errors ended things, but the crowd never could settle itself after not closing things in the fourth set.The blood in the water had dissipated, and SKT's win to force a do-or-die game with everything on the line sent a wave of deja vu over the crowd.The vulnerable SKT was gone.The lackluster early-games and close call against Misfits in Guangzhou were no longer relevant.Down to its last out, SKT had the mid laner in the red jacket, Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok, and on this night, like every night he's ever participated in at Worlds, he would not be denied.Later that night at dinner following SKT's victory, a group of SKT supporters sat down next to me to talk about the match.They smiled over pictures they'd take inside the arena.Outnumbered, they were the only ones making noise at the end of the match.Thousands in the arena and millions at home in China were rooting against Faker and SKT to make a fourth trip to the World finals.But if Team WE loses to Samsung Galaxy on Sunday and fails to make it to the final at the Bird's Nest, a lot of those same fans rooting against SKT will be on its side.Why?Because greatness, like Faker at Worlds, just can't be denied.
Vasilii suspended following 'reports of a domestic violence incident':::::Professional League of Legends player Li "Vasilii" Wei-Jun has been suspended indefinitely from competitive play following confirmation that he is under investigation for "recent reports of a domestic violence incident," game developer Riot Games announced Friday.Chinese esports organization Newbee also terminated Vasilii's contract with the team due to "unprofessional and immature behavior."Streaming platform ZhanqiTV also discontinued its deal with Vasilii on Friday.On Thursday, Vasilii was at his home in China, playing League of Legends on a livestream when he allegedly confronted his girlfriend.In the video, Vasilii flips his table, knocking over the camera.Off-camera, lengthy shouting and crying could be heard.Vasilii later reappeared on camera and said he had to leave the game because police arrived at his home.Riot said the "full extent" of Vasilii's suspension will be announced once an investigation has been completed."There is no place for physical violence in the League of Legends community," Riot wrote in its news release, regarding the suspension."We will not hesitate to exclude from our game and from our sport those who use violence or physical intimidation against others."Vasilii has competed with Newbee since May and has played for other notable Chinese teams such as Vici Gaming and IN Gaming over the past two years.He also played for LMQ, a team of Chinese nationals that relocated to North America in 2014 and was the first team of its kind to qualify for the North American League of Legends Championship Series.
Through wins, losses, cheers and tears, Astros give hope to Houston:::::HOUSTON -- While Hurricane Harvey was inflicting catastrophic damage on Houston and surrounding areas in late August, the city's baseball team was busy empathizing from afar.Major League Baseball moved a scheduled series between the Astros and Texas Rangers from Minute Maid Park to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, and Houston lost two of three games before crowds averaging 4,331 people in a climate-controlled bubble.When the flood waters finally began to recede and the Astros returned to a ravaged city, they got a slight reprieve.A day off was built into the schedule Friday, Sept. 1, to help the area begin to get up and running again, and the Houston players took advantage of the window to interact with the community before a doubleheader against the New York Mets on Saturday.Editor's Picks Astros return to Houston with hope baseball can help heal their ailing city America's favorite pastime was Houston's last concern when Hurricane Harvey devastated the city last week.But on Saturday, the Astros brought the game -- and perhaps some hope -- back to their community.The Astros are bringing hope -- and maybe a World Series title -- to post-Harvey Houston The behind-the-scenes story of the Astros' fight to bring hope -- and a first World Series title -- to Houston in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.1 Related Joe Musgrove and Chris Devenski, two Astros relievers, hit the ground running.At 6 a.m., they drove to BBVA Compass Stadium, home of the Houston Dynamo MLS team, and helped load pallets of supplies designated for local communities in need.After taking a break for lunch, they joined 14 other teammates at the George R. Brown Convention Center, where they met with families who had been displaced by the flood waters.Some of those families had been rescued from rooftops by helicopter or boat during the storm siege and ferried to sanctuary.The initial rush of 10,000 evacuees had subsided to about 2,000, but the 16 Astros got a clear picture of what Houston had endured -- and how determined Houston was to recover from nature's best punch."It was like its own little world,'' Musgrove said."They had barbers in there.They had food.They had clothes.They had little stations where you could go play with the dogs.They had games.They had everything.It seemed like the kids had no idea what was really going on, which was pretty cool to see.They were all so happy and excited and having fun going through such a tough time.''Orbit, the Astros' furry green mascot, entertained the children while fan favorite Jose Altuve danced with a volunteer and others posed for photographs.Musgrove, 24, instinctively gravitated to the kids' area.When Musgrove was a teenager in California, his father, Mark, a San Diego policeman, was stricken with an autoimmune deficiency that left him paralyzed from the neck down for two years.Mark subsequently recovered, but the experience left Joe ultrasensitive to the emotional scars that children can incur during times of trauma.So he came up with an idea that might resonate beyond a single meet-and-greet.Musgrove brought a pair of white spikes to the shelter and asked the kids to decorate them with signatures and other designs.He wore the cleats during the weekend series against the Mets and told the kids to watch on TV to potentially see their handiwork.The shoes were authenticated and later auctioned off for $1,400, with the proceeds going toward hurricane relief.Other players did their part in a variety of ways.Pitcher Lance McCullers, who has a soft spot for dogs, visited an animal shelter and worked with local charities to help rescue and treat pets in the aftermath of the flooding.Dallas Keuchel met with local police, and Carlos Correa distributed mattresses to children.Justin Verlander donated $100,000 -- a gift that was matched by the team -- to military veterans displaced by the hurricane, and Altuve contributed $30,000 and thousands more in shoes and athletic gear through his promotional agreement with New Balance."When you see how the city supported us nonstop throughout the whole season, it's the least you can do,'' Musgrove said."We're not from Houston.But we play for the city, and you start to fall in love with the fans.We're giving them something to be proud of, and you can see how we've been a centerpiece for the city to rally around.The special year we're having will be that much more special if we can bring back a championship.''Once the games resumed, manager A.J.Hinch gave an emotional speech, and the Astros appropriately vanquished Mets starter Matt Harvey in a 12-8 victory.Over the ensuing weeks, the "H-Strong" patches on the players' jerseys helped galvanize the community, and each victory raised the fans' spirits.The players, in turn, drew energy from the fans' resolve."This is one of the reasons why we are here,'' Altuve said."We want to win the World Series and give it to our city."Many of the fans who filled Minute Maid Park during the playoffs against Boston and New York wore T-shirts with the inscription #HoustonStrong, an offshoot of the #BostonStrong T-shirts that symbolized the city's resilience after the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings.Although the circumstances were different, the teams' two success stories helped illustrate how athletes and fans can bond through trying times.The extent of Harvey's destructive path is difficult to grasp for national media members and other out-of-towners who parachuted in for the postseason and stayed in Houston hotels, ate in downtown restaurants and walked the streets to and from Minute Maid Park amid what looked like business as usual.Joe Musgrove asked kids at the shelter to decorate his cleats with signatures and other designs.He wore them during the Mets series and they were later auctioned off for a hurricane relief fund.Courtesy of Houston Astros Much of the devastation took place in surrounding areas -- in Houston suburbs such as Baytown, Dickinson, League City, Kingwood, Dayton, Spring Branch and Pasadena.Many of the affected communities were located near rivers or bayous, in planned communities where the drainage systems were overwhelmed by the incessant rains.Harvey pounded the region for days before it relinquished its grip, and a state of emergency went into effect for 30 counties in Texas and the neighboring state of Louisiana.While Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt was doing herculean work to raise money and help the area recover, the Astros mobilized their resources in multiple areas.The team donated $4 million through its foundation and established a YouCaring site that has raised an additional $243,000.In the aftermath of the storm, the team opened the kitchens at Minute Mark Park and cooked 5,000 meals a day to be distributed in the community by the Salvation Army.School schedules were severely disrupted by the hurricane damage, and the Astros bought 20,000 school-supply kits and 11,000 backpacks for Houston, Pasadena and outlying districts.The team has also reached out to local Little Leagues, which incurred significant flood damage and lost equipment during the hurricane.Twila Carter, executive director of the Astros' foundation and the team's community relations department, said seven of the 15 fields used by the Kingwood/Forest Cove League were under 20 feet of water during the peak of the flood surge.While inspecting the fields, local officials were stunned to see fish lodged at the top of the batting screens.Reid Ryan, the Astros' club president, plunged into the fray with his wife, Nicole, and their three children through the family's affiliation with Second Baptist Church in Houston.Volunteers showed up and were given wheelbarrows, vacuums, sanitizing chemicals and other tools and sent to locations to help people they had never met rebuild their lives."My wife led a crew that was gutting carpets and floors and putting in drywall,'' Ryan said."This is a woman who didn't know what drywall was.And I say that respectfully.''Ryan, the son of "Big Tex,'' Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan, talks of the "rugged, frontier individualism'' that defines the makeup of Texans.That stoicism notwithstanding, many Houston-area residents have reached out to Carter and the Astros for a helping hand or a sympathetic ear during their time of despair.During a conversation with ESPN.com, Carter read several excerpts from letters she had received from Hurricane Harvey victims.One such appeal came from a woman representing a local church that had been around since the mid-1800s.The church lost its sanctuary, a pipe organ, altars, pews and all its supplies down to the Bibles and songbooks.Everything was buried under several feet of rain, muck and sod."The best way I can describe what it feels like when you see it is just a kick in the gut,'' the woman told Carter."I've seen grown men weep.It is so heart-wrenching.The bad part about it is, it isn't the first time.The first time we were well-insured.This time, not so much.''Other handwritten letters expressed similar themes.A local woman reached out on behalf of her stepmother, who's suffering from kidney disease and congestive heart disease and had to be rescued by boat during the storm.Carter heard from a mother whose sons played youth ball on area fields before going on to college and a choir group at a local school that had incurred major damage because of the floods.Come spring, the Astros plan to announce several big-picture initiatives through which resources will be put to use to help Houston rebuild.On a smaller scale, if the Astros can provide an autographed Carlos Correa or Jose Altuve baseball to help a local group with a fundraiser, they'll try to oblige."You're not going to drive the city streets and say, 'Wow, it looks terrible,''' Carter said."It's not visible.But a lot of people have called and sent emails and written letters because they know that we work in the community.A lot of times, it's people who write on behalf of others.''Hall of Famer Craig Biggio, who grew up in New York and went to college at Seton Hall in New Jersey before Houston chose him in the first round of the 1987 draft, fell in love with the city through 2,850 games and 12,504 plate appearances as an Astro.His heart ached as he saw the region decimated by the storm."You think about our fan base and what people went through with Harvey, and how devastating that was,'' Biggio said."The boys were on the road for a while and their families were here.It was hard for everybody."Harvey didn't care who you were, where you lived or what your address was.If it got you, it got you.Everybody here understands that.The players and the organization both understand it.But the way this team continued to play has been a great story.[The power of] sports is an amazing thing.''Biggio is entirely correct that Harvey didn't discriminate.About 25 Astros employees -- from senior vice presidents to ticket sellers -- lost homes and/or family vehicles during the storm.The damage was so extensive, in some cases, they simply gutted the first floor, moved to the second floor and added a door for an entryway."The best way I can describe what it feels like when you see it is just a kick in the gut.I've seen grown men weep.It is so heart-wrenching."Excerpt from one of the letters the Astros received from Hurricane Harvey victims In the Houston clubhouse, Carlos Beltran, Carlos Correa and catcher Juan Centeno absorbed a double-barreled gut punch between Harvey and the massive devastation in their native Puerto Rico inflicted by Hurricane Maria.Beltran raised $1.3 million for Puerto Rico through his foundation, and Astros owner Jim Crane chartered two planes to transport supplies to the island."I'm trying to delegate a lot to my wife,'' Beltran said."She told me I was going crazy.She said, 'Carlos, you need to focus on baseball and let other people take care of this.'But I'm always hands-on when I want to do something."There's no power in Puerto Rico.There's no water.The infrastructure is down.There could be people without power for years.Can you imagine that?Sometimes we spend one day without power and we go crazy.If that happens, it will be tough for people to recuperate.We hope that people don't lose their faith and their hope and they continue to fight.''At home in Houston, that fighting spirit is embodied by Astros season-ticket holders Johnny and Noemi Hill, who maintained their positive outlook after incurring shin-high water at their home in League City.The Harvey-generated damage was significant enough that their son drove 22 hours from Alabama to pitch in and help with the recovery.Houston's fighting spirit is embodied by Astros season-ticket holders Johnny and Noemi Hill.Even while replacing their damaged home, they insisted on buying a postseason ticket package because they had invested so much energy into the teams success.Courtesy Jerry Crasnick Although the Hills were able to replace their Ford pickup truck, they have no flood insurance.Almost two months after Harvey's arrival, they're unsure how to proceed with replacing the floor at their family home because the foundation might have shifted during the hurricane.Johnny Hill, an Air Force veteran, works as a supervisor at Ellington Airport.The days have been long of late, and he has spent a lot of his off time tearing out flooring and replacing sheet rock to make the house habitable.Once or twice during September Astros games, he dozed off in the middle of a pitch.But the Hills insisted on buying the Astros' postseason ticket package, because they had invested so much energy in the team's success, and they wanted to see the season through to the finish."During the Yankees series, I came into work and everybody was hollering at me, 'Were you at the game last night?'''Johnny said."One guy asked if I could leave Noemi at home, and he said he would come with me.He said, 'I'll be your date.'''The Hills fell hard for the Astros from the moment they arrived in Houston from Austin in 1980.Almost 30 years ago, their children waited in line for Biggio's autograph at a local car dealership.Now Johnny proudly displays a straw hat with signatures of players from the team's winter FanFest.The hat is only missing Correa, Alex Bregman and Evan Gattis, who was away on his honeymoon at the time.When Noemi watches games from their seats in the third deck, she instinctively snaps to attention and takes part in the "MVP!MVP!"chants each time Altuve steps to the plate.When pressed to name her favorite Astro, she's stumped for an answer."All the players, as far as I'm concerned,'' she said."There are numerous players, but they're all one, because they play together and support each other.''Togetherness has been a recurrent theme in Houston, from those first outreach efforts at the convention center to the cheers that will rain down from the Minute Maid Park stands when the Astros return home for World Series Game 3.Harvey was extraordinarily powerful and relentlessly cruel, but it has been easier to survive through strength in numbers."It's been a slow grind to get back, but the team has been a big part of it,'' Ryan said."Folks wanted us to play, whether they were listening on radio or watching TV or came out to the game.This team has all of a sudden captured the imagination of our community and given everybody something to think about other than losing their home or fighting the insurance company, or having to ask themselves, 'Where am I getting the money?What am I doing?'"It's easy to see how a community needs a positive distraction when it goes through something like this.Without a doubt, we've become the fan-favorite team in Houston, because we've played through this tragedy and represented the hopes and dreams and given people a ray of sunshine during a tough time in our community.''That ray of hope persists, through wins, losses, cheers, tears and everything else Houston experiences with its baseball team in the fall of 2017.The memories and the bond will endure long after the final pitch of the World Series.
Houston Astros' World Series run is a momentous occasion to their city of survivors:::::HOUSTON -- A few days before the World Series moves back here to the Gulf Coast, the guys at Screwed Up Records and Tapes are waiting on Game 2 to start.The shop is in a run-down strip mall surrounded by oil refineries and distribution warehouses, out near the invisible buffer where the bayou ends and the city begins.In the back room, the first cousin and some friends of the late DJ Screw count down the last 30 minutes before first pitch.The place smells exactly how you'd hope the back room of DJ Screw's record shop would smell -- which is to say, everyone will be in need of a Whataburger run later (bacon, jalapenos, mustard, onion, if you're scoring at home).Big Bubb, Screw's aforementioned first cousin, runs the business.All they sell are T-shirts, hats and the famous Screw Tapes."Me and Screw grew up together, since toddlers," he says."More like brothers.It's been a struggle.I gave Screw my word.Keeping his dream alive.Trying to keep the doors open."Editor's Picks Through wins, losses, cheers and tears, Astros give hope to Houston "We want to win the World Series and give it to our city," Jose Altuve said.For the Astros, this is bigger than a pennant -- it's giving Houston another reason to band together in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.Out on the floor, a guy comes into the shop, asking for a couple of the mixtapes: the slowed-down, doped-out, narcotic-haze hip-hop mixes by H-Town's own beloved and now almost mythical street poet, DJ Screw, who died 17 years ago from an overdose of codeine.The customer is in a rush to catch the first pitch."I'm trying to get home now," he says."Verlander's gonna do it."He leaves, music in hand, and a few minutes later, the Astros game begins.Everyone finds a place to sit in the back room, the Garden of Eden of Southern rap, home of the hard drives holding the life's work of Robert Earl Davis Jr., better known as DJ Screw.They hum all hours of the night and day, burning the songs onto CDs for $15 or jump drives for 10 bucks a rip.A guy who goes by Big A partakes in refreshments and exhales."Gotta get a 'W' tonight," he says.They talk about the local music scene -- they seem to agree that Killa Cal Wayne is the reigning underground king -- and follow the game.Rapper and old Screwed Up Click legend Will Lean comes in and finds a seat in the corner, fresh off a long drive back from Lake Charles, Louisiana.First thing he does is ask about the score.By the time the game reaches the bottom of the second, something just doesn't seem right.It all feels too normal for Houston, a city that is weird above all else, and in the soothing drone of announcer pablum, Bubb realizes what's missing.This is baseball but not Houston baseball.He dials up one of his favorite Screw tapes and twists the volume knob until the whole room is awash in loud, sludgy music, which sounds like a tape player in the process of devouring its tape.Everything metal within earshot of the speakers rattles, sounding like a dozen car trunks.Bubb turns out the light, and everyone leans back into their seats, the only light from the Astros game and the cherries of the orbiting joints.A local DJ offers to make a store run."They got that Dr Pepper on sale," Big A says, peeling off some cash."Two for a dollar fifty."He heckles the Dodgers."I love talking s---," he says."You know I love talking s--- for the home team."They settle in, wanting the Astros to win a baseball game, not because they particularly care about baseball but because they love Houston, Clutch City, all nodding their heads to DJ Screw, like the 1990s had never ended at all.Yeah, the old music seems to be telling the game: Welcome to Houston.On Wednesday, I landed in town to wait for the Astros to come back home.The team has been the sentimental favorite in the playoffs, to be sure, just two months after Hurricane Harvey stalled over the city, dumping days of rain.There are lots of ways to explain how much water fell, like saying it was 15 trillion gallons, or more than 50 inches of rain across the fourth-largest city in the country, but the most effective way seems to be something small and simple: A high school baseball coach I met here had just finished building a pool in his backyard but hadn't added the water when Harvey hit.When the rain stopped, his new pool was full.Before Game 2, fans lined up down in the old train station, which had been turned into a makeshift postseason Astros shop, buying pins and hats and jerseys.The local buses said "Go Astros" on the front.The waiting game from the record shop repeated itself everywhere.The day drinkers lounged in the perfect weather, mid-70s with a breeze, wasting the afternoon at the West Alabama Ice House, an open-air dive bar with cold beer and a taco truck.Bikers sometimes show up there on the weekend, partying alongside the former Big 12 and SEC frat bros. On the other side of town, groups of gambling Vietnamese men in the cafes along Bellaire Boulevard drank the sweet, strong iced coffee with condensed milk.They were served by a woman dressed as Wonder Woman, hustling for extra tips.The stereo played melancholy Vietnamese love songs, and the guys placed bets and stared at Italian soccer on the screens.Many were alone.In a few hours, all of them would be watching the Astros.Houston famously has few zoning laws, prizing growth above all else.It's one of the most diverse cities in the country, and not in that smug Ivy League way, but in a real way, where working men and women from all over the country and world fight to carve out a little piece of a new life.It's an immigrant city.Beneath a downtown office building, there's a simple, busy food court: a Chinese dumpling house, a Vietnamese sandwich shop, an Indian place serving Mumbai and Delhi street food favorites, a shop selling Italian meatballs.Oil and gas folks from Pittsburgh, who came south when the steel industry died, have tailgated at Texans games with sandwiches with french fries on it, just like Primanti Brothers.There's an outpost of the Philly cheesesteak place Tony Luke's.There's a Greek supermarket and a Polish grocery store.Vietnamese people from all corners of the nation can find their local cuisine; an hour after I landed, my friend Jeff and I ate a Hanoi-style lunch of bun cha and banh cuon.There are sports bars and legit juke joints and the fanciest old-line country clubs you could picture in a fevered Gatsby dream.There's everything and everyone, a city populated by expats, where people come with dreams and plans, putting them on the line and rolling the dice.There's no place like Houston, the most American city in the world, really, with all the good and bad that conveys.Like Memphis, its music is not just entertainment but a moan and wail from the guts of the place: dirty sounds like ZZ Top and DJ Screw and Albert Collins, soulful country like Robert Earl Keen and Lyle Lovett.What other city could produce both Beyonce and Kenny Rogers?Listening to 97.1, the classic country station, while driving near the edge of town, always makes me feel like the radio isn't playing in the car but rather in the sky.Glen Campbell's "Galveston" might be about Vietnam, or about the Civil War, or the Crusades.Houston is a city that shakes off easy attempts, such as this one, to define it, the kind of place where, after living such big American lives, people as divergent as Howard Hughes and Lightnin' Hopkins can find their final resting place, just a few miles apart.Springer's 11th-inning home run sealed a Game 2 win for the Astros.Ezra Shaw/Getty Images Around the fourth inning, with the game tied, I leave the record shop and wind my way north to a bar I like called Alice's Tall Texan.Two community tables along the back are for food; every night has the potential to be a potluck at the neighborhood joint, depending on who brings what.Someone brings a tray of sandwiches for Game 2.The bartender watches over her regulars.Her son is in the military, left home after graduating from high school and never came back.He makes sure to send money home."He takes care of his mama," she says.The ceilings are low, and the only two celebrities on the wall are J.J. Watt and Jason Aldean.A freezer in the back keeps big chalices and mugs cold for the draft Shiner or Lone Star, which comes in large or small.The real regulars knew to sign the book: There's a series of notebooks, and if you're invited to buy a poker chip to put in the bag, then you sign your name and throw in a dollar every day you're there.If your chip gets drawn on a day when you signed, you win the pot.People have won thousands.In the last hour of the game, the bar gets quiet and tense.There are two tables of fans, until the stress gets to be too much and one table leaves.Some people go outside when they can't stand to watch.One guy literally pulls at his hair.He wants to fight the umpire.Another watches a television in the corner alone.A third guy, standing at the bar, says he just feels hopeless -- not about the game so much as everything."It's just one of those nights," he says."I have existential dread.Just end it now.With the rest of my misery."The Astros fall behind, then come back.A customer with feathery Whitesnake video hair compliments the bartender, trying to run a little game.The Astros pull ahead in the 10th, then let the Dodgers tie it, then hold on to a one-run win an inning later.The bartender films the bar's reaction with her phone.People leapt in the air and hugged each other, running around giving delirious high-fives."Alice is gonna come here and be all smiles," the bartender says.She turns to some customers and explains that there might be a visitor arriving, to join in the communal joy."If you see an old lady come in, that's Alice.She's a big-time baseball fan.She's 77 years old, and lemme tell you: Some words come out of her mouth!"The first home game for the Astros is Friday, with two more to follow over a frenzied baseball weekend, and it's certainly an interesting time for the circus to land in Houston.A lot is happening.The last hurricane shelter, set up in an abandoned shopping mall, is down to about 90 people, and the Red Cross hopes to have it closed by the end of the week.Yesterday afternoon, a high school baseball coach named Kelly Mead drove me around the northern suburbs, which were hammered by the floodwaters.At one point, traffic went down to one lane because the city was finally fixing the gas pipes.He's the coach at Kingwood High, which was damaged so badly in the storm that the entire student body is sharing a building with another high school in its district.Summer Creek goes from 7-11:25, and then Kingwood goes from 12:11-4:30.Mead took a lot of video of the rising water, and he played the clips and narrated as he drove.A lot of people put in their boats near the Jiffy Lube to help with rescues, but any craft with less than a 200-horsepower motor couldn't handle the fast currents roaring through streets.The area around the high school, which saw incredible flooding, as high as 16 feet in some places, is all nice subdivisions and strip malls with the newest chains.Everything is shiny and new.It's a boomtown, really.The destroyed Whataburger had been open maybe a month, he said, and the HEB grocery store had been there about six months.Nearly everything that got flooded, it seems, is a new build.The boomtown vibe has influenced the recovery, too, as people are working hard to clean up and start anew.Mead's players jumped right into helping teammates and neighbors, ripping out sheetrock, getting dirty.For his career, he has often worried that the stuff he tells players about values and ethics goes in one ear and out the other."You wonder if they're listening," he says."When the flood hit, we really saw they listened."Two of the Astros, Josh Reddick and Joe Musgrove, came to talk to the team one day.At first the kids were shy, but after some prompting from the players, the teenage boys finally started firing questions.The first was about wearing a Speedo during a celebration.The second was about Kate Upton.The power will get turned on at the old school any day now, and he hopes they might play some regular-season games in their stadium.Life is going on.That's a typical Houston reaction to something.To trudge forward.Wednesday afternoon, as the sun began to go down, I met a local poet for a coffee at a place that could be in any European capital.Long Chu's parents fled North Vietnam in 1954, moving south to escape the communists, then they fled Vietnam for good in 1975 when Saigon fell.Two months ago, Harvey destroyed their home.For the third time in their lives, they are starting over."They have taken in a lot of suffering," he says, "and I think, for my mom, what she said immediately: 'When I was 30, in 1975, I felt like I could do anything.Now I don't feel like I can do anything.'It's a very hard realization."The people of Houston, many of them, had to endure trials to even arrive here.People fled governments and wars, and there are constantly refugees arriving from around the world.A good number of Iraqi and Afghani interpreters for the U.S. military end up moved to Houston.Many former New Orleanians live in Houston after being run out of Louisiana by Katrina; for them, Harvey was the second major storm in 12 years.Houston was founded by two real estate speculators from New York, the land bought mostly on credit, and that striving and salesmanship remains coded in the city's residents, both those who have lived here for generations and those who arrived in the past few months.The storm served as a civic reminder of that past."What Harvey has done is really underscored that everything is rootless," Long Chu says."There are no roots.And even if you think you have roots, even if you think you've put down roots, things are not tied down."Houston is, most of all, a city of survivors, which gives the city its energy but also infuses everything with a hardness -- or sadness, as Long Chu describes it -- some sort of understanding that life is a tragedy broken up by moments of joy and light.When people call a city tough, or gritty, or "Clutch City," as the T-shirts call Houston, that's what they're talking about: a civic understanding of both the game and the score, like when the local team plays a World Series game and an entire area code just stops.
Ranking the NBA's top 25 players born outside the United States:::::Last month, ESPN.com rolled out its 2017 list of the top 100 players in the NBA -- the #NBArank project.To highlight the global impact on the league (there were 108 players born outside the U.S. on rosters to start the 2017-18 season), we've used those rankings to compile a list of the NBA's 25 top international players.From left, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid and Steven Adams aren't just some of the NBA's best international players; they are among the NBA's best players, period.ESPN Without further ado, here is the #NBArank Global Edition (with each player's overall #NBArank position in parentheses) for the 2017-18 season: 25.(97) Dirk Nowitzki | Germany AP Photo/Rick Bowmer Mavericks | PF | @swish41 Last year's global rank: 8 Last year's overall rank: 41 Stats & Info: This is Nowitzki's 20th season in Dallas, and when he steps on the court for the first time, he will tie Kobe Bryant's NBA record for the most seasons played with a single franchise.Nowitzki also has a shot at climbing into the top five on the all-time scoring list, as he needs 1,160 points to pass Wilt Chamberlain for fifth place.If he plays in 70 games, Nowitzki would need to average 16.6 PPG to move up the list.24.(96) Dennis Schroder | Germany (AP Photo/John Bazemore Hawks | PG | @DennisMike93 Last year's global rank: 24 Last year's overall rank: 91 Editor's Picks Scouting 2018's best international NBA draft prospects Jonathan Givony scouts and ranks the top 10 international prospects eligible for the 2018 NBA draft.Stats & Info: With the departure of Paul Millsap, Dennis Schroder is now the leader of a rebuilding Hawks franchise and a prime candidate for catchy yet empty box score stats in 2017-18.In 755 minutes he played without Millsap last season, Schroder averaged just under 22 points and eight assists per 36 minutes.Unfortunately for the Hawks, they were outscored by 7.5 points per 100 possessions during that time, a number that would have ranked dead last in the NBA.23.(88) Nikola Mirotic | Montenegro David Banks/USA TODAY Sports Bulls | PF | @threekola Last year's global rank: 27 Last year's overall rank: 95 Stats & Info: Consistency eludes Mirotic, who didn't re-sign with Chicago until just before training camp following another up-and-down season.After averaging just 9 PPG on 30 percent shooting from 3 over the first five months of 2016-17, Mirotic ended on a high note, scoring nearly 16 PPG in March and April while connecting on 43 percent from beyond the arc.22.(84) Ben Simmons | Australia Garrett Ellwood/NBAE via Getty Images 76ers | PF | @BenSimmons25 Last year's global rank: 34 Last year's overall rank: 120 Stats & Info: Simmons missed all of last season and did not participate in Summer League, so he's perhaps the league's biggest mystery entering 2017-18.ESPN.com's fantasy projections peg him for 14.7 PPG, 6.6 APG and 5.9 RPG, all-around production that is almost unheard of by a rookie.In fact, the only two rookies in NBA history to reach those thresholds are Magic Johnson and Oscar Robertson.(Number of international players on rosters at the start of each season.Source: NBA) 21.(80) Pau Gasol | Spain Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images Spurs | C | @paugasol Last year's global rank: 15 Last year's overall rank: 61 Stats & Info: There were 232 players who launched at least 100 triples last season.The player that ranked first among all of them in 3-point FG percentage?Pau Gasol.The gap between Gasol and the second-best was the same as the gap between the second-best and 94th-best.In a league littered with bigs reinventing themselves in the age of pace-and-space, Gasol has transformed into perhaps the game's most deadly stretch 5.20.(77) Gorgui Dieng | Senegal Jordan Johnson/NBAE/Getty Images Timberwolves | PF | @GorguiDieng Last year's global rank: 30 Last year's overall rank: 112 Stats & Info: Dieng was a lone bright spot defensively for a Timberwolves team that finished 26th in defensive efficiency last season.The only players to average at least 25 minutes per game and rank ahead of Dieng in defensive real plus-minus were perennial defensive player of the year candidates Rudy Gobert, Draymond Green and Anthony Davis.The dependable Dieng is one of three players to appear in all 82 games each of the past two seasons.19.(72) Tristan Thompson | Canada Nathaniel S. Butler/NBAE/Getty Images Cavaliers | C | @RealTristan13 Last year's global rank: 17 Last year's overall rank: 68 Stats & Info: Thompson is the only qualified player to average at least three offensive rebounds per game over each of the past six seasons and is vital to Cleveland's ability to generate second chances.With Thompson off the floor, the Cavs averaged just 9.2 second-chance points per 48 minutes, which would have ranked dead last in the NBA.With him on the court, that number rose to 12.9, which would have been good for 16th leaguewide.18.(70) Clint Capela | Switzerland AP Photo/David J. Phillip Rockets | C | @CapelaClint Last year's global rank: 25 Last year's overall rank: 92 Stats & Info: Capela made tremendous strides on the offensive end in his third season, developing into one of the NBA's elite rim runners and ranking third in field goal percentage.Capela was on the receiving end of 103 alley-oops last season, which ranked second in the NBA behind only LA Clippers center DeAndre Jordan.With Jordan's former lob partner Chris Paul now throwing them in Houston alongside James Harden, expect Capela to lead the league in alley-oop finishes in 2017-18.17.(69) Serge Ibaka | Congo Mark Blinch/NBAE via Getty Images Raptors | PF | @sergeibaka Last year's global rank: 19 Last year's overall rank: 71 Stats & Info: Although the addition of Ibaka didn't result in Toronto's ascension to the top of the Eastern Conference last season, as was the hope when they traded for the shot-blocking floor stretcher, the Raptors did have success when playing him at the 5.In the 231 minutes Ibaka played center during the regular season, the Raptors outscored teams by 14.1 points per 100 possessions, perhaps a sign of things to come with Ibaka now inked for three more seasons.(International players on rosters at the start of the 2017-18 season.Source: NBA) 16.(67) Patty Mills | Australia Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports Spurs | PG | @Patty_Mills Last year's global rank: 32 Last year's overall rank: 115 Stats & Info: Last season, the Spurs outscored teams by 11.9 points per 100 possessions with Mills on the floor without Tony Parker, compared to 5.2 points per 100 possessions with Parker on the floor without Mills.With Mills ranking well ahead of Parker in our rankings -- Parker failed to crack the overall top 100 -- it's perhaps more clear than ever that it's time for Mills to take over the primary point guard duties in San Antonio.15.(66) Nicolas Batum | France Jim Dedmon-USA TODAY Sports Hornets | SG | @nicolas88batum Last year's global rank: 10 Last year's overall rank: 44 Stats & Info: On a per-possession basis, Batum has filled it up in each of his two seasons in Charlotte, as he's one of just three players to average at least 20 points, eight rebounds and eight assists per 100 possessions in each of the last two seasons.The others?LeBron James and Russell Westbrook.An area for improvement this season is efficiency, as Batum is coming off a season in which he posted the worst effective field goal percentage of his career.14.(57) Andrew Wiggins | Canada David Sherman/NBAE via Getty Images Timberwolves | SF | @22wiggins Last year's global rank: 11 Last year's overall rank: 45 Stats & Info: When it comes to projecting ceilings, Wiggins is among the most polarizing cases.On one hand, there's no denying his ability to score as you can count on two hands the number of perimeter players in NBA history to average more points as a 21-year old.On the other hand, skeptics wonder if the rest of his game will ever catch up as his assists, rebound, block and steal numbers have all plateaued since his rookie season.(International players on rosters at the start of the 2017-18 season.Source: NBA) 13.(54) Danilo Gallinari | Italy AP Photo/Jae C.

New Orleans Saints ground game thriving with Mark Ingram, Alvin Kamara:::::METAIRIE, La.-- Its mostly a coincidence that the New Orleans Saints' ground game has taken flight since they traded away Adrian Peterson two weeks ago.Weve just been committing to the run.And the offensive lines been doing a great job.And weve been scheming up well, and weve been executing, said Mark Ingram, who had his first back-to-back 100-yard rushing games since 2014 in wins over Detroit and Green Bay -- and could make it three in a row if the Saints try to stay conservative Sunday against a Chicago Bears defense that has been feasting on turnovers.And more than anything, the Saints (4-2) have been winning.Its much easier to stick with the run game when they dont fall behind early like they did in Weeks 1 and 2.Peterson probably would have feasted, too, when the Saints were running all over the Lions while building a 35-point lead two weeks ago.But the performance of Ingram and rookie Alvin Kamara has further emphasized why the Saints deemed one of the NFLs all-time great rushers expendable.Not only are Ingram and Kamara playing great football, they are also both versatile and unpredictable.What you need to know in the NFL Statistics Scoreboard 2017 schedule, results Standings Ingram has 389 rushing yards this year and 166 receiving yards.Kamara has 215 rushing and 209 receiving.Last week, both of them went over 100 yards from scrimmage on a cold, wet day in Green Bay.Both guys are so versatile, both guys can do everything, Saints quarterback Drew Brees said.Brees stressed that the versatility makes New Orleans offense less predictable since defenses like to try and key in on which back is in the game.If you asked me which running backs gonna be in on goal line, I dont know.It could be either one.Whos gonna be in on third down?I dont know.It could be either one.Base offense?It could be either one, Brees said.Theyre both so versatile in what they can do.Its a good thing to have.When youre able to mix and match the backs and do it in a way where youre very comfortable ... basically just opening up the playbook to them and saying, no matter what were running, we feel comfortable with that guy in the game, thats a good thing.Ingram is on pace for his second straight 1,000-yard rushing season (1,037 yards, to be exact, plus 64 for catches for 443 yards, which would be career highs).Kamara is on pace for 573 rushing yards and 75 catches for 557 receiving yards.The Saints are averaging 121.7 rushing yards per game -- their highest total since 2011 -- which ranks 11th in the NFL.Since Week 2, they rank sixth in the NFL with 134 rushing yards per game and seventh with 4.62 yards per carry.Ingram loves those numbers, since he has naturally always pushed for more dedication and patience with the run game, which allows him and the other backs to settle into a groove and wear down a defense.Last week, the Saints ran out the final 4 minutes, 20 seconds of clock at Green Bay before Brees was able to take a knee -- something that everyone appreciates.Thats what we want to do, Ingram said.It just shows the grit, the aggression, the physicality of an offense when you can ice a game out (like that).
Why 2.91 is key number for Seattle Seahawks vs. Deshaun Watson:::::RENTON, Wash. -- The Seattle Seahawks (4-2) host the Houston Texans (3-3) on Sunday with a chance to move into a tie for first place in the NFC West.Heres a closer look at the game from Seattles perspective, starting with the key matchup: Seahawks pass rush vs. Deshaun Watson Watson has been beating defenses with his arm and his legs since taking over as the Texans' starting quarterback in Week 2.He'll present a challenge in that regard, but he'll also present an opportunity for a Seattle pass rush that hasn't produced the expected results over the first six games.The Seahawks' 12 sacks are tied for the fourth fewest in the league, and they've generated pressure on 21.7 percent of opposing quarterbacks' dropbacks, which is tied for 30th.It has been one of the few shortcomings with a defense that has been playing at as high a level as it has at any point in recent seasons.Part of the issue is that Seattle has faced a steady diet of short, quick throws designed to get the ball out of the quarterback's hands before the pass rush can arrive.In the opener against Green Bay, for instance, the Seahawks sacked Aaron Rodgers four times in the first half, when his average pass attempt traveled 8.3 yards beyond the line of scrimmage, according to ESPN Stats & Information.Green Bay went with shorter throws in the second half -- 4.8 yards downfield on average -- and Rodgers wasn't sacked.Deshaun Watson has averaged an NFL-high 2.91 seconds from snap to release this season, potentially giving the Seahawks' pass rush an opportunity to do some damage.Tim Warner/Getty Images The same thing has been happening since then, including last week when the Giants went with a conservative game plan that didn't include many deep throws."Its hard to get the quarterback when theyre throwing that quick," Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said.That's where Watson could present an opportunity for Seattle.He has averaged an NFL-high 2.91 seconds from snap to release this season, according to ESPN Stats & Information.That helps explain why he has been pressured on 40 percent of his dropbacks, also the highest rate in the league."Im hoping that we can heat it up this weekend and make the plays that come from that," Carroll said of Seattle's pass rush.Veteran defensive end Dwight Freeney, who signed with Seattle this week, is expected to be a part of that effort.Carroll said the plan is for Freeney to play Sunday, but Seattle likely will keep his workload to a minimum -- 10 to 15 snaps may be realistic -- given that he's had only three practices with the Seahawks and hasn't played in a game since the Super Bowl in February.By the numbers 80.8.Watson's Total QBR.That's tops in the league and the highest rate through a quarterback's first six games since 2006, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.202.Watson's rushing yards, which rank second among quarterbacks.He's also second in yards per carry at 7.2.His 143 scramble yards are fourth.4-0.Seattle's record against rookie quarterbacks at CenturyLink Field since 2011.Those four quarterbacks -- Mike Glennon (2013), Derek Carr (2014), Carson Wentz (2016) and Jared Goff (2016) -- have averaged only 179 passing yards.Injury notes: The Seahawks will wait until game time to determine if center Justin Britt can play with a sprained ankle.Britt missed only six plays after suffering the injury last week against the Giants, which is a good sign.But he wasn't able to practice until Friday, when he was a limited participant.His availability will have a ripple effect on Seattle's offensive line.Rookie Ethan Pocic is Seattle's backup center and will start if Britt can't play.But Pocic also is competing with Mark Glowinski at left guard, where those two rotated last week.Carroll said Pocic will start at left guard if Britt is able to play.Seattle will likely be without running back C.J.Prosise, who is listed as doubtful because of an ankle injury.Weather check: As of Friday, Weather.com predicts the temperature in Seattle around kickoff at 1 p.m. local time to be 58 degrees with a 5 percent chance of rain.Prediction: Watson has looked like the real deal, but he faces a tough challenge on the road against a Seattle defense that has hit its stride.That unit has allowed only 33 points during the Seahawks' three-game winning streak, elevating them back into their familiar place as the NFL's top scoring defense.And this game is at CenturyLink Field, where the Seahawks have had their way with rookie quarterbacks.The guess here is that Watson will be the next one on that list.Seahawks 27, Texans 21.
Jaguars counting on Marcell Dareus to help shore up run defense:::::JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- The Jacksonville Jaguars have one of the worst run defenses in the NFL.Theyre hoping the addition of defensive tackle Marcell Dareus will help, and help enough for them to win the AFC South.Marcell Dareus brings a reputation as both a solid pass-rusher and run-stuffer to Jacksonville.AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack The Jaguars are next to last against the run (138.6 yards per game), and nobody allows more than their 5.2 yards per rush.The 6-foot-3, 331-pound Dareus gets headlines because of his prowess as an interior pass-rusher (35 sacks in six-plus seasons, including 7.5 in 2013 and 10.0 in 2014), but hes one of the leagues better run-stuffing tackles.Dareus is now the Jaguars biggest defensive lineman and he can play both nose tackle and 3-technique.The two-time Pro Bowler will likely move into the starting lineup ahead of nose tackle Abry Jones (6-foot-4, 318).The Jaguars (4-3) opted to keep Jones over Roy Miller -- who is now with Kansas City, and he hasnt played badly -- but Jacksonville doesn't have an experienced backup behind him.Dareus and Jones should give the Jaguars a good rotation at nose tackle.Dareus has had more than his share of off-field issues -- he was benched for being late to a team meeting in 2013, was sent home from a preseason game this year for violating a team rule, was twice suspended for violating the NFLs substance-abuse policy, and hes had two offseason arrests -- but the Jaguars believe the help the Alabama product can bring the run defense is worth the risk.Its clear the Jaguars needed to do something.In their four victories, theyve allowed only 98.3 yards per game rushing.However, theyve given up 192.3 in their three losses.Defensive coordinator Todd Wash and several players have said a lack of gap discipline, over-pursuit and backside cutbacks are the biggest problems.Those are discipline issues and can be corrected, but it is troubling that it seems to occur each week.The Jaguars chances of winning the division and making the playoffs rest on the defense.The pass defense has been stellar -- Jacksonville entered Week 8 ranked first in the NFL in sacks (33), interceptions (10) and turnovers (16) -- and cornerbacks Jalen Ramsey and A.J.Bouye have established themselves as one of the best cornerback duos in the NFL.The addition of safety Barry Church also was one of the teams best offseason moves, shoring up a weak spot in replacing Johnathan Cyprien.The one glaring defensive weakness has been stopping the run.The Jaguars are gambling that Dareus is the fix they need.
which four drivers make the final four?:::::Martin Truex Jr. wins from the pole at Kansas while Jimmie Johnson advances to the round of 8 despite spinning twice on Sunday.(2:57) Our experts weigh in on four of the biggest questions in motorsports as the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series heads to Martinsville Speedway on Sunday for the first race in the semifinal round of the playoffs: Turn 1: The Round of 8 is all set for the semifinals.Who do you have advancing to the final four for the championship race at Homestead?Ricky Craven, ESPN NASCAR analyst: I have Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch, Denny Hamlin and Jimmie Johnson, of course.I'm not necessarily placing my confidence in the speed of the 48, but in the experience of the driver and crew chief.Ryan McGee, ESPN.com: Truex, Kyle Busch, Brad Keselowski and Kyle Larson.Oh, wait -- sorry, Mr. Larson ... Jimmie Johnson.Kyle Busch, left, and Martin Truex Jr. are popular choices to make the championship race at Homestead with their title hopes intact.Robert Laberge/Getty Images Bob Pockrass, ESPN.com: Truex, Kyle Busch, Hamlin and Kevin Harvick.It feels stupid leaving Johnson off the list, but he has already used enough horseshoes this season.Matt Willis, ESPN Stats & Information: I like Kyle Busch to win at Martinsville, Truex to win at Texas (duh, it's a 1.5-mile track) and Harvick in Phoenix.That leaves one spot, and I'm giving a slight edge to Keselowski over Chase Elliott, since Brad starts the round with 20 more points and had a fourth-place average finish on this round's tracks earlier this season.Turn 2: Which of the eight drivers still in the playoffs is most dependent on a successful race Sunday at Martinsville?Craven: At the risk of contradicting answer No.1, Johnson is most dependent on a strong Martinsville.I believe this for two reasons.Chevrolet has not been able to match the speed of the Toyotas on larger tracks, but most importantly, Jimmie needs a strong Martinsville because he told me so Sunday night.He knows and understands the path to an eighth title.He has traveled that path seven times.McGee: Hamlin.If he's going to really make a run at this, it needs to start Sunday.He has won at all three tracks between now and Homestead but wasn't great at any of them the first time around this season.I've always gauged the health of this team by how well he runs at the track he knows best.Yes, I know he's from Richmond, but the one he has run the most is Martinsville.Editor's Picks NASCAR Cup 2017: Breaking down the third-round playoffs grid Martin Truex Jr. looks like a lock to make the NASCAR Cup playoffs finale at Homestead, but he's not taking it for granted.The three-race semifinal round starts Sunday at Martinsville, and the eight drivers hoping to make the final four are on edge.Monday Rundown: Martin Truex Jr. gets pit-stall choice at Martinsville For Martin Truex Jr., winning the pole at Kansas came with a bonus.Now he gets the first -- and highly coveted -- pit stall this Sunday at Martinsville.In Xfinity, the JR Motorsports boys are rolling, and it looks like a spec engine is coming to Trucks.1 Related Pockrass: Elliott.He's too far back in the points as the only winless driver that a bad run at Martinsville will put him in a deep hole.Willis: It's hard to say a nine-time Martinsville winner has something to prove, but Johnson might have to get it done at Martinsville.The second race of the leg is at Texas, and he has struggled to the tune of a 15.3 average finish and one top-5 (albeit a win at Texas, but he led only 18 laps) on 1.5-mile tracks this season.Johnson just snuck into this round and might have to win at one of his best tracks to make it through.Turn 3: Matt Kenseth was eliminated from playoff contention.Where, if anywhere, do you see him driving next season?Craven: I see Matt driving his daughters to Cannon School.And while I know the urge to compete will always exist, it makes no sense for Matt to spend the last inning of his career driving equipment inferior to what he experienced at Joe Gibbs Racing.McGee: I think he'll be stuck in Interstate-77 traffic.While we're all throwing palm fronds at Junior's feet as he exits, another Hall of Famer is likely saying goodbye to full-time racing, too.And if he is, he's doing it just as he would've preferred: with zero fanfare.Matt Kenseth might be down to the final four races of his NASCAR Cup career.Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images Pockrass: I see him driving to all of his daughters' activities.On the racetrack?Most likely only in a substitute role.Willis: It's unfortunate to see a driver with a lot left in the tank (pun intended) be the odd man out.There's a chance he heads to Stewart-Haas Racing to take the car not (presumably) lined up for Aric Almirola.Would he be willing to drive a couple more years in a car for a team like Front Row Motorsports?Something tells me no.But the most I can get inside his head is to know he has an awesome first name and probably was not happy about Aaron Rodgers' injury.Turn 4: Is it OK that Kansas qualifying set pit-stall selection order for Martinsville because there is only about two hours between qualifying and the race?Craven: Pit road selection at Martinsville is critical.Nothing about competing at Martinsville translates to competing at Kansas.The whole concept seems convoluted.I haven't figured out the logic behind this decision.McGee: This is dumb.We finally have the one-day show I've been begging for, and this is sitting there, in the way.File this in the drawer marked "There's always one thing that makes you go, 'Why?'"It's a pretty full drawer.Pockrass: No.When NASCAR has back-to-back races because of rain, the stalls are able to get set up within an hour.Where there's a will, there's a way, and there should be a will to have qualifying impact pit selection for that specific race.To have Kansas qualifying impact the Martinsville race just seems wrong.Willis: Something about it rubs me the wrong way, and maybe it's because we've seen pit road come so much into play recently (see: Kenseth, Matt), and that pit road is so tight that the first pit stall could be worth a few positions each stop.Kansas and Martinsville are such different animals.Why not use practice speeds from Friday and give a little extra juice to those practices?Or, better yet, a hot dog-eating contest!
Brad Keselowski's plan requires skill and luck:::::HOMESTEAD, Fla. -- Brad Keselowski had finished a day of testing at Homestead-Miami Speedway and knew what he might need there next month if he is among the four finalists in contention to win the NASCAR Cup title."We're going to need a horseshoe," Keselowski quipped."If last year proved anything, they exist."The Team Penske driver knows he has a tough road to just make it to the final round and to be among the four championship finalists -- something he has yet to do in his career.His best shot comes Sunday at Martinsville Speedway, where he will try to repeat his feat from April and win on NASCAR's shortest oval."It's been a good track for us," Keselowski said."We've been super consistent there.We've had a lot of bad luck there and it almost feels like we've gotten it out of our system."The last three years we've had just atrociously bad luck there with random part failures.Last year was a debacle with the [long] yellow flag.It probably cost us the race....It feels like in the spring, there was some kind of vindication -- we could get a whole race in without any bad luck and win.That's a big confidence booster."A win at Martinsville, Texas or Phoenix by one of the current eight playoff drivers vaults that driver into Homestead as one of the four championship contenders.The remaining spot, or spots, get determined by points.Thanks to his three race victories and six stage wins, Keselowski sits nine points above the cutoff entering the semifinal round based on playoff points.He does have a race win at a 1.5-mile track, but that came in the second race of the year at Atlanta.Five of his six stage wins came at a short track or restrictor-plate tracks.The team has struggled at intermediate tracks such as Texas."We need to have a very strong run at Martinsville, a lot of stage points or win," Keselowski said."And then [we need] two solid runs from there."For the 2012 Cup champion, the fact he has gone to Homestead without a chance at the title since his championship season has gnawed at him.He was eliminated in the semifinal round the first two years and after the quarterfinal round last year."It's bothersome because I felt like we were good enough in three of the last four years," Keselowski said."There are a lot of reasons why we haven't, but at the end of the day we just haven't."Some of it was in our control.Some of it wasn't.So you just hope that this year will be different."Keselowski doesn't need extra motivation this weekend, but he knows what will happen if he doesn't advance.He knows when he prepares for Homestead, the frustration will return."Re-watching the race is miserable, I can tell you that," Keselowski said."All everybody talks about, when you re-watch the Homestead race, is the championship cars.I'm [in] a race car, too, don't I exist?"Not really, not in the eyes of people watching who will the title.To exist in many ways at Homestead, he needs to be among the four finalists.He already feels bad that Kyle Larson, who has won four times this year and was one of the three best cars all season, suffered a blown engine last week at Kansas and won't have a shot at winning the title.Larson is one of the favorites at Homestead, where he excels.But the four finalists won't have to worry about Larson as far as winning the championship."I'm going to still feel sorry for Kyle," Keselowski said about he will feel if he makes the four finalists."I will."Sure, there's probably a little bit of crocodile tears in there.I'm still going to end up having to race three other guys and it's just a different person.When you win, you want to beat the best."Keselowski might not be the best at Homestead.But he saw Jimmie Johnson win the title last year when he wasn't the best car for much of the race.He very well could need the horseshoe so many have said Johnson has.But doesn't a team make its own horseshoes?"[Yes,] and sometimes they fall out of the sky," Keselowski said."It happens."So all you can do is put yourself in position for good things to happen to you and hope they do."
How Lewis Hamilton can seal world title No.4 in Mexico:::::MEXICO CITY -- Lewis Hamilton's victory in Austin inched him to the verge of this year's championship crown.The Mercedes driver holds a 66-point lead over Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel with three races, and 75 points, left to play for.The permutations for this weekend are simple -- much like he had to do for his first championship at the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, he must finish fifth or better.Unlike that dramatic Sao Paulo climax, where he passed Timo Glock for fifth at the penultimate corner, he has two more races to secure the handful of points he needs this season.Lewis Hamilton is on the brink of winning his fourth F1 world title after winning in Japan.Sutton Images By finishing fifth or higher, Hamilton will ensure he is at least 50 points ahead of Vettel with the final two races to space.Given Hamilton's recent form, it seems unlikely the championship will continue into Brazil without car failure or driver error.The close fight in Austin should have served as a reminder of how close this championship could have been.It's also likely Ferrari will be left wondering what might have been in Mexico City, where Mercedes is braced for a difficult weekend at the high-altitude circuit.With a resurgent Red Bull impressing every weekend, fifth position might well be a fair target for Hamilton and Mercedes this weekend.Though it features a long start-finish straight -- where Valtteri Bottas' Williams topped out at 372.54 km/h last year -- it also has two twisty, technical parts of the circuit likely to favour Ferrari and Red Bull.With Hamilton proving in Austin he has no desire to win the championship by collecting the points he needs to, all the ingredients are still in place for a classic contest.
Astros Yuli Gurriel Escapes World Series Ban, but Will Miss 5 Games in 2018:::::Photo HOUSTON Yuli Gurriel, the Houston Astros first baseman who was seen making a racist gesture in the dugout during Game 3 of the World Series on Friday night, has been given a five-game suspension without pay that will begin at the start of the 2018 season.The suspension, which was handed down by Rob Manfred, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, is the largest levied against a player for a public act of intolerance during a baseball game, exceeding by two games the suspension of Yunel Escobar, who was penalized for gay slurs written on his eye black strips in 2012.Manfreds decision, which he announced in a Saturday afternoon news conference, means that Gurriel will not have to sit out any of the remaining games of the World Series.The Astros entered Game 4 of the Series on Saturday night leading the Los Angeles Dodgers, two games to one.Gurriel is scheduled to earn $12 million in 2018 and will lose roughly $320,855 because of the suspension.He will also have to undergo sensitivity training.Photo There is no excuse or explanation that makes that type of behavior acceptable, Manfred said.During Game 3 of the Series on Friday, Gurriel, who defected from Cuba in 2016, hit a home run off Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish in the bottom of the second inning.After Gurriel returned to the dugout, he was captured on camera smiling and then raising his hands as if to stretch the sides of his eyes.It seemed to be a clear, and pointedly insensitive, reference to Darvish, who is from Japan.After Game 3 ended in a Houston victory, Gurriel was besieged by reporters, and he told them through an interpreter that he did not intend to offend Darvish.He maintained that he was telling teammates that maybe Darvish thought he was Japanese and that is why he gave him a good pitch to hit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Darvish issued a statement Friday night forgiving Gurriel and asking people to learn from the incident.
Astros Rout Yu Darvish and Hold On to Beat the Dodgers in Game 3:::::HOUSTON The list of stellar pitchers that the Houston Astros lineup has toppled this postseason is impressive: Chris Sale, Craig Kimbrel, Luis Severino, Aroldis Chapman and Kenley Jansen all among the best at their craft.And by the second inning of Game 3 of the World Series on Friday night, the Astros had struck again, this time getting the best of another prestigious pitcher the Los Angeles Dodgers Yu Darvish.They shelled him for four runs and forced him to make him an unceremonious exit after getting only five outs.The end result was a 5-3 victory that gave the Astros a lead of two games to one in the Series, with Game 4 scheduled for Saturday night at Minute Maid Park.The Astros are now 7-0 in their ballpark this postseason, and the Dodgers trail for the first time in a 2017 postseason series.The victory displayed the dynamism of the Astros offense.After being limited to one run in Game 1, the Astros scored 12 over the next two games.The win also underscored the versatility of pitcher Brad Peacock.Used mainly as a starter this season, Peacock took over for Lance McCullers Jr. in the sixth and fired three and two-thirds hitless innings to complete the game, earning the first save of his career and ensuring that the work of the Astros lineup would hold up.Photo When I was out there, a couple of times I got the chills from them screaming so loud, Peacock said of the Astros fans.

p.m. Eastern with Lance McCullers of the Astros throwing a 95 mile-per-hour fastball low and outside for ball one to Chris Taylor of the Dodgers.McCullers eventually got Taylor to pop out to second and retired Corey Seager when Jose Altuve made a great diving play in shallow-right to knock the ball down before throwing Seager out at first.The inning ended with Justin Turner flying out to deep center.Waldstein: Yu Darvish takes the mound in the bottom of the first for the Dodgers as the first Japanese starting pitcher in the World Series in 10 years.The last one was Daisuke Matsuzaka for the Boston Red Sox in their four-game sweep of the Colorado Rockies in 2007.Matsuzaka also started Game 3.Darvish has plenty of experience pitching at Minute Maid Park from his days with the Texas Rangers.He comes into the game with a 4-1 record and a 2.16 earned run average, so the Dodgers are pinning a lot of their hopes on him replicating that success here.Bottom 1st: Darvish gets out of jam.George Springer worked a 3-1 count against Yu Darvish and then pounced on a fastball in the zone, hitting a hard liner to center for a double.Alex Bregman made Darvish work, fouling off five pitches in an eight-pitch at-bat, but ultimately grounded out to third, which kept Springer at second.Jose Altuve flew out to deep center, which sent Springer to third, but Darvish got ahead in the count and Carlos Correa grounded out to short to end the inning.Top 2nd: Dodgers make some noise, but no runs.Lance McCullers threw half of his 12 pitches in the inning to one batter, but worked around a single to keep the game scoreless.He needed just three pitches to strike out Cody Bellinger, as the rookie infielder almost fell down as he swung wildly at a knuckle-curve.One pitch to Yasiel Puig and McCullers had a second out on a grounder to second, but Logan Forsythe got the Dodgers first hit on a single to right.Forsythe was able to steal second as Austin Barnes worked a six-pitch at-bat, but the half-inning ended when Barnes grounded out to third.Photo Bottom 2nd: Astros jump all over Darvish and score 4 runs.Yu Darvish struggled to put pitches where he wanted them and that led to a great inning for struggling Astros batters.Only six outs into the game, Dave Roberts had seen enough and removed his No.3 starter with the Dodgers already down 4-0.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yulieski Gurriel, who was 1 for 7 in Games 1 and 2, led things off by unloading on a fastball for a solo home run.Josh Reddick, whose bat had been almost entirely silent, doubled to left for his first extra-base hit of the postseason.Evan Gattis walked and Marwin Gonzalez, who had been in a horrible funk leading up to his game-tying home run in Game 2, singled off the wall in left, scoring Reddick.With runners on first and second with no outs, Brian McCann, who was hitless in the first two games of the series, looped a ball into right-center that brought home Gattis and sent Gonzalez to third.Photo Darvish finally got his first out when George Springer, the sixth batter of the half-inning, lined out to second, but Alex Bregman hit a fly ball deep enough to center to give Gonzalez enough time to tag up and score, making the score 4-0.Jose Altuve doubled to left, sending McCann over to third, and that brought out Roberts, who replaced Darvish with Kenta Maeda.Maeda needed just two pitches to end the inning, getting Carlos Correa to fly out to right.Darvishs final line was one and two-thirds innings, six hits and four runs.He walked one and had no strikeouts in the shortest start of his career.Waldstein: Darvish did not have it tonight.Even the outs were on balls that were hit hard.Gurriel started it by ripping a line-drive home run into the left field bleachers, which can be home to some of the cheapest home runs in baseball.Not to say that it was cheap, because he hammered the ball.But the distance is 315 feet, only 5 feet deeper than Fenway Park in Boston.But the wall here is about half the height of the 37-foot Green Monster, so it is one of the most tantalizing targets in baseball for a right-handed pull hitter, as Gurriel showed.It was the sixth home run hit in the last four innings of this World Series, going back to the extra innings of Game 2.Photo Top 3rd: Dodgers get one back.Given a fairly sizable lead, Lance McCullers walked the bases loaded to start the third, but managed to get out of the half-inning having only allowed one run.It was a rough start, as he engaged in a battle with Joc Pederson.The boom-or-bust hitter fought off several good pitches in what proved to be a nine-pitch walk.Undoubtedly frustrated by putting Pederson on base, McCullers responded with walks to Kike Hernandez and Chris Taylor.He got some help when his defense turned a double-play on a grounder from Corey Seager, and ended the inning by getting Justin Turner to ground out to short.The inning couldve gone far worse for McCullers, who should be happy with a 4-1 score.Waldstein: You want to make a pitching coach crazy?Get handed a 4-0 lead and then go to the mound and walk the No.8, No.9 and No.1 hitters to load the bases with nobody out.Thats what Lance McCullers, Jr. just did.But thanks to some terrific defense, including by McCullers, himself, the Astros avoided big damage.The big play was getting Corey Seager to ground into a double play that required some exceptional synchronized movement and pinpoint throws from the Astros to complete.First baseman Yuli Gurriel threw a strike off the wrong foot to Carlos Correa coming across the second base bag and he, while in stride, delivered the ball to a moving target in McCullers covering first.That kind of cohesion begins in spring training.Photo Bottom 3rd: Maeda cools down Astros batters.After a pair of lengthy half-innings for both teams, Kenta Maeda made quick work of the Astros in the third.He started by getting a pair of matching pop-outs to third from Yulieski Gurriel and Josh Reddick.A walk to Evan Gattis was a mild speed bump, but Maeda finished things off by getting Marwin Gonzalez to ground out to first to end the inning.Photo Top 4th: Puigs gamble backfires.A bang-bang play went Houstons way, sending the Dodgers down in order.With one out, Yasiel Puig hit a grounder down the third-base line that Alex Bregman could not quite reach.The ball skipped into foul territory, but Puig took some time before realizing he should round first and Carlos Correa was able to corral the ball and throw him out at second.Stoked to have two outs despite the hard hit by Puig, Lance McCullers ended things by getting Logan Forsythe to fly out to right.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Waldstein: Yasiel Puig has been caught admiring balls before, but this time he suffered from putting his head down and hustling to first base.After hitting a sharp bouncer down the third base line, Puig ran so hard that he did not see the ball had skipped past third baseman Alex Bregman.Puig overran first, slowed down and only then realized he should have been headed to second.By the time he restarted and slid into second, the ball was in Jose Altuves glove and Puig was tagged out.Bottom 4th: Maedas relief appearance gives Dodgers hope.Kenta Maeda has done a terrific job of settling things down after Yu Darvishs disastrous start.Brian McCann led off fourth against him by looping a ball just out of Corey Seagers reach in shallow left field for a single.But Maeda was unfazed and went on to strike out George Springer on four pitches and Alex Bregman on five.He got out of the inning when Jose Altuve grounded out to short.Maeda is up to 38 pitches in two and one-thirds innings of relief as the Dodgers try to get as much as they can from one of the teams three best relievers.Photo Top 5th: McCullers gets out of trouble again.Lance McCullers worked around some tremendous hustle from Joc Pederson to pitch another scoreless inning, with some help from George Springer.With one out, Pederson hit what looked like a single to center.But the young outfielder ran hard right out of the box and managed to stretch the soft hit into a double.Kike Hernandez sent him to third on a groundout to second, but McCullers got out of the inning when Chris Taylor hit a shallow fly to center that a diving Springer was able to snare for the third out.
Texans Owner Bob McNair Apologizes Again and Meets With His Team:::::Players across the N.F.L.have reacted strongly to McNairs inmates remark, some of them suggesting they would never play for the Texans.The conflict came at a critical time for the N.F.L., which has been in talks with players to address some of the concerns that led them to abstain from standing for the anthem, including racial injustice and, more specifically, the treatment of African-Americans by the police and the criminal justice system.A handful of owners and players have met in recent weeks to see if the league can help support the players in their causes.Under withering criticism from President Trump and from many fans, the owners are also eager for the players to consistently stand during the anthem.The players and owners may meet again Monday or Tuesday, but there has been confusion about the location, the agenda and whether Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who last season started the practice of not standing for the anthem, will attend.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Kaepernicks lawyer said Saturday that Kaepernick had not received an invitation to the meeting.Its obvious that Colin is being invoked for purposes other than playing football, the lawyer, Mark Geragos, said in an interview.Everyone seems to have an agenda other than putting Colin on the football field.Officials at the N.F.L.said it was up to the players to invite him.The players union, which is helping coordinate the meeting, said it was not even sure it would take place and had not firmed up a guest list.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Saturday, Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Malcolm Jenkins, who has been active in the talks, invited McNair, Commissioner Roger Goodell and Kaepernick to meet in Philadelphia, according to ESPN.Eric Reid, a safety on the 49ers who knelt with Kaepernick during the anthem last season, and has also participated in talks with the league, was also confused by Jenkinss invitation because he, too, was unaware of any meeting in Philadelphia.Im not sure why a press release was sent out saying theres a meeting when theres no confirmation the N.F.L.would attend the meeting, Reid said.There needs to be better communication.Kaepernicks attendance would be noteworthy.Now a free agent, he has been unable to secure a new contract from another team.This month, he filed a grievance in which he claimed the owners had colluded to keep him out of the league.
When Salmon Return to the Margaree, Its All Fly Rods and Autumn Glory:::::And then, of course, there are the people you meet.One morning, I headed upriver, where the Margaree grows more sylvan and intimate, resembling an Adirondack trout stream.At Cemetery Pool, I ran into Todd Karnas and Blair Banton.Karnas is a professor of literature at Memorial University in Newfoundland.He had canceled a few classes to spend the week fishing with Banton, a member of the Canadian Coast Guard.As was the case downriver, the fish were showing but not biting.The duo did not seem disheartened.Banton, who has a tattoo of a salmon fly on his left forearm, intensely watched his line swing through the pool.Well keep at er, he said.In the middle section of the river, at Etheridge Pool, I watched Anita Coady make a series of graceful casts.Coadys family has lived in the Margaree Valley for centuries.Though she travels a bit in other seasons, Coady is always sure to be home in the fall.This place doesnt ever change, she said.Why would you ever want it to?At the hub of much of the activity is Alex Breckenridge, the owner of the Tying Scotsman, the only full-service fly shop in the area.Breckenridge, with his glasses perched on the tip of his nose, ties flies to match the colors of the fall deep red marabou streamers and bright orange shrimp patterns.He moved here from Ayrshire, Scotland, in 2003 and opened his shop two years ago.This river is so accommodating, he said.All you need is a license and a place to stay.Like many, though, Breckenridge worries about the future of Atlantic salmon.A witches brew of maladies including overharvest, habitat degradation and climate change has caused a precipitous 30-year decline in worldwide Atlantic salmon populations.The species is now listed as endangered in the United States and is extinct on some rivers in southern Nova Scotia.The Margaree has not been immune to the troubles.But angling organizations, like the international Atlantic Salmon Federation and the local Margaree Salmon Association, have taken steps to try to mitigate the decline.Recent measures on the Margaree include attempts at habitat restoration and a mandated catch-and-release policy on the river.Photo The declines in the runs have made some wistful for years past.But Gaines and Child shun the nostalgia.Every week up here, and every day on the river, grants you a new chance, Child said.That optimism is a necessary trait for Atlantic salmon anglers.Its adherents are practiced in the art of rejection.The enigmatic species has been called the fish of 1,000 casts for good reason.(Atlantic salmon do not feed when they enter freshwater; many believe they strike flies out of some instinct developed as a juvenile in rivers.)Some anglers endure long stretches without catching a fish Id gone a full two weeks on the Margaree over the summer without even a strike.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its certainly not a sport for everyone, especially those with a steady iPhone habit.For others, though, the patient, repetitive process and the ability to simultaneously daydream and pay close attention to your fly is the entire point.Yvon Chouinard, the founder of Patagonia and an avid Atlantic salmon fisherman, has likened salmon fishing to being stoned.Im firmly in Chouinards camp: The process is more important than the result.Still, on the last evening of my October trip, I was going on three weeks without a fish.What I wanted more than anything was to feel the pull of an Atlantic salmon a jolt, always unexpected, like shaking hands with an overeager Texan.I walked down to the lower river, tied on one of Breckenridges red-and-yellow marabou flies and began to cast.On my third swing, my fly suddenly stopped.The water frothed as the salmon leapt twice, completely clearing the surface of the river.Eventually, I tailed her and held her steady in the current, up to my elbows in the water.Her back was lightly bronzed, her flanks silvery.It was getting dark quickly and the air had chilled.My ritual of the fall was at its end.The salmon, with a flick of her strong tail, shot upstream, continuing on with hers.
Another N.B.A. 7-Footer, Trying to Keep Up, Ventures Into 3-Point Land:::::Coach Kenny Atkinson did not question those limitations until the most powerful person in the organization suggested looking deeper.Atkinson recalled a conversation with Mikhail Prokhorov, the teams owner, not long after the Nets acquired Mozgov, who, like Prokhorov, is from Russia.Hey, Atkinson remembered Prokhorov telling him, Timmy can shoot 3s.The exchange carried some weight.Atkinson loves big men who are proficient from the 3-point line because they drag their defenders to the perimeter, which creates space for everyone else.He pointed out the challenges that players like Porzingis and the Boston Celtics Al Horford present in pick-and-rolls.Do you switch your big onto their super-quick guard?Its just not ideal, Atkinson said.And if you dont switch and play it soft, they throw it back to those guys for a wide-open shot.As the Nets surged to a surprising 3-2 start with their victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday, Mozgov has struggled to find a fit with his new team, averaging 4.6 points and 4.2 rebounds ahead of Fridays game against the Knicks.His biggest issue?A general inability to defend more mobile centers.Mozgov sees the future of his position every night, and it is a problem.Consider that 23 percent of all the field goals attempted by 7-footers through Wednesdays games were 3-pointers, an increase from 14.6 percent last season and 8.9 percent in 2015-16.Less than 1 percent of 7-footers shots were 3-pointers as recently as 2000-1, according to N.B.A.Advanced Stats.Enter Mozgov, who may need to develop a consistent deep jumper to stay in the Nets rotation.His shot is a work in progress.Through the first five games of the regular season, Mozgov has attempted three 3-pointers, sinking one in a loss to the Orlando Magic on Tuesday.Thats where the league is going, Nets forward Quincy Acy said.Mozgov understands that he does not have carte blanche to chuck 3-pointers.As he put it, Its not like Ill be on the 3-point line all game.But he will pick his spots.In the preseason, he made two of three attempts from 3-point range.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Nice, right?he said.Despite Prokhorovs assurances, there was little statistical evidence coming into the season that Mozgov could knock down 3-pointers.He had attempted 40 of them through his first seven seasons in the league and made just seven.But Atkinson noticed that Mozgov had a soft touch on a high release.And with the Lakers last season, he shot 44.6 percent on jumpers that ranged from 16 feet out to the 3-point line at 23 feet 9 inches, according to N.B.A.Advanced Stats.But in the age of analytics, midrange jumpers are about as popular as two-week road trips.Rather than have his players take long 2-pointers, Atkinson would prefer that they shoot from behind the 3-point arc and that now includes Mozgov.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Might as well, Atkinson said.Atkinson delivered this news to Mozgov on the day of his introductory news conference in June.The directive was coming from above.The owner told me to tell you that, Atkinson recalled telling him.Mozgov tends to be impassive.But Atkinson said he could sense that Mozgov was thrilled by this development.His teammates could, too.If youre a big guy like Timo, all most coaches want you to do is just score on the block, bang, get rebounds and set screens, the reserve guard Joe Harris said.So when the coach finally gives you some freedom, its like you have a whole new perspective.Atkinson also thinks of the 3-pointer as a motivational tool.I do think theres an element of that, Atkinson said.Like, Hey, Timmy, if you defend and rebound, well let you take a 3 once in a while.But hes really embraced it.There are limits.During a preseason game, Mozgov received a pass just in front of the 3-point line.He was open and wanted to shoot, but he realized he was in the midrange no-mans land.So he took a step-back dribble and fired a 3-point attempt.It was off the mark.Atkinson advised him not to do that again.Kennys like, Well, I give him the freedom to shoot 3s but not step-back 3s, Harris said.I dont think he wants anyone taking step-back 3s.In truth, Prokhorov hardly needed to sell Atkinson on the idea of letting another of his players drift behind the 3-point line.Last season, the Nets ranked fourth in the league in 3-point attempts, and Atkinson broadcast his affinity for the shot by giving the green light to the one player on the roster who seemed the least likely to take them: Lopez.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In his first eight seasons with the Nets, Lopez shot a total of 31 3-point attempts.But last season, Atkinson encouraged him to add the occasional 3-pointer to his repertoire.To suggest that Lopez was receptive would be an understatement.He took it and ran with it, Atkinson said.Lopez took a team-high 387 3-pointer attempts that season and made a respectable 34.6 percent of them.I think Timmy will be more measured, Atkinson said.Mozgov was asked if teammates had offered pointers.Just make it, he said.Simple.Mozgov often concludes a practice by taking dozens of 3-pointers with the help of assistant coaches who rebound for him.As he works his way around the arc, he forces himself to make 7 of 10 attempts before he moves on to the next spot.He can sense gradual improvement.His future may depend on it.
N.F.L. Predictions: Cowboys Over Redskins; Steelers Over Lions:::::Detroits defense is not nearly as crisp as Pittsburghs, but it can be just as opportunistic.If Roethlisberger is at all careless with his passes, Detroit will make him pay for it.Golden Tates being limited, or possibly inactive, with a sprained AC joint takes some jolt out of the Lions offense, but this should be a close game.Pick: Steelers 49ers at Eagles, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Eagles by 13 The 49ers (0-7) are very bad.The Eagles (6-1) are very good.It is not hard to predict that Philadelphia will take care of business at home against a winless opponent, but a spread of 13 points is demanding a blowout, and San Franciscos plucky young defense may be up to the task of preventing that from happening.As good as the Eagles have been, they have kept things close in four of their six wins, and they have little reason to try to run up the score against an overmatched opponent.Pick: 49ers Texans at Seahawks, 4:05 p.m., CBS Line: Seahawks by 5.5 Thanks to the emergence of Deshaun Watson, the Texans (3-3) have averaged 39.3 points a game over the last four weeks.The hype has been deafening, but in reality, he has yet to face a very challenging defense.That ends this week, as the Seahawks (4-2) are the type of team that has the combination of talent and veteran know-how to truly mess with a rookie quarterbacks mind.A victory might be too much to ask for, but Watson is talented enough to keep things close, making a 5.5-point spread a bit too generous.Pick: Texans Cowboys at Redskins, 4:25 p.m., Fox Line: Cowboys by 2 This game could be Ezekiel Elliotts last one for quite some time, as he has a court hearing on Monday that could determine the fate of his six-game suspension.Elliott seemed to be buckling under the weight of the looming punishment at the start of the season, but he has looked like his old self in the last two weeks, and it is no coincidence that the Cowboys (3-3) have righted the ship along the way.At a glance, the Redskins (3-3) seem to have a good run defense, but they have allowed so few yards because teams have chosen not to run against them, which wont be the case with Dallas in town.Pick: Cowboys Second-Tier Matchups Photo Bears at Saints, 1 p.m. Fox Line: Saints by 9 Relying on your teams defense to do all the scoring is not a sustainable strategy in the N.F.L., but that is what has been working for the Bears (3-4) in the Mitchell Trubisky era.The rookie quarterback has done almost nothing notable, averaging 116 passing yards per game, but has a 2-1 record despite having thrown just two touchdown passes in a three-game stretch in which his teams defense scored three.The Saints (4-2) are a tough team to play defense against, especially at home, but if Chicagos surge on that side of the ball has not been a mirage, it should be able to beat a 9-point spread.Pick: Bears Raiders at Bills, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Bills by 2.5 There is nothing like crushing a well-regarded division rival to lift the spirits of a flailing team, and the Raiders (3-4) did just that with a come-from-behind win against Kansas City.Derek Carr returned to his 2016 form just in time to lead a game-winning drive.Unfortunately for Carr, the Bills (4-2) have a habit of making opponents miserable, and they can likely gut out an ugly win.With Marshawn Lynch suspended, Oakland will have a hard time controlling the clock.Pick: Bills Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Chargers at Patriots, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Patriots by 7 This game will serve as an indication of whether the Patriots (5-2) fixed their problems in the secondary last week, or if Atlanta simply was not good enough to take advantage of New Englands biggest weakness.Philip Rivers does not have the same confidence problems that the Falcons have been dealing with, so he will probably challenge New England early and often.If this game were in Los Angeles, the Chargers (3-4) would stand a better chance, but the Patriots are incredibly tough to beat at home.Pick: Patriots Panthers at Buccaneers, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Buccaneers by 2.5 Cam Newton has had two brutal games in a row.He has completed just 57 percent of his passes, and his five interceptions matched his total from the first five games combined.But watching the Panthers (4-3), it is easy to feel sorry for Newton as he is brutalized on play after play.Even the successful plays many of which have come with Newton running rather than passing end with big hits.The big quarterback rarely has extended stretches of ineffectiveness, and an important division game against the equally-struggling Buccaneers (2-4) should bring out the best in him.Pick: Panthers Advertisement Continue reading the main story Bottom-Tier Games Photo Dolphins at Ravens, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday), CBS and NFL Network Line: Ravens by 3 Cameron Wake, a defensive end for the Dolphins (4-2), managed to sum up Thursday Night Football in one convenient quotation.He told reporters this week: To be very honest, nobody is going to be ready the way they like to be.Theyll be as ready as you can be on Thursday night.With Matt Moore expected to start for the injured Jay Cutler, Miamis offense will run through the teams running back, Jay Ajayi, and that spells trouble for the Ravens (3-4), as they are ranked last in rushing yards allowed per game.Pick: Dolphins Vikings vs. Browns at London, 9:30 a.m., NFL Network Line: Vikings by 9.5 The Browns (0-7) will play their first game without tackle Joe Thomas since 2006, so Spencer Drango, a second-year player out of Baylor, will be protecting DeShone Kizers blind side against a Minnesota defense that is tied for sixth in sacks, with 21.It is understandable for the Vikings (5-2) to be road favorites in the neutral site of Londons Twickenham Stadium, but a spread of nearly 10 points is a lot to ask for from an underwhelming Minnesota offense.Pick: Browns Falcons at Jets, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Falcons by 5 The Jets (3-4) followed a three-game winning streak with consecutive losses, but they played well in both games and lost them by a combined 10 points.They go into every game with a talent deficit, but Coach Todd Bowles has had them focused and prepared each week.There is no reason the Falcons (3-3) shouldnt mop the floor with them based on personnel, but the same thing was true in their recent losses to Miami and Buffalo.Unless the team has figured out what has been holding its offense back, this game could be close.Pick: Jets Colts at Bengals, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Bengals by 10.5 Jacoby Brissett endured a beating last week that few other quarterbacks have.He was sacked or hit on 31 of his teams 67 plays, and the Colts (2-5) spent the week arguing about whether it was appropriate for T. Y. Hilton, a wide receiver, to blame his teams offensive line for the blowout loss.The Bengals (2-4) do not have the players to replicate Jacksonvilles savagery, but they will try.A point spread of 10.5 points is enormous, but the Colts have lost by more than that in three of the last five weeks, with the other two games being wins against the two worst teams in the N.F.L.Pick: Bengals Mondays Matchup Broncos at Chiefs, 8:30 p.m., ESPN Line: Chiefs by 7 The Broncos (3-3) scored 42 points in Week 2, and in the four games since, they have also scored 42 points combined.The Chiefs (5-2) are a division rival that not only has more talent than Denver, and home-field advantage, but also the motivation of having lost two close games in a row after a 5-0 start.Denvers defense can probably limit Alex Smith and the Chiefs to a few touchdowns and a bunch of field goals, but that should be plenty to outscore Trevor Siemian and the Denver offense.Pick: Chiefs.
Manfred Makes His Choice: Punish Gurriel, but Leave the World Series Alone:::::Obviously, Manfred said, World Series games are different than regular-season games.Among the other reasons Manfred cited for delaying the suspension, this stands out: I felt it was unfair to punish the other 24 players on the Astros roster, he said.I wanted the burden of this discipline to fall primarily on the wrongdoer.Denying Gurriel a chance to help his team in the World Series would have severely affected him.It would also have allowed a fleeting gesture an ugly one, for sure, but one that was done in the dugout, not on the field, and that did not appear to be premeditated to unduly influence the World Series.And yet, given that reasoning by Manfred, these tough words from him on Saturday There is no place in our game for the behavior or any behavior like the behavior we witnessed last night seem somewhat contradictory.Gurriel, after all, is still playing.But Manfred was right in saying that World Series games are far more significant than a midseason game for the Oakland As or the Toronto Blue Jays.Maybe that sounds crass, but there is no disputing it.And while Manfred would not declare five games as the new standard price for intolerant words or actions during a game he said he would deal with each situation on its own merits the penalty for Gurriel does exceed all recent punishments, including the three-game ban given to Yunel Escobar, then of Toronto, for wearing eye black inscribed with an anti-gay slur in 2012.Gurriel, for his part, said after Fridays game that he was surprised by the furor over his gesture.He mentioned his experiences in Japan he played for the Yokohama BayStars in 2014 and said that he respected Japanese people.I did not want to offend anybody, he said through an interpreter.As for his characterization of Darvish as a chinito, a word that can be demeaning to Asians, Gurriel said that in Cuba, the term applies to anyone who is Asian, not just to Japanese people, although that did not amount to much of an excuse.Photo In any case, he added that he understood he was wrong.In a statement on Saturday, Gurriel apologized to Darvish and called his gesture indefensible.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Not surprisingly, both managers in the Series were asked to comment on Gurriel and his punishment.We support everything thats right about this game, and well move forward, if everyone will allow us to, Astros Manager A. J. Hinch said.Knowing Yuli, knowing what he will do to convince everyone that this incident was not in his heart, will be key.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts, who was born in Japan and whose mother is Japanese, said he approved of the way Manfred had handled the incident.Gurriel, who was batting .340 in the postseason and was in the starting lineup for Game 4, has delivered on his promise since the Astros signed him for five years and $47.5 million after he defected last year.He made a smooth transition from third base to first while batting .299 with 18 homers, 75 runs batted in and 43 doubles this season.Hes a great hitter, said Jose Altuve, the Astros star second baseman, one of the best Ive ever seen, to be honest with you.It was, officially, Gurriels rookie season.But at 33 years old, after playing professionally for 15 seasons in Cuba and Japan, Gurriel is a rookie in name only.He comes from a prominent baseball family in Cuba, and spent most of his prime years there.I could have left at 22 or something like other players and spent their entire careers here and maybe that would have been better, Gurriel said in Spanish at a workout in Los Angeles on Monday.But no, I dont regret it.I had the chance to play my entire life in Cuba and enjoy those great moments, and the chance to play in Japan.God wanted me to be here in this moment now, and Im enjoying this.The Astros have such a deep offense that their leader in runs batted in, Marwin Gonzalez, batted eighth in Game 3.That suits Gurriel, who said he felt pressure to carry his Cuban teams but does not have the same feeling here.In Cuba, if I didnt hit, I lost, he said.If I did hit, it was normal and what I was supposed to do.So it was really hard to please people.Its been different here in this lineup.At the same group interview in which he made those comments, Gurriel was asked a question by a Japanese reporter.He answered with a few words in Japanese before continuing in Spanish.I identified a lot with the Japanese public, Gurriel said.It was a really great experience.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yet with one gesture on Friday, Gurriel turned what should have been an experience to celebrate into something much different.And left Manfred to untangle it.
How the Big Ten Got Back to the Top of College Football:::::Meanwhile, the SEC was exploiting its home states booms in population and in football prospects and plowing unprecedented cable television revenue into higher coaching salaries, bigger stadiums and better facilities.Elsewhere, upstarts like Baylor and Oregon developed innovative offensive schemes that would go on to change the way many teams in other conferences played.The SEC is not exactly going anywhere Alabama is having one of the great runs of success in college football history but any fair assessment of the landscape would suggest that the Big Ten is challenging for the distinction of being the top league.Four Big Ten teams are ranked in this weeks Associated Press Top 25 three are in the top six with a fifth, Michigan, likely to make its way back in.Purdue has its most promising coach in a decade, Jeff Brohm, and Minnesota and Maryland recently hired two of the most coveted young coaches, P. J. Fleck and D. J. Durkin.In the three years of the four-team College Football Playoff, the Big Ten has always had a contender something that cannot be said of the Big 12 or the Pacific-12.And that national title drought?It ended in the 2014 season, which was capped by Ohio States victories over Alabama and Oregon in the inaugural College Football Playoff.In many ways, the Big Ten has ridden the same characteristics that delivered Baker to Columbus: good coaching, stability, recruiting prowess and luck.Baker switched his college commitment in the fall of 2014 when it became likely that Florida would change head coaches.It helped that Ohio States Meyer and his staff, according to Baker, never gave up on me.Florida was going in their own direction, Baker said in a recent interview.I loved Florida.For my future, it wasnt the best option.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Big Ten was never going to be down forever.Its biggest teams are too prestigious, and its fan bases too large and too valuable to broadcasters.It presciently introduced the Big Ten Network a decade ago, and new television contracts that bring in $240 million a year solidified its place as the richest conference in college sports (challenged only, of course, by the SEC).Photo But the arrivals of several pedigreed coaches Meyer, who joined Ohio State in 2012; James Franklin, who departed Vanderbilt, of the SEC, for Penn State before the 2014 season; and Jim Harbaugh, the Michigan alumnus who returned to Ann Arbor for the 2015 season created a rising tide that lifted all boats and changed the way the Big Ten did business.The influx of new, very strong coaches coming into the league, some emphasizing recruiting and in some cases national recruiting, made everyone in the league pick up their game, said Barry Alvarez, Wisconsins athletic director and former football coach.Meyer initially ruffled feathers in the Big Ten with recruiting tactics that, while not illicit, were aggressive by conference standards.In Bakers case, Meyers staff was polite and respectful but firm in insisting that Baker, even after he had committed to Florida, would always have a home in Columbus.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.He came from an environment where recruiting was 365 days a year and hostile and competitive, the ESPN analyst Todd Blackledge, an Ohio native and a former Penn State quarterback, said of Meyer.And he came into the Big Ten and he maintained that type of recruiting, Blackledge added, and some of the coaches in that league werent used to that.Meyer responded to the criticism not by relenting but by urging rival coaches to match his efforts, telling a radio host that the conference needed to keep pushing that envelope to be better.Said Blackledge: He forced other teams in that league to raise their level to keep up with him.High school prospects noticed that the Big Ten was cool again, according to Josh Helmholdt, a Midwest-based reporter for Rivals.com, which covers college recruiting.When you have those teams recruiting better and the Big Ten being a brighter star, he said, then the rest of the conference also improves in terms of their national appeal and brand.One way for the Big Ten to sustain its current level of competitiveness might be not to buy into the hype that it has become this competitive.Restrained expectations, whether deriving from fallow seasons or from a stereotypically gentle Midwestern outlook, can actually be an asset in a landscape where programs in other conferences are all too quick to cut bait on underperforming coaches (for instance, Florida, which is still paying Will Muschamp, the coach who initially persuaded Baker to go to Gainesville, even as he coaches South Carolina, a division rival of the Gators).Advertisement Continue reading the main story I see a lot of movement in the Southeastern Conference, Alvarez said.He recalled speaking to a local fan club of one SEC team a couple of years ago and thinking: This is tough.One loss, and theyre about ready to run someone out of town.By contrast, programs like Iowa and Michigan State have stood by their highly regarded coaches, Kirk Ferentz and Mark Dantonio, through subpar seasons that might have doomed them elsewhere.Bob Lattinville, an agent with the Spencer Fane firm, suggested that the Big Tens previous lows were directly related to its current highs.In 2014, maybe the shine had come off, he said.That can be helpful, in the sense that if your fan bases expectations arent out of whack, or your biggest booster isnt threatening to withhold a check, thats helpful.For now, the Big Ten will bask in its success.And after Saturday, Baker could take pleasure in a big win and in Barkleys limited success.After returning the opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown, Barkley rushed for a 36-yard score but ended up with 44 yards on 21 carries.Hes getting all this praise, Baker said of Barkley ahead of the game.To me, thats a real challenge and real accomplishment its like, Im going against the best.

Texans Owner Bob McNair Apologizes Again and Meets With His Team:::::Players across the N.F.L.have reacted strongly to McNairs inmates remark, some of them suggesting they would never play for the Texans.The conflict came at a critical time for the N.F.L., which has been in talks with players to address some of the concerns that led them to abstain from standing for the anthem, including racial injustice and, more specifically, the treatment of African-Americans by the police and the criminal justice system.A handful of owners and players have met in recent weeks to see if the league can help support the players in their causes.Under withering criticism from President Trump and from many fans, the owners are also eager for the players to consistently stand during the anthem.The players and owners may meet again Monday or Tuesday, but there has been confusion about the location, the agenda and whether Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who last season started the practice of not standing for the anthem, will attend.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Kaepernicks lawyer said Saturday that Kaepernick had not received an invitation to the meeting.Its obvious that Colin is being invoked for purposes other than playing football, the lawyer, Mark Geragos, said in an interview.Everyone seems to have an agenda other than putting Colin on the football field.Officials at the N.F.L.said it was up to the players to invite him.The players union, which is helping coordinate the meeting, said it was not even sure it would take place and had not firmed up a guest list.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Saturday, Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Malcolm Jenkins, who has been active in the talks, invited McNair, Commissioner Roger Goodell and Kaepernick to meet in Philadelphia, according to ESPN.Eric Reid, a safety on the 49ers who knelt with Kaepernick during the anthem last season, and has also participated in talks with the league, was also confused by Jenkinss invitation because he, too, was unaware of any meeting in Philadelphia.Im not sure why a press release was sent out saying theres a meeting when theres no confirmation the N.F.L.would attend the meeting, Reid said.There needs to be better communication.Kaepernicks attendance would be noteworthy.Now a free agent, he has been unable to secure a new contract from another team.This month, he filed a grievance in which he claimed the owners had colluded to keep him out of the league.
Texans Owner Bob McNair Apologizes for Inmates Remark:::::Photo Houston Texans owner Bob McNair apologized on Friday for a remark he made last week about inmates running the prison if N.F.L.owners allowed players to continue to sit or kneel during the national anthem, but the apology appears to have done little to appease his own players.McNair made the comment among a handful of other owners who were together at a New York hotel after a meeting with about a dozen players, many of them African-Americans who have demonstrated during the anthem to highlight a lack of attention to racial oppression.The players and owners were seeking common ground on the issue when they met at the N.F.L.headquarters in Manhattan.When a group of owners later discussed whether the league ought to clamp down on the protests, McNair suggested it should, because we cant have the inmates running the prison.The comment, which ESPN reported, was taken as insensitive and demeaning to the players.I never meant to offend anyone, and I was not referring to our players, McNair said in a statement on Friday.I used a figure of speech that was never intended to be taken literally.I would never characterize our players or our league that way, and I apologize to anyone who was offended by it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some players on the Texans, though, were having a hard time accepting McNairs apology.They considered walking out of practice on Friday, and one player, DeAndre Hopkins, did not attend, according to The Houston Chronicle.
N.F.L. Predictions: Cowboys Over Redskins; Steelers Over Lions:::::Detroits defense is not nearly as crisp as Pittsburghs, but it can be just as opportunistic.If Roethlisberger is at all careless with his passes, Detroit will make him pay for it.Golden Tates being limited, or possibly inactive, with a sprained AC joint takes some jolt out of the Lions offense, but this should be a close game.Pick: Steelers 49ers at Eagles, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Eagles by 13 The 49ers (0-7) are very bad.The Eagles (6-1) are very good.It is not hard to predict that Philadelphia will take care of business at home against a winless opponent, but a spread of 13 points is demanding a blowout, and San Franciscos plucky young defense may be up to the task of preventing that from happening.As good as the Eagles have been, they have kept things close in four of their six wins, and they have little reason to try to run up the score against an overmatched opponent.Pick: 49ers Texans at Seahawks, 4:05 p.m., CBS Line: Seahawks by 5.5 Thanks to the emergence of Deshaun Watson, the Texans (3-3) have averaged 39.3 points a game over the last four weeks.The hype has been deafening, but in reality, he has yet to face a very challenging defense.That ends this week, as the Seahawks (4-2) are the type of team that has the combination of talent and veteran know-how to truly mess with a rookie quarterbacks mind.A victory might be too much to ask for, but Watson is talented enough to keep things close, making a 5.5-point spread a bit too generous.Pick: Texans Cowboys at Redskins, 4:25 p.m., Fox Line: Cowboys by 2 This game could be Ezekiel Elliotts last one for quite some time, as he has a court hearing on Monday that could determine the fate of his six-game suspension.Elliott seemed to be buckling under the weight of the looming punishment at the start of the season, but he has looked like his old self in the last two weeks, and it is no coincidence that the Cowboys (3-3) have righted the ship along the way.At a glance, the Redskins (3-3) seem to have a good run defense, but they have allowed so few yards because teams have chosen not to run against them, which wont be the case with Dallas in town.Pick: Cowboys Second-Tier Matchups Photo Bears at Saints, 1 p.m. Fox Line: Saints by 9 Relying on your teams defense to do all the scoring is not a sustainable strategy in the N.F.L., but that is what has been working for the Bears (3-4) in the Mitchell Trubisky era.The rookie quarterback has done almost nothing notable, averaging 116 passing yards per game, but has a 2-1 record despite having thrown just two touchdown passes in a three-game stretch in which his teams defense scored three.The Saints (4-2) are a tough team to play defense against, especially at home, but if Chicagos surge on that side of the ball has not been a mirage, it should be able to beat a 9-point spread.Pick: Bears Raiders at Bills, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Bills by 2.5 There is nothing like crushing a well-regarded division rival to lift the spirits of a flailing team, and the Raiders (3-4) did just that with a come-from-behind win against Kansas City.Derek Carr returned to his 2016 form just in time to lead a game-winning drive.Unfortunately for Carr, the Bills (4-2) have a habit of making opponents miserable, and they can likely gut out an ugly win.With Marshawn Lynch suspended, Oakland will have a hard time controlling the clock.Pick: Bills Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Chargers at Patriots, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Patriots by 7 This game will serve as an indication of whether the Patriots (5-2) fixed their problems in the secondary last week, or if Atlanta simply was not good enough to take advantage of New Englands biggest weakness.Philip Rivers does not have the same confidence problems that the Falcons have been dealing with, so he will probably challenge New England early and often.If this game were in Los Angeles, the Chargers (3-4) would stand a better chance, but the Patriots are incredibly tough to beat at home.Pick: Patriots Panthers at Buccaneers, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Buccaneers by 2.5 Cam Newton has had two brutal games in a row.He has completed just 57 percent of his passes, and his five interceptions matched his total from the first five games combined.But watching the Panthers (4-3), it is easy to feel sorry for Newton as he is brutalized on play after play.Even the successful plays many of which have come with Newton running rather than passing end with big hits.The big quarterback rarely has extended stretches of ineffectiveness, and an important division game against the equally-struggling Buccaneers (2-4) should bring out the best in him.Pick: Panthers Advertisement Continue reading the main story Bottom-Tier Games Photo Dolphins at Ravens, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday), CBS and NFL Network Line: Ravens by 3 Cameron Wake, a defensive end for the Dolphins (4-2), managed to sum up Thursday Night Football in one convenient quotation.He told reporters this week: To be very honest, nobody is going to be ready the way they like to be.Theyll be as ready as you can be on Thursday night.With Matt Moore expected to start for the injured Jay Cutler, Miamis offense will run through the teams running back, Jay Ajayi, and that spells trouble for the Ravens (3-4), as they are ranked last in rushing yards allowed per game.Pick: Dolphins Vikings vs. Browns at London, 9:30 a.m., NFL Network Line: Vikings by 9.5 The Browns (0-7) will play their first game without tackle Joe Thomas since 2006, so Spencer Drango, a second-year player out of Baylor, will be protecting DeShone Kizers blind side against a Minnesota defense that is tied for sixth in sacks, with 21.It is understandable for the Vikings (5-2) to be road favorites in the neutral site of Londons Twickenham Stadium, but a spread of nearly 10 points is a lot to ask for from an underwhelming Minnesota offense.Pick: Browns Falcons at Jets, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Falcons by 5 The Jets (3-4) followed a three-game winning streak with consecutive losses, but they played well in both games and lost them by a combined 10 points.They go into every game with a talent deficit, but Coach Todd Bowles has had them focused and prepared each week.There is no reason the Falcons (3-3) shouldnt mop the floor with them based on personnel, but the same thing was true in their recent losses to Miami and Buffalo.Unless the team has figured out what has been holding its offense back, this game could be close.Pick: Jets Colts at Bengals, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Bengals by 10.5 Jacoby Brissett endured a beating last week that few other quarterbacks have.He was sacked or hit on 31 of his teams 67 plays, and the Colts (2-5) spent the week arguing about whether it was appropriate for T. Y. Hilton, a wide receiver, to blame his teams offensive line for the blowout loss.The Bengals (2-4) do not have the players to replicate Jacksonvilles savagery, but they will try.A point spread of 10.5 points is enormous, but the Colts have lost by more than that in three of the last five weeks, with the other two games being wins against the two worst teams in the N.F.L.Pick: Bengals Mondays Matchup Broncos at Chiefs, 8:30 p.m., ESPN Line: Chiefs by 7 The Broncos (3-3) scored 42 points in Week 2, and in the four games since, they have also scored 42 points combined.The Chiefs (5-2) are a division rival that not only has more talent than Denver, and home-field advantage, but also the motivation of having lost two close games in a row after a 5-0 start.Denvers defense can probably limit Alex Smith and the Chiefs to a few touchdowns and a bunch of field goals, but that should be plenty to outscore Trevor Siemian and the Denver offense.Pick: Chiefs.
Fantasy Football: Who to Start in N.F.L. Week 8:::::Carson Wentz (PHI vs. 49ers) Few have ever doubted Wentzs potential, but even fewer expected him to be among the best fantasy quarterbacks so far this season.He has 11 passing touchdowns over his last three games, and only four interceptions on the season.His 21.7 F.P.P.G.is fourth best for his position, and this week he takes on the 49ers, who have yielded 24.0 F.P.P.G.to quarterbacks over the last five weeks and the second most total on the season.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Also consider: Andy Dalton (CIN vs. Colts) Running Back LeGarrette Blount (PHI vs. 49ers) It has not always been pretty for Blount this season, particularly last week, when it took him 14 carries to earn 29 rushing yards.But he has been a borderline RB2/Flex option when you look at his entire season, averaging 8.3 F.P.P.G., good for 25th among running backs.He should be a very solid RB2 this week against the 49ers, who are even worse against opposing running backs than they are against quarterbacks.Eight backs have topped 10 fantasy points against them in seven games, and theyve given up a shocking 26.4 F.P.P.G.to the position this season.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Melvin Gordon (LAC at Patriots) He has looked like the RB1 that fantasy owners drafted him as for most of this season: His total of 14.9 F.P.P.G.is sixth best among running backs.He had only two poor performances, including last weeks against the Broncos (4.4 fantasy points).He should get back on track in a big way against the Patriots, who have not only allowed the fourth most rushing yards, but also the second most receiving yards, to running backs, and 20.4 F.P.P.G.to the position.Also consider: Jay Ajayi (MIA vs.Jets) Wide Receiver Kelvin Benjamin (CAR at Buccaneers) After a rocky start, Benjamin has been the eighth best fantasy receiver over the last four weeks (9.7 F.P.P.G.), even with last weeks rough game against the Bears (three catches for 65 yards).The Buccaneers offer an excellent opportunity for Benjamin to right the ship, as six receivers have topped 10 fantasy points in their six games played.Over all, their 28.4 F.P.P.G.yielded to the receiver position is the second most.If youre still not convinced, Benjamin will line up opposite to cornerback Robert McClain, who is the lowest rated player of the teams entire starting defense, according to ProFootballFocus.com.Demaryius Thomas (DEN at Chiefs) If any player is due to score a touchdown this week, it is Thomas, who has gone 12 consecutive games without one, dating to last season.But he is still averaging 8.4 targets per game this season, and his teammate Emmanuel Sanders might miss a second game in a row with an ankle injury.The Chiefs, despite the presence of the star cornerback Marcus Peters, have allowed the most fantasy points to the position in 2017 (30.4 F.P.P.G.)Also consider: Keenan Allen (LAC at Patriots); Nelson Agholor (PHI vs. 49ers) Tight End Jason Witten (DAL vs. Redskins) With six teams on a bye this week, Witten makes for an excellent streaming option against the Redskins, who have allowed a touchdown to the position in three of the last four games and the second most F.P.P.G.(11.7) over all.Witten has quietly been one of the better fantasy tight ends this season, with his 7.4 F.P.P.G.the eighth best so far this season.Also consider: Kyle Rudolph (MIN at Browns) Defense/Special Teams MIN at Browns; NO vs. Bears Kicker Jake Elliott (PHI vs. 49ers); Steven Hauschka (BUF vs. OAK).
Chris Borland Blasts N.F.L. for Hiding C.T.E. Risks:::::Photo Chris Borland shocked the sports world when he left the N.F.L.after his rookie season, saying the long-term health risks of playing football were not worth it.Now, Borland is going further, appearing in a public service announcement that denounces the N.F.L.for hiding the risks of catastrophic brain damage.In the announcement, Borland discusses his decision to leave the N.F.L., and how the league spent years trying to play down and discredit research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease known as C.T.E.that is linked to repeated head trauma.In the one-minute spot, which is now online and will be shown on various television channels, Borland said that the leagues efforts to suppress the risks of the disease is especially sad when you think about the fact that there are 5-year-old kids out there playing tackle football.Advertisement Continue reading the main story N.F.L.Commissioner Roger Goodell has said repeatedly that dozens of rules changes have made the game of football safer than ever before.The league has also committed to spending tens of millions of dollars to develop safer equipment and to pay for research into the effects of playing the game.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The N.F.L.did not immediately return a call for comment.Borland, who played one standout season as a linebacker with the San Francisco 49ers before abruptly leaving the league, is working with the Union of Concerned Scientists, an activist group of independent scientists who cite the N.F.L.in its Disinformation Playbook, a new website exposing the ways that some companies and trade associations sideline science.According to the group, the N.F.L.attacked the facts about concussions and C.T.E.similar to the ways the tobacco industry, fossil fuel companies and the makers of sugary sodas try to obscure health consequences of their products.
Two Teams, One Anthem: An N.F.L. Showdown:::::In fact, the vast majority of N.F.L.players chose the Cowboys way when it came to the anthem on Sunday, suggesting enthusiasm for mixing football and politics is waning.Eleven owners met with players and officials from the league and the players union last week to find a graceful way out of the impasse.Notably absent was Jones.He holds close two statistics: How many players are protesting and what the demonstrations are doing to the bottom line.Through Week 6, the N.F.L.is down slightly in TV ratings, though that can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the continuing decline of cable television subscribers.Last month, after President Trump called for any son of a bitch who knelt during the anthem to be fired, several owners stood with their teams for the anthem.None was as calculating as Jones.He linked arms with his team and knelt, then all rose before the anthem played.No matter.Jones said that the team office was inundated with calls, emails and letters objecting to the gesture.Photo Jones may have been in an ebullient mood after the game Sunday, giving atta-boys to his players for the rout that brought the Cowboys to 3-3.He was expansive on the three-touchdown performance of running back Ezekiel Elliott, who won a temporary injunction to hold off his six-game suspension by the N.F.L.for his role in a domestic-violence case.Still, the anthem controversy was on his mind.There is no question the league is suffering negative effects from this protest, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Trump on Monday tried to keep the fires burning, sending out a tweet that said, Two dozen N.F.L.players continue to kneel during the National Anthem, showing total disrespect to our Flag & Country.No leadership in NFL!What he overlooks is that over the past year, N.F.L.players have sustained a national dialogue about social justice that often only briefly pops up after police shootings or society-rending riots.Whether you like it or not, the N.F.L is among the most watched pieces of entertainment on the planet, with a massive platform.Many players have used it to provide poignant moments.The Seahawks Michael Bennett brought a military wife to tears of understanding as he exchanged views with veterans outside the gates of the teams practice complex.His teammate Doug Baldwin Jr. joined N.F.L.Commissioner Roger Goodell in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman in support of the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2017.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Steelers Alejandro Villanueva, a West Point graduate with a Bronze Star for valor as a platoon leader in Afghanistan, memorably stood by himself with his hand over his heart during the anthem as his team waited off field.He then movingly explained why he could not turn his back on the flag and apologized to his teammates for botching the teams plans and making them look bad.None of it has done much good for Kaepernick or the team that he once took to the Super Bowl.Last week, he filed a complaint against the N.F.L., accusing all 32 teams of colluding to keep him out of the league.He is an activist now and has more than likely kissed away whatever slim chance he had to play in the N.F.L again.On Sunday, there were plenty of empty seats here and about half the filled ones were inhabited by fans wearing the blue and white of the Cowboys.Levis Stadium hasnt been a popular home for the 49ers since opening in 2014.Fans complain that the tickets are too expensive and the commute is too far from San Francisco.Still, it was a jarring sight on an afternoon that San Francisco legend Joe Montana and more than 30 members of the 49ers Super Bowl winning teams were here at halftime to honor another icon, Dwight Clark, who is battling the neurological disease A.L.S.It was Montana and Clark who teamed up for The Catch in 1982, one of the most famous plays in N.F.L history, a 6-yard pass in the back of the end zone in the final minute to beat the Cowboys and advance to the Super Bowl.Those glory days seem like ancient history.In the locker room after the game, Kaepernick and social awareness meant little to a winless and beaten up team.C. J. Beathard, the rookie quarterback who was sacked five times, summed up the 49ers season like a 10-year veteran.Sure, it was a massacre, but hardly a last stand.Yeah, we are 0-7.Theres only one way to go, and thats up, he told reporters.And weve got a lot of season left ahead of us to get better, turn the season around and make something out of it.
Throw 7 Passes. Complete 4. Win Game.:::::Photo The Chicago Bears beat the Panthers on Sunday, 17-3, and they did it with an unconventional game plan.The rookie quarterback Mitchell Trubiskys final line was eyebrow-raising: 7 passes attempted, 4 completed.It was the fewest passes attempted in a winning effort in the N.F.L.since 2006, when the Panthers Chris Weinke also was 4 for 7, in a 10-3 win over the Falcons.It was the fewest completions in a win since 2011, when Tim Tebow was completed 2 of 8 passes in a 17-10 Broncos win over the Chiefs.What do all three games have in common?The head coach of the winning team was John Fox.Fox is not totally averse to the forward pass: He also coached Peyton Manning for three years in Denver.But there have been many not-quite-ready quarterbacks thrust into starting roles over the years, and only Fox steered them away from passing to such an extreme.And successfully.In Weinkes first game filling in for an injured Jake Delhomme in 2006, Fox let him throw 61 passes.In his next start he threw 28.After those games, both losses, Fox dialed all the way back for the seven-pass game.It resulted in Weinkes second career win, and first in five years.Delhomme returned the next week, and Weinke never won another game in the league.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Tebow, who replaced the Denver starter Kyle Orton in 2011, was never a prolific passer, averaging 24 passes a start that season.But he never had a game quite like that 2-for-8 effort.It worked though, and was the second game in a six-game winning streak that helped the Broncos into the playoffs
The Seahawks Are a Little Dysfunctional. Theyre O.K. With That.:::::For much of the first half Sunday, Seattles offense was inept and bungling.And, of course, that led to a scuffle on the sideline.What would a Seahawks football game be without at least a little chaos on the bench?With Seahawks down by 4 points in the second quarter, a meeting of players from the sputtering offensive unit became heated, with receiver Doug Baldwin shoving the teams offensive line coach, Tom Cable, who had been addressing the players.Baldwin was shouting in the direction of his teammates not so much Cable and Pete Carroll, the head coach, came over in the middle of the episode, although no one appeared unnerved by the incident.Cable continued to talk to the players and Baldwin remained near his side.Apparently, the Seahawks are simply used to such displays.Doug is always fired up, Seattle wide receiver Paul Richardson said with a smile.He might have had an outburst but he went out and made plays.It was all to get us going, and it worked.Indeed, Baldwin caught a 22-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter that gave the Seahawks a lead they never relinquished.And Richardson was in the middle of a critical fourth-quarter sequence, wrestling for possession of the ball with the Pro Bowl safety Landon Collins after a pass into the Giants end zone.Collins and Richardson had something akin to simultaneous possession, which the game officials ruled to be a Seattle touchdown.The score and extra point put the Seahawks ahead by 17-7, which, given the current state of the Giants offense, amounted to an insurmountable lead.Photo The Giants gained just 177 yards Sunday and converted on only 2 of 12 third-down opportunities.A Seahawks turnover led to the Giants only touchdown.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Seattle receivers also dropped three passes, and quarterback Russell Wilson overthrew multiple targets on plays that could have resulted in touchdowns.The Seahawks also committed a staggering 15 penalties.It is failures like these that have many wondering, justifiably, what is wrong with the Seahawks.Yes, they have had some bad luck with injuries.But are they truly a championship contender if they struggled, even briefly, to overwhelm the immensely hobbled and downtrodden Giants?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.And is the sideline strife, however benign it might ultimately have been, a good thing?Seattle defensive lineman Michael Bennett conceded his team might confuse some fans.I dont know how to grade us right now, myself, Bennett said.But I dont have to.We take it week to week and we just won one more this week.Not surprisingly, Sherman is not worried.He saw a defense especially a deep, talented secondary that toyed with the Giants inexperienced wide receiving corps.Early in the game, Giants quarterback Eli Manning heaved a long, mighty pass toward Tavarres King, who was streaking down the right sideline.The football, spinning in a perfect, tight spiral, appeared destined for a touchdown, and King stretched out his arms within a few steps of the end zone.And then, in a flash, Sherman caught up with the descending football and flicked it away with one hand.Shermans play was almost a dismissive act, knocking down a deft pass inches from Kings hands.Just letting Eli know Im here, Sherman said.I was just saying that we werent going to let anything be caught deep.Not today.The Giants very rarely threw in Shermans direction again.Everybody should know the Seahawks are O.K., Sherman said.Of Baldwins eruption in the bench area, Sherman said it hardly raised an eyebrow on the team.To the outside world, its misunderstood, Sherman said.But we all look at the coaches as peers.Were in this together.Dougs not yelling at him, hes trying to be encouraging and trying to motivate everyone.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Sherman grinned.It gave a spark, he said.Its all good.
Justin Timberlake Will Perform in Super Bowl Halftime Show:::::Photo The N.F.L.will revisit its most controversial Super Bowl halftime show by having Justin Timberlake, the singer who participated in the infamous wardrobe malfunction of 2004, perform during Super Bowl LII.Timberlake, a Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter, became famous with the boy band N Sync before going on to solo success with hits like SexyBack, Cry Me a River and Rock Your Body.While he has largely transitioned to acting, Timberlake recently had another hit with Cant Stop the Feeling on the soundtrack for the animated movie Trolls.He also voiced the character Branch in the movie.Before his acting turn, Timberlake was part of the halftime shows for Super Bowls XXXV, in 2001, and XXXVIII, in 2004.At the performance for Super Bowl XXXVIII, which was held in Houston, he was on stage with Janet Jackson, and at the end of the performance he tore away part of Jacksons top.The incident, which was later described as a wardrobe malfunction, led to numerous complaints and a hefty fine by the F.C.C.The fine was eventually vacated by an appeals court.During an interview televised during NBCs Sunday Night Football broadcast, Mike Tirico asked Timberlake about whether the N.F.L.had addressed the incident with him.Timberlake smiled and said That wont happen this time.Timberlake continues the N.F.L.s trend toward courting a younger audience rather than going with older, safer performers.Other recent performers have included Lady Gaga, Beyonc, Bruno Mars and Katy Perry.
Jets Go From Rolling to Rolled in One Quarter Against Dolphins:::::Coach trusted me and the offense with that, McCown said, and we let him down.It was the second straight comeback victory for Miami (4-2), which overcame a 17-point deficit in the second half to beat Atlanta last week.The Dolphins have won 12 games in a row when the margin is seven or fewer points.The N.F.L.record for such a streak is 14 consecutive games.It sounds like a broken record, said defensive end Cameron Wake, who had two and a half sacks for the Dolphins, as they avenged a 20-6 loss to the Jets last month.Its a belief in one another.Weve been showing that over and over and over.Cutler left the game because of a chest injury with his team trailing 21-14 in the third quarter.After the Jets took a 28-14 lead on a 10-yard pass from McCown to Austin Seferian-Jenkins late in the period, Moore threw a pair of scoring passes to Kenny Stills to tie the game.That was fun, man, said Moore, who saw his first action of the season.Its always fun to get a win, and then when you can contribute and have a comeback like that, its fun for everybody.Against a defense that had not allowed more than 20 points in a game all season, McCown also threw for touchdowns of 29 yards to Kearse and 17 yards to Robby Anderson.Advertisement Continue reading the main story McCowns rushing touchdown came after an interception by Muhammad Wilkerson, the Jets 315-pound defensive lineman.With the Dolphins backed up at their 7-yard line during the second quarter, Wilkerson caught a pass that had been deflected by a blitzing Jamal Adams, and was tackled at the 1.McCown scored two plays later, giving the Jets a 21-14 halftime lead.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But the Jets were shut out over the final 16 minutes 41 seconds, and McCowns interception with 47 seconds left proved costly.I dont want to think about it.It makes me sick, McCown said.To come out on the road and get going like we did and then finish it like that is frustrating.There were signs of a Jets meltdown at the end of the game.Anderson, who scored his touchdown in the first quarter, appeared to angrily spike his helmet in the closing seconds, and Wilkerson was heard shouting from the Jets closed-door locker room after the game.A lot of frustration.You heard it, McCown said.There are a lot of emotions, and frustration is high on that list.The head of that frustration was, Lets rebound, and Mo did a good job of hammering that home.Cutler had thrown for two touchdowns before going to the locker room after being hit by Jets linebacker Jordan Jenkins in the third quarter.Some Miami fans cheered as Moore entered the game to replace Cutler, who drew boos during his Dolphins home debut two weeks ago.Moores fifth pass was intercepted by Marcus Maye, whose 33-yard return set up the score by Seferian-Jenkins, the third week in a row that the tight end has reached the end zone.Moore finished 13 for 21 for 188 yards and the two scores.Regrouping will be a challenge after the Jets lost a heartbreaker for the second week in a row.Last week, a disputed call contributed to a 24-17 loss to New England.The Jets will host Atlanta next Sunday.We have to develop a killer instinct, Bowles said.We had a 14-point lead; weve got to close the game out.
Heres What Happened in N.F.L. Week 7:::::Elliott takes advantage of delayed suspension as Cowboys smash 49ers.A temporary restraining order brought Ezekiel Elliott back to the Dallas Cowboys this week, and he took full advantage of his suspension being delayed yet again by scoring three touchdowns as the Cowboys demolished the San Francisco 49ers, 40-10.Elliott, who received a six-game suspension before the season as a result of a lengthy investigation into domestic violence allegations, has yet to miss a game, as the courts have repeatedly delayed the suspension.He won the latest legal round when a federal judge agreed to halt the suspension until Elliott can get a hearing before a presiding judge.His status for the rest of the year could be decided in the next two weeks.On Sunday, Elliott was again the centerpiece of the Cowboys offense, racking up 219 yards from scrimmage, running for two touchdowns and getting a third on a 72-yard catch-and run.Dak Prescott was nearly as good, completing 16 of 25 passes for 234 yards and three touchdowns.His first touchdown was a nifty one-handed grab by Jason Witten.His second was the 72-yarder to Elliott.His third moved Dez Bryant into a tie with Bob Hayes for the franchise record in receiving touchdowns.It was Prescotts third consecutive game with three or more touchdown passes and his numbers would likely have been higher if he was not taken out in the fourth quarter with the Cowboys up by 30 points.Photo Steelers Big Three are too much for the Bengals.The Cincinnati Bengals did their best to keep up with their division rivals, but the Pittsburgh Steelers pulled away in the second half of a 29-14 victory, which improved the teams record to 5-2.A week after their offense finally seemed to get right, the Steelers Big Three were at it once again.Ben Roethlisberger threw for 224 yards and two touchdowns, LeVeon Bell had 192 yards from scrimmage, and Antonio Brown had 65 receiving yards and a touchdown, with the stars leading an effort that produced 420 total yards.For fun, the Steelers added in a 44-yard pass from Robert Golden to Darrius Heyward-Bey on a fake punt in the fourth quarter.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Steelers, who have sometimes struggled to maintain balance on offense, are now 16-0 all-time in regular season games in which Bell runs the ball more than 23 times.Andy Dalton had two passing touchdowns in the first half, but the Steelers made adjustments at halftime, and intercepted him twice in the second half while shutting out the Bengals in the games final 37 minutes.Dalton had just 34 passing yards in the second half.Anthem protests continue in Week 7.Days after the N.F.L.declined to change its rule on the national anthem, about two dozen players protested around the league.About two dozen players around the league protested during the anthems before the early games.Some players knelt, others sat, stayed in the tunnel or raised a fist.On Sept. 25, a day after President Trump said players should be fired for protesting during the anthem, more than 200 protested in a show of solidarity.This week, the Seahawks and 49ers led the way.Seattle defensive end Michael Bennett and seven Seahawks teammates did not stand before their game with the New York Giants.And in San Francisco, about a half-dozen 49ers knelt led by Eric Reid, Marquise Goodwin, rookie linebacker Reuben Foster, Eli Harold, Adrian Colbert and Kwaun Williams.All the Dallas Cowboys stood.David Irving, a defensive lineman for the Cowboys, had vowed to demonstrate during the national anthem despite Jerry Jones having said he would bench any player that knelt during the song.Irving walked back his comments on Saturday, and then offered a mild protest, raising his fist as the song was about to end.Seahawks start slow, then stifle Giants.Russell Wilson threw three second-half touchdown passes, and the Seattle Seahawks limited the Giants receiver-depleted offense to 177 yards in a 24-7 victory on Sunday at MetLife Stadium.The Giants had lost their first five games before stunning the Broncos last Sunday night in Denver.Wilson hit Doug Baldwin with a go-ahead 22-yard touchdown pass midway through the third quarter.Wilson added a 38-yard touchdown throw to Paul Richardson on a play that was reviewed because of simultaneous possession, and he put the game away with a 1-yard pass to Jimmy Graham with 2 minutes 14 seconds to go.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Seahawks (4-2) limited the Giants (1-6)

roll in the second half, adding two more touchdowns, including a 72-yard catch-and-run by Ezekiel Elliott his third touchdown of the game.But with the teams place-kicker, Dan Bailey, sidelined by a groin injury, they have had to rely on Jeff Heath, a safety, for extra-point attempts.Heath barely made his first attempt, with the ball sailing toward the right upright before going in, but he badly missed his second attempt, which came after a 2-yard touchdown run by Dak Prescott.The Cowboys are up 33-3 at the start of the fourth quarter.Broncos struggles continue against Chargers.The Denver Broncos lost to the undermanned Giants last week, and this week they were blanked by the Los Angeles Chargers, 21-0.Once again, Denvers offense has failed to make a dent, while the teams defense was unable to stop Philip Rivers and the Chargers passing attack.The defense was also forced to watch as the teams punting unit allowed a 65-yard return touchdown to Travis Benjamin.Photo Rams shut down Carson Palmer and Adrian Peterson.Last weeks turn-back-the-clock performances from Carson Palmer and Adrian Peterson are distant memories.Palmer was ineffective and broke his left arm, Peterson ran for just 21 yards and the Arizona Cardinals were crushed 33-0 by the Los Angeles Rams.The Cardinals were outclassed in virtually every aspect of the game, with the Rams gaining 425 yards to Arizonas 193, and 28 first downs to Arizonas 10.For the Rams, everything seemed to click.Todd Gurley ran for 106 yards and a touchdown, Jared Goff was fairly efficient, and Greg Zuerlein chipped in with four field goals and three extra points.Arizona came into the game with high hopes after piling up 38 points last week in a win over Tampa Bay.Palmer threw three touchdown passes in that game, and Peterson ran for 134 yards and two touchdowns.But this week, with the team having traveled to London to play in Twickenham Stadium, the Cardinals age caught up on them.Palmer had 122 passing yards and one interception before leaving with his non-throwing arm broken.Peterson got just 11 carries, but did nothing with them, as his longest run went for six yards.Photo Drew Brees is too much for short-handed Packers.Drew Brees threw his 500th career passing touchdown, and the New Orleans Saints fought back in the second half to beat the Green Bay Packers, 26-17.Forced to start a game without Brett Favre or Aaron Rodgers for just the eighth time in the last 25 years, the Packers got a decent first half from Brett Hundley, but as the game wore on the Saints chipped away, going ahead to stay when Wil Lutz hit a 44-yard field goal with 10:26 left in the fourth quarter.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Brees then put the game out of reach late in the fourth quarter by diving over a pile at the goal line for a 1-yard touchdown run.Hundley, who completed 12 of 25 passes for 87 yards and one interception did provide some excitement with a 22-yard touchdown run that involved him colliding with defenders at the goal line.But he was not able to consistently move the ball when his team needed conversions.Brees, whose 22-yard touchdown to Brandon Coleman was the 476th regular season score of his career (he has 24 playoff touchdowns) threw for 331 yards, becoming the first quarterback in N.F.L.history to surpass 300 yards against one opponent in seven consecutive meetings.The loss for Green Bay at home dropped the team to 4-3 and negated another strong performance by Aaron Jones, the rookie running back, who appears to have supplanted Ty Montgomery as the teams starter.Jones had 17 carries for 131 yards and got the first score of the game on a 46-yard touchdown.Photo Bears ride defense in victory over Cam Newtons Panthers.The Chicago Bears only got 153 yards from the teams offense, but a pair of defensive touchdowns by Eddie Jackson provided all of the scoring the team needed in a 17-3 victory over the Carolina Panthers.Jackson returned a fumbled pitch from Cam Newton to Curtis Samuel for a 75-yard score on Carolinas opening drive, and then early in the second quarter, he intercepted Newton and wove through the defense on his way to a 76-yard score.Mitchell Trubisky is now 2-1 as a starting quarterback, though he has his teams defense, running game and special teams to thank for it as he has yet to have more than 128 passing yards in a start.He did provide one highlight with a 70-yard pass to Tarik Cohen.Browns drop to 0-7 and lose ironman Joe Thomas.The Cleveland Browns dropped to 0-7 with a 12-9 overtime loss to the Tennessee Titans.Another loss seemed secondary when, for the first time in his 11-year N.F.L.career, Joe Thomas, the superstar left tackle for the Cleveland Browns, missed a snap because of injury.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Thomas, who received a great deal of publicity earlier this season when he played in his 10,000th consecutive snap, injured his triceps at the end of his 10,363rd career snap and came out of the game after receiving medical attention on the field.After the game, Thomas said he still needed to get an M.R.I.and that it was too soon to tell if he would miss the remainder of the season.Trying to remain upbeat, Thomas told reporters It wasnt going to be an infinity streak.The No.3 pick in the 2007 draft, Thomas was playing in his 167th career game, all for the Browns.Long considered one of the best players at his position, the 10-time Pro Bowler has never played in a playoff game, and is incredibly unlikely to break that streak considering his teams winless start to the season.The Browns kept things close for much of the game, but DeShone Kizer threw two interceptions, both to Kevin Byard, and once again was benched, this time for Cody Kessler.In a game with no touchdowns, the Titans were just a tad better.The Browns official Twitter account seemed to have run out of optimism after the game.Jaguars, minus Fournette, roll over the Colts.It was an oddly-numbered week, so the Jacksonville Jaguars were dominant.The team has alternated wins and losses all season, and in a 27-0 win over the Indianapolis Colts they won easily on both sides of the ball.The Jaguars found out shortly before gametime that Leonard Fournette, the teams standout rookie running back, was not available because of an ankle injury sustained last week.But even without Fournette, who has scored a touchdown in each game of his N.F.L.career, the Jaguars managed 518 yards of offense against the lowly Colts.Blake Bortles threw for 330 yards and T.J. Yeldon ran for 122, but Jacksonvilles fearsome defense was even more dominant, with an incredible 10 sacks and 20 quarterback hits.
Manfred Makes His Choice: Punish Gurriel, but Leave the World Series Alone:::::Obviously, Manfred said, World Series games are different than regular-season games.Among the other reasons Manfred cited for delaying the suspension, this stands out: I felt it was unfair to punish the other 24 players on the Astros roster, he said.I wanted the burden of this discipline to fall primarily on the wrongdoer.Denying Gurriel a chance to help his team in the World Series would have severely affected him.It would also have allowed a fleeting gesture an ugly one, for sure, but one that was done in the dugout, not on the field, and that did not appear to be premeditated to unduly influence the World Series.And yet, given that reasoning by Manfred, these tough words from him on Saturday There is no place in our game for the behavior or any behavior like the behavior we witnessed last night seem somewhat contradictory.Gurriel, after all, is still playing.But Manfred was right in saying that World Series games are far more significant than a midseason game for the Oakland As or the Toronto Blue Jays.Maybe that sounds crass, but there is no disputing it.And while Manfred would not declare five games as the new standard price for intolerant words or actions during a game he said he would deal with each situation on its own merits the penalty for Gurriel does exceed all recent punishments, including the three-game ban given to Yunel Escobar, then of Toronto, for wearing eye black inscribed with an anti-gay slur in 2012.Gurriel, for his part, said after Fridays game that he was surprised by the furor over his gesture.He mentioned his experiences in Japan he played for the Yokohama BayStars in 2014 and said that he respected Japanese people.I did not want to offend anybody, he said through an interpreter.As for his characterization of Darvish as a chinito, a word that can be demeaning to Asians, Gurriel said that in Cuba, the term applies to anyone who is Asian, not just to Japanese people, although that did not amount to much of an excuse.Photo In any case, he added that he understood he was wrong.In a statement on Saturday, Gurriel apologized to Darvish and called his gesture indefensible.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Not surprisingly, both managers in the Series were asked to comment on Gurriel and his punishment.We support everything thats right about this game, and well move forward, if everyone will allow us to, Astros Manager A. J. Hinch said.Knowing Yuli, knowing what he will do to convince everyone that this incident was not in his heart, will be key.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts, who was born in Japan and whose mother is Japanese, said he approved of the way Manfred had handled the incident.Gurriel, who was batting .340 in the postseason and was in the starting lineup for Game 4, has delivered on his promise since the Astros signed him for five years and $47.5 million after he defected last year.He made a smooth transition from third base to first while batting .299 with 18 homers, 75 runs batted in and 43 doubles this season.Hes a great hitter, said Jose Altuve, the Astros star second baseman, one of the best Ive ever seen, to be honest with you.It was, officially, Gurriels rookie season.But at 33 years old, after playing professionally for 15 seasons in Cuba and Japan, Gurriel is a rookie in name only.He comes from a prominent baseball family in Cuba, and spent most of his prime years there.I could have left at 22 or something like other players and spent their entire careers here and maybe that would have been better, Gurriel said in Spanish at a workout in Los Angeles on Monday.But no, I dont regret it.I had the chance to play my entire life in Cuba and enjoy those great moments, and the chance to play in Japan.God wanted me to be here in this moment now, and Im enjoying this.The Astros have such a deep offense that their leader in runs batted in, Marwin Gonzalez, batted eighth in Game 3.That suits Gurriel, who said he felt pressure to carry his Cuban teams but does not have the same feeling here.In Cuba, if I didnt hit, I lost, he said.If I did hit, it was normal and what I was supposed to do.So it was really hard to please people.Its been different here in this lineup.At the same group interview in which he made those comments, Gurriel was asked a question by a Japanese reporter.He answered with a few words in Japanese before continuing in Spanish.I identified a lot with the Japanese public, Gurriel said.It was a really great experience.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yet with one gesture on Friday, Gurriel turned what should have been an experience to celebrate into something much different.And left Manfred to untangle it.
Astros Yuli Gurriel Escapes World Series Ban, but Will Miss 5 Games in 2018:::::Photo HOUSTON Yuli Gurriel, the Houston Astros first baseman who was seen making a racist gesture in the dugout during Game 3 of the World Series on Friday night, has been given a five-game suspension without pay that will begin at the start of the 2018 season.The suspension, which was handed down by Rob Manfred, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, is the largest levied against a player for a public act of intolerance during a baseball game, exceeding by two games the suspension of Yunel Escobar, who was penalized for gay slurs written on his eye black strips in 2012.Manfreds decision, which he announced in a Saturday afternoon news conference, means that Gurriel will not have to sit out any of the remaining games of the World Series.The Astros entered Game 4 of the Series on Saturday night leading the Los Angeles Dodgers, two games to one.Gurriel is scheduled to earn $12 million in 2018 and will lose roughly $320,855 because of the suspension.He will also have to undergo sensitivity training.Photo There is no excuse or explanation that makes that type of behavior acceptable, Manfred said.During Game 3 of the Series on Friday, Gurriel, who defected from Cuba in 2016, hit a home run off Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish in the bottom of the second inning.After Gurriel returned to the dugout, he was captured on camera smiling and then raising his hands as if to stretch the sides of his eyes.It seemed to be a clear, and pointedly insensitive, reference to Darvish, who is from Japan.After Game 3 ended in a Houston victory, Gurriel was besieged by reporters, and he told them through an interpreter that he did not intend to offend Darvish.He maintained that he was telling teammates that maybe Darvish thought he was Japanese and that is why he gave him a good pitch to hit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Darvish issued a statement Friday night forgiving Gurriel and asking people to learn from the incident.
Astros Rout Yu Darvish and Hold On to Beat the Dodgers in Game 3:::::HOUSTON The list of stellar pitchers that the Houston Astros lineup has toppled this postseason is impressive: Chris Sale, Craig Kimbrel, Luis Severino, Aroldis Chapman and Kenley Jansen all among the best at their craft.And by the second inning of Game 3 of the World Series on Friday night, the Astros had struck again, this time getting the best of another prestigious pitcher the Los Angeles Dodgers Yu Darvish.They shelled him for four runs and forced him to make him an unceremonious exit after getting only five outs.The end result was a 5-3 victory that gave the Astros a lead of two games to one in the Series, with Game 4 scheduled for Saturday night at Minute Maid Park.The Astros are now 7-0 in their ballpark this postseason, and the Dodgers trail for the first time in a 2017 postseason series.The victory displayed the dynamism of the Astros offense.After being limited to one run in Game 1, the Astros scored 12 over the next two games.The win also underscored the versatility of pitcher Brad Peacock.Used mainly as a starter this season, Peacock took over for Lance McCullers Jr. in the sixth and fired three and two-thirds hitless innings to complete the game, earning the first save of his career and ensuring that the work of the Astros lineup would hold up.Photo When I was out there, a couple of times I got the chills from them screaming so loud, Peacock said of the Astros fans.
A World Series Twist: First Loves Become the Enemy:::::His parents were from New York and rooted for the Yankees, as did Luhnows older brother, Chris, who told him they could not root for the same team.Luhnow picked the Dodgers, one of the more successful teams of the 1970s.I watched them on TV sunshine, L.A., the beach, a likable team, I liked the colors, all that, he said.So they became my team.Photo When Luhnow was 14, in 1981, Fernando Valenzuela profoundly jolted the franchise.Valenzuela, a pudgy prodigy from Navojoa, Mexico, opened the season by going 8-0 in eight starts and working nine innings every time.He ended that year with nine more innings against the Yankees to win Game 3 of the World Series, helping the Dodgers to a championship.Luhnow had found his favorite player.He just didnt look like a prototypical athlete, he said.He physically didnt look like he was in that great shape, his delivery was so unusual, and he looked like a guy that grew up in rural Mexico and was suddenly on the largest stage in the world and dominating in an unusual way that no one could figure out the screwball, the eyes rolling back and all the things that he did.He was a lovable player.Decades later, Luhnow would also defy convention to make it in baseball, using a business background and a strong belief in analytics to grow a thriving farm system for the St. Louis Cardinals and, since December 2011, to patiently build the Astros into winners.When he moved to California for high school, though, that was too far-off to imagine.Luhnow just wanted to go to Dodger Stadium.I came to a ton of games, he said.My English teacher had season tickets, right up there in the loge level.I would come every time he would invite me, which was quite a bit.Luhnow was there for the first two games of the 1983 National League Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies a loss in the opener and a victory by Valenzuela in Game 2.The Phillies won the best-of-five series in four and the Dodgers would not reach the World Series until 1988, after Luhnow had left California to continue his education, eventually earning an M.B.A. from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Friedman could relate to the World Series near miss.In 1986, just before he turned

later.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That was the infamous or celebrated Game 6, which the Mets tied with three runs in the ninth.The Mets scored again in the 14th before the Astros, who were facing elimination, tied it on a Billy Hatcher homer.The Mets scored three in the 16th, gave up two in the bottom of the inning, but finally won the pennant and avoided facing the unhittable Mike Scott in Game 7.I was heartbroken I swore off baseball, said Friedman, who had witnessed Scotts division-clinching no-hitter that September.He added that 86 scarred me some I remember watching the World Series with the Mets and Red Sox, and it was painful.Photo Of course, Friedman did not really give up the game.As the years went on, he would visit the Astrodome so frequently about 30 times a summer, he guessed that he befriended the stadium workers and could roam almost anywhere he pleased.Long before clubs stamped game-used items with holograms and sold them at the team store, Friedman would often go home with broken bats or discarded equipment.He once scored an artifact from the early career of a future Hall of Famer.Probably a Craig Biggio helmet from when he was catching, Friedman said, when asked for the prize of his collection.It had a crack in it, and I dont really remember how I got it but probably someone that wasnt him just saw me there hanging out.Friedman would play baseball at Tulane and, like Luhnow, work in business before joining a major league front office.He built the Tampa Bay Rays into pennant winners in 2008, and has been the Dodgers president of baseball operations for three years.In their jobs now, Luhnow and Friedman regularly meet their old heroes.Friedman said he had put his fandom long behind, and was not awe-struck when he met Biggio a few years ago.Luhnow, though, has never quite summoned the courage to have a conversation with Valenzuela, who now broadcasts Dodgers games in Spanish and tossed the ceremonial first pitch before Game 2.Luhnow said he got chills watching that ceremony.He has said hello to his baseball idol, but only casually.Yet Valenzuela is well aware of his work.I havent had the pleasure of meeting him, but I would congratulate him on where his team has gotten, Valenzuela said in Spanish.His team has reached the World Series, which is what you want.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Actually, both of Luhnows teams his employer and his first love have reached the World Series.Both of Friedmans, too.
Want to Play in the World Series? Just Get the Yankees to Trade You:::::After all, since the Yankees began jettisoning veterans from their 25-man roster, in 2016, almost everyone they have traded has gone on to the Series.So why not Ellsbury and Headley?Advertisement Continue reading the main story Consider that Aroldis Chapman was traded to the Chicago Cubs in July of last year (he is a Yankee again) and played a key role in the 2016 Series.So did his fellow reliever Andrew Miller, who was traded by the Yankees to the Cleveland Indians in midseason and also ended up a major figure in the 2016 Series.Another Yankee who was dealt at the nonwaiver trade deadline last year was Carlos Beltran.He was sent to the Texas Rangers, but signed as a free agent with the Houston Astros before this season.Now he is in the World Series, too, along with another former Yankee catcher Brian McCann, who was traded by New York to the Astros in the off-season.Then there is reliever Tyler Clippard, who was a Yankee this year and is now an Astro, although he is not on the postseason roster.Still, if the Astros win the Series, he is in line to get a ring.Photo Clippard was sent to the Chicago White Sox this season to help offset some of the salary the Yankees were taking on when they acquired relievers Tommy Kahnle and David Robertson and third baseman Todd Frazier.Several weeks later, the White Sox sent Clippard to the Astros.The only two players the Yankees have dealt from their major league roster in the past 16 months who have not reached a World Series are starting pitcher Ivan Nova, who was sent to Pittsburgh at the 2016 nonwaiver trade deadline and has remained there, and reliever Tyler Webb, who was dealt to Milwaukee this past summer.Beltran, who grounded out as a pinch-hitter on Tuesday night in Game 1 of the Series, was relegated to the bench for the two World Series games at Dodger Stadium earlier this week because there is no designated hitter in National League parks.But McCann could play a central role as this Series continues, just as he did in the American League Championship Series against the Yankees, when he hit a pair of run-scoring doubles that sparked the Astros to victories in Games 6 and 7.McCann signed a five-year, $85 million deal with the Yankees in November 2013 but realized his role as the teams regular catcher was in peril once the Yankees called up Gary Sanchez from the minor leagues in August 2016 and thrust him into the lineup.From that point on, McCann played regularly as a designated hitter but caught only sporadically.Meanwhile, Sanchez was slugging one home run after another.Photo When the season ended, I kind of assessed where I was and what I wanted to do going forward, and I just wasnt ready to catch once a week and I wasnt ready to just D.H. against right-handed pitching, McCann said recently.Advertisement Continue reading the main story While McCann had a no-trade clause in his deal with the Yankees, he also had another incentive to waive it the $15 million in his contract for 2019.It vests only if he has 1,000 plate appearances in 2017 and 2018 and he must also catch at least 90 games next year and not end the season on the disabled list.In conversations with Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman after last season, it became apparent to McCann that there were two realistic landing spots for him the Astros and the Atlanta Braves.Atlanta is McCanns hometown and the Braves are the club with whom he began his career.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But in the end, it was Houston that wanted to make the deal, with the Yankees picking up $11 million of McCanns contract over this season and next.I looked around and this was the first team that came to mind because I knew they needed a catcher, I knew the talent they had in the clubhouse playing against them, and it was just a perfect fit, said McCann, who is playing in his first World Series.I talked to Cash quite a bit during that process and it was really between coming here or going to Atlanta.Im very thankful this all worked out the way it did.Well, not all of it.Because McCann had only 399 plate appearances this season he batted .241 with 18 home runs it is unlikely the 2019 option will kick in.Still, he is in the World Series, one more recently traded Yankee enjoying baseballs most prestigious competition.Perhaps there will be still others in 2018.
World Series 2017: How the Astros Won Game 3, Inning by Inning:::::- Want exclusive sports news, highlights and analysis from a rotating cast of New York Times journalists, delivered to your inbox once a week?Click here to receive our weekly Sports newsletter.- Heres how the Astros beat the Dodgers in Game 3, inning by inning: Photo Top 1st: McCullers gets three quick outs.Game 3 began at 8:21 p.m. Eastern with Lance McCullers of the Astros throwing a 95 mile-per-hour fastball low and outside for ball one to Chris Taylor of the Dodgers.McCullers eventually got Taylor to pop out to second and retired Corey Seager when Jose Altuve made a great diving play in shallow-right to knock the ball down before throwing Seager out at first.The inning ended with Justin Turner flying out to deep center.Waldstein: Yu Darvish takes the mound in the bottom of the first for the Dodgers as the first Japanese starting pitcher in the World Series in 10 years.The last one was Daisuke Matsuzaka for the Boston Red Sox in their four-game sweep of the Colorado Rockies in 2007.Matsuzaka also started Game 3.Darvish has plenty of experience pitching at Minute Maid Park from his days with the Texas Rangers.He comes into the game with a 4-1 record and a 2.16 earned run average, so the Dodgers are pinning a lot of their hopes on him replicating that success here.Bottom 1st: Darvish gets out of jam.George Springer worked a 3-1 count against Yu Darvish and then pounced on a fastball in the zone, hitting a hard liner to center for a double.Alex Bregman made Darvish work, fouling off five pitches in an eight-pitch at-bat, but ultimately grounded out to third, which kept Springer at second.Jose Altuve flew out to deep center, which sent Springer to third, but Darvish got ahead in the count and Carlos Correa grounded out to short to end the inning.Top 2nd: Dodgers make some noise, but no runs.Lance McCullers threw half of his 12 pitches in the inning to one batter, but worked around a single to keep the game scoreless.He needed just three pitches to strike out Cody Bellinger, as the rookie infielder almost fell down as he swung wildly at a knuckle-curve.One pitch to Yasiel Puig and McCullers had a second out on a grounder to second, but Logan Forsythe got the Dodgers first hit on a single to right.Forsythe was able to steal second as Austin Barnes worked a six-pitch at-bat, but the half-inning ended when Barnes grounded out to third.Photo Bottom 2nd: Astros jump all over Darvish and score 4 runs.Yu Darvish struggled to put pitches where he wanted them and that led to a great inning for struggling Astros batters.Only six outs into the game, Dave Roberts had seen enough and removed his No.3 starter with the Dodgers already down 4-0.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yulieski Gurriel, who was 1 for 7 in Games 1 and 2, led things off by unloading on a fastball for a solo home run.Josh Reddick, whose bat had been almost entirely silent, doubled to left for his first extra-base hit of the postseason.Evan Gattis walked and Marwin Gonzalez, who had been in a horrible funk leading up to his game-tying home run in Game 2, singled off the wall in left, scoring Reddick.With runners on first and second with no outs, Brian McCann, who was hitless in the first two games of the series, looped a ball into right-center that brought home Gattis and sent Gonzalez to third.Photo Darvish finally got his first out when George Springer, the sixth batter of the half-inning, lined out to second, but Alex Bregman hit a fly ball deep enough to center to give Gonzalez enough time to tag up and score, making the score 4-0.Jose Altuve doubled to left, sending McCann over to third, and that brought out Roberts, who replaced Darvish with Kenta Maeda.Maeda needed just two pitches to end the inning, getting Carlos Correa to fly out to right.Darvishs final line was one and two-thirds innings, six hits and four runs.He walked one and had no strikeouts in the shortest start of his career.Waldstein: Darvish did not have it tonight.Even the outs were on balls that were hit hard.Gurriel started it by ripping a line-drive home run into the left field bleachers, which can be home to some of the cheapest home runs in baseball.Not to say that it was cheap, because he hammered the ball.But the distance is 315 feet, only 5 feet deeper than Fenway Park in Boston.But the wall here is about half the height of the 37-foot Green Monster, so it is one of the most tantalizing targets in baseball for a right-handed pull hitter, as Gurriel showed.It was the sixth home run hit in the last four innings of this World Series, going back to the extra innings of Game 2.Photo Top 3rd: Dodgers get one back.Given a fairly sizable lead, Lance McCullers walked the bases loaded to start the third, but managed to get out of the half-inning having only allowed one run.It was a rough start, as he engaged in a battle with Joc Pederson.The boom-or-bust hitter fought off several good pitches in what proved to be a nine-pitch walk.Undoubtedly frustrated by putting Pederson on base, McCullers responded with walks to Kike Hernandez and Chris Taylor.He got some help when his defense turned a double-play on a grounder from Corey Seager, and ended the inning by getting Justin Turner to ground out to short.The inning couldve gone far worse for McCullers, who should be happy with a 4-1 score.Waldstein: You want to make a pitching coach crazy?Get handed a 4-0 lead and then go to the mound and walk the No.8, No.9 and No.1 hitters to load the bases with nobody out.Thats what Lance McCullers, Jr. just did.But thanks to some terrific defense, including by McCullers, himself, the Astros avoided big damage.The big play was getting Corey Seager to ground into a double play that required some exceptional synchronized movement and pinpoint throws from the Astros to complete.First baseman Yuli Gurriel threw a strike off the wrong foot to Carlos Correa coming across the second base bag and he, while in stride, delivered the ball to a moving target in McCullers covering first.That kind of cohesion begins in spring training.Photo Bottom 3rd: Maeda cools down Astros batters.After a pair of lengthy half-innings for both teams, Kenta Maeda made quick work of the Astros in the third.He started by getting a pair of matching pop-outs to third from Yulieski Gurriel and Josh Reddick.A walk to Evan Gattis was a mild speed bump, but Maeda finished things off by getting Marwin Gonzalez to ground out to first to end the inning.Photo Top 4th: Puigs gamble backfires.A bang-bang play went Houstons way, sending the Dodgers down in order.With one out, Yasiel Puig hit a grounder down the third-base line that Alex Bregman could not quite reach.The ball skipped into foul territory, but Puig took some time before realizing he should round first and Carlos Correa was able to corral the ball and throw him out at second.Stoked to have two outs despite the hard hit by Puig, Lance McCullers ended things by getting Logan Forsythe to fly out to right.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Waldstein: Yasiel Puig has been caught admiring balls before, but this time he suffered from putting his head down and hustling to first base.After hitting a sharp bouncer down the third base line, Puig ran so hard that he did not see the ball had skipped past third baseman Alex Bregman.Puig overran first, slowed down and only then realized he should have been headed to second.By the time he restarted and slid into second, the ball was in Jose Altuves glove and Puig was tagged out.Bottom 4th: Maedas relief appearance gives Dodgers hope.Kenta Maeda has done a terrific job of settling things down after Yu Darvishs disastrous start.Brian McCann led off fourth against him by looping a ball just out of Corey Seagers reach in shallow left field for a single.But Maeda was unfazed and went on to strike out George Springer on four pitches and Alex Bregman on five.He got out of the inning when Jose Altuve grounded out to short.Maeda is up to 38 pitches in two and one-thirds innings of relief as the Dodgers try to get as much as they can from one of the teams three best relievers.Photo Top 5th: McCullers gets out of trouble again.Lance McCullers worked around some tremendous hustle from Joc Pederson to pitch another scoreless inning, with some help from George Springer.With one out, Pederson hit what looked like a single to center.But the young outfielder ran hard right out of the box and managed to stretch the soft hit into a double.Kike Hernandez sent him to third on a groundout to second, but McCullers got out of the inning when Chris Taylor hit a shallow fly to center that a diving Springer was able to snare for the third out.
The Astros Alex Bregman Keeps Working at Hitting, Fielding and Spanish:::::Across from Gurriel at the other corner of the infield is Bregman, a 23-year-old third baseman and a first-round draft pick in 2015 who moves seamlessly between the teams contingents of Latino and American players because he has a working knowledge of Spanish and a desire to get better at it.He makes the effort, and he values the guys who dont speak English, which is important in this game, said Carlos Beltran, the Astros designated hitter, who is from Puerto Rico.When I see an American player really making the effort with the Latinos, its something really special, added Beltran, 40, who was shy as a teenage prospect because he did not understand English but over the years has become confident in publicly addressing issues.He was one of the players most instrumental in getting Major League Baseball to require that every team have Spanish-English interpreters.More than a quarter of major league players are Latino, and most of those were born overseas.After arriving in the United States, those players are expected to learn English, and they often take language classes in baseball academies and in the minor leagues.In contrast, American-born players without any Latino background do not receive similar instruction in Spanish, even though it is the first language of numerous teammates.Instead, they usually learn bits of Spanish from playing alongside Latinos in both the minor and major leagues.What frequently happens as a result is that the foreign-born Latino players, especially those whose English is limited, end up spending most of their time in and away from the clubhouse with their fellow Spanish-speaking teammates.It becomes a question of comfort and familiarity.Photo But in the Astros clubhouse, the high-energy, Spanish-speaking Bregman bounces around everywhere.He hangs with the American players, the Latinos, everyone, Correa said.Hes a great teammate.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Monday, the day before Game 1 of the World Series, the Astros infielders finished fielding drills and headed to the batting cage together.Altuve, Correa, Gurriel, Bregman and the utility player Marwin Gonzalez, who is from Venezuela, walked as a group with Gonzalezs arm over Bregmans shoulder.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Growing up in New Mexico and in a baseball family, Bregman was perhaps destined for this.His father, Sam, who is a lawyer, and an uncle played baseball at the University of New Mexico.His grandfather Stan was the general counsel for the second version of the Washington Senators, and helped negotiate the teams sale.At age 5, Alex Bregman said, he began receiving Spanish instruction in school.Throughout his baseball travels, including time while on developmental rosters for Team U.S.A., he said, he played in Colombia, Mexico and Cuba.That helped with his Spanish, too.Bregman was selected by the Astros with the second overall pick in 2015, and within a year he was in the major leagues because of his strong fielding and hitting ability.He hit .284 with 19 home runs and 71 R.B.I.this season and was 3 for 10 with a home run through the first two games of the World Series.Meanwhile, Bregman said, his Spanish skills continued to improve because he had so many Latino teammates once he turned professional.Im basically almost fluent now, he said, perhaps overstating his proficiency.I understand it all and speak probably 90 percent of it.You can ask them, but theyll tell you Im fluent.Photo His teammates verdict?He speaks it pretty well, at least better than you think, said Altuve, who speaks English well, just like Correa and Gonzalez.When I first met him, he didnt speak much.But hes learning more every day, so be careful what you say in front of him.Francisco Liriano, a veteran Astros pitcher who is from the Dominican Republic, grinned when asked about Bregmans Spanish.He sounds like an American, but he knows a good amount, he said.Beltran lauded Bregmans confidence and desire to learn a new language, a trait Beltran said would help Bregman not only with Spanish but throughout his career on the baseball field.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The most important thing is that he tries, said Beltran, who spoke in Spanish for this article, as did the other Latino players who were interviewed.Hes not afraid to express himself.He makes me laugh a few times because its funny the words he uses, good and bad words.Words you hear and you think, Oh, wow, how cool that he knows this word.Bregman is so enthusiastic about his language endeavor that he has done conducted brief interviews in Spanish with Francisco Romero, a Spanish-language radio broadcaster for Astros games.In an interview two weeks ago with Romero during the postseason, Bregman called a home run against the Boston Red Sox a dream for me and my family in Spanish, then mixed in some English when he could not remember how to say a blessing.The sentences were not complete, and there were a few mistakes, but he tried and he smiled.Earlier in the season, Romero recorded Bregman singing along in Spanish to Ginza, a popular reggaeton song by the Colombian artist J. Balvin.Because Altuve is well known in the Astros clubhouse for singing along to music, Bregman wanted to do it, too.Hanging out with his Latino teammates, Bregman said, has given him an appreciation for reggaeton (we all listen to it in the clubhouse all the time) and for carne asada, a staple of Latin American cuisines.Its all part of his learning process.
Fans Love Extra Innings and Late-Game Twists. Reporters, Less So.:::::As if it had fallen from the sky, a fruitful theme emerged in the sixth inning: Corey Seager, the Dodgers All-Star shortstop who missed the previous round of the playoffs with a bad back smashed a go-ahead, two-run home run.(Hitting a baseball is hard enough; imagine bashing it into the stands when it is thrown at 97 miles per hour and you have barely played the past two weeks.)Even when standout Dodgers relievers Brandon Morrow and Kenley Jansen gave up a run in the eighth inning, the Dodgers still held a 3-2 lead, and I thought the 950 words of a story framed around Seager would still work.I even liked how I had written it.But in the top of the ninth inning, something unlikely happened: Astros left fielder Marwin Gonzalez, who had been struggling in the playoffs, clobbered a game-tying home run off Jansen, who had never blown a save in his playoff career.It was 11:18 p.m. Eastern.While the most dramatic, mind-bending games are fun to watch on the couch or at the bar or in the stands, trying to capture the many late-game twists and turns as the final print edition deadline nears can be nerve-racking.So, goodbye Corey Seager story.I copied it all into a separate document and started rewriting.Then, in the top of the 10th inning, Astros stars Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa gave Houston a 5-3 lead with two solo home runs.As a reporter, I have no rooting interest.But this gave me a little bit of a cushion from deadline pressure: The Dodgers still had to bat in the bottom of the inning.I reframed the story around Houstons improbable comeback against a Dodgers bullpen that had not allowed a run in 25 consecutive innings entering the game, focusing on the blasts by Gonzalez, Correa and Altuve.Photo At 11:50 p.m., the night sports editor, Joel Petterson, emailed to remind me that they would need the story immediately when the game ended to get it into the final edition.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dont worry if its sloppy, well clean up whatever, said Petterson, who has saved me on deadline before.Within 10 minutes of his email, the Dodgers tied the score, at 5-5, with a home run by Yasiel Puig and a single by Enrique Hernandez.I wrote back to Petterson: Ive added like 50 white hairs the past three innings alone.I had not gotten up from my seat since the fifth inning.By now, I knew that I needed to come up with a way to capture the mayhem of the game, no matter the outcome.I wrote a broad introduction or lede, as we call it in journalism and worked backward through the wildest moments of the game.(The teams set a World Series record with eight home runs in total, including five in extra innings.)I left a few sentences with blanks, knowing I would fill in the final details the time of the game, the last out, the winning hit.As soon as the game ended, I sent in my story.After talking to the managers and players, I filed an updated version for the web, since the print deadline had long passed.Once I was done, I looked over at the secondary document I had open on my computer.There is probably a funny compilation to be made of all the drafts of historic game stories that never saw the light of day.If anyone ever gets around to pulling one together, I have 2,360 words to add.
The Yankees Had a Steady Winner in Girardi. Now They Want More.:::::It is clear, though, that the Yankees viewed this moment as something of a pivot point.After coming so close to the World Series, they now expect to get there, and win, within the term of the next managers contract.Girardi took this group to the edge of a title, and now his successor they hope will haul it over the top.For all the niceties in the five-sentence statement from General Manager Brian Cashman announcing the move he praised Girardis work ethic and heart, and wished him well he gave no explanation for the move.Everything this organization does is done with careful and thorough consideration, the statement said, leaving open the question of what Cashman considered to be lacking in Girardi.After a decade of working with him, Cashman knew precisely what he had in Girardi.He is said not to have held Girardis tactical blunder in the division series against him (Girardi failed to ask for a video review that could have prevented a Cleveland Indians grand slam), but he knows what kind of team he has built, and he decided not to have Girardi lead it.Photo To Cashman, Girardis style might not mesh well with a team of players in their 20s.The veterans Girardi managed for most of his tenure, essentially, were fully formed major leaguers before they played for him.A younger group may respond better to a manager who projects less tension and more outward calm.In the A.L.C.S., the Yankees got a close look at a manager who does that, one with renowned communication skills: A. J. Hinch of the Astros, who recovered from three losses at Yankee Stadium to take the final two games in Houston.Hinchs Astros also eliminated the Yankees in the 2015 A.L.wild card game, the Yankees only other playoff appearance in the last five years.He just believes in every single one of us, and he shows you that, Alex Bregman, the Astros 23-year-old third baseman, said on Thursday.He shows that he has confidence in everybody on our roster.Hes a motivator and a guy that you want to play for a guy that you want to run through a wall for.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Girardi speaks often of believing in his guys.But he showed no faith in Dellin Betances, a four-time All-Star reliever, when he yanked him after he had faced two batters in his final appearance of the regular season with a four-run lead in the ninth inning.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Betances had seemed to be turning around an inconsistent season, but after that outing he became a playoff afterthought.Twice Girardi pulled him after two batters in the postseason when the Yankees held a big lead, and by the fateful Game 7 of the A.L.C.S.after burning Chad Green for two and a third innings in Game 6 Girardi was left with limited options.Of course, the Yankees did not score in Game 7, so their pitching options made little difference.And bullpen management, in general, has always seemed to be a strength of Girardis, along with his meticulous preparation.Yet over Girardis tenure, managers increasingly became extensions of the front office, and the Yankees, with their increasing emphasis on analytics, were no different.If Girardi and Cashman were still in lock step on overall philosophy, game management or both their partnership would most likely still be intact.Instead, Cashman severed it, as the Washington Nationals did with Dusty Baker and the Boston Red Sox with John Farrell, both after having made the playoffs two years in a row.In one of his final acts on the job, Girardi made a point to seek out Hinch in the home clubhouse in Houston after Game 7 to congratulate him and wish him well.Hes a real class act, Hinch said on Thursday, adding later, I dont think anyone goes through what Joe goes through in New York.Girardi went through it all as a winner 10 seasons, 10 winning records and a somewhat puzzling departure.Fans once wondered how anyone could adequately replace Joe Torre, who won four championships.Now we could ask the same question about replacing Girardi, who won just one title but kept a stable, successful atmosphere for a decade.
After a Decade, Joe Girardi Is Out as Manager of the Yankees:::::It will now be up to Cashman to find a new manager, although Cashman himself still has to sign a new contract with the club.The most likely internal candidate is Joe Espada, who worked as a special assistant to Cashman for one season before becoming the Yankees third-base coach in 2015.Espada, who is 42, has a strong relationship with several of the young, Spanish-speaking Yankee players.Cashman was developing a list of candidates on Thursday, according to the baseball executive, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly.And that list will almost certainly include candidates from outside the Yankees organization as Cashman tries to figure out who is best suited to managing a young team brimming with talent while dealing with the media scrutiny that the Yankees attract.The decision to part with Girardi comes after a postseason run that was both exhilarating and painfully disappointing for the Yankees, ending with a loss in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series.Two other managers the Washington Nationals Dusty Baker and the Boston Red Sox John Farrell lost their jobs this month after their teams were ousted from the postseason.Girardi now becomes the third.In his decade in the Bronx, Girardi compiled a 910-710 record and was the third-longest-tenured active manager in the major leagues before he was let go, behind the Los Angeles Angels Mike Scioscia and the San Francisco Giants Bruce Bochy.Photo In recent years, he was able to get aging Yankee teams to at least stay in the hunt for a postseason berth.And then came the 2017 campaign, in which Girardi found himself presiding over a younger and, at times, dynamic roster that began to exceed just about everyones expectations as the season progressed.It was a club that chased the Red Sox to the penultimate day of the regular season for the division title before ending up with a wild-card berth.And it was a club that then embarked on a postseason run that did not end until last weekend.Girardis unyielding manner be it his rigorous preparation or his sometimes-contentious back and forth with the news media was reflected in that run, in which the Yankees twice rallied from two-games-to-none deficits in postseason series only to ultimately fall short.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But it was during the postseason run that Girardi also came under fierce criticism for his managing.It grew out of the Yankees Game 2 loss in the division series against the Cleveland Indians, a game in which Girardi declined to ask for a replay review of a hit-by-pitch call a decision that opened the door for an Indians comeback.Girardi, who made a rare admission the next day I screwed up, he said repeatedly at a news conference was afforded a reprieve when the Yankees rallied to win the next three games to advance to the A.L.C.S.against the Houston Astros.Still, the withering criticism that was directed at him after the Game 2 blunder seemed to affect him deeply and, for the first time, raised the notion that his decade in the Bronx had worn on him.And Saturday night, after the Yankees were eliminated by the Astros, Girardi had an almost fatalistic tone as he discussed his baseball future.Ive had 10 great years here, he said.I feel extremely blessed.God has been good to me, and well see what the future holds.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.That same night, Cashman was vague in his assessment of Girardi and did not single him out for praise.I think everybody did everything they possibly could to get where we wanted to go, to be the last team standing, and we fell short, Cashman said.Though Cashman and Girardi have divergent personalities and far different interests, they had generally enjoyed a strong working relationship.I think he knows that he can speak his mind in a constructive way with me, and I can speak my mind in a constructive way with him, Cashman said at the start of the 2016 season.Theres an openness that is encouraged here.I acquire the talent, and Joe deploys the talent, and sometimes youll have disagreements on players capabilities that Ive acquired or strategies that hes employing.Photo Youve got to be able to work through those in a healthy manner to have a successful manager-general-manager relationship, and Im proud to say we have that, Cashman added.But at a time when the ability to relate to players is becoming more valued, Girardi may have had some difficulties on that front.He became so frustrated this season over catcher Gary Sanchezs inattentiveness in blocking pitches that he publicly called him out, a rarity for Girardi.Advertisement Continue reading the main story And in the wake of Girardis botched replay decision, closer Aroldis Chapman liked a social media post that urged the Yankees not to bring Girardi back.Chapman later said he had done it inadvertently.Girardi, who was chosen over Don Mattingly to replace Torre, as manager, had a rocky first season in 2008, when the Yankees missed the playoffs for the first time since the strike-aborted season of 1994.But the Yankees made an immediate turnaround and won the 2009 World Series the 27th in franchise history in a new stadium.That championship also meant a change of uniform for Girardi.He switched to No.28 from No.27 because he wanted a visible reminder of the number of championships the Yankees had accumulated, along with the inference that another one would surely come soon enough.But it did not.In an interview before the start of the 2017 season, Hal Steinbrenner largely absolved Girardi for the disappointments the Yankees had encountered, including a failure to make the playoffs in 2013, 2014 and 2016.Was any of what was going on the fault of Joe Girardi?, Steinbrenner said.Was Joe Girardi the fact we hadnt made the playoffs in two to three years?Had he lost control of the team?Did the players no longer respect him?Is it a serious situation in that regard?And the answer to that in my opinion was no.There have been plenty of owners that have fired managers left and right and still arent winning, Steinbrenner added.So how well does that work?Girardi, who has three children, has long touted the importance of family.He skipped a game this season in Tampa to attend the high school graduation of his oldest daughter, and he made it comfortable for players and coaches to leave the team for significant events in their lives.And Girardi said last week that he would meet with his family after the season to gauge how they felt about him returning.Im not living my kids lives; Im not living my wifes life, he said.Im living, in a sense, my life, so I dont know what changes for them.Now, however, much has changed for Girardi.He is no longer the Yankees manager.
After Barrage of Home Runs in the World Series, Juicy Theories as to Why:::::That was basically the story of Game 2, when the Astros and the Dodgers combined for five home runs in extra innings something that had never been done in major league history, even in the regular season.Major leaguers combined for a record 6,105 homers in 2017, and the postseason has been no different.The very first batter, Minnesotas Brian Dozier, went deep to start the first wild-card game.In their National League Championship Series loss to the Dodgers, the Chicago Cubs scored eight runs on homers, and no runs any other way.Of the 17 runs scored in this World Series, 14 have come on homers.Everybodys swinging for the fences, said a weary Ken Giles, the Astros closer, who served up Yasiel Puigs 10th-inning blast in Game 2.Home runs this series have been the big play so far.We need to figure out a way to prevent it.On Friday, the series shifts to Minute Maid Park, where the Astros are 6-0 this postseason.Jose Altuve began the Astros playoff run with three homers there in the division series opener.The Dodgers also got a three-homer game in the playoffs, by Enrique Hernandez in the N.L.C.S.clincher.Teams generally must slug to win.The top eight teams in slugging percentage all reached the playoffs this season; the Astros were first, at .478, and the Dodgers were tied for seventh with the Cubs, at .437.If this World Series becomes one big home run derby, the Astros like their chances.If it comes down to a slugfest, my moneys on us, third baseman Alex Bregman said.We bang.Were the best-hitting team in baseball.Well step in that box ready to go every time.Its fun to be a part of an offense like this.Bregman homered off Clayton Kershaw in Game 1, the only blemish across Kershaws seven dazzling innings.It was typical of the way opponents have tried to handle Kershaw this month: With little chance of bunching hits together, they simply try to swing big.Photo The strategy is failing; while Kershaw has allowed all eight of his runs on homers this postseason, he is 3-0 with a 2.96 earned run average.He is scheduled to face Keuchel in Game 5 on Sunday.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As for Keuchels assertion widely shared by other pitchers around the league that the balls have been altered, Commissioner Rob Manfred has consistently denied it.He reiterated that stance before the American League wild-card game this month.Were using two different labs that have been looking at the ball on a continuous basis all year, Manfred said.Balls are within specs; theres been no movement even within the range of the specifications in terms of the baseball.Ive said before I think theres other issues causing the home runs other than the baseball principally, the way the games being played, the tolerance for strikeouts, power pitching, guys changing their swing.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Manfred added that fans like home runs, a point that is hard to argue.Excitement surged through Dodger Stadium with each home run on Wednesday night, and the hitters reacted memorably: The Dodgers Joc Pederson joyously gestured to the crowd; Carlos Correa gleefully flipped his bat toward the Astros dugout; Puig gently placed his bat on the dirt; Charlie Culberson cavorted as if he were Joe Carter.Guys have been superaggressive, trying to get a fastball or attack a first pitch thats what Ive been seeing, said the Astros Chris Devenski, who gave up Culbersons two-out homer in the 11th but struck out Puig with a changeup to end it.Its baseball.It goes in streaks; it goes in spurts at times.The last time the World Series came to Southern California, in 2002, home runs were also the big story.The Angels beat the San Francisco Giants in Game 2 in Anaheim, 11-10, with the teams combining for six home runs, out of a record 21 for the Series.Players openly guessed that the ball was juiced then, too.Al Levine, a nonroster pitcher for the Angels, actually took a Ginsu knife and sliced open a World Series ball and a regular-season ball in the clubhouse during that game.He concluded that the World Series ball was wound tighter.When I cut them open, one was easier, definitely, Levine said then.The World Series ball was a lot tougher to get through.Troy Percival, the Angels closer who had given up a towering homer to Barry Bonds, put it this way: Its like throwing a smooth rock.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Predictably, baseball denied any shenanigans.By then, though, the owners and the players had agreed to implement steroid testing the next season.The program has gradually gotten tougher since then, including a provision that players suspended during the regular season cannot take part in the postseason.We have been fooled before, of course, but this generation of players seems to want a clean game.A widespread, coordinated cheating epidemic that consistently beats baseballs testing program seems a little hard to fathom.In any case, this World Series has so far reflected the game in 2017: dinger after dinger after dinger, breaking records and turning most players into awe-struck fans.I dont know what to tell you, man, Correa said.It was so much fun.
Astros Even World Series With Dodgers in a Home Run Derby:::::Because no lead was safe on Wednesday, many fans were undoubtedly holding their breath in the bottom of the 11th.It was merited: Charlie Culberson hit a solo home run off Astros reliever Chris Devenski, trimming Houstons lead to one run.Photo But Devenski struck out Puig to complete the victory after 4 hours 19 minutes, handing the Dodgers just their second loss of this postseason.It was probably as nerve-racking as it was in the stands as for everybody else, Springer said.When the last out is made you finally breathe.Two games may be a small sample size, yet one conclusion can be drawn in this series: These are two well-matched teams that have the potential to play more dramatic games like Game 2.Even the calmest of fans would have had trouble watching Wednesdays game without fraying some nerves.Two teams that competed for 27 outs, Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said.An emotional roller coaster.The teams will now fly to Houston with the best-of-seven series tied at one game apiece.They will return to action on Friday, with Houstons Lance McCullers Jr., a hero of Game 7 of the A.L.C.S.against the Yankees, slated to start Game 3 opposite Yu Darvish of the Dodgers.The unseasonably warm weather in Los Angeles it was 93 degrees at first pitch should have been a clue that no margin would be comfortable.Balls that might have normally died at the warning track turned into game-changing hits.Photo Dodger Stadium is pretty famous for, at night, the ball not carrying, said Verlander, who had pitched brilliantly this postseason.Doesnt seem like the case the last couple of nights.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Verlander, staked to a 1-0 lead thanks to Alex Bregmans single in the third inning, was mowing through the Dodgers lineup with ease early on.But with two out in the fifth inning, Verlander gave up his first hit to Dodgers left fielder Joc Pederson, who tied the score at 1-1 with his first major league home run since July 26.Seager provided what felt a decisive blow an inning later.Seager, last years National League Rookie of the Year, hurt his back in the Dodgers division series against the Arizona Diamondbacks and missed the entire N.L.C.S.With two outs in the sixth, Dodgers center fielder Chris Taylor drew a walk, and then Seager smashed a go-ahead, two-run home run and screamed in delight.Then the Astros proceeded to slowly chip away.Facing the Dodgers stout reliever Brandon Morrow in the eighth inning, Bregman smacked a ball down the right-field line that hit the edge of Puigs glove as he dived for the ball.Puig, a strong defender, flung his glove into the ground in annoyance after the play.Nursing a two-run lead, Roberts called for Jansen, his closer, for the kind of two-inning save Jansen has handled well.Photo This time was different.The second hitter Jansen faced, Correa, smacked an outside cutter up the middle for a run-scoring single that trimmed the Astros deficit to 3-2, snapping a streak of 28 consecutive scoreless innings by the Dodgers bullpen.Ill take Kenley any day of the week with a one-run lead going into the ninth inning, Roberts said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The next inning spelled more trouble for the Dodgers.Gonzalez was a key cog in the Astros season, yet he had not driven in a run since the first game of the division series.But he drilled a 94 m.p.h.cutter, Jansens trademark pitch, over the center-field wall for a game-tying blast.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.It was the first earned run Jansen, the best closer in baseball, had allowed in the postseason since Game 3 of a division series in 2016.It was just flat, Jansen said.Give credit to Marwin Gonzalez.He didnt miss the one pitch that was flat the whole night.In the top of the 10th, Altuve and Correa provided a 5-3 lead by feasting off Dodgers reliever Josh Fields, who had been used sparingly this postseason.Altuve brought chants of M.V.P.when he blasted a solo home run to left-center field to lead off the 10th inning.Photo Correa followed with his own shot, flipping his bat far into the air before he began his home run trot.The Astros dugout bounced up and down as the home crowd sat stunned.I loved it, said Puig, who is well known for his own home run celebrations.He threw it higher than I normally do, and thats the way you should play in the World Series.Puig replaced the Astros euphoria with anxiety when he hit a solo home run off Giles in the bottom of the 10th.Normally emphatic on the field, Puig simply placed his bat on the ground before running the bases.With blood pressure high everywhere, Logan Forsythe drew a two-out walk and advanced to second base on a wild pitch.Hernandez then tied the game with a single, Forsythe beating Josh Reddicks throw to home plate.As if that were not enough drama, Hinch brought in Devenski.And before he threw a pitch, Devenski fired a pickoff attempt to second base, hoping to nab Hernandez.It was wide, and if it had not hit the umpire Laz Diaz, there might have been another play at the plate.Instead, it was a dead ball.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Laz was perfectly positioned right where we wanted him, Hinch said with a smirk after the game.This all set the stage for a delirious 11th inning.McCarthy had not pitched since Oct. 1, and was making his postseason debut.He coughed up a single to Astros outfielder Cameron Maybin.Up came Springer, who struck out four times in Game 1 but was determined to slow his heart rate down in this moment.He did, slamming a ball to right-center field for a two-run lead, and the Astros held on to win a game for the ages.
The Dodgers Unsung Weapon: A Shutdown Bullpen:::::Seven have featured so far.Kenley Jansen is the closer, with four saves in the postseason.His WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched) is a miserly 0.33, his earned run average a perfect 0.00.Jansen, 30, from Curacao, is an intimidating presence at 6 feet 5 inches and 275 pounds, and he has been an elite closer for the Dodgers for six seasons.But like many of his teammates, he is only now getting to throw in his first World Series.He and his setup man, Brandon Morrow, led the way with eight appearances each in the Dodgers nine games.Morrows nine and a third innings leads the team.He and Tony Watson are the hold men; Morrow has four and Watson three so far.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Kenta Maeda, signed last year from the Hiroshima Carp, has been shifted to the bullpen for the playoffs.He has not given up a hit in five innings and has been credited with two wins.Tony Cingrani, Josh Fields and Ross Stripling round out the group.The Dodgers were a comfortable 14 games up in the N.L.West at the end of July but did not stand pat, bolstering their relief by landing Cingrani from the Reds and Watson from the Pirates.Though the relievers have been impressive, it cannot be too surprising to those who paid attention during the regular season.The bullpens E.R.A.was 3.38, the best in the N.L.Jansen finished tied for second in saves behind Tampa Bays Alex Colome.His win probability added, a stat that tries to determine how much players contribute to victories, was 5.7, the best of any pitcher in the game.Houstons relievers were also effective in Game 1 of the Series: Brad Peacock and Chris Devenski did not give up a run.But over all, the Astros bullpen has not been as dominant, surrendering nine runs, for example, in the seven-game A.L.C.S.Plenty of fans will tell you that pitching plays an outsize role in the postseason.And ask any Yankee fan about Mariano Rivera to understand just how important a good bullpen can be.With the kind of numbers their relievers are putting up, the Dodgers are holding a big edge as the Series continues.
With a Crowd of Diverse Faces, Dodger Stadium Stands Out:::::Latino attendance can be seen in other ballparks, including Minute Maid Park in Houston, but the scene at Dodger Stadium seems to stand apart.Photo The diversity is fantastic, said Jaime Jarrin, the Dodgers longtime Spanish-language radio announcer.When I first started in this job, the Latinos coming to the ballpark were about 8 to 10 percent.Now, he said, he believes the figure to be around 45 percent.It is the most of any park, he added.Oh, by far.But we have also seen many Japanese people and Korean people here, too.Jarrin, who is originally from Ecuador, has been broadcasting Dodgers games since 1959.He said he has seen a steady uptick in fans at Dodger Stadium who come from various backgrounds.Assumptions about someones ethnic identity can prove false, and much of the available evidence about the diversity at Dodger Stadium is anecdotal.Stan Kasten, the Dodgers president, said he had no statistical data regarding the ethnic composition of the fans at Dodger Stadium.Still, he said the team cherished that its fan base was noticeably diverse.We are very proud of it, Kasten said.This is the organization of Jackie Robinson.The Dodgers were at the forefront, not only of breaking the color barrier, but we historically scoured the globe to find players.The Dodgers were the first to build an academy in the Dominican Republic.Were a global team, and that is something thats reflected in the stadium, too.When the Dodgers brought Robinson to the major leagues in 1947, he became the first African-American to break through baseballs wall of segregation, and many African-American fans were drawn to the team.In 1980, the Dodgers introduced Valenzuela, a charismatic left-handed pitcher from Navojoa, Mexico, who energized fans on both sides of the border with his unorthodox windup and stellar pitching.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Valenzuela, who now does commentary on Dodgers games alongside Jarrin, left the Dodgers after the 1990 season.But the legacy of Fernandomania is still felt today.Photo People who were into soccer and boxing, they became big baseball fans because of Fernando, Jarrin said.Many of them still love the Dodgers.And more players would come along and attract fans from various communities to Dodger Stadium.In 1994, the right-handed pitcher Chan Ho Park became the first player from South Korea to join the major leagues, and he tapped into the large Korean-American community in the Los Angeles area.The next year, the remnants of Fernandomania gave way to Nomomania, named for Hideo Nomo, the whirlwind Japanese pitcher who became such an instant sensation that fans from Japan would fly to Los Angeles for a weekend just to see him pitch.The Dodgers currently have two Japanese players on their playoff roster, the pitchers Kenta Maeda and Yu Darvish.There are also two players from Cuba (Yasiel Puig and Yasmani Grandal); one from Puerto Rico (Enrique Hernandez); and a pitcher, Hyun-jin Ryu, from Incheon, South Korea.When Ryu was pitching this summer, I was sitting with like 20 Korean fans, said the 55-year-old Varela, who works for a health care firm in Los Angeles.We were all together and we had so much fun.In recent years, the team has acquired popular Mexican-American players like Nomar Garciaparra, who delighted many fans by walking to his at-bats to the song Low Rider, by War, and Adrian Gonzalez, who is on the team but not on the playoff roster.There is also building excitement for Julio Urias, a 21-year-old left-handed pitcher from Culiacn, Mexico, who is injured.Photo When fans arrive at Dodger Stadium they are greeted by signs written in English and Spanish.Along the top of the visitors dugout the word Welcome is painted in English, Japanese, Spanish and Korean, and some fans wear blue shirts that read, Doyers, an affectionate reference to the way first-generation immigrants in Los Angeles sometimes pronounced the Dodgers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the Dodgers early relationship with Angelenos of Mexican descent was fraught with animosity and distrust after some residents of Chavez Ravine, where Dodger Stadium now sits, were forcibly evicted first to make room for a public-housing development that was never built and then, in 1958, for the stadium.Some of those evictions were captured on television news programs.But over time, that episode was mostly forgiven as fans jumped aboard the Dodgers wagon.For many Mexican-Americans, it was another example of how they were uprooted and pushed around, said Eric Avila, a professor of history at U.C.L.A.and the chairman of the Csar E. Chvez Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies.The Dodgers got off to a really bad start in Southern California.But in the end, people just loved baseball, and they eventually adopted the Dodgers.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Avila called Valenzuelas electrifying rookie season in 1981 a tipping point.From that point forward, the Dodgers actually became an expression of Mexican-American identity in Southern California.The Mexican-American community went nuts for Fernando, he said.They claimed him and the Dodgers as their own.The Dodgers are also still popular among a segment of African-American supporters, especially older fans who were initially drawn to the team that Robinson played for.But as with the rest of baseball, the Dodgers have struggled to attract a substantial number of African-American fans to games.Curtis Granderson, a Dodgers outfielder who is African-American and has also played in Detroit and New York, said he noticed the fan diversity at Dodgers games to a certain extent.I know theres a heavy Hispanic population and a white population here, Granderson said.I havent noticed a heavy black population.That doesnt mean it doesnt exist.But those two have definitely stood out the most to me.It is definitely a diverse group, and it should be.This is the second-largest city in the U.S., and you hope everyone is supporting the Dodgers.Photo Despite the early resentment created by the evictions at Chavez Ravine, Walter OMalley, who owned the Dodgers, made sure to broadcast games on Spanish radio to spread the gospel of the team among the local Spanish-speaking population, and the broadcasts helped create more Latino fans.One of them was Juan Arrieta, who grew up in the Los Angeles area listening to Jarrin describe Dodgers games in Spanish because Arrietas father, a mechanic from Peru, did not understand English well at the time.It was only recently that Arrieta discovered that Jarrin is actually from Ecuador, just north of Peru.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I always just assumed he was Mexican, Arrieta said, acknowledging how people can mislabel others.Isnt that awful?Now a 45-year-old bartender living in San Diego, Arrieta and his wife, Diane, who is of Mexican descent, attend a handful of Dodgers games each year, and were sitting in the bleachers at Game 2 of the National League Championship Series.I think the big difference nowadays is that you see people spread around the stadium, Arrieta said about Dodger Stadiums diversity.It used to be that we would sit in the upper deck or out in the pavilion.Now its not segregated like that anymore.And its not just Latino.When Maeda or Ryu pitch, you see a lot of Asian fans at the game, too.Its a real melting pot.After Game 1 of the World Series ended and happy Dodgers fans were congregating in the parking lot waiting to leave, Varela came upon an older white man who said he was originally from Brooklyn and had been a Dodgers fan since then.He was sharing stories with a younger Mexican-American fan from Los Angeles, and the two men snapped photos of themselves together.It doesnt matter what color you are or where you come from or what religion you are, she said.What matters is we all love baseball, and that unites us.
World Series 2017: How the Astros Won Game 2, Inning by Inning:::::Bottom 6th: Seager goes deep on Verlander.Justin Verlander needed just four pitches to retire Chase Utley and pinch-hitter Andre Ethier on a pair of fly-outs to center to start the inning, but that is when the trouble started.He walked Chris Taylor his second walk of the game, both of which were drawn by Taylor and got ahead, 0-2, on Corey Seager, but a 97 mile-per-hour fastball was right down the middle and Seager wasted no time hitting it out of the park to give his team the lead.Justin Turner popped out to end the inning, but the mighty Dodgers bullpen now has a lead to work with, which could be a big problem for Houston.Waldstein: Did that seem like a familiar script?A two-out walk to Chris Taylor and then a two-run homer to left by the next batter?In Game 1 it was Justin Turner with the smash.In Game 2 it was Corey Seager, who went opposite field with a pitch that Verlander left up in the zone.And Seager knew it was gone or at least had a good chance right away because he was screaming as the ball left the bat.All of the Dodgers runs so far in the series have come on four home runs.Now L.A. is 12 outs away from taking a 2-0 lead in the series by beating the Astros two best pitchers, and the Dodgers have a favorable pitching matchup in Game 3.Top 7th: Dodgers bullpen stays strong.Ross Stripling was the fourth Dodgers pitcher of the game and he lasted just four pitches, each of which was a ball.The walk to the struggling Marwin Gonzalez resulted in yet another pitching change, with Brandon Morrow coming in to face Josh Reddick, and the right-hander came through in a big way by getting Reddick to ground into a double play.He allowed a single to Evan Gattis, who was pinch-hitting for Justin Verlander, but finished off the inning by inducing a grounder to short from George Springer.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With Verlander now out of the game, his final line was six innings, two hits and three earned runs.He struck out five and walked two.Bottom 7th: Harris Keeps it close for Astros.With Will Harris on in relief for Houston, Cody Bellinger led off the inning and reached on a throwing error.He advanced to second on a curveball in the dirt that was ruled a wild pitch and went to third on a groundout by Yasiel Puig.But with the infield in to try to prevent a run, Joc Pederson struck out on five pitches.The infield returned to their normal positioning with two outs and Harris struck out Austin Barnes to end the inning.Photo Top 8th: Astros cut into Dodgers lead.Dave Roberts continued to be aggressive with pitching changes, but for the first time in the series he did not quite have the magic touch as the Astros narrowed the Dodgers lead to 3-2.After Alex Bregman led off the inning with a ground-rule double off Brandon Morrow, Roberts turned to his closer, Kenley Jansen, hoping for a six-out save.Jansen was able to get a groundout from Jose Altuve, but Bregman advanced to third on that play and then scored on a single by Carlos Correa.Jansen recovered to get a pop-out from Yulieski Gurriel and then ended the inning by striking out Brian McCann.Unless the Dodgers can extend the lead in the bottom of the 8th, Jansen will have just one run to work with in the ninth.Waldstein: The Astros finally break through against the Dodgers bullpen, which had not surrendered a run in 28 consecutive innings in the postseason.Jansen, who is being asked to get a 6-out save, was 41 for 42 in save opportunities in the regular season.He had one five-out save this year and earned a win in a two-inning performance in extra innings.He has a five-out save and a four-out save this postseason.Bottom 8th: Dodgers riding Jansen for six-out save.It was a quick inning for the Dodgers offense.Chase Utley flew out to left, pinch-hitter Kike Hernandez grounded out to short, and Chris Taylor flew out to left to end the inning.The Dodgers are three outs away from a 2-0 lead in the series with their dominant closer, Kenley Jansen, trying to finish a six-out save.Photo Top 9th: Gonzalez breaks out of slump to tie game.Kenley Jansen only had one six-out save in his career coming into todays game, and he will leave with only one after he allowed a game-tying solo homer to Marwin Gonzalez to start the ninth inning.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After the home run, Jansen got a quick out from Josh Reddick, who popped out to second, and retired pinch-hitter Carlos Beltran on a fly ball to center, but he allowed a two-out double to George Springer.With the go-ahead run on base, Jansen was able to stop the bleeding by retiring Alex Bregman on a grounder to short.With the Dodgers already having used five relievers, including their three best, they could run into manpower issues if this tie game stretches on for a while.Waldstein: It was only Jansens second blown save of the year.His first was July 23 in Atlanta when he gave up a game-tying, three-run home run to Matt Adams.But the Dodgers came back to win that game, 5-4, and are 98-0 when leading after 8 innings this year, including the postseason.Bottom 9th: Bellingers blast ends at warning track.Houston turned to their closer in the ninth and Ken Giles started things off by striking out Corey Seager.He retired Justin Turner on a grounder to short and narrowly escaped a walk-off home run when Cody Bellingers deep blast to right was caught at the warning track by Josh Reddick.This game is headed to extra innings.Photo Photo Top 10th: Back-to-back homers give Astros a lead.Houston badly needed its best hitters to start delivering, and Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa did that in a big way by starting the 10th inning with back-to-back home runs to give the Astros a 5-3 lead.The Dodgers ran out of top-shelf relievers, thanks to the aggressiveness of Dave Roberts in trying to protect a narrow lead earlier in the game, so Josh Fields came in for the 10th.Robertss aggressiveness had paid off throughout the postseason, but it backfired in Game 2, with Fields giving up the two home runs, and a double to Yulieski Gurriel, before being replaced by Tony Cingrani.Cingrani made quick work of the Astros, allowing just an intentional walk.Houston is now three outs away from victory.Waldstein: That was Altuves sixth postseason home run.Not too shabby.And Carlos Correa follows it up with another blast, the third by the Astros in the last two innings.Correa with an epic bat flip, too.This game, and the series, has pivoted in a hurry, and Dodger Stadium is very quiet.Photo Bottom 10th: Dodgers storm back to tie game.The Astros went ahead 5-3 in the top of the 10th, and sent their closer, Ken Giles, out for a second inning in hopes of finishing off the victory.The Dodgers had other plans.Yasiel Puig led off the inning with a home run, and after Giles struck out two batters, Los Angeles tied things up on a walk to Logan Forsythe and a single by Kike Hernandez.Chris Devenski relieved Giles, and with the winning run at second base, he got Chris Taylor to fly out to center to end the inning.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Waldstein: I have been at some great World Series games, and this one now joins the list.Leads have been erased, home runs all over the place, blown saves, classic bat flips, and to top it all off, the second base umpire, Laz Diaz, gets hit in the upper leg with a pickoff attempt.Had it not hit him, Kike Hernandez certainly would have been on third base, and that might have changed how Dvensky would have pitched to Taylor.When Forsythe slid home for the tying run, the upper decks of Dodger Stadium were swaying slightly.I remember that from Shea Stadium in 1999 and 2000.A bit unsettling.Photo Top 11th: Springer goes deep to put Astros on top.Brandon McCarthy was not on the N.L.C.S.roster for the Dodgers, but he was added as an extra arm for the World Series.Because the team was officially out of relievers, he was on the mound to try to keep Los Angeles in the game in the 11th.Cameron Maybin led off the inning with a single and stole second before George Springer, who had been ice-cold coming into the game, hit a monster blast to right-center that once again put the Astros on top.McCarthy ended the damage there, getting three quick outs, but the Dodgers now have three outs to stay alive in what has become a wild game.Bottom 11th: One more home run, but not enough for Dodgers.Chris Devenski was back out for a second inning of work and he started things off by getting Corey Seager to line out to center.That brought up Justin Turner, and the postseason hero for the Dodgers hit a liner that looked like it might sneak through the infield before Alex Bregman ranged to his left and was able to snare it for the second out.That brought up Charlie Culberson, and the last man on the Dodgers bench hit a two-out solo homer to center to narrow Houstons lead to one run, but that was as close as Los Angeles would get, as Yasiel Puig struck out to end the game.
On the Mound, the Dodgers Rich Hill Is Part Curveball, Part Crazy:::::Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts agreed: Hes absolutely crazy.He sees red.Hes bordering on psychotic, but in the best possible way.General Manager Farhan Zaidi did, too: Rich Hill is as much a Jekyll and Hyde personality as Ive seen on and off the field.The Dodgers have reached their first World Series in 29 years with a well-rounded roster, a deep farm system, the largest payroll in the sport and shrewd moves by the front office.The one unit that ranked first in all of baseball this season was their starting rotation, which posted a 3.39 earned run average.Photo That would not have been possible without the rotations depth, beginning with Clayton Kershaw, the best pitcher of this generation.Then there is Alex Wood, who was an All-Star this season; the formidable Yu Darvish, who was acquired in a midseason trade; and Hill, a left-hander whom the Dodgers traded for last season and, after being duly impressed by how he pitched, gave him a three-year, $48 million contract over the winter.Since the Cubs drafted Hill in 2002, he has been with 10 major league organizations, including two where he only pitched in the minors.While he has always had that competitive fire, Hill admitted it may have grown with the Dodgers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I really believe that effort and passion will beat talent every single time, he said.The 6-foot 5-inch Hill thrives on a funky delivery with his long limbs, a deceptive fastball that averages only 89 miles per hour and frequent use of one of the sports best curveballs.In 31 starts over a year and a half with the Dodgers, he has posted a 3.02 E.R.A.Hills controlled rage, as teammates call it, adds an extra wrinkle.People pay good money to come and watch a baseball game, and when I go out there Im giving everything I got every single time, Hill said.Whatever the results are, the results are going to be.If you come to watch a game where Im pitching, youre going to get that intense passion and understanding that the effort doesnt compromise.During a game, his facial expressions are something to behold.He scowls.He looks disturbed after rough innings, hands on his head, visibly frustrated.He rightfully looked distraught after losing a no-hit bid on a game-ending home run by the Pirates in the 10th inning of a game last August.After giving up a solo home run to Addison Russell of the Chicago Cubs in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series last week, Hill violently threw a cup of water onto the dugout floor and screamed.It was the only run he gave up in five innings, and the Dodgers later won the game, but his reaction was standard fare for Hill at least.If hes had a couple first innings where hes given up a run or two, then nothings safe, said Chris Taylor, the Dodgers leadoff hitter.Coolers arent safe.The gum tray, whatevers in there, you just kind of stay out of his way.But he does a great job of releasing that, and then he always seems to come back out there and give a quality outing.Photo Kenley Jansen, the Dodgers All-Star closer, said Hill was the nicest guy Ive ever met in baseball, period.He said he could sense that Hills competitiveness is derived from the setbacks he endured to get to where he is now.Jansen said that before heading out to the bullpen, he spends the first part of the game in the Dodgers clubhouse, where he can hear Hill screaming.Added Zaidi: If you happen to be hanging out in the clubhouse on days that he starts, you may hear noise rattling in the distance, and theres a good chance its Rich rearranging some equipment.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Zaidi said Hills intensity was actually reassuring and can rub off on teammates during the game because you know the guy going out there taking the ball feels that passionately about the game and nobody else is going to let up when they see that.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hill plays down his wild intensity when asked about it, perhaps because he is so easygoing off the mound.I cant really explain it unless Im standing in between the lines, he said.Its that boxers mentality of, when you get in the ring the other guy is trying to beat you.His on-field alter ego is so different than his off-field persona that his family will occasionally ask him about it.He just shrugs.Its a very difficult game, and its extremely hard to master, he said.But with the effort, intensity and passion, it makes it a heck of a lot easier to go home at night and know you gave everything that you could, rather then think back and regret.
Dodgers Overcome Heat, and Astros, in World Series Game 1:::::Over seven innings, Kershaw allowed three hits, did not walk a batter and racked up 11 strikeouts the most by one pitcher this season against the Astros, who had the fewest strikeouts of any team during the regular season.Houstons only run came on a fourth-inning home run by third baseman Alex Bregman, which soared into the left-field seats.Photo When Kershaw was done, Brandon Morrow retired the Astros in order in the eighth inning, and closer Kenley Jansen did the same in the ninth as the Dodgers seized a one-game-to-none lead in the Series.The record temperatures are not expected to abate for Game 2 on Wednesday, when the Dodgers left-hander Rich Hill will face the Astros right-hander Justin Verlander.If pitchers were forced to work in sauna-like conditions that were far different than the typically frigid World Series games played in the Midwest and Northeast, hitters did not mind.We treated it like a summer game in Cincinnati, Dodgers first baseman Cody Bellinger said.When its hot, the ball flies and we like that.The blistering heat, which shattered the previous World Series first-pitch record of 94 degrees set in 2001 in Phoenix when the Yankees played the Arizona Diamondbacks, did not dim the enthusiasm of the crowd, which relished the Dodgers first World Series appearance in 29 years.The visitors from Houston were relative newcomers to this stage, too.The Astros had been here only once before, in 2005, and they had the worst record in baseball as recently as 2013.To get to this Series, both franchises leaned heavily on analytics.The heads of baseball operations for each team the Dodgers Andrew Friedman and the Astros Jeff Luhnow had worked in the business world and arrived from other organizations where they had success through extensive use of data.Friedman constructed a perennial contender that reached the World Series as the general manager of the Tampa Bay Rays despite having one of baseballs smallest payrolls, while Luhnow helped feed talent to World Series teams as the St. Louis Cardinals head of scouting and player development.Photo After Luhnow was hired by the Astros after the 2011 season, the team endured several losing seasons to secure high draft picks to complement some of the young talent in the system, and it continued to make shrewd trades and free-agent signings.Friedman, who was hired after the 2014 season, took over a team that had won back-to-back division titles but had bigger ambitions under the Guggenheim Group, which had purchased the team for a record $2 billion two years earlier.Advertisement Continue reading the main story While Friedman set about drastically turning over the roster, the Dodgers continued to win.Only five players Turner, Kershaw, Jansen, and outfielders Yasiel Puig and Andre Ethier were on the major-league roster when Friedman arrived.The Dodgers now boast what is arguably the most versatile roster in baseball, allowing them to pick favorable matchups at their will.One of Friedmans most valuable finds has been Taylor, the utility player he plucked from the Seattle Mariners, who has reconfigured his swing and become a vital spark for the Dodgers offense, hitting 21 home runs in the regular season while playing center field and shortstop.Taylors home run, his third of the postseason, was the fourth leadoff homer in a World Series, the most recent one being Alcides Escobars inside-the-park home run for the Kansas City Royals two years ago against the Mets.I didnt overthink it, said Taylor, who modestly flipped his bat after he made contact.I was just going up there trying to get the barrel to the ball, thinking about being aggressive, and be ready to hit the first one.Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts hoped the weather would help his hitters if they could get the ball up in the air against Keuchel.But he conceded before the game it would be a difficult chore against a pitcher whose late movement and pinpoint control had allowed him to have the highest ground-ball-to-fly-ball rate (2.12) among starting American League pitchers.Photo It just comes down to discipline, trying to get a ball up, out, over use the big part of the field like everyone talks about, Roberts said.Light air today its going to be hot so I think for us to try to get underneath it and try to put the ball in the air.With him obviously, its a tall task.If Keuchel, who had not allowed a leadoff home run in more than five years, was stunned by Taylors thunderbolt, he did not come unglued.He allowed only four more hits two singles to Corey Seager and one each to Enrique Hernandez and Austin Barnes and all but one were erased by a double play.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Keuchel did appear to be spooked by Taylor, who lined into a double play in his second at-bat and walked on five pitches with two out in the sixth.That brought up Turner, whose bushy, unkempt red beard, matches Keuchels distinctive facial hair that runs to the collar of his jersey.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Keuchel worked the count to 1-2 and came inside with a cut fastball that was belt high.Turner pulled his hands in and lifted a high, fly ball to left field.Astros outfielder Marwin Gonzalez drifted back on the ball as if he had a play on it, but after he reached the warning track and then the wall, he looked up helplessly as it landed in the pavilion.I didnt think it was going out by any means, Keuchel said.It wasnt an easy pitch to hit.I was trying to get in on him and I thought it did.He didnt square it up by any means.Turner acknowledged that he had gotten a helping hand from the weather.If its 10 degrees cooler, thats probably a routine fly ball, Turner said.Photo The home run upped Turners career postseason R.B.I.total to 26, tying the franchise record set by Duke Snider.Fourteen of those have come this season for Turner, the former Mets castoff.The two home runs were enough for Kershaw, who has won three Cy Young Awards but has had a spotty October rsum.He had been good but not dominant since his return in early September from a five-week stint on the disabled list with a sore back.On Tuesday, though, he was at his best, complementing his two best pitches a fastball and a knee-buckling curve with a sharp slider.His fellow Dodgers pitcher Brandon McCarthy said Kershaw had been close but not all the way there.Tonight, McCarthy added, that looked like that was the genuine article.Kershaw allowed only three hits the homer to Bregman, a third-inning single to Josh Reddick and a seventh-inning single to Jose Altuve.And besides the hits, Kershaw allowed just three balls to be hit out of the infield.On a night when the air was as thin as it was hot, that proved to be the difference.
The Lakers? Who Are They? L.A. Is a Dodgers Town These Days:::::It takes quite a performance to rally the populace in a city where more stars are visible on the streets than in the sky and where entertainment is a profession for so many of its citizenry.But this years Dodgers have galvanized Los Angeles with their 104 regular-season victories; their relievers who have combined for 23 scoreless innings in the postseason; their presumptive rookie of the year, Cody Bellinger; their possible Cy Young winner, Clayton Kershaw; their tongue-wagging, bat-licking, hit-scorching man-child, Yasiel Puig; and their Mr. Red October, Justin Turner.For the first time in 29 years, the Dodgers are the last National League team standing in the postseason.For a proud franchise that won six championships in a 33-year span, the wait to return to the World Series has seemed biblical in its length.The end of the drought has made die-hard fans delirious and more casual followers of the team pretty fanatical, too.Photo And so minutes after Culberson caught a line drive off the bat of the Chicago Cubs Willson Contreras last Thursday night for the final out that clinched the pennant for the Dodgers, Cecilia Geers went on the StubHub ticket site on her computer in search of Series tickets.She found single tickets for sale in the top deck in left field for $750, which struck her as a bargain for a once-in-a-lifetime experience.Geers, a Los Angeles native, was born 30 days after the Dodgers final game of the 1989 season, when they finished 77-83, a far cry from the title they had won the year before.Throughout her childhood, Geers accompanied her father to a few games every season.It was almost always at his suggestion, and he sweetened the invitation by letting her eat whatever she wanted at the concession stands.And so she gorged on soft-serve ice cream in a miniature helmet, pizza, frozen lemonade and chocolate malts, even as team after team left her hungry for something more substantial.As she grew older, her tastes matured.For the past few years, Geers has appreciated the mastery of Kershaw and the mischievousness of the Cuban-born Puig, whom she follows on social media because hes hilarious, she said.In Geerss lifetime, the Dodgers havent exactly been a joke; before this year they had advanced to the postseason 10 times, including four trips to the National League Championship Series.But close didnt cut it when, in the same period, the Lakers were winning five N.B.A.titles, the Kings were winning two N.H.L.titles, and the Anaheim-based Angels and Ducks were each winning a championship.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There was a reason that in January of last year, a headline in HuffPost read, Los Angeles is a Lakers Town.Of course, 21 months later that reads like fake news.The Lakers, seven years removed from their last championship season, are rebuilding, and Rachelle Tachiquin, who drives a black Honda sedan with a California vanity license plate that reads DGRFN81 gets thumbs-up and honks from fellow drivers with whom she shares the overcrowded roads.I have a lot of people stop and compliment me, said Tachiquin, who was indeed born in 1981, when the Dodgers beat the Yankees in the Series.This time around, she will get to see every Series game in her capacity as an usher along the third-base side of Dodger Stadium.Photo Geers, however, wont be there.She reached out to her parents and asked if they would buy her a ticket to one of the first two Series games as a gift for her birthday, which falls on Halloween.They found the $750 price that she quoted frightful, and so, along with likely millions of other Southern Californians, Geers will have to settle for watching the telecast.But just being able to watch the games on television is a treat; because of a continuing cable dispute much of the Southern California market does not have access to telecasts of Dodgers games during the regular season.Seeing a team you rooted for all your life finally make it, even though it wasnt as long a drought as the Cubs had, it was still my lifetime so its a really big deal, Geers said.So how much has Los Angeles changed since the Dodgers last World Series appearance?Theres less smog and more traffic, Mike Scioscia said with a laugh.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Scioscia was a member of the upstart 1988 Dodgers team that won the World Series in five games over the Oakland Athletics for the franchises second title of the decade.Since 2000, he has managed the Los Angeles Angels, whom he led to their first World Series crown in 2002 in the franchises 42nd season.Some of my friends are saying 29 years is long enough, Scioscia said Monday by telephone.I had to remind them that the Angels had to wait longer.But Scioscia understands.The Dodgers have always been a captivating force out here because of their history and tradition, he said.When they came here from Brooklyn they already had a national audience and the expectations are high because of that history and tradition.The franchise also arrived in Los Angeles with Vin Scully, who began broadcasting Dodgers games in 1950 and didnt stop until his retirement at the end of last season.The last time the Dodgers were in the World Series, Scully called the games for NBC.His voice was the cord that braided together generations of Dodgers fans.For many, this postseason has been akin to that first holiday meal without a beloved family member.Photo Not having Vin doing the games makes this postseason bittersweet, said Valerie Medina, who was waiting in line Saturday to enter the team store.She had made the trip the day before only to discover that the pennants and caps she sought had sold out.If he could come and do one game, that would be awesome.But Im glad for him that he gets to watch the games as a fan with his family.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Online petitions to bring Scully back for the World Series collected thousands of signatures, but Scully has been adamant about remaining outside the spotlight, declining through the Dodgers an interview request.He has attended a few of this seasons playoff games as a fan, and during one such visit to Dodger Stadium, Scully stopped in the broadcast booth of his longtime friend, Jaime Jarrin, who is concluding his 59th season as the teams Spanish-language broadcaster.Jarrin, who is from Ecuador and who from 1962 to 1984 put together a Cal Ripken-esque string of consecutive game broadcasts, described Scully as my teacher, my idol, my mentor and my friend.He said he told Scully, Even though you wont be here, youll be in my booth spiritually.Still around, too, is Tommy Lasorda, who is 90 and who managed the Dodgers to their two championships in the 1980s.Back then, he sometimes held court in a booth at the Pacific Dining Car, an old-time, downtown, 24-hour eating establishment where the waiters wear pressed jackets, the walls are paneled and the tables are covered in white linen.The owner of the restaurant is Wes Idol III, whose great-grandfather opened it in 1921.Idol has a personal tie to this years Dodgers.In the summer of 1995, he headed to Massachusetts with a friend named John Beaton Hill to interview baseball players for a screenplay.On that trip, Idol met his friends 15-year-old brother.That brother, Rich Hill, would grow up to be a major league pitcher who went through a great deal of adversity on the field before becoming a crucial member of the Dodgers starting rotation.And once in Los Angeles, Rich Hill was also reunited with his brother, who is now a filmmaker.Its the quintessential L.A. story; a man moves to the city in pursuit of his creative dreams.Years later, his brother joins him after an arduous baseball journey finally leads somewhere.And now the Dodgers could soon be champions.Yes, Rich Hill acknowledged.Its fun.A lot of other people in Los Angeles would seem to agree.
To Measure Jose Altuve, Just Watch Him Soar:::::Altuves all-around skills have made him, in the words of Astros Manager A. J. Hinch, the games perfect player.This season, he led the majors in hitting at .346 while delivering 24 homers, 32 stolen bases and his usual stellar defense at second base.Teammates and opponents marvel at his uncanny ability to strike any pitch, anywhere, with the barrel of the bat.He hit .500 for a whole month this year, Astros catcher Brian McCann said, referring accurately to Altuves torrid stretch from June 27 through July 27.Hes playing a different game.I did that in high school.As for the Hall of Fame, McCullers was not overstating things.Altuve, 27, has 1,250 hits in his career.Only three players in the top 10 list Pete Rose, Ty Cobb and Hank Aaron had more hits through their age-27 season.Photo Dallas Keuchel, the Astros Game 1 starter on Tuesday, said Altuve had the best hand-eye coordination he had ever seen.They were teammates on the Tri-City ValleyCats, the Astros affiliate in Troy, N.Y., in 2009.Altuve was 19 then and in his third pro season after signing from Venezuela for just $15,000 (no other teams had shown interest).Keuchel remembers hearing Altuves nonstop chatter in the back of the bus and thinking it sounded as if he had not yet hit puberty.He sounded like he shouldnt even have been playing baseball, Keuchel said, but the more they played together, with the Lancaster JetHawks and the Corpus Christi Hooks, the more those hand-eye skills signaled stardom.I didnt know that he was going to actually be this good, Keuchel said.I thought he was going to be an All-Star, but to win the M.V.P., which he should and honestly, he should have been in the race the last three or four years and I couldnt be happier for the guy, because he is an all-American dude.An All-American dude, you could say, who represents the essence of the All-American game.Walk past an N.F.L.or N.B.A.star on the street, and chances are you could guess his profession.With most of the best baseball players, you would never know.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Chris Sale, the strikeout king of the Boston Red Sox, is a string bean: 6-6 and 180 pounds.Dustin Pedroia, the longtime Boston second baseman whom Altuve called an inspiration, is easily shorter than his listed height of 5-9.The greatest pure hitters of modern times Tony Gwynn and Ichiro Suzuki could not have looked more different: Gwynn lumbering (in later years), Suzuki forever lithe.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.When physical outliers play with Altuves verve, their appeal can be irresistible.I bet kids disproportionately love Jose Altuve, like kids disproportionately loved Kirby Puckett and Ozzie Smith, said the broadcaster Bob Costas, citing undersized but spirited Hall of Famers.Their size makes them stand out, and their energy and joy transmits easily.If youre 9 years old, youre not deeply into analytics but you can deeply appreciate those guys.Naturally, Altuve grades high analytically: According to Baseball Reference, , only Mike Trout and Josh Donaldson have compiled more wins above replacement among position players over the last four seasons.This year Altuve ranked first, just ahead of Aaron Judge, the hulking Yankees slugger.Size can help, clearly, but for such highly specialized skills, it doesnt always matter.Not in baseball, if you have the ability, said Dave Hudgens, the Astros hitting coach.And the thing about Jose, too, is that pound for pound, he might be the strongest guy in the league.Incredibly strong.He squats 400 pounds, his core is really strong, and hes developed the knee-cock, which has enabled him to hit for more power.Photo Marwin Gonzalez, the utility player who led the Astros in runs batted in this season with 90, has known Altuve since they played in the Venezuelan winter league at 17.He remembers Altuve adding that power-hitting technique after already winning the first of his three major league batting titles, with a .341 average in 2014.Altuve hit seven homers that season, and 24 in each of the last two.Its never enough for him, Gonzalez said.He says that theres always room to get better, and I believe it.That first batting title heralded so much to come.Altuve clinched it on the final day of the season the very last day before the Astros made their move from 92-loss also-rans to a wild-card winner and a perennial contender.Of the 13 players the Astros used that afternoon against the Mets, only Altuve is on the World Series roster.Gonzalez was on the bench that day and remembers how teammates urged Altuve to sit out.He was hitting .340, three points better than Detroits Victor Martinez, who could not have closed the gap without a big day.He didnt want to win it that easy, Gonzalez said.He worked a lot for that.Everybody was telling him in the clubhouse, Just sit down, it wasnt necessary, you dont know when youre going to have that opportunity.Some players just win one batting title, and thats it.But he didnt listen to us.He went out there and competed, and thats what he does every day.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Three years earlier at Citi Field, the Mets Jose Reyes had left the season finale after a first-inning bunt single ensured him the batting title.Altuve played the full game in 2014, went 2 for 4 and said he never considered asking out.I played 150-something games; I dont think the last one would have made the difference, he said.If you want to win something, I dont think it would be very honest if I would have sat down that day.If I sat down, it would have been automatic.I dont think Victor had any chance of catching me.Thats why I was like, We got to play fair.I have to go out there and play, because hes playing that day.As valiant final-day performances go, it does not quite rank with Ted Williams in 1941, when he risked losing a .400 average and instead rapped six hits in a doubleheader to finish at .406.But it symbolized something powerful in its simplicity: a desire just to play, for the sake of the game and the integrity of the competition.The baseball gods must have looked on approvingly.Altuves career has ascended ever since, and now he has reached another peak.
How the Dodgers Won World Series Game 1, Inning by Inning:::::Baseball has worked to improve pace over the last several years, and Game 1 could serve as the blueprint for speeding things up.In the two hour and 28 minute game the shortest World Series game since 1992 the teams combined to throw just 211 pitches.There were only two walks and nine hits, and beyond the three home runs nothing went for extra-bases.Perhaps most important to the pace, there was only one mid-inning pitching change.It helps to have two Cy Young Award-winning pitchers on the mound.- Want exclusive sports news, highlights and analysis from a rotating cast of New York Times journalists, delivered to your inbox once a week?Click here to receive our weekly Sports newsletter.- Heres how the Dodgers won Game 1 of the World Series: Photo Top 1st: Clayton Kershaw delivers ...The 2017 World Series is underway.The first pitch of Game 1 was thrown by Clayton Kershaw at 8:11 p.m. Eastern.The 94 mile-per-hour fastball was fouled off by George Springer.Kershaw finished Springer off in four pitches, striking him out on a slider that dove toward the center fielders feet.Alex Bregman flew out to left, and Jose Altuve grounded out to shortstop, giving Kershaw a perfect inning on just nine pitches.Seven of his nine pitches were strikes.Waldstein: Clayton Kershaw looking sharp at the outset.As colleague Tyler Kepner pointed out, he recorded three outs on his three pitches: Fastball, slider, curve.Kepner, who is sitting beside me and will have fascinating insight all game, also noted that as much as people laud Kershaws curveball, his slider is really his most devastating pitch.Photo Bottom 1st: Taylor puts Dodgers on the board.Chris Taylor got the Dodgers on the board first, hitting Dallas Keuchels first pitch of the World Series well over the left field wall for a 1-0 lead.The breakout performer for the Dodgers, who has firmly established himself as the teams leadoff batter, was sitting on a fastball and got one right down the middle.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Keuchel settled down to strike out Justin Turner on seven pitches.Cody Bellinger was retired on a groundout to second, and Yasiel Puig grounded out to short to end the inning.For 10 of Keuchels 11 pitches he looked dominant, but he cant get back that first offering to Taylor.Top 2nd: Kershaw cruises through middle of order.Staked to a lead, Clayton Kershaw started off the inning by retiring Carlos Correa on a fly ball to center field.He caught Yulieski Gurriel sleeping on a 94 mile-per-hour fastball that sailed right through the zone for strike three.And then he induced a ground ball from Brian McCann which second baseman Logan Forsythe fielded in shallow right field before throwing him out to end the inning.Kepner: The Dodgers ballpark organist played a few bars of Paint It Black by the Rolling Stones after Kershaw painted the black (hit the corner) to strike out Yuli Gurriel in the top of the second.Pretty sharp.Photo Bottom 2nd: Keuchel settles in after early disaster.Dallas Keuchel has continued to look strong since his first pitch of the game went for a home run.Kike Hernandez got things started in the half-inning by singling to left but Corey Seager, making his return to the team after missing the N.L.C.S.with back trouble, grounded into an easy double-play to erase the threat.Logan Forsythe was nearly out on a foul pop to right field that a diving Josh Reddick couldnt handle, but on the next pitch he ended the inning by popping out to center.Top 3rd: Astros get a base runner, but thats it.The Astros got their first hit of the game, but they were not able to do anything with the base runner.Clayton Kershaw started the inning by getting another called strike three, this time to Marwin Gonzalez, but Josh Reddick, the former Dodger, followed that up with a hard grounder to right that scooted just past Cody Bellingers glove for Houstons first hit.Dallas Keuchel, who seemed lost trying to bunt Reddick over to second, ended up striking out on a foul bunt attempt, and then George Springer flailed at strike three to end the inning.Kershaw now has five strikeouts.Photo Kepner: Josh Reddick went 0 for 22 before his first hit in the ALCS.So, naturally, he gets a left-on-left single against Kershaw in his first at-bat of the World Series.The fans here have been booing Reddick every chance they get, as he predicted.They didnt like him when he played here last year, and the feeling apparently is mutual.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Thats 5 strikeouts in 10 batters for Kershaw: two on sliders, two on fastballs, and one on a curveball.Even more impressive considering that the Astros had the fewest strikeouts in the majors this season.Bottom 3rd: Taylor hits it hard again.Too hard.The leadoff batter for the Dodgers reached for the third consecutive inning, as Austin Barnes hit a grounder through the infield into shallow left for a single.Clayton Kershaw, who has considerably more experience as a batter than Dallas Keuchel, showed him how the National League does things with a bunt that sent Barnes to second.But Chris Taylor, who started the game with a home run on the first pitch he saw, ended the inning by hitting a rope to shortstop Carlos Correa, who easily doubled Barnes off second base to end the inning.Kepner: It hardly seemed likely at the time, but the Dodgers got two Game 1 World Series starters in the same deal in Dec. 2014: Enrique Hernandez and Austin Barnes.The Dodgers got those two, plus pitchers Chris Hatcher and Andrew Heaney, from the Marlins for Dee Gordon, Dan Haren and Miguel Rojas.Photo Top 4th: Bregman takes Kershaw deep.The game is tied.Alex Bregman took Clayton Kershaws third pitch of the inning over the wall in left-center for a home run, evening the score at 1-1.It was the seventh home run that Kershaw has allowed this postseason.Going back to the regular season, he has now allowed at least one homer in nine consecutive games.After allowing Bregmans blast, Kershaw got consecutive called strike threes on Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa, with home plate umpire Phil Cuzzi giving him some help on a low slider that retired Altuve.Yulieski Gurriel swung helplessly at a slider to end the half-inning, and Kershaw is up to eight strikeouts.Waldstein: I spoke to Carlos Beltran yesterday and he was raving about Bregman.Beltran said Bregman just has an unquenchable thirst for the game and always wants to talk baseball.They often go over video of pitchers and Beltran said sometimes they do their video scouting back at the hotel.Bregman picked a really good guy to learn from.Bregman, at 23 years and 208 days, became the youngest American League player to hit a home run in the World Series since Manny Ramirez for Cleveland against Atlanta in 1995.Ramirez was 60 days younger.Bottom 4th: Dodgers struggle to hit Keuchel hard.It was a remarkably quiet half-inning for the Dodgers.Justin Turner popped out to first, Cody Bellinger grounded out to first, and Yasiel Puig grounded out to short.Dallas Keuchel continues to induce soft contact to great effect.Kepner: Hes one section out of view from the center field cameras, but Scott Boras, the powerful agent who sits directly behind home plate in Anaheim, is here in the front row just to the third-base side of the plate.Boras represents both teams No.3 hitters Jose Altuve and Cody Bellinger.Neither has hit free agency yet; Bellinger is a rookie, and the Astros control Altuves rights on a bargain deal (signed with a different agent) through 2019.Here are Altuves salaries: 2014: $1.25M, 15: $2.5M, 16: $3.5M, 17: $4.5M, 18: $6M club option, 19: $6.5M club option.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Top 5th: Kershaw and Keuchel are dueling.This game has settled into a solid pitchers duel (minus the two solo homers) and it continued with Clayton Kershaw having yet another perfect inning.Brian McCann grounded right into the shift to start things off, and then Kershaw got some help from his defense when Justin Turner handled an awkward bounce on a grounder from Marwin Gonzalez, throwing out Gonzalez easily at first.Kershaw then ended the half-inning by freezing Josh Reddick with a 95 mile-per-hour fastball for strike three.Waldstein: With two good pitchers doing their thing minus one home run each this game is moving along at a rapid pace.Kershaw is getting strikeouts and Keuchel inducing ground balls.Kershaw has nine strikeouts already against the team that struck out the least in baseball.His stuff is very crisp.Photo Bottom 5th: Double play gets Keuchel out of inning.Dallas Keuchel got his second strikeout of the game on a changeup to Kike

How the Astros Became an American League Team:::::The Astros joined the A.L.in 2013 to balance the leagues with three divisions of five teams each.Since 1998, when Arizona and Tampa Bay joined the league as expansion teams and the Milwaukee Brewers moved to the National League, there had been a four-team division in the A.L.and a six-team division in the N.L.Photo The Astros were chosen as the team to switch in part as an effort to create a rivalry with the Texas Rangers in the A.L.West.Because the National League had, on balance, bigger cities, the move to the A.L.was considered a negative by many fans, so much so that the teams new owners were compensated $70 million to offset possible reduced television money.The Astros are the first team to make the World Series with each league.The only other team to switch leagues in modern times, the Brewers, has only one playoff series win since joining the N.L.The Astros N.L.high point was a World Series trip in 2005; they wound up being swept by the Chicago White Sox.Outside of that year, the Astros playoff record was poor in the N.L.: one series win in nine tries.Since moving to the A.L., their playoff series record is 3-1.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.A division or conference switch in other North American sports is unlikely to cause a huge commotion.But baseball for many years kept a clean separation of its two leagues, making such a switch more disruptive.Most notably, teams from different leagues did not play one another in the regular season, adding a frisson to the rare times they did, like the All-Star Game and the World Series.Leagues also maintained distinct identities.They had separate league offices, and their umpires dressed differently (A.L.umps wore their chest protectors outside their uniforms).There were rules, large and small, that differed.Fans of the National League, founded in 1876, dismissed the American League, which became a major league in 1901, as the junior circuit.In recent times, rules have become standardized.The debut of interleague play in 1997 took away the most unusual quirk of the leagues.The only significant distinction left is the designated hitter rule, still controversial enough to start a barroom argument.As time moves on, the memories of the Astros as a National League team will fade, and any future trips to the World Series will probably not cause many double takes.
World Series Preview: A Matchup With No Underdog:::::The engine of each teams offense has a look all his own.Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner revels in his long, red hair and shaggy beard and hit .322 with a robust .945 on-base plus slugging percentage this season.Astros second baseman Jose Altuve is the shortest everyday player in the majors at 5 feet 6 inches but this season hes probably the best player, too.Altuve led the majors in batting average, at .346, and hit .400 in the A.L.playoffs.Jose Altuve is a perfect player, Astros Manager A.J.Hinch said this month, and who could argue?Other notables dot the lineups the newcomer Cody Bellinger and the old pro Chase Utley for the Dodgers; the homegrown sensations Carlos Correa and George Springer for the Astros and both pitching staffs include an ace yearning for a championship.The Dodgers Clayton Kershaw, 29, and the Astros Justin Verlander, 34, have won the Most Valuable Player Award, and will probably spend their golden years gathering on a stage in Cooperstown every July.But neither has a World Series title to his name.Kershaw, who will start Game 1 against another top left-hander, Dallas Keuchel, went 18-4 and led the National League in earned run average for the fifth time, with a 2.31 mark.He reached 200 strikeouts for the seventh time, and despite middling postseason numbers over all (6-7, 4.40 E.R.A.), the Dodgers have now won eight of his last nine playoff appearances.His desire to be great is relentless, said Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers president of baseball operations, after the N.L.C.S was over.You watch how he prepares, you watch how he goes about his work every fifth day, and for all that he has put into this game, knowing how badly he wants to pitch in a World Series, Im overcome with joy for him that he gets to experience this.Kershaw has spent his entire 10-year career with the Dodgers, while the Astros are just getting to know Verlander, who joined them in a trade from Detroit on Aug. 31, moments before his eligibility for the postseason would have run out.Verlander has taken the mound nine times for Houston, postseason included and gone 9-0 with a 1.23 E.R.A.He brings elite pitching and star power to the World Series; his fiance, the supermodel Kate Upton, wore a 1980s-vintage Astros warm-up jacket, with the old rainbow design, to the on-field celebration after the final game of the A.L.C.S.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I just congratulated him, and told him I was proud of him and what he had done, said Nolan Ryan, an Astros executive and Hall of Fame pitcher, after Verlander was named the most valuable player of the series.He stepped up and hes a big part of this ball club.I enjoy power pitchers, and he was a real pleasure to watch.Verlander will start Game 2 of the World Series on Wednesday, probably against the Dodgers Rich Hill.The series starters should also feature the All-Stars Yu Darvish (in his final performance or two before free agency) and Alex Wood for the Dodgers, and the Astros shutout duo from Game 7 against the Yankees, Charlie Morton and McCullers.Teams driven by stats or by names, they dont do anything, they dont get anywhere, Morton said in the raucous clubhouse after Game 7 of the A.L.C.S.Teams with grit, a tight-knit bond, those teams outperform expectations.That may be true, but both of these teams were expected to contend, and both fulfilled their promise all year long.Photo Leading Off With a Bang The Astros use their best power hitter, George Springer, in the leadoff spot.He went just 3 for 26 in the A.L.C.S., but bashed 34 homers in the regular season with a strong .367 on-base percentage.Hes an incredible tone-setter his presence, his energy, his knowledge of the strike zone, his threat to do exactly what he did tonight, Hinch said after Springer homered in a victory this summer.Hes a middle-of-the-order bat whos leading off the game, and once it rolls back around, you can see how productive he can be getting the most at-bats of the night.Dangerous Curves As fastball velocity rises in the majors, use of the curveball with its greater speed variation than the slider is also up.No two starters throw more curves than the Astros McCullers and the Dodgers Hill.McCullers, who silenced the Yankees with a flurry of curveballs to close out Game 7 of the A.L.C.S., threw curveballs on 47.4 percent of his pitches in the regular season, by far the most for any major leaguer with at least 100 innings.Hill ranked second, with 37.5 percent curveballs.McCullers throws the pitch much harder than Hill, with an average velocity near 86 miles an hour, compared to about 74 m.p.h.for Hill.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Unassuming Champions Besides Bellinger, no Dodger hit 30 homers or drove in 80 runs this season.But if their offense seems underwhelming, consider the lineup for their last World Series game, in 1988: Steve Sax, Franklin Stubbs, Mickey Hatcher, Mike Marshall, John Shelby, Mike Davis, Rick Dempsey, Jeff Hamilton, Alfredo Griffin.Nobody on that Dodger team had more than 25 homers or 82 runs batted in, but with stellar pitching (including two complete games from Orel Hershiser) and the timeliest of all timely hitting (Kirk Gibsons iconic homer to end Game 1), the Dodgers upset the Oakland As in five games.A Complete Player.Almost.Few players have ever matched the all-around skills and longevity of the Astros Carlos Beltran.He is one of five players with at least 2,700 hits, 400 homers, 300 steals and multiple Gold Gloves, along with Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez, Willie Mays and Andre Dawson.Yet only two of those players Rodriguez and Mays have won the World Series.Beltran lost in his previous appearance, with St. Louis in 2013.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Catching On While Houstons catcher is the seven-time All-Star Brian McCann, the Dodgers Austin Barnes keeps a lower profile.A backup to Yasmani Grandal for most of the season, Barnes emerged to start six of the Dodgers eight games in the playoffs.The team acquired him with Enrique Hernandez from Miami in a seven-player deal in December 2014 that sent second baseman Dee Gordon to the Marlins.Barnes, who by then had played part of just one season above Class A, supports the theory that minor league numbers translate to the majors: his on-base percentage in the minors, .388, matches his on-base percentage for the Dodgers, and his slugging percentage (.439 in the minors, .430 for the Dodgers) is nearly identical.Reminder of Home Jansen wears No.74, a number worn by only nine other players in major league history.For Jansen, it was not simply a high number assigned randomly one spring training.He chose it to honor the street address of his boyhood home in Willemstad, Curacao.His parents had struggled to keep the house after Jansens father suffered a stroke when Jansen was 12.Baseball success has taken care of the mortgage.The short story is I helped my parents save the house, Jansen said a few years ago.We had good times, good memories over there, and also we went through a lot of tough times with the 74.Thats why Im wearing it.Photo Name That Team Neither team began with its current nickname.For their first three seasons, the Astros were known as the Colt .45s, after a suggestion from a fan named William Neder, who wrote in a contest entry, The Colt .45 won the West and will win the National League.In the team logo, smoke rose from a pistol to form the C in Colts.In December 1964, with the Colt firearms company considering a lawsuit over merchandising rights, the team owner Roy Hofheinz changed the name to Astros to capitalize on the space race.The name and insignia will help dispel the image of Texas as a land of cowboys and Indians, Hofheinz said.The Dodgers went through several names in their early years in Brooklyn Atlantics, Grays, Bridegrooms, Superbas, Robins.In the 1930s, the name Dodgers for folks who dodged trolley cars on their way across busy Brooklyn streets finally stuck.Name That Tune Visitors to Minute Maid Park know the word coyotes has only two syllables: those are ky-oats who wail along the trail in the clap-along seventh-inning stretch anthem Deep in the Heart of Texas.Likewise, fans at Dodger Stadium from the South Bay to the Valley, from the West Side to the East Side groove along to Randy Newmans I Love L.A. after every win.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Two No.32s Both teams have 10 retired numbers, including No.32 for a pitcher.The Dodgers 32 honors the Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax, but the Astros honoree is far less known.In April 1964, before the Dodgers or most teams had retired any numbers, the Astros then still known as the Colt .45s retired 32 for Jim Umbricht, a top reliever in their first two seasons as an expansion team.After posting a 2.01 E.R.A.in 1962, Umbricht was found to have a malignant tumor in his leg.He returned after surgery and pitched well again, but died of lymphoma the next spring at age 33.Photo Familiar Faces If you miss seeing Mary Hart on Entertainment Tonight, for which she was a host from 1982 to 2011, you can still find her on TV, on the far right of your screen behind the home plate for games at Dodger Stadium with her husband, Burt Sugarman.In roughly the same seating location for the games at Houstons Minute Maid Park, youll see Nolan Ryan with his wife, Ruth.And youll almost surely see the ubiquitous Marlins Man a Miami lawyer and sports superfan named Laurence Levy in his trademark orange jersey and visor somewhere close by.An Orbit All His Own The Dodgers are one of just three teams without a mascot, joining the Yankees and the Los Angeles Angels on the no-fun list.Luckily, the Astros have Orbit, a fat and furry green prankster with little baseballs affixed to his antennas.Orbit, who likes to shed his shirt and streak across the field to celebrate winning streaks (get it?), is known for playfully teasing the players; he held a sign reading Im Not Touching You while hovering inches from the head of the notoriously twitchy Adrian Beltre.Orbit is a rival of the Tampa Bay Rays Chris Archer, who presented him with a formal Declaration of Unfriendliness after a series of madcap antics this summer.Common Alumni The Dodgers Hernandez and Josh Fields are former Astros, and Houstons Josh Reddick has played for Los Angeles.Outfielder Jimmy Wynn, known as the Toy Cannon, ranks fourth on the Astros career home run list and played for the Dodgers in the 1974 World Series.Don Sutton, the Dodgers career leader in wins, losses, shutouts and strikeouts, left the team as a free agent to join the Astros in 1981.He fractured a kneecap in his final start of that season and missed the playoffs, but several others have played in the postseason for both teams, including Fields, Reddick, Enos Cabell, Danny Heep, Jose Lima, Davey Lopes, Jeff Kent and Rafael Landestoy.Playoff History A meeting of former National League West rivals, this World Series feels a bit like the 2014 Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and the Denver Broncos; for decades, the matchup occurred multiple times every regular season.But the Astros, who moved to the A.L.in 2013, did face the Dodgers in a playoff series after the strike-shortened 1981 season, when baseball staged a best-of-five series between the first- and second-half winners of each division.The Astros who had beaten the Dodgers in a one-game playoff to win the West the year before took the first two games in Houston but dropped the last three at Dodger Stadium.Nolan Ryan had no-hit the Dodgers two weeks before, but he lost the finale to Jerry Reuss, who spun a five-hitter against his former team to send Los Angeles on its way to a championship.
Mets Have a Clear Goal for Mickey Callaway: Fix Their Pitching:::::I think youre always taking a gamble, Alderson said.Youre always taking a risk on somebody.Nobody is the perfect candidate or the perfect interview, either.Theres always risk in choosing 1 out of 6 or 1 out of 36.But we feel very good.Callaway, who was Clevelands pitching coach for the past four seasons, directed a group that in 2017 posted the lowest combined E.R.A.in the majors (3.30), led the league in strikeouts (1,614) and issued the fewest walks (406).The won-loss record and E.R.A.of Clevelands starting staff (81-38, 3.52) was the best in baseball, and the teams ace, Corey Kluber, is a leading candidate to win the American League Cy Young Award, which he won in 2014.Callaway is also credited with the development of Trevor Bauer, who went from a sub-.500 pitcher in his first four seasons to having a 17-9 record in 2017.Clearly, the Mets are hoping Callaway can work similar wonders with their own pitching staff, which was decimated by injuries in 2017 and posted a 5.01 E.R.A., third-worst in the majors.People are reluctant to name pitching coaches as managers or former pitchers as managers, but in our situation, short-term, pitching is everything, Alderson said.I think it was a positive factor in this case.We evaluated the candidates and looked at Mickey and tried to look at the short term and long term, and we definitely think Mickey long-term has potential as a manager.And short-term, maybe there will be some growing pains, who knows?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But short-term, Alderson added, what is most critical for our success is the pitching, and I think that he has had so much success recently with a pitching staff definitely was a factor for us.Callaway emerged as the winner after a first round of interviews involving five other candidates a list that included Kevin Long, the Mets hitting coach for the past three seasons.Alderson said Long was disappointed not to be chosen, and it was unclear if he would return to the club in 2018.There may be another managerial opportunity out there that comes his way, so well just have to see what happens over the next few days, Alderson said.Hes been given permission to speak to one other team, but I dont want to disclose any of that because I dont know what theyre disclosing.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But so impressed were Alderson and Fred Wilpon, the Mets owner, after a lunch meeting with Callaway that they canceled a second round of interviews to concentrate on him.The thing I want to emphasize is we werent only looking for a manager, we were looking for a leader, Alderson said.There seemed to be a real consistency between Mickeys approach and our approach and what he was looking for in the way of managing, and what we were looking for in the way of a leader in the clubhouse.Thats a visceral reaction, not one that you can put down on a checklist, but to me that said everything.Callaway acknowledged being somewhat unfamiliar with the Mets and their personnel while being fully aware of their troubled 2017 season.Im looking forward to getting to know everyone here and digging in deep to everything and everybody to see how I can assist them, he said.And for sure, the Mets need help.
For Game 1 of the World Series, Mother Nature Will Bring the Heat:::::All of this represents a drastic swing from recent World Series weather, especially considering that Game 2 of last years Series between the Indians and Chicago Cubs had a game-time temperature of 43 degrees in Cleveland.The unusual heat in Los Angeles also comes amid a period of extreme weather events around the country, such as the devastating hurricanes that have hit Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida; temperatures of over 100 degrees in Portland in August and San Francisco last month; and the wildfires that have raged through parts of California.For Angelinos, October is Santa Ana season, said William Patzert, a climatologist with NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is about 10 miles northeast of Dodger Stadium.Santa Ana winds blow toward the Pacific Ocean when a high-pressure system builds over the Great Basin desert in Nevada.That pushes winds through the high desert and three mountain passes Cajon, Banning and Santa Clarita River at speeds ranging from 30 to 50 miles per hour.As they drop down into the basin where Dodger Stadium is, they tend to heat up and dry out, Patzert said.What were expecting in the next couple days is record-breaking heat.This could be not-so-welcome news for the starting pitchers in Game 1, Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers and Dallas Keuchel of the Astros.Photo Dodger Stadium, which sits in Chavez Ravine in the hills just above downtown Los Angeles, is one of baseballs more pitcher-friendly ballparks especially at night.This is due to not only the stadiums dimensions, with its ample 385-foot power alleys, but also Los Angeless weather patterns.Normally, mornings bring an offshore flow, as warm air is carried out toward the ocean.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the afternoon, the winds often shift, bringing in a moist, heavier marine layer that benefits pitchers, weighing down long drives that might normally leave the ballpark.If that marine air is absent, replaced by warm, dry and thin air from the Santa Ana winds, it could be a boon for lineups with plenty of pop.The Astros were second in the American League with 238 home runs, while the Dodgers were fourth in the National League with 221.Keuchel, though, did not seem to mind.This weather is always beautiful, he said Monday.Its that dry heat.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Asked if it was hot enough to make him consider shaving his bushy, chest-length beard, Keuchel laughed.Well, if its hot enough for four wins, Ill shave it for sure, he said.For a long time, weather was less of an issue in the World Series.Until the postseason was expanded in 1969, the World Series wrapped up much earlier in October.And until 1971, when Commissioner Bowie Kuhn persuaded NBC to begin broadcasting some World Series games at night, postseason games were played exclusively during the day.Kuhn, sensitive to criticism over the move away from traditional day baseball, sat in the stands without an overcoat during Game 2 of the 1976 World Series, even though others around him shivered as they watched the Yankees play the Reds in Cincinnati.In 1979, Kuhn prohibited the Baltimore Orioles and Pittsburgh Pirates from wearing ski caps during warm-ups or in the dugout, even though it was 41 degrees at the start of Game 1.After Kuhn was long gone, the postseason calendar kept expanding.Division series were added in 1995 to supplement the league championship series that had begun 26 years before.And then a wild-card game was added for each league in 2012.The extended postseason action has created the opportunity for more bone-chilling nights when the Series takes place in cities like Boston, New York, Denver, Detroit, Chicago or Philadelphia.After a frigid 2006 World Series, when the St. Louis Cardinals and the Detroit Tigers improvised to keep warm when the temperature dipped below 40 degrees, the New Era apparel company persuaded Major League Baseball to allow it to develop three types of cold-weather accouterments: knit ski caps, balaclavas and fleece-lined baseball caps with ear flaps, which drew comparison to cartoon character Elmer Fudds hunting cap.The gear came in handy in 2008, when the Phillies and Tampa Bay Rays had to play in wet, windy and cold conditions in Philadelphia.Dodgers outfielder Curtis Granderson pondered the weathers effects on the postseason in 2006, when he played for the Tigers.Since spring training, outside of maybe the first few weeks in April, its been nice weather all season, he recalled thinking that year.Now were trying to determine the best teams in baseball and its anywhere from 20 to 50 degrees colder than youve been playing all season long?Has anyone thought about this?Advertisement Continue reading the main story Such considerations will not be necessary on Tuesday.Neither will the balaclavas, scarves and wool coats.The fans who fill Dodger Stadium are far more likely to be wearing tank tops and flip flops while they watch the Astros and Dodgers trying to beat each other and the heat.

pinstripes jumped up and down on my beloved Brooklyn Bums the great rivalry of this sport, two teams from the same city (more or less) meeting in six World Series in one tense decade.Photo So much history.So much pain.The humble, scorned and wacky outer-borough Dodgers had played and lost two earlier World Series before finally meeting the Yankees in 1941 a harbinger of hideous things to come.In the fourth game that year, the Dodgers were one strike away from tying the Series except that the catcher, Mickey Owen, missed a third strike on Tommy Henrich, thrown by Hugh Casey, which just may have been a spitter: hard to hit, hard to catch.Photo This was my family legacy as a kid in Queens.Brooklyn was the mother ship and the Dodgers were the good guys, doing the right thing, signing black players and repeatedly reaching the World Series.I remember each Series, the way one remembers disasters more vividly than happy events.I know where I was.I know what happened.I know how I felt:

Sabathias contract is up, Masahiro Tanaka can opt out of his and, because of new rules governing the signing of international players, the chase for the Japanese two-way talent Shohei Otani who could fill a spot in the rotation and a gaping hole at designated hitter will not simply be a matter of emptying the treasure chest.While Cashman seems unlikely to be going anywhere the principal owner Hal Steinbrenner has shown little inclination to fire people with far less merit the case of Girardi is more complicated.He just completed his 10th season with the Yankees, and though he shepherded the club through several transitional years while keeping the team competitive and was duly praised for his work this season, questions remain about whether his relentless style amid the attendant scrutiny of New York has a shelf life.Photo And at a time when the ability to relate to players is becoming more valued, it is fair to wonder how deeply the 53-year-old Girardi connects on that level.Girardi became so frustrated this season over catcher Gary Sanchezs inattentiveness in blocking pitches that he publicly called him out, something Girardi rarely if ever had done in the past.Asked to assess Girardis work this season, Cashman said: I think everybody did everything they possibly could to get where we wanted to go to be the last team standing and we fell short.Asked if he would recommend bringing Girardi back, Cashman said, My recommendation will be to talk to our owner and sit down and find out whats next.While the barrage of criticism over a rare tactical blunder by Girardi he chose not to ask for a video replay that might have stemmed Clevelands comeback victory in Game 2 of the division series largely subsided once the Yankees dispatched the Indians and went on to nearly win the A.L.C.S., it left Girardi shaken.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the wake of incident, there were even moments where Girardi seemed somewhat fatalistic about his future with the team.And Girardi, too, will be asking some questions not just of Steinbrenner and Cashman, but of his family.It is a ritual each time Girardis contract expires, most recently occurring after the 2013 season.Back then, he had a quick conversation with his wife and three children the oldest is now a college freshman to hear what they had to say about his job.He will do so again.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Im not living my kids lives; Im not living my wifes life, he said recently.Im living, in a sense, my life, so I dont know what changes for them.Girardi said Saturday night that he would speak with Cashman after gauging his familys feelings.Thats not my concern right now, he said.Ive had 10 great years here.I feel extremely blessed.God has been good to me and well see what the future holds.The same can be said for several other Yankees.Sabathia, who is 37, said Saturday night that he wanted to return to the Yankees in 2018 Of course, he said but at what price?It will be nowhere near the $25 million he earned in the final year of his contract, but Sabathia is extremely prideful and, after his recent resurgence, he may find suitor willing to pay more than the Yankees next season.Photo Another free agent who wants to return is third baseman Todd Frazier, a midseason acquisition who quickly established himself as a voice in the clubhouse and who played with aplomb in the playoffs.But with top prospect Gleyber Torres likely to make his debut at some point next season, the Yankees do not seem eager to commit to a multiyear deal to keep Frazier around.Tanakas performance in the playoffs he had three dominant outings may have raised his value enough after a lackluster regular season to prompt him to opt out of the remaining three years and $66 million on his contract.Its the first time for me being in this situation, Tanaka said through an interpreter on Saturday night.I dont fully understand how its going to work out, but obviously, Im going to talk to my agent.How the financial pieces fit together has rarely been as great a concern for the Yankees as it is now.Steinbrenner has said getting below the luxury-tax threshold for the first time it will be $197 million next year is an objective, if not an edict.It would allow the Yankees to shed the onerous new penalties for repeat offenders that go into effect next year.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Yankees, who carried a payroll of close to $220 million this season, will shed nearly $70 million with the expiration of the contracts of Sabathia ($25 million), Matt Holliday ($13 million), Alex Rodriguez ($21 million) and Michael Pineda ($7.4 million).They could pare payroll even further if they find a suitor for Chase Headley, who has one year and $13 million left on his contract, or a taker for Jacoby Ellsbury, even if they have to eat a large chunk of the three years and $66 million remaining on his deal.(Ellsbury has a full no-trade clause, but it is hard to imagine him not being open to waiving it to get to a place where he could play regularly.)On the other side of the ledger, eight players are due for raises through arbitration.It is those young, talented and mostly affordable players, though, who form the foundation of the Yankees optimism.Theres a lot of pieces that are here that have a chance to have exciting times ahead, Cashman acknowledged.And then he added a cautionary note: I think people in my chair, if youre trying to be good at what you do, you never assume anything.The team down the hallway on Saturday night is proof of that.The Astros arrived ahead of schedule in 2015, knocking off the Yankees in the wild-card game before a crushing collapse against the Kansas City Royals in the division series.Though the Astros returned for the 2016 season both optimistic and resolute, they got off to an awful start and never fully recovered, missing the postseason entirely.Ultimately, the future is never promised, Cashman said, as promising as it may be.
Dave Roberts Seeks a Different Shade of Postseason Glory:::::Thats where it really flipped for me, Roberts said, where I was like, Ive got to do this and Im going to do this, Lord willing, as long as I can.Last season, his first as the Dodgers manager, Roberts was named the National Leagues manager of the year.Now he has guided the Dodgers to their first N.L.pennant in 29 years, ending the franchises longest stretch without a World Series appearance.Fittingly, the final out of the N.L.Championship Series in Chicago was a line drive to shortstop Charlie Culberson a fill-in for Corey Seager, the All-Star who has been sidelined with a back injury.With Culberson and Chris Taylor, who also plays the outfield, Roberts nimbly covered the absence of Seager, who is expected to be active for the World Series.The Dodgers roster of multiposition players gives Roberts extraordinary flexibility and matchup advantages.He has a lot of weapons, a lot of interchangeable parts, and hes not afraid to pinch-hit for a guy in the middle of the game, Black said.So from the other side, if you try to set up the right pitcher on the right hitter, a lot of times it cant happen, because hell make that move and he does it with his bullpen, too.Joe Maddon, the Cubs manager, said the key to beating the Dodgers was to get an early lead and keep them from deploying their many options.Theyre prepared, Maddon said, adding later, Once you get behind and theyre able to fulfill the script, then its really difficult, because they do match up well.Yet the Cubs actually held a lead in four of the five N.L.C.S.games against Los Angeles, but were outscored by 20 runs over all and batted just .156.The Dodgers bullpen fired 17 scoreless innings in the series.Photo And when Roberts had to go off script, he did, pulling back a pinch-hitter in the sixth inning of Game 3 to let Yu Darvish bat with the bases loaded against the erratic Carl Edwards Jr.The serendipitous result: the first bases-loaded walk by a pitcher in the postseason since Larry Christenson drew one in 1977.On four pitches, no less.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That was probably 99 percent gut, Roberts said, smiling, though he based the feeling on logic.The Dodgers already had a two-run lead, he explained, and Darvish was pitching well.He knew it would not have been easy for a pinch-hitter most likely the struggling Curtis Granderson to put the bat on the ball, anyway, and recognized that the Cubs had been struggling with control.There is a walk in there, Roberts said, regardless of who is in the batters box.Roberts, whose parents are African-American and Japanese, is the first minority manager in Dodgers history and one of just three minority managers currently in the majors, with Rick Renteria of the Chicago White Sox and Alex Cora of the Boston Red Sox, who was hired on Sunday.In other ways, though, Roberts, 45, fits the profile of a modern manager: recent playing experience, a college education (U.C.L.A.), a willingness to work closely with an analytically minded front office and an unflappable nature to handle the increasing demands of the news media.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Experience still matters; no manager has won the World Series in his first managing job since Ozzie Guillen of the Chicago White Sox did it 12 years ago.But Robertss familiarity with Los Angeles, where he also played for parts of three seasons, has perhaps reduced the learning curve that often greets a first-time manager.Especially in New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles if any one of those four places becomes your first opportunity, theres a lot thats going to come at you awfully quick, said Jim Tracy, Robertss manager with the Dodgers from 2002 to 2004.If youre not prepared for that, or youre lacking in people skills and dealing with the media, I dont know if its going to go well for you.But he has all of that.You engage yourself with David Roberts for any period of time, and youll swear hes never had a bad day in his life.The Dodgers had plenty of bad days late in the season, losing 16 of 17 games from Aug. 26 through Sept. 11.They dropped 12 games in the N.L.West standings, but had built such a big lead that the division title was not in much doubt.Still, the team needed a calm leader.Every day we came to the park, we thought that was the day it was going to end, and it took a little bit longer than that but you couldnt tell it from Doc at all, said Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers president for baseball operations, referring to Roberts by his nickname.He was communicating with the media twice a day.It would have been really easy for him at some point along the way to crack, and he didnt at all.And it wasnt just his public persona, either.It was also the way he handled things in the clubhouse.Roberts also seems to have solved the riddle of outfielder Yasiel Puig, who often confounded the previous manager, Don Mattingly.Asked in August about the Dodgers success, Puig without prompting credited Roberts for unifying the team.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He has a lot of charisma, Puig added, through an interpreter.Likewise, when asked generally about Roberts during the N.L.C.S., the ace Clayton Kershaw praised Robertss handling of Puig.Yasiels probably one of the main things that youve seen, said Kershaw, who will start Game 1 of the World Series.I think Yasiels really responded to Doc as manager.Doc has really kind of taken him aside and really given him the attention that probably he needed at first to gain that trust.Puig, a five-year veteran, bashed a career-high 28 homers this season, never grumbling about often batting eighth.He hit .414 (12 for 29) in the N.L.playoffs while showing off his colorful persona, often kissing his bat before using it and flipping it after making contact.After years of postseason angst, the Dodgers look carefree.And with four more victories, their manager will be revered on another coast, forever.
Mets Hire Mickey Callaway, Indians Pitching Coach, as Manager:::::In addition, Callaway will now become one of the youngest managers in the majors.That in itself will mark a significant change for the Mets, who had the oldest manager in the majors in 2017 in Terry Collins, who turned 68 in May.Collins stepped down last month after seven years in the job.The longtime Mets pitching coach Dan Warthen was also not retained for next season.Photo Callaway will also be only the second manager Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson has worked with in New York.While Collins was not as well versed in modern baseball analytics as Alderson is, and although there was friction between Collins and the front office during his tenure, he and Alderson worked relatively well together and took the Mets to the World Series in 2015.Now Alderson will start over with Callaway, who will give the Mets a new perspective as they try to deal with their vexing pitching problems, many of which have involved physical setbacks to young pitchers with considerable talent.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The victims in 2017 included Noah Syndergaard, Steven Matz, Matt Harvey and Zack Wheeler.Only Jacob deGrom went unscathed.It was a key reason the Mets had a team E.R.A.of 5.01 in 2017, the second worst in team history.Meanwhile, the Indians had a team E.R.A.of 3.30 in 2017.Clevelands talented pitching staff was one reason the Indians made it to the World Series in 2016 and finished with 102 victories this season before losing in a division series to the Yankees.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Callaway is from Tennessee and played in college at the University of Mississippi.In his major league career, he generally worked out of the bullpen, spending time with Tampa Bay, Anaheim and Texas.He pitched professionally in South Korea and Taiwan before retiring as a player.As a coach, he worked his way up through the Indians farm system before landing the major league pitching coach job in 2013.Over all during Callaways tenure, the Indians ranked fourth in the majors in E.R.A.and were No.1 in some advanced metrics.During his playing and coaching career, Callaway learned from some of baseballs most experienced managers.In Anaheim, he played for Mike Scioscia.In Texas, he played for Buck Showalter.In Cleveland, he coached under Terry Francona and worked with a front office that leaned heavily on modern analytics.Hes wise beyond his years, Francona said of Callaway late this season.He is confident and when I say confident, I mean confident enough to collaborate with others.Hell take information and sift through it and take what he wants.Hes very good.In an interview with The New York Times in August, Callaway spoke about the Indians approach to all aspects of their pitching staff.Everybodys input is valued, he said, and then we make the best decision we can out of everything thats out there, no matter whos presenting it.Were willing to listen, and if it makes sense, well implement it in our program.To land the managing job with the Mets, Callaway emerged from a group of candidates that included Manny Acta, a former Washington Nationals and Indians manager; Joe McEwing, a former Mets utility player and the current Chicago White Sox coach; Alex Cora, a Houston Astros coach who was hired as Bostons manager on Sunday; and Kevin Long, the Mets well-liked hitting coach, whose future with the team is now unclear.After the season ended, Alderson said he would give Long consideration for the position but had hoped to retain him dependent on the outcome of the managerial search.
Alex Cora Hired as Red Sox Manager:::::Photo BOSTON The Boston Red Sox hired the Houston Astros bench coach, Alex Cora, to be their manager on Sunday, turning to a player from their 2007 World Series championship roster to help the team out of its current playoff slump.The Red Sox announced the hire a day after the Astros eliminated the Yankees in the American League Championship Series.With two days off before Houston opens the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Boston had a chance to hire Cora without running afoul of Major League Baseballs ban on major moves during the Series.Cora replaced John Farrell, who led the Red Sox to the 2013 title and in the past two years claimed the first back-to-back A.L.East championships in franchise history.But Boston also finished last twice in Farrells tenure, and the club has won just one playoff game since winning it all in his first season.A native of Puerto Rico, Cora is the first Hispanic manager for a franchise that was the last in the major leagues to field a black player.The Red Sox faced renewed racial scrutiny this season after Orioles outfielder Adam Jones reported being subjected to racial slurs at Fenway Park.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A day later, a fan was barred from the ballpark for life for using racial slurs in the stands.The teams president, Sam Kennedy, said at the time that the episode made him feel deep remorse that these things happen in our society.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Cora, who has never managed, played 14 years in the major leagues, including parts of four seasons with the Red Sox, and retired in 2011.He hit .243 with 35 homers and 286 R.B.I.in his career.In 2003, with the Dodgers, he led the National League in putouts and double plays by a second baseman.Alex is a guy that communicates well with the players; hes a guy that studies the game, Astros designated hitter Carlos Beltran said this month.His preparation is above what I have seen in baseball, and he has a great personality.
Behind Astros Victory, McCullerss Killer Instinct and a Fathers Advice:::::A 90 percent blockage in the axillary artery in his shoulder essentially ended his career.McCullers Sr. was 26 years old and had pitched 301 games for San Diego, the Yankees and Detroit.He would pitch just five more, all before his first son was born.He was out of the game by 1996, when the Yankees opened a spring training ballpark near the familys home in Tampa, Fla. McCullers Sr. took a hard-hat tour during construction, and once took Lance Jr. to meet the players in the clubhouse.The family still has tickets, eight rows behind the Yankees on-deck circle.I grew up watching those guys; I love those guys, said McCullers Jr., who went to Jesuit High School on North Himes Avenue, the same street as the Yankees minor league complex.But tonight, I had to do what I had to do.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Astros envisioned a night like this in 2012, at the first draft for their general manager, Jeff Luhnow.They used the No.1 overall pick on shortstop Carlos Correa, who signed for a reduced bonus that allowed them to meet the asking price of two other coveted prospects: McCullers and infielder Rio Ruiz, who was eventually traded to Atlanta for designated hitter Evan Gattis.In Game 7, Gattis lashed a homer for the Astros first run.Correa singled twice and scored.And McCullers authored just the third four-inning save to clinch a postseason series, after Oaklands Vida Blue in the 1972 A.L.C.S.and San Franciscos Madison Bumgarner (five innings) in the 2014 World Series.On the podium behind second base on Saturday, as the Astros received their A.L.championship trophy, Correa draped an arm around Luhnow and reminded him of that first draft.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Its crazy, Correa said later.I got drafted with Lance; we grew up together through the minor league system.And now to be here, tasting the World Series, its just surreal.That curveball was working, it was nasty, he was confident.It doesnt get any better than what he did today.A. J. Hinch, the Astros manager, said he had not known McCullers would be so dominant on Saturday, when he was pitching on three days rest.But he knew he would thrive in the setting.McCullers rises to the moment, Hinch said, with a ravenous killer instinct.That assessment got back to McCullers later, in the soggy, smoky home clubhouse.He was proud to explain why.It comes from how I grew up, man, he said.My dad taught me to be a bulldog.This game was, in a way, kind of stolen from him.He got hurt a lot toward the end of his career, and he had a lot left to give.
Astros Move Onto the World Series as the Yankees Run Out of Gas:::::The Yankees ended up losing six of the seven games they played on the road in this postseason.And the final loss came in much the same manner as their last trip to the playoffs, in 2015, when they were blanked by the Astros, 3-0, in the wild-card game.Photo The Yankees meager offense on Saturday was part of a pattern that persisted through all four of their losses at Minute Maid Park in this series.They scored one run in Game 1, another in Game 2 and then one more in Game 6 on Friday night.All three of those defeats came against Houstons two aces Dallas Keuchel, a longtime Yankee tormentor, and Justin Verlander, who boasts a rich playoff rsum.But in Game 7, the Yankees succumbed to Morton, a career journeyman, who held them to two hits through five innings, and to McCullers, who is normally the teams No.3 starter.McCullers gave up a single to Gardner, the first batter he faced, and allowed only one other base runner Todd Frazier on a leadoff walk in the eighth.When center fielder George Springer squeezed a lazy fly ball by Greg Bird for the final out, McCullers leapt into McCanns arms, and the Astros poured out of their dugout to celebrate the franchises second-ever trip to the Series.Photo Everybody talks about Game 7, youre going to need 12 pitchers to get through 27 outs, Astros Manager A. J. Hinch said.Outside of a couple times I warmed Will Harris up about half a dozen times and Ken Giles at the end we were perfectly content with what Morton and McCullers were doing because they were so dominant.After losing three straight games at a loud and intimidating Yankee Stadium to fall behind in the A.L.C.S, the Astros rebounded once they were back in more comfortable surroundings.Their pitching became dominant again, and it dovetailed with superb defense in the infield and outfield.After Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge jumped at the wall to take a solo homer away from Yuli Gurriel in the second inning on Saturday the second home run Judge pilfered in the postseason Astros third baseman Alex Bregman was quick to return the favor.Photo With one out and runners at the corners in the fifth, and the Astros protecting a 1-0 lead, Bregman fielded Fraziers chopper and fired right to McCanns glove as Bird slid into it.A less precise throw would not have gotten Bird, who was thrown out at the plate twice in this series.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Then, in the top of the seventh, as the Yankees were running out of outs, Houston center fielder George Springer whose leaping catch at the wall was the defining moment of Game 6 sprang up again.He vaulted over left fielder Marwin Gonzalez to catch Birds drive to the left-center field wall and keep the Yankees from threatening.And while much was made of the Yankees vaunted bullpen, especially in contrast with the Astros shaky corps, it turned out not to be an advantage in this series.Photo Over the seven games, Yankees relievers allowed more runs than their counterparts (11 to 9), and their most reliable arms were the ones that cost them.Closer Aroldis Chapman was beaten in Game 2 on a walkoff hit; David Robertson deprived the Yankees of a chance to rally when he was raked for four runs late in Game 6; and Tommy Kahnle could not keep his team close on Saturday, getting tagged for three runs.In losing Games 3, 4, and 5 at Yankee Stadium, the Astros seemed unnerved and looked overly anxious at the plate.Thus, it heartened their hitting coach, Dave Hudgens, that when they ended a 15-inning scoreless streak in Game 6, there were three walks that led to a three-run outburst.I think that relaxed everybody a little bit, Hudgens said before Saturdays game.It did.In the fourth inning on Saturday, Gattis fought off three two-strike pitches from C. C. Sabathia and crushed the eighth pitch of the at-bat, a slider he sent over the left-center field wall to break a scoreless tie.Photo In the fifth, Altuve hit a solo homer to right this one beyond the reach of Judge and punctuated the shot with a flip of his bat after he had carried it nearly all the way to first base.Correa and Gurriel followed with line singles to center and right, putting runners at first and second.After Kahnle struck out Gattis, McCann came to the plate.He saw five consecutive changeups from Kahnle.The last one, on a 2-2 pitch, arrived letter high, and McCann ripped it into the right-field corner, chasing home Correa and Gurriel and putting the Yankees in a 4-0 hole.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was the second consecutive game in which McCann, who was traded by the Yankees to the Astros for a pair of low-level prospects last winter, had delivered a critical run-scoring double.In a particularly painful twist, the Yankees are paying $5.5 million of McCanns salary this year and will do the same next season.The Yankees paid at least 15 players on their postseason roster less than they gave McCann this season.It was last years jettisoning of veterans like McCann and another current Astro, Carlos Beltran that ushered in the Yankees youth movement.Judge and Luis Severino quickly emerged as stars this season.Gary Sanchez proved that his scintillating final two months of 2016 had been no illusion.Outfielder Aaron Hicks finally played to his talent level, while reliever Chad Green went from afterthought to indispensable, the rookie pitcher Jordan Montgomery showed a veterans moxie, and shortstop Didi Gregorius continued to blossom.All of these developments should leave the Yankees feeling that there will be a lot more postseason games for them in the years ahead.But there are questions afoot, too beginning with the futures of Manager Joe Girardi and Cashman, whose contracts are expiring.And with the Yankees eliminated, those questions have come into sharper focus.We were hoping to kick that can down the road, but now, obviously, were like 28 other teams, Cashman said.Were now in that pile of whats next?
Joshua stops Takam in 10th to retain heavyweight crowns:::::CARDIFF (Reuters) - Britains Anthony Joshua retained his IBF, WBA and IBO world heavyweight titles when he stopped bloodied challenger Carlos Takam in the 10th round in Cardiff on Saturday.Boxing - Anthony Joshua vs Carlos Takam - IBF & WBA World Heavyweight Titles - Principality Stadium, Cardiff, Britain - October 28, 2017 Anthony Joshua celebrates at the end the fight Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Couldridge Unbeaten champion Joshua opened up a dreadful cut above 36-year Takams right eye in the fourth round and although the durable France-based Cameroonian battled on the fight was halted by referee Phil Edwards after a series of heavy blows.It was far from a straightforward night for Joshua in the Principality Stadium, however, as the 28-year-old appeared to suffer a broken nose in the second round after an accidental clash of heads with his shorter and lighter opponent.Takam, who stood in 12 days ago after Joshuas original opponent Kubrat Pulev suffered an injury in training, proved a worthy challenger and was still throwing punches despite blood streaming from his eyes for half the fight.Joshua did force a standing count in the fourth but never totally dominated a wily opponent who clearly disagreed with Edwardss decision to end the contest - only the second time he had been stopped in 40 fights.It was a good fight until the referee stopped it so I have the utmost respect for Takam, former Olympic champion Joshua, who took his record to 20-0, said in the ring.I have no interest in what is going on with the officials, thats not my job.I think people want to see Takam unconscious on the floor, and thats what I was trying to get to.Boxing - Anthony Joshua vs Carlos Takam - IBF & WBA World Heavyweight Titles - Principality Stadium, Cardiff, Britain - October 28, 2017 Referee steps in to stop end the fight Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Couldridge Joshua, who was fighting for the first time since his epic victory over Wladimir Klitschko in April, began in cagey fashion with neither fighter landing a serious blow in round one.The fight took a twist in round two when Takams head clattered into Joshuas nose, making the Londoner wince.Slideshow (12 Images) Joshua sprang into life and dominated the next few rounds and cut Takam with a stinging right hook in the fourth before briefly flooring his opponent.It looked as though the fight would be stopped as Takam struggled to see through the blood, but the underdog showed tremendous courage and asked serious questions of the champion whose nose injury affected his breathing.Joshua was not at his fluent best but was way ahead on the scorecards when he put together a sustained attack in the 10th to convince the referee to intervene.The Briton said he wanted to take on American WBC title-holder Deontay Wilder.AJs told me he wants the belts.Deontay Wilder against Anthony Joshua has to happen, promoter Eddie Hearn said.

Venus rallies past Garcia to set up Wozniacki final:::::SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Venus Williams rallied from the disappointment of losing a tight first set to blast her way past Caroline Garcia 6-7(3) 6-2 6-3 and set up a WTA Finals title showdown against Caroline Wozniacki on Saturday.Tennis - WTA Tour Finals - Singapore Indoor Stadium, Singapore - October 28, 2017 USA's Venus Williams celebrates winning her semi final match against France's Caroline Garcia REUTERS/Edgar Su The evergreen American has enjoyed a brilliant campaign, reaching two grand slam finals in 2017, and the 37-year-old American was able to call on all her experience to find a way to stifle her upset-minded opponent in an engrossing encounter.In the first semi-final, Denmarks Wozniacki stood her ground in the face of some incredible early pressure before pinning down Karolina Pliskova with a 7-6(9) 6-3 victory that ensured Simona Halep will end the year as world number one.Williams and Garcia took the court in a battle between two players possessing huge forehands and a tendency to attack their opponents second serve, the contest starting out as slow burner that lacked fluency after they traded early breaks.Williams appeared troubled by a hip injury and was trying to keep the points short while Garcia became tentative every time she had a chance to break free, especially when she fashioned her first set point that came and went at 5-4.Garcia was rewarded for being more positive in the tiebreak as Williams serve wavered and the Frenchwoman wrapped up the opener on her second set point when her opponent sent another groundstroke wide and long.The American increased her intensity in the second set and took advantage of Garcias passivity to storm 4-1 clear, with Williams breaking for a second time in the eighth game against a weary-looking opponent to level up the contest.Garcia had won nine of her last 10 three-set matches but was struggling to grab any sort of foothold in Williams service games and the American shifted up a gear to grab the only break she needed in the eighth game and served it out for the win.Garcia competed so well in the whole tournament, Williams said of an opponent who won back-to-back titles in China to sneak into the event as the last qualifier.Tennis - WTA Tour Finals - Singapore Indoor Stadium, Singapore - October 28, 2017 USA's Venus Williams in action during her semi final-match against France's Caroline Garcia REUTERS/Edgar Su Every time I thought I had her, she would play amazing shots... but its never over until the fat lady sings and Im not fat, joked Williams, who won the tournament in 2008.RESILIENT WOZNIACKI Wozniackis victory, completed in a just under two hours, was built on the Danes resilience, consistency and greater variation on the key points, and put the 27-year-old into her second final at the eight-woman event after losing in 2010.Slideshow (12 Images) We have had a lot of close matches this year and I was hoping today was my turn.It feels great to be in the final and I have been playing some great tennis this week, Wozniacki said in a courtside interview.The first five games went with serve until the Czech edged ahead by instigating a run of four straight breaks of serve as Wozniacki staved off three set points in the 10th game to stay alive in the set and eventually force a tiebreak.The Dane then raced into a 6-1 lead over the sleepwalking Pliskova before the Czech rose from her slumber to first save all five set points and then fashion three more of her own, which Wozniacki somehow managed to survive.Wozniacki continued to cover every inch of the court to set up another set point, her sixth, with more defensive brilliance, and the former number one sealed the opener 11-9 in the breaker when Pliskova found the net with a backhand.Wozniacki changed tactics again, opting to push the ball into the corners to force Pliskova into making errors as she struggled out of position and the Dane forged a vital break for a 5-3 lead.This time there would be no way back for Pliskova as Wozniacki sent a backhand crosscourt winner past her stranded opponent to storm into the final.

Mexican GP marks a return to normality, says organizer:::::MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican Grand Prix organizers say Sundays Formula One race marks a return to normality after last months devastating earthquakes, with tickets sold out and a three-day crowd of 320,000 expected.Formula One F1 - Mexican Grand Prix 2017 - Mexico City, Mexico - October 28, 2017.Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton in action during practice.REUTERS/Henry Romero The Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez circuit escaped any damage but there had been fears fans might stay away, with hotel bookings slumping in the immediate aftermath.Everyone was asking How are the people going to react?So I think this weekend officially becomes the coming back to normality.And thats the whole idea, GP president Alejandro Soberon told reporters.The Sept. 7 and 19 earthquakes killed 471 people in central and southeastern states.Soberon said Formula One and grand prix organizers were donating around $500,000 to fund 600 temporary classrooms in the southern states of Oaxaca and Chiapas to get 9,000 affected children back to school.Fans attending the race, which should see Britains Lewis Hamilton clinch his fourth world title, are asked to stand and raise a clenched fist during lap 19 of the race as a sign of support and solidarity.The second quake hit Mexico City harder and rescuers raised clenched fists to call for silence while they searched for survivors.The gesture also embodies the idea of Fuerza Mexico (Be Strong Mexico).The race coincides with Mexicos annual Day of the Dead festivities, which has become a big draw for international visitors.Soberon said the race date was now established and ruled out any switch.U.S. Grand Prix promoter Bobby Epstein told Reuters earlier this month that he would prefer his race in Austin, Texas, to be paired with Brazil, as it was for three years, instead of Mexico.He said then that Mexico would be better off back-to-back with Montreal in June.Bobby is a fantastic guy and I love him.I think he has a good idea to separate the races, said Soberon.But I invite Bobby to move back to June.It will make even more sense to have Canada and the States, which are closer, together.For us its impossible to move to June because its the heaviest rainy season.The Day of the Dead holiday is on these dates, its just become a big festival in the city.But overall you cannot have a good experience of the weekend if the rain is so heavy.Contract extension talks were expected to start next year, once Mexican presidential elections were out of the way.The circuit has two more years to run on its five-year deal.
Cap That Shielded Jackie Robinson From Racist Pitchers Fetches Record Amount at Auction:::::Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.The padded cap protected him from racist pitchers.A Brooklyn Dodgers cap worn by Jackie Robinson has been auctioned for a record amount.The blue cap sold for $590,000 Saturday after a monthlong online auction through the sports auctioneers Lelands.It's the most money ever exchanged for a hat at auction.Lelands says Robinson wore the hat when he broke baseball's color barrier in 1947.That year he joined the Dodgers and became the first black athlete to play in the segregated MLB in the 20th century.Robinson endured constant racist taunts during his rookie year, and pitchers frequently threw at his head.The specially-padded cap helped protect him from beanings by the pitchers.The padded cap came with a letter from Robinson's widow, Rachel, describing the three protective plates sewn inside the lining.The 95-year-old Rachel Robinson was in Los Angeles on Tuesday to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at Game 1 of the World Series between the Dodgers and the Houston Astros.Batting helmets didn't become mandatory in the Major Leagues until 1956.Top Tri-State News Photos
Opinion Shifting Toward Athletes' Anthem Protests: Poll:::::AP reporters counted more than 200 NFL players who did not stand during the national anthem before their games on Sunday.(Published Monday, Sept. 25, 2017) Americans are split in a new poll on rules that would require professional athletes to kneel for the national anthem, a real shift in favor of their right to protest, NBC News reported.Fifty-one percent of respondents to an HBO Real Sports/Marist poll said they opposed leagues requiring that players stand, while 47 percent supported such rules.The four-point difference is within the Oct. 15-17 poll's margin of error, which makes it a statistical tie.But when the poll was conducted a year ago, a clear majority supported rules requiring players to stand, by a mark of 52 to 43.Since then, President Donald Trump threw a spotlight on the athletes following the example of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who began kneeling for the anthem in August 2016.

Dodgers Advance to World Series for 1st Time Since 1988, After Routing Cubs, 11-1, in Game 5 of NLCS:::::Check out the behind the scenes footage including interviews with Cody Bellinger and Yasiel Puig as the Los Angeles Dodgers Advance to their first World Series since 1988.(Published Friday, Oct. 20, 2017) The iconic words of Vin Scully were first spoken 29 years ago, the last time the Los Angeles Dodgers were in the World Series: "In a year that has been so improbable, the impossible has happened."After nearly three decades, the wait is finally over the Dodgers are going back to the World Series.Enrique Hernandez hit three home runs, including a grand slam, as the Dodgers punched their ticket to the Fall Classic, defeating the Chicago Cubs, 11-1, in Game 5 of the NLCS on Thursday night at Wrigley Field.In 1988, the last time the Dodgers went to the World Series, Clayton Kershaw was just seven months old.Twenty-nine years later, he was on the mound when they won the pennant."We've heard 1988 for so long in L.A., it feels good to say that we're getting to go to the World Series in 2017," Kershaw said after the victory."With four more wins, hopefully we get to bring one home."Top Sports Photos: Astros Lead Dodgers 2-1 in World Series Kershaw (2-0), threw six innings, allowing just one run on three hits with one walk and five strikeouts in the third potential-clinching start in his postseason career.In those games, the three-time NL Cy Young Award winner is a perfect 3-0 when he takes the mound with a chance to advance his team to the next round."To get to be on the mound tonight and get to be going to the World Series on the same night, it's a special thing," Kershaw said."Who knows how many times I'm going to get to go to the World Series.I know more than anybody how hard it is to get there.So, I'm definitely not taking this one for granted."Since 2013, Kershaw had only gotten one run of support in four total starts in the NLCS over the course of his career.In his only two starts in 2017, he got 16 runs of support."That's a testament to this team and what we stand for," Kershaw said of the support from the offense."As a starting pitcher, when you get seven runs, your job is to get them back in the dugout as fast as possible."In order to end the drought, the Dodgers needed to go through the Cubs, the reigning World Series Champions, a team that slayed their own demons only one year prior.Los Angeles wasted little time dispatching the champs.After a nine-pitch lead-off walk to Chris Taylor to start the game, Cody Bellinger roped a double down the right field line, giving the Dodgers a 1-0 lead."What [Taylor] has done for our lineup all year long, settling into the lead-off spot, getting on base, hitting balls over the fence.He's a dynamic player and table-setter," said teammate Justin Turner, who was named Co-MVP of the NLCS along with Taylor."When he goes, we usually go as a team.I think you guys saw that here in the postseason."One inning later, Hernandez started off the second inning swinging, as he jumped all over a first-pitch fastball from Cubs' starter Jose Quintana, hitting it to straightaway center for a solo home run.Hernandez wasn't finished.After an RBI single from Turner gave the Dodgers a 3-0 lead, Quintana loaded the bases before leaving the game for Hector Rondon.Once again, the Puerto Rican was swinging on the first pitch, and this time, Hernandez sent a slider into the basket in right-center for a grand slam home run."I blacked out," Hernandez said of the fourth grand slam ever hit in Dodgers' postseason history."I can't even describe it you know.I was thinking the entire game, 'Man, this is unbelievable.'"Hernandez not only sent the Dodgers to the World Series with his bat, he also became the first Dodger since Adrian Gonzalez in 2013 to hit multiple homers in a postseason game."I don't remember much of the game," Hernandez admitted."The whole game is a blur.I remember the first two, but I definitely don't remember the last one.It's awesome!"As Wrigley Field fell silent as the shrouded dead, one voice could be heard that of Hernandez's father, Enrique Hernandez Sr., one year removed from a life-threatening battle with cancer, fresh off an evacuation from his homeland because of Hurricane Maria.Despite it all, he stood and cheered.He just watched his son have the game of his life, in the biggest moment of his career."Honestly, I couldn't wait for this game to end so I could give my dad a big old hug," Hernandez said as he fought back tears."Everything that he's been through the last year or so, and everything he went through for me to be here on this stage right now means the world to me."Quintana (0-1) lasted only two innings, surrendering six runs on six hits with one walk and one strikeout in his fourth start of the postseason with the Cubs."Quintana was a great addition," said Cubs manager Joe Maddon after the game."[The Dodgers] know what it feels like coming off last year, we were celebrating versus them in this exact same spot."John Lackey entered the game in the fourth inning for the Cubs and served up a two-run double to Logan Forsythe that gave Los Angeles a 9-0 lead.The two innings of relief may have been the last ever seen of Lackey as the 38-year-old's contract is up at the end of the season.He could be leaning toward retirement at the end of the year."John and I go way back," Maddon said."John and I were together with the Angels in the 2002 World Series team.So it's really special for me with John.Hopefully it's not his last year, but if it is, having that chance to be with him in that moment is pretty special for me."Kris Bryant hit his first home run of the postseason in the bottom of the fourth, a laser beam off Kershaw over the scoreboard in left field, for the Cubs' only run of the game.The Cubs became the first team in Major League history to score all of their runs as home runs in a series that went at least five games."Every year is different," Maddon said on why his offense wasn't able to replicate the same success as last year."We have all these incredible numbers from last year, but every year is different."Just for good measure, Hernandez hit his third home run of the game off Mike Montgomery in the top of ninth, to put the exclamation point on his historical night."I may have had a great game, but this is not about me, this is about this team," Hernandez said, as his teammates celebrated around him in the winning locker room."Tonight it was me, but every night its someone different coming up big for us.Luckily enough, tonight it was me."Hernandez is just the ninth player in MLB history to have three homers in a postseason game, joining like the likes of Babe Ruth, Reggie Jackson, and Albert Pujols.Hernandez finished the game three-for-four with three home runs and a league championship record seven RBIs.To put that in perspective, the Cubs scored eight runs in the entire series."I blacked out and four hours later I had three homers and seven RBI," Hernandez said."There's a very big God up there that blessed me tonight, and grandpa, I appreciate it because I know you had something to do with it."Earlier in the season, Hernandez lost his grandfather and left the team to fly to Puerto Rico to be with his family."Kik told me before the game, 'Hey, I've got your back tonight,'" Kershaw said."He said that before I even went out and took the mound.Then he goes and hits three home runs."Kenta Maeda, Brandon Morrow and Kenley Jansen pitched the final three innings of the game as the Dodgers bullpen set an NLCS record with 17 scoreless innings of relief."We wanted the defending champs," Jansen said after the game."We know how much it sucks to lose here and see the fans enjoy it in front of us.We wanted to make a statement.We wanted to come here and we wanted to win in front of them.It's not over yet.Hopefully, we can bring the championship back home."The Dodgers' pen has a scoreless innings streak of 23, a new MLB postseason record, surpassing the 1977 New York Yankees.However, the rest of the game was a mere formality as both teams went through the motions before the Dodgers popped champagne aged 29 years in the visiting clubhouse.The victory earned the Dodgers their 22nd National League pennant, the second most in league history behind only their rivals, the Giants, who have 23.Nearly one year ago, the Cubs clinched their first World Series berth since 1945 against these same Dodgers.That night, as the mob of adoring fans celebrated in Wrigleyville, the Dodgers team buses were unable to leave, so the players had to wait over two hours in the visiting locker room.During that time, the Dodgers sat and stewed, thinking about this exact moment that could occur one year later, and how great it would be to beat the Cubs on their own field to advance to the World Series.Revenge is, indeed, sweet.Up Next: The Dodgers advance to the World Series, awaiting either the Houston Astros or New York Yankees for Game 1 at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday, Oct. 24.

Full Recovery Expected for Hayward After Injury in Celtics Debut:::::Boston Celtics head coach Brad Stevens said he expects Gordon Hayward to make a full recovery from the gruesome injury he suffered in Tuesday's season opener.(Published Thursday, Oct. 19, 2017) The Boston Celtics said Gordon Hayward is expected to make a "full recovery" after undergoing successful surgery on Wednesday night.The team announced Thursday afternoon that Hayward underwent "successful bony and ligamentous stabilization surgery for the fracture dislocation of his left ankle" sustained in Tuesday night's season opener.Hayward's father tweeted Thursday morning the surgery was 'a big success,' and his wife Robyn posted her own message on social media saying "He did great with surgery!So now we are starting the recovery process."His agent, Mark Bartelstein, added that the surgery "went really well."No timetable has been set for his return, but Bartelstein told ESPN it remains unlikely the 27-year-old forward will return this season.The Celtics player had arrived at New England Baptist Hospital on Wednesday after flying in from Cleveland, where he and former Cavaliers point guard Kyrie Irving played their first game in Celtics green.Hayward came down awkwardly after an alley-oop pass in the first quarter, dislocating his left ankle and fracturing his leg.In a video message on the Celtics' Twitter page Wednesday, Hayward spoke to his fans from his hospital bed."Wanted to say thank you to everyone whose had me in their thoughts and prayers," he said."I'm gonna be alright."Hurting me that I can't be there for the home opener," Hayward went on to say in his video tweet."I want nothing more than to be with my teammates and to walk out on that floor tonight.But I'll be supporting you guys from here and wishing you the best of luck."While the team initially tweeted that Hayward had been diagnosed with a broken ankle, Stevens said in a press conference Wednesday that hospital tests had confirmed his actual injuries."He put a lot of effort into trying to start his career out well in Boston, but this is a setback," Stevens added.Despite the setback, the coach said he believes Hayward will be back to full health."We are expecting a full recovery," he said."We know there are going to be a lot of tough days ahead on that recovery, but at the same time, I think, hopefully, he'll improve day to day."Stevens coached Hayward at Butler University.After spending the first seven seasons of his NBA career with the Utah Jazz, Hayward signed a four-year, $128 million contract to play for his college coach in Boston.As Hayward lay on the court Tuesday night, the Quicken Loans Arena fell silent, with Celtics and Cavs players alike showing their concern.The crowds erupted in applause when he was carried off the floor on a stretcher.The following day, athletes and fans have taken to social media to support Hayward."Thanks for all the prayers for Gordon and our family," Hayward's wife, Robyn, tweeted Wednesday."It sucks, but this is what happens."Robyn Hayward's tweet included a quote, reading, "When everything seems like it's falling apart that's when God is putting things together just the way he wants it."In their opener, the Celtics came back from a 16-point halftime deficit and jockeyed with Cleveland for the lead in the fourth quarter.The Cavs won their first game 102-99.Wednesday night, the Celtics played their home opener without Hayward against the Milwaukee Bucks, but it was clear Hayward was on the mind of everyone.Love for the forward was evident in every corner of TD Garden, as fans who miss him signed a giant "get well soon" banner for him, gave him a standing ovation, and even chanted his name.The Bucks beat the Celtics 108100.

Olympic Gold Medalist Details Sexual Abuse by Team Doctor:::::McKayla Maroney, a gold medalist and former Olympic gymnast, went public with her account of sexual assault by former US Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar on Twitter.(Published Wednesday, Oct. 18, 2017) Two-time Olympic medalist McKayla Maroney says she was molested for years by a former USA Gymnastics team doctor, abuse she said started in her early teens and continued for the rest of her competitive career.Maroney posted a lengthy statement on Twitter early Wednesday that described the allegations of abuse against Dr. Larry Nassar, who spent three decades working with athletes at USA Gymnastics but now is in jail in Michigan awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to possession of child pornography.Nassar also is awaiting trial on separate criminal sexual conduct charges and has been sued by more than 125 women alleging abuse.Nassar has pleaded not guilty to the assault charges, and the dozens of civil suits filed in Michigan are currently in mediation.Maroney, now 21, says the abuse began while attending a U.S. National team training camp at the Karolyi Ranch in the Sam Houston Forest north of Houston, Texas.Maroney was 13 at the time and wrote that Nassar told her she was receiving "medically necessary treatment he had been performing on patients for over 30 years."Maroney did not detail Nassar's specific actions.Maroney, who won a team gold and an individual silver on vault as part of the "Fierce Five" U.S. women's team at the 2012 Olympics in London, said Nassar continued to give her "treatment" throughout her career.She described Nassar giving her a sleeping pill while the team traveled to Japan for the 2011 world championships.Maroney says Nassar later visited her in her hotel room after the team arrived in Tokyo, where he molested her yet again."I thought I was going to die that night," Maroney wrote.Maroney did not immediately return an interview request from The Associated Press.Attorneys for Nassar had no comment.Maroney says she decided to come forward as part of the "#MeToo" movement on social media that arose in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein."This is happening everywhere," Maroney wrote."Wherever there is a position of power, there is the potential for abuse.I had a dream to go to the Olympics, and the things I had to endure to get there, were unnecessary and disgusting."Maroney called for change, urging other victims to speak out and demanding organizations "be held accountable for their inappropriate actions and behavior."Maroney is the highest profile gymnast yet to come forward claiming she was abused by Nassar.Jamie Dantzscher, a bronze medalist on the 2000 U.S. Olympic team, was part of the initial wave of lawsuits filed against Nassar in 2016.Aly Raisman, who won six medals while serving as the captain of the U.S. women's team in both 2012 and 2016, called for sweeping change at USA Gymnastics in August.USA Gymnastics launched an independent review of its policies in the wake of the allegations against Nassar in the summer of 2016 following reporting by the Indianapolis Star that highlighted chronic mishandling of abuse allegations against coaches and staff at some of its more than 3,500 clubs across the country.In June, the federation immediately adopted 70 recommendations proffered by Deborah Daniels, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw the review.The new guidelines require member gyms to go to authorities immediately, with Daniels suggesting USA Gymnastics consider withholding membership from clubs that decline to do so.The organization also named Toby Stark, a child welfare advocate, as its director of SafeSport.Part of Stark's mandate is educating members on rules, educational programs, reporting and adjudication services.USA Gymnastics praised Maroney's strength in a statement on Wednesday, adding it is "outraged and disgusted" by Nassar's alleged conduct."We are strengthening and enhancing our policies and procedures regarding abuse, as well as expanding our educational efforts to increase awareness of signs to watch for and reporting suspicions of abuse, including the obligation to immediately report," USA Gymnastics wrote."USA Gymnastics, its members and community are committed to working together to keep our athletes as safe as possible."The organization had initially agreed to purchase the training facility at the Karolyi Ranch following longtime national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's retirement shortly after the 2016 Olympics ended.The organization has since opted out of that agreement.Steve Penny, longtime president and CEO, resigned in March.A replacement has not been named.The allegations and fallout have reached Capitol Hill.Two different pieces of legislation are in the works that call for greater responsibility for organizations that oversee Olympic sports to immediately report sex-abuse allegations to law enforcement or child-welfare authorities.California Sen. Dianne Feinstein issued a release Wednesday saying she is putting the finishing touches on a bill she is co-sponsoring that would make failure to report sexual abuse a crime."It has become clear that for too long, amateur athletics organizations have shirked their responsibility of protecting young, vulnerable children," Feinstein wrote."That must stop, and it must stop now."Maroney, who lives in California and officially retired in 2015, encouraged others to speak out."Our silence has given the wrong people power for too long," she wrote, "and it's time to take our power back."
Oldest Woman to Finish a Marathon Dies at 94:::::Harriette Thompson, a two-time cancer survivor, became the oldest woman to run a half-marathon at the San Diego Rock 'n' Roll Marathon.NBC 7's Ramon Galindo reports.A nonagenarian who set a world record as the oldest woman to complete a full marathon has died, her family confirmed in a published report.Harriette Thompson, 94, smiled and laughed as she crossed the finish line at the Rock 'N' Roll Marathon in San Diego in June.With her finish, Thompson became the oldest woman to run a half-marathon."I guess it's unusual, but I don't know why people make such a big deal," Thompson said at the time."I feel just like I did when I was 16.But I just cant move as fast."In 2015, Thompson broke the world record as the oldest woman to complete a full marathon.The Charlotte Observer reported Monday Thompson died in hospice after suffering an injury in a fall on Oct. 6.Thompson, a cancer survivor, used her love of running to raise money for the Leukemia Lymphoma Society.Through the years, she raised $100,000 for the organization.She raised $15,000 in 2017 alone.In June, when she completed the Rock n' Roll marathon with a time of 3 hours, 42 minutes, Thompson was most pleased that she did it surrounded by members of her family."I enjoyed running across the finish line," Thompson said."Thats always the biggest thing.And I really enjoyed having my family with me."Rose McGowan Makes First Appearance Since Weinstein Claim
Florida coach Jim McElwain on buyout speculation: 'We'll see':::::JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- University of Florida administrators are discussing whether they can fire coach Jim McElwain with cause, multiple sources told ESPN.After failing to find any evidence to substantiate claims made by McElwain this week that his family and players received death threats, Florida administrators have worked to see if the coach's allegations were enough to relieve the university from paying his full buyout of $12.9 million if he were to be fired.The news came amid another tough result on the field for the unranked Gators (3-4, 3-3 SEC), who were dismantled 42-7 by No.3 Georgia (8-0, 5-0) on Saturday in Jacksonville.When asked about the speculation after the defeat,?McElwain said he first heard about buyout negotiations while walking into team breakfast earlier Saturday."It's the first I've heard of it," McElwain said."We'll see."Sources believe the university has enough cause to fire McElwain without having to pay his buyout.Sources also said that if McElwain were to be relieved of his duties, defensive coordinator Randy Shannon would be asked to be the team's interim coach."At the end of the day, we were all brought here to win, and we haven't done it," McElwain said."The concern isn't about my job.It's about the players and my staff.That's the concern.It isn't about me."?McElwain said he spoke to athletic director Scott Stricklin on Thursday, but the possibility of losing his job wasn't mentioned."Nothing in this world surprises me," McElwain said."I know what I was brought here to do: to fix the offense.And we haven't done that.We haven't won enough, and we haven't won championships."Prior to Saturday's game, Stricklin released a statement dispelling rumors that the school was working on a buyout with McElwain."No one representing the University of Florida or our athletic department has had any conversations with Coach McElwain or his representatives regarding a buyout of his contract," Stricklin said in a statement."Our focus is on this great Florida-Georgia rivalry today in Jacksonville."The buyout talk coupled with the blowout loss capped a tumultuous week for McElwain and the Gators.On Monday, the coach told reporters unprompted during his news conference that his family and players received death threats."There's a lot of hate in this world and a lot of anger," McElwain told reporters."And yet it's freedom to show it.The hard part is obviously when the threats [are] against your own players, the death threats to your families, the ill will that's brought upon out there."When asked to expand on his claims, McElwain wouldn't go into detail about the nature of the threats and said he wasn't planning to contact law enforcement.?"A lot of angry people," McElwain said."In this business, we're the ones that you take the shots at.That's the way it is."Two days later, McElwain said that he was wrong to bring up the death threats that he said "happened in the past."After the Georgia loss Saturday, McEwain reiterated his regret for what transpired with the talk of death threats."When you look back, I've made mistakes in my life," he said."And yet I stand by everything that occurred.It is what it is."Florida officials were unaware of McElwain's claims until he discussed them during the Monday news conference.The school released a statement regarding possible death threats but added that after meeting with McElwain, he "offered no additional details.""The University Athletic Association takes the safety of our student-athletes, coaches, staff and families very seriously,'' team spokesman Steve McClain said in the statement."Our administration met with Coach McElwain this afternoon, and he offered no additional details.''McElwain, who was hired in December 2014, entered Saturday with a 22-11 record and had won the SEC Eastern Division in back-to-back seasons, becoming the first SEC coach to make it to the SEC championship game in each of his first two seasons.His 19 wins entering the 2017 season were the second-most by any SEC coach in 2015 and '16.Those 19 wins tied Steve Spurrier for the second-most victories by a Florida coach in his first two seasons.
Manfred's leadership was tested with Gurriel -- and he passed:::::HOUSTON -- Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred issued Yuli Gurriel a five-game suspension?on Saturday with full knowledge that some segments of the baseball community -- and perhaps people who have never even seen a baseball game -- would be upset by the timing or the message or the perceived inadequacy of the response.This is an occupational hazard of holding a position of authority in a $10 billion industry in which events play out every night on a live stage.One minute, you're sitting in the crowd with 43,282 fans showering Texans defensive end J.J. Watt with love as he throws out the ceremonial first pitch while on crutches.And two innings later, your cell phone is buzzing with a heads-up that Houston's first baseman has responded to a home run off the Los Angeles Dodgers' starting pitcher with racially insensitive behavior?in the Astros' dugout that was captured for all the world to see.And then you have a few hours to interview Gurriel to gauge his level of contrition, determine Yu Darvish's willingness to move on, weigh the interests of the two teams and consider the historical implications of the decision -- all before asking the folks at the Major League Baseball Players Association for their opinion on the topic.Sometimes, leadership is all about threading the needle and making the best of a bad situation.Manfred made the best of a bad situation Saturday afternoon, when he announced that Gurriel would be suspended for five games without pay at the start of the 2018 season.To his credit, Manfred didn't bury the lead.Upon taking his seat in a packed interview room four hours before Game 4 of the World Series, Manfred laser-focused on the heart of the matter."There is complete unanimity -- me, my office, both owners, both clubs and the MLBPA -- that there is no place in our game for the behavior or any behavior like the behavior we witnessed last night,'' Manfred said."There is no excuse or explanation that makes that type of behavior acceptable.''This is not a situation anyone wants or could have possibly foreseen.The Astros are raising the spirits of a city and a region that were devastated by Hurricane Harvey less than two months ago.Game 3 was a veritable lovefest at Minute Maid Park before Gurriel cast a blemish on the proceedings.MLB always has to be vigilant for replay glitches, fans leaning over outfield fences to catch fly balls or even the impromptu beanball confrontation that takes the focus off events on the field.But there's not much of a roadmap to navigate the problem of racially insensitive behavior being dispensed from the dugout.People are free to draw their own conclusions about Gurriel and what he did.He'll have to live with the fallout of opinions expressed on social media.As Astros manager A.J.Hinch recently observed, questionable bullpen decisions are enough to subject people in his profession to a "public slaying'' on Twitter.Racially insensitive expressions, regardless of intention, are a completely different ballgame.The reactions of the two main parties helped lower the temperature.Gurriel was remorseful and contrite over his actions, and Darvish took the high road, and his reasoned and sensitive response quickly advanced the notion that everyone is best served to use what transpired at Minute Maid Park on Friday night as a teachable moment.So what could baseball do to send the proper message?If Manfred had tried to drop the hammer immediately, the union could have appealed, and the machinations of a grievance proceeding would have become an unwelcome sideshow to the sport's crown jewel event.Gurriel has already agreed to not appeal, and we'll be spared any news updates involving MLB's independent arbitrator, Mark Irvings, over the coming days.Given the examples on the books, a five-game suspension for Gurriel seems like a logical progression.In 2012, Toronto shortstop Yunel Escobar received a three-game suspension for displaying a homophobic slur on his eye black.This year, Toronto's Kevin Pillar and Oakland's Matt Joyce were both hit with two-game suspensions for anti-gay slurs in May and August, respectively.Gurriel will take part in sensitivity training as part of his discipline, and Manfred hopes that will be viewed as more than just a footnote to the story."I think it's important,'' he said."I think we all need continuing reminders and education in this area as to what's appropriate and not appropriate.''No amount of training or counseling can ensure we won't see similar situations down the road.But the public censure for Gurriel's transgression was strong enough that the next player who crosses the line will have only himself to blame.Manfred's response was authoritative and pragmatic in a way that marked his tenure as baseball's labor lawyer under Bud Selig and bodes well for his commissionership.For a few hours Saturday, Manfred's job became less about shaking hands and presenting awards than setting an example for crisis management.His leadership skills were tested on the fly, and he passed the test.
Packers' Martellus Bennett 'pretty sure' he'll retire at season's end:::::GREEN BAY, Wis. -- When veteran tight end Martellus Bennett signed a three-year, $21 million contract with the Green Bay Packers this spring, he never offered any hint that his stay would be much shorter.But Bennett might be calling it quits after just one year in Green Bay.Bennett, 30, posted an Instagram story on Saturday saying he is considering retirement after this season, his 10th in the NFL."After conversations with my family, I'm pretty sure these next eight games will be the conclusion of my NFL career," Bennett wrote."To everyone that has poured themselves and time into my life and career.These next games are for you.Thank you."A Packers source confirmed Saturday that the team is aware of Bennett's possible retirement after the season.Green Bay, which is on a bye this week, has nine games to go in the regular season.Even after he signed with the Packers, Bennett maintained his home in Long Grove, Illinois, a northern suburb.Bennett spoke frequently about the return trips he made there to see his wife and daughter."It's only two-and-a-half hours from here, so it's been a blessing," Bennett said last spring during OTAs.Bennett got off to a slow start this season and battled drops, but he has 24 catches (fourth-most on the team) for 233 yards without a touchdown.Before Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers broke his collarbone, Rodgers said he needed to make sure he got Bennett more involved early in games.Earlier this month, Bennett said he wasn't disappointed in his relatively limited production because he was still getting used to playing with Rodgers, and the Packers were winning.They were 4-1 at the time but have lost two straight since Rodgers went down."It's a long season," Bennett said earlier this month."The season's still getting started.For me, I left a couple of plays on the field here and there, but it's just getting used to and getting acclimated to playing in a game-type situation with Aaron and the team and the flow of things.So just try to figure out that, try to get in a good rhythm.I haven't really been able to get in a rhythm yet.But we're just getting started, and we're winning games.That's all that really matters."It doesn't matter if I have 10 catches or two catches.There's a lot of stuff I'll make an impact in the game with.It doesn't matter if I'm getting the ball or not.If my impact on this week's game is chipping a lot, I'm going to try to do the best job I can do chipping.If they need me to catch 10 balls, I'm going to try to go catch 10 balls.Every single week is different.I know a lot of the outside people look at statistics, but I just look at Ws."The Packers signed Bennett after they decided to let tight end Jared Cook leave in free agency.Cook then signed a two-year, $10.6 deal with the Raiders.
Bob McNair meets with Texans players, expresses regret over 'inmates' comment:::::Team owner Bob McNair met with Texans players Saturday morning and expressed regret for his "inmates running the prison" comment, a source confirmed to ESPN's Chris Mortensen."I know they were upset," McNair told the Houston Chronicle."I wanted to answer their questions.I told them if I had it to do over again, I wouldn't use that expression."Later Saturday, McNair issued a statement that expanded on his apology from Friday."As I said yesterday, I was not referring to our players when I made a very regretful comment during the owners meetings last week," the statement read."I was referring to the relationship between the league office and team owners and how they have been making significant strategic decisions affecting our league without adequate input from ownership over the past few years."I am truly sorry to the players for how this has impacted them and the perception that it has created of me, which could not be further from the truth.Our focus going forward, personally and as an organization, will be towards making meaningful progress regarding the social issues that mean so much to our players and our community."Mortensen confirmed the statement was part of McNair's message to the players during Saturday's meeting.An owner who was in the meeting told ESPN on Saturday, though, that, given the discussion in the room when McNair made the statement, it would be hard to conclude how he could have been referring to anyone other than players.A Texans offensive starter told ESPN's Josina Anderson that the team will meet Saturday night "to discuss a demonstration tomorrow."The player also said that he expects everyone on the team to travel Saturday to Seattle.McNair issued a public apology Friday following an ESPN The Magazine report that McNair said, "We can't have the inmates running the prison," during last week's owners meeting, in reference to ongoing player demonstrations during the national anthem."I let them know that No.1, the last thing I want to be is a distraction to the team," McNair told Houston's Fox 26 on Saturday."If any of the players were offended by what was reported, I'm sorry about that, and I apologized to them for that.We need to just work together going forward."Some Texans players considered staging a walkout following McNair's comment, a source told ESPN.About 10 players, including Pro Bowl wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, left the facility Friday, the source said.Sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter that Hopkins' absence from practice was directly related to McNair's comment.Running back D'Onta Foreman?also did not practice over the quote, sources told ESPN's Sarah Barshop.Most of the players who left returned to the facility, a source said, and the remaining players were talked out of their protest by the coaching staff."When it happened, there's a thousand emotions going through your mind," left tackle Duane Brown said Friday."Obviously, one of the emotions is to leave the building immediately.[But] we decided to go to work.The situation's not over.It's something that we'll reconvene and talk about again, but we had practice today."Texans coach Bill O'Brien said Hopkins had taken a "personal day."O'Brien said Friday that he expected Hopkins to be on the team plane to fly to Seattle on Saturday and that the wide receiver will play Sunday against the Seahawks.
Aaron Rodgers says Anthony Barr gave him finger after hit:::::GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Cameras caught Aaron Rodgers yelling at Minnesota Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr after the hit that broke the Green Bay Packers quarterback's collarbone, but Rodgers said that's only one side of the story.Rodgers said the cameras never showed what Barr did."I looked over at him as I walked off the field.The cameras caught me saying something to him, but what they missed was him [giving the] finger, 'suck it' sign," Rodgers said during a TV appearance on TBS's Conan O'Brien show.Multiple sources told ESPN that Barr grabbed his crotch after the hit.On the day after the hit, an NFL source said the league was not aware of any gestures and was not looking into what Barr did after the play.The NFL has yet to comment on whether it would look into the matter now that someone has gone on the record with an accusation.Rodgers appeared on "Conan" during the Packers' bye week after he underwent surgery Oct. 19 to repair his right clavicle."I rolled out to my right, I threw the ball, and I got tackled and kind of slammed on the ground.But I'm good now," Rodgers said on the show."Thirteen screws later and here I am."Later, he admitted to ESPN Wisconsin's Jason Wilde that he may have exaggerated about having 13 screws implanted during the surgery.A week ago, Barr said he wasn't sure what Rodgers said to him."He wasn't happy, and I understand.He probably realized that he was injured at that time and he wasn't happy," Barr said."I probably would have had that same reaction.It's fine."Packers coach Mike McCarthy had called the hit "an illegal act" and "unnecessary.""No one liked the way it happened," he said."No one liked the things that happened after the injury, some of the bulls--- that went on there.No one feels good about that."Rodgers was placed on injured reserve the day after the surgery.The Packers are holding out hope that he could return late in the season, but IR rules say that he must remain out for a minimum of eight weeks.Rodgers would return only if the Packers are still in contention for a playoff berth.They were 4-1 entering the Week 6 game at Minnesota, where Brett Hundley finished the 23-10 loss.The Packers lost Hundley's first start Sunday against the New Orleans Saints to fall to 4-3.
Dartmouth assistant punches out glass at Harvard Stadium press box:::::A Dartmouth coach was so incensed when his team fumbled a punt against Harvard that he punched a hole through the glass at Harvard Stadium on Saturday.Dion King, a defensive quality control coach for Dartmouth, was located in the press box above the field when he broke the glass, sending shards down below.King was escorted out of the stadium by security.In a statement, Dartmouth head coach Buddy Teevens said King "let his emotions get the best of him.""Dion and Dartmouth Football are terribly sorry for his actions and any harm caused by them.We hold ourselves to high standards, and in this instance we failed to conduct ourselves appropriately.Dion, Dartmouth Football, and I apologize wholeheartedly to everyone impacted, as well as to Harvard and Dartmouth," Teevens said.With Dartmouth ahead 14-0 in the second quarter, Danny McManus fumbled the punt in question, which Harvard recovered and turned into a touchdown after a six-play, 38-yard drive.Harvard would rally to win, 25-22.
Gurriel banned 5 games in 2018 for racist gesture at Darvish:::::Yuli Gurriel will have to sit out for making a racist gesture toward Yu Darvish but not during the World Series.Major League Baseball suspended the Houston Astros first baseman on Saturday for the first five games next season.The punishment came a day after Gurriel's actions toward the Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher during Game 3."I understand that people may have different views," Commissioner Rob Manfred said."But it was my best judgment that this timing was appropriate.""I wanted the burden of this discipline to fall primarily on the wrongdoer," he said.The Cuban-born Gurriel pulled on the corners of his eyes after homering off Darvish during Houston's 5-3 win Friday night.He also used a derogatory Spanish term in reference to Darvish, who was born in Japan."I made an offensive gesture that was indefensible," Gurriel said in a statement released by the Astros."I sincerely apologize to everyone that I offended with my actions.I deeply regret it.""I would particularly like to apologize to Yu Darvish, a pitcher that I admire and respect.I would also like to apologize to the Dodgers organization, the Astros, Major League Baseball and to all fans across the game," he said.Gurriel said Friday that he wanted to meet with Darvish to express his regret.Manfred said there would be a private apology.Gurriel will lose $322,581 of his $12 million salary next year, which the Astros will donate to charitable causes.He also will be required to undergo sensitivity training during the offseason.Immediately after the game, Darvish said he was angry."Acting like that, you just disrespect all the people around the world," he said in Japanese through a translator.Darvish later tweeted "let's stay positive and move forward instead of focusing on anger."Gurriel drew cheers when he batted in the second inning of Game 4 on Saturday night.He grounded into a double play.The 33-year-old Gurriel played in Japan in 2014 and is completing his second season in the major leagues after leaving Cuba.Darvish was born to a Japanese mother and an Iranian father.The four-time All-Star played professionally in Japan from 2005-11 before joining the Texas Rangers in 2012.He was sent to the Dodgers at this year's July 31 trade deadline.Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow said the team was "surprised and disappointed" by Gurriel's behavior and supported Manfred's decision."Yuli has always demonstrated respectful behavior and is extremely remorseful for his actions," Luhnow said."Appropriately, Yuli has apologized for his gesture.He had no intention of offending anyone, but now recognizes the perceived offensiveness of his actions."MLB suspended two players this season for using slurs.Toronto's Kevin Pillar and Oakland's Matt Joyce each were banned two games this season after making anti-gay comments.In 2012, Toronto infielder Yunel Escobar was penalized three games for a gay slur."That precedent is not adequate to deal with the current situation," Manfred said."I've decided to go beyond that precedent as a statement of our disapproval of this behavior."Manfred said he was "impressed in my conversation with Yu Darvish by his desire to move forward, and I felt that moving the suspension to the beginning of the season would help in that regard."Said Manfred: "There is no place in our game for the behavior or any behavior like the behavior we witnessed last night.""There is no excuse or explanation that makes that type of behavior acceptable," he said.By imposing a penalty Gurriel and the players' union agreed not to contest, Manfred avoided a possible grievance hearing in the next few days before arbitrator Mark Irvings that would have taken attention away from the World Series.Gurriel will be put on the restricted list next season, meaning the Astros can replace him and play with a 25-man roster.Manfred would not compare Gurriel's actions with the Cleveland Indians' decision to keep using their Chief Wahoo logo, which has been criticized by Native Americans and others."I see a difference between behavior from one player directed specifically at a player and a logo," he said."While both are problematic, I don't see them as the same issue.We continue to have conversations with the Indians about the logo, and it's an issue I intend to deal with in the offseason."More MLB baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball
Comeback! No. 6 Ohio State rallies to beat No. 2 Penn State:::::In the tunnel at Ohio Stadium that leads from locker room to the field, J.T.Barrett was posing for pictures with friends, receiving handshakes and hugs and thanking one older man with a scratchy voice for screaming himself hoarse.Barrett smiled and laughed.Apparently, the Ohio State quarterback even busted out some moves in the locker room celebration.The stoic fifth-year senior doesn't show much emotion on the field.And if he gained any particular gratification from playing the best game of his decorated career seven weeks after a lot of Buckeyes fans were wondering if he should be benched, he was not about to let on.This is certain: When Barrett said goodbye to his friends and left the Horseshoe on Saturday night he did so as a Heisman Trophy candidate with absolutely nothing left to prove.Barrett was near flawless against No.2 Penn State, capping a brilliant performance with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Marcus Baugh with 1:48 left in the fourth quarter that gave No.6 Ohio State a 39-38 victory.Buckeyes coach Urban Meyer called it one of the best games he has ever seen a quarterback play."I've never had a kid play perfect, but damn he was close tonight," Meyer said.Barrett was 33 for 39 for 328 yards and four touchdown passes, three in the fourth quarter after the Buckeyes (7-1, 5-0 Big Ten) were down 35-20.He also ran for 95 yards on 17 carries.In the fourth quarter, he was 13 for 13 for 170 yards."We don't care about what anyone else thinks about J.T.because we know what we think about J.T.and what he brings to the table," said Terry McLaurin, who caught Barrett's first TD pass of the game, which gave the quarterback 91 in his career to break Drew Brees' Big Ten record.Penn State led 38-27 with 5:42 left and it looked as if the Nittany Lions (7-1, 4-1) were going to knock the Buckeyes out of the College Football Playoff race."What was going through my head was Coach Meyer saying go win the game.He says that all the time, go win the game," Barrett said.Saquon Barkley scored two long touchdowns for Penn State, but it was Barrett who surged into the Heisman race in what was billed as the Big Ten game of the year and lived up to the hype."I think the H-word is appropriate after today's game," Meyer said.Barrett and the Buckeyes got the ball back down five with 3:20 left.They quickly marched to the 16 and then Barrett found his big tight end Baugh for the lead."I didn't manage the game well," Penn State coach James Franklin said."There's enough blame to spread around."The blackout crowd at the Horseshoe poured onto the field to celebrate after Barrett took a final knee.He calmly wandered through the mayhem.Barrett had been the target for much criticism after the Buckeyes' offense struggled in a September loss to Oklahoma.He said he just tried to get better.Barrett went 19 of 35 with no TDs and an interception against the Sooners.He looked like a different player Saturday, but he wasn't buying that."When you say like I'm different I feel like I would have to be thinking different in order to feel different, but I really don't feel any different because I'm thinking the same," he said."It's not like I'm telling myself anything new."Receiver K.J.Hill said Barrett's calmness keeps the Buckeyes cool, and, yes, he does cut loose sometimes."We definitely got a smile out of him.A little dance moves in the locker room," Hill said.STOPPING SAQUON Barkley was held to 44 yards on 21 carries, and that included a 36-yard touchdown run in the first half.And the Nittany Lions had trouble pass blocking Ohio State's talented defensive line, with Nick Bosa and Tyquan Lewis, especially after tackle Ryan Bates went out with an injury.On their final drive, quarterback Trace McSorley got pressured on each play, was sacked one and threw three incomplete passes.THE TAKEAWAY Penn State: The Nittany Lions will need some upsets to get back in the playoff and Big Ten race."We played a hell of a football game," tight end Mike Gesicki said."In no way, shape or form should anybody on our team have their head down, be disappointed. "Ohio State: The Buckeyes' now control the Big Ten East and they paid back the Nittany Lions for the loss last year in Happy Valley that kept Ohio State out of the conference title game.The Buckeyes' path to the playoff might still be muddled by that loss to Oklahoma, but right now they are the Big Ten's best shot.NEXT Penn State: The Nittany Lions face a third straight ranked opponent when they go to No.16 Michigan State.Ohio State: The Buckeyes go to Iowa next week.Follow Ralph D.

Keuchel warming up for Series rematch with Kershaw in Game 5:::::Dallas Keuchel figures he already has one advantage for his next start in the World Series warming up, he'll be able to spot his catcher.The Astros left-hander is set to start Game 5 against Los Angeles Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw on Sunday night.It will be a rematch of the opener, when Kershaw dominated in a 3-1 win."To be in a position to clinch would be awesome, just because that means we're taking care of business," Keuchel said.Houston led the Series 2-1 going into Saturday night's game.Whether he's pitching for a championship or trying to give the Astros a lead, Keuchel said his focus won't change.But his preparation will be slightly different.It was 103 degrees at Dodger Stadium for the first pitch.Keuchel felt the heat while he threw to catcher Brian McCann before the game."Physically, I felt great.The only thing that bothered me was the sun, it was literally in my face in the bullpen," he said."I had never been at Dodger Stadium for a 5 (p.m.) game before.Couldn't even see McCann or the plate warming up," he said.Part of the home-field advantage, probably.While Keuchel loosened up in the sun, Kershaw was in the shade.With the retractable roof closed at Minute Maid Park, the elements won't be an issue for Game 5.Kershaw was in total control in the opener.He threw seven shutout innings, giving up three hits while striking out 11 without a walk.Keuchel kept it close in the matchup for Cy Young Award-winning lefties.He pitched 6 2-3 innings and allowed three runs, giving up home runs to Justin Turner and Chris Taylor.In the open air, the crowd was loud at Dodger Stadium.At Minute Maid, the sound is amplified indoors."It's always more than I expect.And when I think about it in my head it's one way, but then it's actually better each and every time," Keuchel said."It was pretty impressive at Dodger Stadium to see all the white and blue.And I could only spot five or six orange Astros shirts or jerseys.So to replicate that here back in Houston is amazing," he said.Kershaw is aiming to repeat his performance in the opener.He's won all three of his starts this postseason."Hopefully, tonight we can even it up, and at least guarantee our chance back in LA.And either way you can't really focus on tonight's game, from my perspective, you've just got to be ready to go pitch," he said."Elimination game, no elimination game, shouldn't change your mindset.Obviously added pressure if it's an elimination game.But it shouldn't change any mindset, for sure," he said.More MLB baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball
The Latest: Astros strike first on Springer home run:::::The Latest on Game 4 of the World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Houston Astros (all times local): 9:09 p.m. George Springer delivered the first hit of the game for the Houston Astros and it was a huge one, a long home run in the sixth inning that put them ahead 1-0.Dodgers lefty Alex Wood had completely shut down the Astros until Springer homered deep to left field.Wood fell to one knee as he watched his final pitch sail, and Minute Maid Park erupted.Astros third baseman Alex Bregman made the play of the game, keeping things scoreless in the top of the sixth.After Los Angeles put runners at the corners with one out against Charlie Morton, Chris Taylor hit a sharp grounder to Bregman.Bregman aggressively charged the two-hopper, snagged it and made a perfect throw home to nail Enrique Hernandez.Morton has given up two singles and struck out seven.Going into the sixth, Wood had already accomplished something that no Dodgers pitcher had achieved.Not Sandy Koufax, not Don Drysdale, not Orel Hershiser, not Sal "The Barber" Maglie, not any Dodgers pitcher in Los Angeles or Brooklyn had taken a no-hit bid into the sixth in the World Series.Overall, at 5 2/3 innings this was the longest no-hit try in Dodgers postseason history.8:42 p.m. Astros starter Charlie Morton has still faced the minimum 15 batters through five innings.But it's Dodgers starter Alex Wood who still hasn't allowed a hit in Game 4 of the World Series.Wood has walked two batters, but one of them was retired on a double-play grounder.The only hit Morton allowed was to Chris Taylor leading off the game for the Dodgers.Taylor was thrown out trying to steal second base.Morton has seven strikeouts after getting two more Ks in the fifth.8:26 p.m. Charlie Morton and Alex Wood are locked in a pitcher's duel through four innings.Morton struck out two in a scoreless fourth to give him five on Saturday night and Wood retired Alex Bregman, Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa to leave Houston hitless.Morton struck out Chris Taylor to start the fourth before Corey Seager grounded out and he fanned Justin Turner.Wood has issued two walks and struck out one and Morton has allowed a hit but hasn't walked a batter.8:12 p.m. Not much traffic on the bases so far in Game 4 of the World Series.It's scoreless through three innings, with Dodgers lefty Alex Wood and Houston's Charlie Morton in charge.There's been only one hit, a single by Chris Taylor leading off the game.Wood has walked a couple, but no one has made it past first base.The crowd hasn't gotten crazy yet.Sounds like the fans are waiting for something big to happen.8:11 p.m. Seven-year-old Hailey Dawson, who was born without three fingers on her right hand, threw out the ceremonial first pitch with a 3-D printed prosthetic hand.Dawson's prosthesis was gold and had the words "World Series" on it.She tossed the ball to Astros star Jose Altuve, who hugged her before signing the hand.Earlier on Saturday, Houston ace Justin Verlander gifted the little girl, who is from Las Vegas, with custom-made cleats that said "Vegas Strong."Dawson, whose goal is to throw out a pitch at every major league ballpark, started by tossing out one at Nationals Park in June.7:52 p.m.Both starting pitchers in Game 4 have faced the minimum number of batters through two innings, even while allowing runners.Dodgers starter Alex Wood issued a leadoff walk to Carlos Correa to start the bottom of the second.But Correa was erased when Yuli Gurriel grounded into a double play.Los Angeles second baseman Logan Forsythe then made a nifty sliding stop toward the middle of the infield, getting up to throw out Josh Reddick for the inning-ending out.Houston right-hander Charlie Morton pitched a 1-2-3 second.The only Dodgers player to reach was Chris Taylor with a one-out single in the first, but he was then caught trying to steal second base.7:35 p.m. Game 4 of the World Series is scoreless after the first inning.The Dodgers held a team huddle in the dugout shortly before the first pitch.They trail 2-1 in the Series and were hoping to break loose against Houston starter Charlie Morton.Chris Taylor led off the game with a sharp single, but was later caught trying to steal.It was the first time Houston catcher Brian McCann had thrown out a would-be base stealer since mid-June 18.Los Angeles left-hander Alex Wood breezed through the first.The Astros contended that leadoff man George Springer was hit by a pitch, but lost their challenge.5:07 p.m. Dodgers rookie first baseman Cody Bellinger entered Saturday 0 for 11 with seven strikeouts in the World Series.Bellinger went 0 for 4 with four strikeouts in Game 3, prompting manager Dave Roberts to say "it's just trying to get Cody to slow down a little bit.I think he's been a little too quick."Roberts said Saturday the coaching staff had spoken with Bellinger, who set an NL rookie record with 39 home runs."They've got a plan together, and part of it is having a plan and also executing it," he said."I talked to Cody a little bit and saw the boyish smile, didn't want to get too deep in things, because he's a few games removed from the CS, which he swung the bat very well.So to put so much weight into a couple of games of not swinging the bat well I think is unfair."Bellinger hit .318 (7 for 22) with a home run and two RBIs in the NL Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs.4:44 p.m. Houston's 5-3 win in Game 3 of the World Series was seen by 16,163,000 viewers on Fox's three outlets, down 17 percent from the 19,386,000 who viewed Cleveland's 1-0 victory over the Chicago Cubs in the third game last year.Fox said Friday's game was seen by

Texans owner apologizes again; attempts to explain comment:::::Houston Texans owner Bob McNair has released a second apology and is attempting to explain his comments, a day after a report revealed that he said "we can't have the inmates running the prison" during a meeting of NFL owners about players who protest by kneeling during the national anthem.McNair, who first apologized in a statement on Friday, released a second statement regarding his comments on Saturday.He says he wasn't referring to the players in what he calls a "very regretful comment."Instead he says he was "referring to the relationship between the league office and team owners and how they have been making significant strategic decisions affecting our league without adequate input from ownership over the past few years."He then apologized to NFL players saying: "I am truly sorry to the players for how this has impacted them and the perception that it has created of me which could not be further from the truth.Our focus going forward, personally and as an organization, will be towards making meaningful progress regarding the social issues that mean so much to our players and our community."The comment was published in an ESPN The Magazine story about two recent days of meetings among owners, players and others to discuss the protests that have drawn the ire of President Donald Trump.Players, following the lead of former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, say they kneel to protest social injustices, particularly against African-Americans.Trump has sharply criticized the protests and even called on NFL owners to fire players.The meetings earlier this month did not result in a policy change that would require players to stand for the anthem.Owners and players are expected to meet again next week to discuss initiatives.For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/APNFL
No. 8 Miami stays unbeaten, tops North Carolina 24-19:::::Eighth-ranked Miami is still unbeaten, even if it isn't coming easy.Malik Rosier threw for a career-high 356 yards with three touchdowns to help the Hurricanes hold off North Carolina 24-19 on Saturday, though they struggled to put away an injury-riddled team despite entering the game as 20-point favorites.Miami (7-0, 5-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) didn't score its first touchdown until the final minutes before halftime and had two turnovers, most notably when Travis Homer coughed up a late fumble that gave UNC the ball with a chance to drive for a winning score.Still, Miami came up with a pair of key plays to stay atop the league's Coastal Division standings."A lot of good things happened," Miami coach Mark Richt said."Just not clean enough for me personally."Rosier had a 51-yard touchdown throw to Christopher Herndon IV late in the first half, a 78-yarder to Jeff Thomas to open the third quarter and a 5-yarder to Braxton Berrios to give the Hurricanes a 24-13 fourth-quarter lead.Rosier missed a first-half series because of an apparent shoulder injury.The team didn't make him available for comment after the game, saying he was receiving treatment.UNC (1-8, 0-6) got within 24-19 on freshman Beau Corrales' second touchdown catch with 3:03 left, then came up with Homer's fumble with 2:56 to go.But after pushing across midfield and near the Miami 35, UNC's Jordon Brown lost a fumble recovered by Jaquan Johnson with 2:11 left.Then Rosier ran for a chains-moving 7-yard keeper on third down, allowing Miami to run out the clock."Obviously us as an offense, we kind of felt a little bit down because we didn't do what we needed to do or executed the way that we wanted to," Miami offensive lineman Kc McDermott said."But at the same time, a win's a win."Nathan Elliott threw for one touchdown and three interceptions for UNC after starter Chazz Surratt was knocked from the game in the opening quarter."They go out there, and they care about each other, they love each other, and they play hard together," UNC coach Larry Fedora said."But we still made too many mistakes to overcome to win a football game, especially against a really good football team."THE TAKEAWAY Miami: The Hurricanes went from squeaking by in their last three wins by a combined 13 points to struggling much of the day against a 1-7 team relying on a third-string quarterback.Not the best way to go into the November stretch run, even as they remain unbeaten."I know this: If we keep a cool head and we make good decisions and we execute what we're calling, we've got a chance to come back and win," Richt said."That's what I think the team has done, even in the tightest of circumstances."UNC: The Tar Heels responded to last week's blowout loss at Virginia Tech with a better showing.Still, UNC's offense struggled in the red zone by getting just three points on three first-half trips.And the defense repeated its habit of surrendering a couple huge plays to wipe out long stretches of solid execution, sending UNC down 22 players because of injuries to 0-6 in the ACC for the first time since 2006.HAND SIGNALS Berrios remembered Miami's 59-21 loss at North Carolina from two years ago, complete with Tar Heels players flashing the Hurricanes' famous "U'' handsign upside down in celebrations.That's why Berrios popped up from his short TD catch, then turned the upside-down back up in gesture to the crowd."It hasn't really left my mind since we came up here two years ago and we got embarrassed, utterly embarrassed," said Berrios, an instate native of nearby Raleigh."You lose a game, but when you get disrespected like that it sticks with you for a while.I told my wide receiver group: If I got in, I was going to make sure the U was held up properly."UP NEXT Miami: The Hurricanes host No.13 Virginia Tech on Nov. 4 in a key Coastal Division matchup.UNC: The Tar Heels have an off week before going to Pittsburgh on Nov. 9.More AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/APTop25 Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap
Rudolph shines in rain, No. 11 Oklahoma St. beats No. 22 WVU:::::Even without a week of practice, Mason Rudolph outshined Will Grier in the rain.Rudolph threw three touchdown passes and ran for another score to lead No.11 Oklahoma State to a 50-39 victory over No.22 West Virginia on Saturday.A senior, Rudolph earned his 29th win as a starter, breaking the school record set by current coach Mike Gundy from 1986 to 1989.Rudolph was in uniform but held out of practice over the past week in order to rest.Gundy said Rudolph was "dinged" after a win at Texas but didn't specify any injury."I felt great today," Rudolph said."I was pretty confident.I think had it been my freshman year and I hadn't practiced all week, I might have been a little mentally kind of out of it.I'm just really confident in our offense the way I can grasp it."Rudolph finished 20 of 34 for 216 yards.The national passing yards leader prevailed in a matchup with Grier, who entered the game first in the FBS with 26 touchdown passes.Grier threw four interceptions, and his streak of seven straight 300-yard passing games ended.He finished 20 of 42 for 285 yards and two TDs.In winning its fourth straight, Oklahoma State (7-1, 4-1 Big 12) scored four touchdowns following West Virginia turnovers, and the Mountaineers couldn't come back from their biggest deficit of the season."I can't say enough about the defense and their ability to make plays," Gundy said."We got some pressure on the quarterback and forced some overthrows."Freshman J.D.King ran for a season-high 142 yards and scored twice in place of Big 12 leading rusher Justice Hill, who left after fumbling the ball away in the game's first series.King had 36 carries, more than doubling his previous high for the season.West Virginia (5-3, 3-2) entered the game fifth in total offense in the nation and was limited to 347 yards, 192 under its average."It was pretty clear and evident to me that they were more physical than us," West Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen said."Offensively and defensively both I thought they dominated up front and when that happens, it's going to be tough."Rudolph found King with a 6-yard-scoring pass early in the third quarter to put Oklahoma State ahead 30-10.Rudolph also had TD tosses of 13 and 19 yards to James Washington.After West Virginia scored a pair of quick touchdowns, Oklahoma State pulled away again when Hill returned in the fourth quarter, when he had scoring runs of 5 and 18 yards.THE TAKEAWAY Oklahoma State: Following the 13-10 win at Texas , Gundy wanted his running game to improve, especially on first down, to set up the pass.After averaging 2.9 yards per rush last week, the Cowboys were solid on the ground, with 246 yards.West Virginia: On Oct. 14, the Mountaineers came from 18 points down to beat Texas Tech at home.Grier couldn't summon a similar comeback this time, both overthrowing and throwing behind his targets.The loss puts the Mountaineers in a big hole in the quest for a spot in the conference championship game.TWO TDS, NO OFFENSE West Virginia stormed back in the third quarter without the help of its offense.Little-used redshirt freshman Osman Kamara blocked a punt and teammate Marvin Gross recovered the ball in the end zone.Fifty seconds later, Kenny Robinson, who lost his starting job this week at cornerback, returned an interception 39 yards to cut the deficit to 30-24.SILLS A NON-FACTOR West Virginia's David Sills V, who entered the game leading the nation with 15 receiving TDs, six more than anyone else, failed to score a touchdown for only the second time this season.He had three catches for 44 yards.POLL IMPLICATIONS Oklahoma State could move back into the Top 10, while West Virginia likely will fall out of the rankings.UP NEXT Oklahoma State: Bedlam at home next Saturday against No.10 Oklahoma.West Virginia: Plays No.25 Iowa State at home next Saturday.More AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/APTop25
No. 3 Georgia thumps rival Florida 42-7 in 'Cocktail Party':::::Sony Michel slipped through the line untouched, sprinted past several defenders and then spun into the end zone.The rout was on, and the losing streak was essentially over.Michel put third-ranked Georgia up big early and put Florida away late, scoring on two long runs in a 42-7 drubbing Saturday that might have been the final game for Gators coach Jim McElwain.It was Florida's most lopsided loss in the series since a 44-0 shutout in 1982.Michel finished with 137 yards rushing on just six carries and helped the Bulldogs remain unbeaten and in control in the Southeastern Conference's Eastern Division.Nick Chubb also scored for Georgia (8-0, 5-0 SEC), which started 8-0 for the first time since 2002 and ended a three-game losing streak in "The World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party.""This meant a lot to get a win," linebacker Lorenzo Carter said."It's one of the reasons I came back for my senior year.We hadn't beaten them and I wanted to go out with a win.We had to finish out the right way, and we did."So lift a glass to Georgia.And pour one out for McElwain."I haven't been told anything," said McElwain, who is now 22-12 in three seasons."There have been no conversations about that....Nothing in this world surprises me.I know what I was brought here to do.Look, we haven't been good on offense.I get it.We've won a few games, but we haven't won enough; haven't won a championship.That's real.That's life.And I take full responsibility for all of it, no doubt."Florida (3-4, 3-3) started the day by responding to a tweet from a sports lawyer who said Florida and McElwain's agent, Jimmy Sexton, have engaged in buyout negotiations and are "miles apart."Athletic director Scott Stricklin released a statement several hours before the game saying the report was inaccurate."No one representing the University of Florida or our athletic department has had any conversations with Coach McElwain or his representatives regarding a buyout of his contract," Stricklin said.McElwain was told about it during a team breakfast."Those eggs didn't taste real good," he said.But Stricklin stopped short of giving McElwain a vote of confidence after one of the strangest weeks in program history.McElwain created a firestorm Monday when he said Florida players and families received death threats amid the team's struggles.Stricklin met with McElwain in hopes of gathering more information and helping alleviate any safety concerns.McElwain rebuffed his efforts, prompting a statement from the athletic department that essentially criticized McElwain for being uncooperative.His reaction raised questions about his relationship with Stricklin and prompted speculation about whether he even wants to be at Florida any longer.Here are the big questions: Can Florida fire McElwain with cause and avoid a $12.9 million buyout or are they willing to part ways regardless?Florida's performance against Georgia surely doesn't bode well for McElwain's job security.The Bulldogs scored on their first three possessions and led 21-0 before the Gators picked up a first down.Georgia used three huge plays to build a three-touchdown lead."It was a shocker," said Florida safety Chauncey Gardner, who questioned Georgia quarterback Jake Fromm early in the week.Fromm found D'Andre Swift in the flat for a 39-yard gain that set up Chubbs' 6-yard touchdown run.Dominick Sanders intercepted Feleipe Franks' pass on the ensuing possession, and Fromm threw a perfect, 17-yard pass to Javon Wims in the corner of the end zone.Michel added his first of two scores, a 74-yarder midway through the second quarter.He added a 45-yard TD scamper in the third."We're not going to point fingers or complain," Franks said."You don't live in the past or the future.You have to live in the now.... We're definitely not going to fold.We're not going to bow our heads down."TAKEAWAY Georgia: The Bulldogs are clearly the best team in the East and look like they could make a run at top-ranked Alabama in the league title game.Florida: The Gators are dealing with the kind of mess that only a coaching change can correct.It's no longer a matter of if, but when.SHUTOUT STREAK The only question that remained late in the game other than McElwain's future was whether Georgia would end Florida's NCAA scoring record.The Gators haven't been shut out since a 16-0 loss to Auburn in 1988.They scored with 2:42 remaining against Georgia's backups to extend the streak to 368 games.UP NEXT Georgia: Hosts South Carolina next Saturday.The Bulldogs could clinch the East next week, but only if Kentucky loses to Tennessee later this Saturday.Florida: Begins a two-game road stretch at Missouri.They play at South Carolina the following week.More AP college football: www.collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/APTop25
No. 5 Wisconsin holds off Illinois 24-10, stays unbeaten:::::Wisconsin has relied all season on star freshman running back Jonathan Taylor to provide the winning edge.When Taylor went down with an injury against Illinois on Saturday, the fifth-ranked Badgers showed how well they can play defense, forcing three turnovers to help key a 24-10 victory.Wisconsin had five sacks and three quarterback hurries against the Illini's inexperienced quarterbacks.The pressure up front led to two interceptions, one by defensive back Joe Ferguson, and a fumble recovery."When someone does get a pick or fumble, everybody is juiced-up and excited for them," Ferguson said."It makes everyone else want to make a play."On offense, Wisconsin did just enough to get by.Alec Ingold and Garrett Groshek scored on short runs in the first half, and offensive lineman Michael Deiter added another touchdown on a trick play late in the game.Taylor entered the game averaging 158.6 yards rushing, but only had 73 before leaving the game in the second quarter.Head coach Paul Chryst said he does not know the extent of the injury."It was fun to see other guys have to step up," Chryst said."We'll find out more about JT at practice this week."Alex Hornibrook made enough throws to get the victory for Wisconsin (8-0, 5-0 Big Ten).None was better than on the trick play that freed Deiter for his first career touchdown.Hornibrook dropped back on third-and-goal from the 4 and rushed right before throwing a backward pass to Deiter on the other side.The 328-pound Deiter caught it and hustled in for the score."I was super nervous," Deiter said."I've never touched a football in a football game other than @ center.I had the whole offensive line out in front of me.There was no way I wasn't going to get in."Wisconsin gained 303 yards, well below its season average of 462.7 yards, but was able to overcome a sluggish performance for its 11th consecutive conference victory.After starting with consecutive three-and-outs, Wisconsin came alive behind Taylor, who gained 52 yards to set up Ingold's 1-yard plunge on his only carry of the game.That capped a 15-play, 92-yard drive that took just over eight minutes.Without Taylor to contend with, the Illinois defense held its own, keeping the score at 17-3 until the fourth quarter.But the Illini offense never found a rhythm."It was an outstanding defense that we were going against," Illini coach Lovie Smith said."We couldn't establish the run.We had our moments with the passing game, but not enough consistency to win."Sophomore Jeff George Jr. and freshman Cam Thomas combined to go 9 of 31 for 152 yards.Thomas threw the interceptions, the second coming midway through the fourth quarter and ending any hopes of a comeback.The Illini (2-6, 0-5) finally found the end zone on a 3-yard run by Kendrick Foster, but it came with less than a minute left in the game.THE TAKEAWAY Wisconsin: The Badgers' hopes for a Big Ten title remained intact despite losing Taylor.They didn't look worthy of making the playoffs, though.Illinois: The Illini have the worst scoring offense in the Big Ten and it showed.Smith's dual-quarterback approach doesn't seem to be the answer.In the past two games, George has thrown just one touchdown pass and Thomas has thrown three interceptions.QUARTERBACK WIN STREAK Wisconsin has not lost a game in Hornibrook's last 14 starts.It's the nation's longest active win streak by a quarterback.The streak started last October with a 17-9 victory over Iowa.TARGETING PENALTIES Linebacker James Knight was ejected in the second quarter for targeting.After a 13-yard completion from Hornibrook to wide receiver Quintez Cephus, Knight dived in and tagged Cephus with a late hit to the head.Knight is the fourth Illini to be ejected for targeting this season.Bennett Williams, defensive back Stanley Green, and linebacker Tre Watson are the others.BANGED-UP BACKFIELD After starting two consecutive games, Illinois RB Ra'Von Bonner did not suit up against Wisconsin due to a concussion.Bonner has 219 yards on 67 carries and leads the team with four rushing touchdowns this season.UP NEXT: Illinois hits the road to face Purdue next Saturday.Wisconsin is on the road against Indiana next Saturday.More AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/APTop25
Northwestern stuns No. 16 Michigan State 39-31 in 3 OT:::::A gory injury couldn't knock Nate Hall out of the game or stop him from coming up with Northwestern's biggest interception of the season.Hall picked off Brian Lewerke in the end zone on the game's final play even though he had 30 stitches in his left hand after Clayton Thorson threw a 22-yard touchdown to Flynn Nagel in the third overtime to lead the Wildcats to a 39-31 victory over No.16 Michigan State on Saturday.Northwestern had a third down at the 22 when Thorson hit Nagel on a crossing pattern for the go-ahead TD.Cameron Green caught the two-point conversion to make it an eight-point game, and two big plays by the defense on one snap preserved the victory .Lineman Joe Gaziano stripped Lewerke as he dropped back on second down at the 25.Hall heard the crowd roar and figured there was a sack, but he stayed locked in coverage.Lewerke picked up the loose ball and fired toward the goal line.Hall reached up and came down with a pass intended for Matt Sokol , setting off a wild celebration with the sideline emptying and fans pouring out of the stands."We're taught to stay in coverage," Hall said."That's exactly what I did."That Hall finished the game was quite an achievement.He missed most of the second quarter after his middle and index fingers got bent so far back they broke the skin.His interception set off a wild celebration, with the sideline emptying and fans pouring out of the stands."We've always kind of had the same mentality," Nagel said."We've known that we can be a good team.We are a good team.I think we're not just starting to prove that."The win was the third straight for the Wildcats (5-3, 3-2 Big Ten) and their second in overtime in as many weeks.Michigan State (6-2, 4-1) came up short after winning four in a row.Thorson threw for 356 yards and two touchdowns.Jackson had 41 yards rushing and 51 receiving.But the star running back threw for a touchdown early in the fourth quarter on his first career pass.Nagel added 87 yards receiving, and Cameron Green had 76 yards and a TD catch."We kept playing," Thorson said."So proud of our guys.These are the games that just think back to playing NCAA Football and going to triple-overtime with my brothers this is something I've always wanted to do."Lewerke threw for 445 yards and four touchdowns.But he was second guessing his decision on the game's final play."I should have thrown it away, but I saw Sokol running on the right side and it looked like he had a couple of steps on a guy," he said."It just takes a little bit bigger of an arm to make that throw and obviously I probably shouldn't have thrown it in that situation."Cody White had 165 yards receiving and two TDs.But instead of heading into next week's home game against No.2 Penn State unbeaten with a perfect conference record, the Spartans came up short facing a resurgent team.After Michigan State deferred to start the first OT, Thorson threw a 14-yard touchdown to Green.Lewerke then hit Felton Davis with a 6-yarder to tie it and gave the Spartans a 31-24 lead with an 11-yarder to White.But Jackson tied it again with a 3-yard run for his 38th career touchdown, tying Damien Anderson's program record."They're seeing the return on the investment, that the work (they're) putting in, (they're) getting the reward," coach Pat Fitzgerald said.DOWN THE STRETCH Jackson also gave Northwestern a 17-10 lead early in the fourth.He took a handoff from Thorson and threw a wobbly 12-yard touchdown to Bennett Skowronek in the back of the end zone.Michigan State's Matt Coghlin hit the right upright attempting a 32-yard field goal with about six minutes left in regulation.But the Spartans got another chance.Lewerke scrambled for 5 yards on a fourth-and-4 from the 30 and threw a 13-yard touchdown to Felton Davis III in the left corner of the end zone to tie it with 25 seconds left in regulation.THE TAKEAWAY Michigan State: The Spartans could have really made things interesting in the Big Ten with back-to-back games against No.2 Penn State and No.6 Ohio State coming up.Northwestern: The Wildcats squeezed out another tight win and once again seem to be hitting their stride after a slow start, just as they did last year.QUOTABLE Fitzgerald when asked if Jackson will throw any more passes: "No, we will not be calling more throws for him."UP NEXT Michigan State: Hosts Penn State on Nov. 4.Northwestern: Visit Nebraska on Nov. 4.More AP college football coverage: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://twitter.com/APTop25

Anthony Joshua stops Carlos Takam in the tenth to defend heavyweight titles in Cardiff:::::Anthony Joshua stopped an incredibly tough Carlos Takam in the tenth round to defend his WBA, IBF and IBO heavyweight world titles on Saturday night in Cardiff.After suffering what appeared to be a broken nose in the second round, Joshua fought on to cut his opponent, before eventually stopping him in the latter stages.The fight began with the champion firmly on the front foot, while the challenger was reluctant to engage.However Joshua faced a new test in the second when a head-butt from his opponent seemed to break his nose.It feels it [broken] said AJ in his post-fight interview, I just kept my composure and continued to fight.As the rounds progressed, Joshua continued to assert his dominance and answered back by causing a severe cut to his opponents right eye, before dropping him in the fourth.The tough Takam refused to wilt, fighting on through adversity to win the hearts of the Cardiff crowd.There were multiple occasions between rounds when the doctor was called to inspect Takams cuts.This may have influenced the referees thinking as the battle entered the tenth.Joshua landed a big shot which clearly hurt his opponent and then followed it up with a couple of not-so-clean punches before referee Phil Edwards jumped in much to the disappointment of the onlooking fans.The stoppage saw Takam call for a rematch after the fight, but Joshua and his promoter Eddie Hearn made clear that they were looking at bigger things.AJs told me he wants the belts, said Hearn.Deontay Wilder v Anthony Joshua has to happen.Deontay Wilder, Joseph Parker, Tyson Fury - those are the 2018 fights.When asked of the controversial stoppage, AJ simply stated: I have no interest of whats going on with the officials, thats not my job.Earlier in the night, Dillian Whyte overcame Robert Helenius on points while Irelands Katie Taylor made a statement as she won her first professional world title against the tough Anahi Sanchez.Kal Yafai triumphed against his mandatory challenger Sho Ishida to retain the WBA super-flyweight belt, while Frank Buglioni defended his British light-heavyweight title with a unanimous decision victory over late replacement Craig Richards.Also during the night, 2016 GB Olympians Joshua Buatsi, Joe Cordina and Lawrence Okolie picked up wins to move to 3-0, 5-0 and 6-0 respectively.

Chelsea boss Antonio Conte realistic about Premier League title defence:::::Chelsea must be "realistic" in their quest to chase down leaders Manchester City and set their Premier League title defence back on track, according to Antonio Conte.Boss Conte has admitted the Blues deserve to sit fourth in the table after a patchy 10 games in an early-season stint containing "a lot of problems".Eden Hazard's first Premier League goal of the season guided Chelsea to a 1-0 win over Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium, leaving Conte charting an upward curve for the weeks ahead."At this moment we must be realistic by going game by game," said Conte, when asked to assess Chelsea's chances of catching Premier League leaders City."We have 19 points and we deserve to have 19 points."We are first in our group in the Champions League.We went into the next round of the Carabao Cup after going out in the second round last season."I'm very happy with this group.There are players who are very honest, players who want to fight until the end for something important."Are we able to do this?I don't know.But we will try to stay there."I know very well that, in England in this league, there are six top teams, very strong.Four go into the Champions League.Two have to stay out and play Europa League."Today it was important: a good win, also because the other teams all won, apart from Tottenham who lost."Striker Alvaro Morata has now gone five games in all competitions without a goal - but Conte believes the Spain hitman will soon hit his peak after injury.Morata missed a gilt-edged chance and also had a goal incorrectly chalked off over a bad call on a Cesar Azpilicueta offside."Honestly, I'm happy with his commitment, his desire, his will to fight," said Conte, of Morata."For sure, he can do better but, don't forget, he is recovering from a muscular problem."When you have this type of problem, it needs a bit of time to come back to the best physical condition.But I'm very happy with his performance."N'Golo Kante missed Saturday's Bournemouth victory despite returning to training after hamstring trouble, but could now face Roma in Tuesday's Champions League clash."I hope, I hope; he could be ready," said Conte."But you know very well the importance of this player.I want to be sure he is ready.I'd prefer not to take a risk.If he's ready, he plays."
Mexican Grand Prix: Sebastian Vettel edges out Lewis Hamilton for pole position:::::Lewis Hamilton was made to settle for third on the grid in Mexico as Sebastian Vettel kept his slim world championship hopes alive by storming to pole position.Max Verstappen appeared on course to become Formula One's youngest ever pole sitter only for Vettel to beat the Red Bull driver with the final lap of a dramatic qualifying session at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.Vettel, who trails Hamilton by 66 points with just three grands prix remaining, must finish either first or second in Sunday's race to stand any chance of taking the championship battle on to the penultimate round in Brazil.But despite Hamilton's relatively lowly grid slot the Englishman needs to cross the line only fifth to seal his fourth crown on Sunday.Hamilton has been in blistering form since the summer break after winning five of the six grands prix staged, including a dominant victory in Austin, Texas last weekend.But the British driver has his work cut out to secure his fourth world championship in style after a rousing performance from Vettel.The German delivered a dizzying time at a track which is more than 2,300 metres above sea level, to edge out Verstappen by just eight hundredths of a second and claim the 50th pole of his career.Hamilton was nearly half a second further back in third with his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas fourth on the grid.Hamilton however, could be bumped up to second with Verstappen under investigation from the stewards for allegedly blocking Bottas earlier in qualifying.Verstappen was controversially stripped of his podium finish last Sunday in Austin after he was penalised for an illegal last-lap overtake on Kimi Raikkonen.Raikkonen finished fifth in the order ahead of Force India's Esteban Ocon, with Daniel Ricciardo a disappointing seventh."Congrats to Sebastian on reaching 50 poles," Hamilton said."I tried to deny him but it wasn't to be.It was a difficult session and it has been a difficult weekend."They did a great job and their car was working better than ours this weekend, but I am still there in the fight."The race pace is good so I am not worried about that, but you can't overtake here.There is a long way down to turn one so we should have some fun tomorrow."
Arsene Wenger relieved to overcome Swansea after slow start:::::Arsene Wenger felt his Arsenal side were "laboured" and "slow" in the first half of their Premier League clash with Swansea - before they hit back to take all three points.Swansea, who had won on three of their previous five league visits to the Emirates Stadium, set up defensively but went in at half-time in front thanks to Sam Clucas' first goal for the club.Arsenal had toiled for large parts of the half, with only Alexis Sanchez stinging the palms of Lukasz Fabianski as Swansea's defence held firm.But - in Wenger's 800th Premier League game in charge - it was a different story after the interval as Sead Kolasinac levelled less than six minutes after the restart before laying on the winner as Aaron Ramsey tucked away his cross to seal a 2-1 win for the Gunners."At half-time, I could be worried because we were 1-0 down and I knew that Swansea had conceded only one away goal the whole season," Wenger said."For us it was important to play quicker, sharper, with more penetration, changing sides quicker and putting them more under pressure, which we did in the second half.In the first half, we looked dominating but a bit laboured, too slow in our game."Arsenal moved to just one point behind third-placed Tottenham as a result of their win but face a tough trip to leaders Manchester City next weekend.
Pep Guardiola dismisses claims Manchester City will be champions by January:::::Pep Guardiola witnessed Manchester City equal the best ever points haul after 10 Premier League games but dismissed Jurgen Klopp's suggestion they will be champions by January.Guardiola's side won an eighth successive top-flight game by beating West Brom 3-2 at The Hawthorns to take their tally to 28 points from a possible 30 - a feat only the Chelsea side of 2005 and the City team of 2011 have otherwise achieved in the Premier League era.In both of those instances, that team went on to win the division and Liverpool boss Klopp had suggested to France's SFR Sport on Saturday morning that Guardiola's men could have the title sewn up by the new year.When that was put to Guardiola in his post-match press conference at The Hawthorns, he replied: "You are English - from a long time ago, did you see a champion in January?Me neither."Asked if it was unrealistic, Guardiola said: "Definitely."For now his team have a five-point cushion at the top having responded to Manchester United's victory over Tottenham earlier in the day with a win of their own over the Baggies.Leroy Sane's 10th-minute opener was quickly cancelled out by Jay Rodriguez before Fernandinho's deflected effort went in off the post to restore the visitors' lead as three goals were scored in under five minutes.Substitute Raheem Sterling finished off an exquisite City move after the break but their victory looked less handsome when Matt Phillips made it 3-2 by capitalising on Nicolas Otamendi's error in stoppage time.Guardiola's side have delivered more emphatic performances during their winning streak but the way they are continuing to pick up three points has been pleasing to him "The way we played from the beginning for 90 minutes showed me a lot," he added."You cannot win all the time by four, five, six goals, that is unrealistic."It's important when you make a good performance you win comfortably and when you don't play at the high level you're able to win."I think that's the big difference with last season - when we were not playing good there was no chance to win and this season, until now, it doesn't happen."
Hull 2-3 Nottingham Forest: Hat-trick hero Kieran Dowell earns visitors win:::::A first senior hat-trick by Kieran Dowell earned Nottingham Forest a 3-2 win at Hull to move them within one point of the Sky Bet Championship play-off places.The on-loan Everton midfielder grabbed all three goals for the visitors to secure maximum points despite late strikes from Jarrod Bowen and Michael Hector.In the build-up to the match, Tigers fans protested about their frustrations with owner Assem Allam, and those spilled on to the pitch in the 19th minute when a section of supporters threw yellow balls onto the pitch to chants of "We want Allam out", stopping play for several minutes.Dowell, an Under-20 World Cup winner with England in the summer, drilled in a 25-yard stunner to give the visitors a half-time lead before grabbing his second with a calm first-time effort with 19 minutes remaining.Bowen halved the deficit with a curling effort from 20 yards before Dowell completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot after Tyler Walker was hauled down six minutes from time, with Hector's late finish proving to be a mere consolation.Academy graduate Bowen created the first opportunity in the fifth minute when he worked his way into the Forest area with a mazy run but his low cross was well defended by Tendayi Darikwa with Kamil Grosicki lurking at the far post.From the resulting throw-in, the hosts went even closer to opening the scoring as Seb Larsson's terrific right-wing cross found Poland international Grosicki at the near post, but he could only divert his effort wide.The short delay caused by protests seemed to halt the momentum that the hosts had built up and Mark Warburton's side took full advantage of Hull's missed half-chances just before the half-hour mark.A loose pass was picked up by Dowell just inside the Tigers half before driving to the edge of the area and unleashing a strike into the top corner which left Hull goalkeeper Allan McGregor with no chance.Grosicki tested the hands of Jordan Smith in the Forest goal before the 22-year-old stopper brilliantly denied David Meyler from close range moments later in a goalmouth scramble.Just before the break, Bowen's trickery saw him ease past Eric Lichaj and his cutback was weighted perfectly for Grosicki, but a wonderful last-ditch block by Joe Worrall denied a certain goal.Forest nearly doubled their lead on the stroke of half-time when another quick counter led to Lichaj finding Ben Osborn 15 yards out but his first-time volley rattled the crossbar.Hull came close to an equaliser shortly after the restart when Larsson's free-kick rebounded kindly off the Forest wall for Fraizer Campbell, who thumped a half-volley straight at Smith.Heroic defending by the visitors stopped the Tigers from levelling in the 63rd minute when Jason Cummings flicked fellow striker Campbell's header over the crossbar.Forest doubled their lead when 20-year-old Dowell curled Barrie McKay's lay-off in off the post.Hull replied instantly with a neat finish from winger Bowen, only for Dowell to restore Forest's two-goal from the penalty spot after Walker was felled.Centre-back Hector ensured their was late drama when he smashed in from close range with three minutes left but the visiting side held on to secure back-to-back victories for just the second time this season.
Bournemouth 0-1 Chelsea: Eden Hazard seals victory for Blues:::::Eden Hazard's first Premier League goal of the season eased Chelsea past Bournemouth 1-0 at Dean Court.The Belgium playmaker's smart strike ensured Chelsea just about kept in touch with the league's pacesetters, though the champions still trail leaders Manchester City by nine points.Hazard rescued his side after a host of missed chances and an incorrectly disallowed goal for Alvaro Morata, with Cesar Azpilicueta ruled offside in error.Asmir Begovic was caught out by Hazard's near-post drive, that punished Simon Francis' failed clearance without regard for Bournemouth's early-season peril at the wrong end of the table.Bournemouth compounded their worst start to a Premier League season, and lost Jermain Defoe, Junior Stanislas and Benik Afobe to injury on a stark day for boss Eddie Howe.Callum Wilson made his first appearance since January after successive knee surgeries, but this was a day light on plus points for the Cherries.Josh King's absence with a back problem could now leave Wilson as Bournemouth's only fit striker - and the former Coventry man is not yet at full fitness.Chelsea wasted a hatful of first-half chances, but still had the officials to thank for turning round goalless.Morata tucked away the rebound after Azpilicueta blasted straight against Begovic, but the assistant incorrectly judged the Spanish defender offside.The Blues had no business serving up that error as excuse for their profligacy, especially Morata, who fluffed a cast-iron sitter.Begovic passed straight to Hazard 25 yards out, and the Belgium star played in Spain forward Morata.But the ex-Real Madrid man rolled his effort wide.Begovic saved well from Morata after a fine Hazard flick, while Tiemoue Bakayoko - blue hair and all - headed a corner straight at the home keeper.A curiously low-key half yielded precious few openings for Bournemouth, but Afobe was left to rue a puzzling call to play in Charlie Daniels when he should have fired off a shot on goal.The former Wolves man was clean through and ought to have at least tested Thibaut Courtois.Instead Daniels had to chase the over-hit pass and conjure a solid cut-back.But that delay let Chelsea reset their defence, and they duly cleared Afobe's eventual effort on goal.An obviously struggling Defoe did not reappear after the break, and Howe pitched in Jordon Ibe rather than throw on Wilson, who continues to work back to full fitness after successive knee ligament surgeries.The hosts started the half brightly enough, but were floored by Hazard's crisp strike.Francis bungled a clearance to gift Hazard the opening, and Begovic should not have been beaten at the near post.Ibe should have equalised with a half volley from 16 yards, but Antonio Rudiger produced a fine block to deflect the ball over the bar.
Liverpool news: Jurgen Klopp praises his team's return to form in win over Huddersfield:::::Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said it "felt like Christmas" as his players bounced back from their worst game of the season to beat Huddersfield 3-0.The 4-1 humiliation against Tottenham last weekend brought criticism raining down on the Reds boss and his players, but a return to winning ways alleviated some of the pressure.Daniel Sturridge's 100th club goal provided the crucial breakthrough five minutes after the break, and Roberto Firmino and Georginio Wijnaldum made sure of the points after Mohamed Salah had missed a penalty at the end of the first half, which was followed by boos from disgruntled fans."Of course we had not the best week.We take the situation really seriously.It is really important," said Klopp about the last seven days."Tottenham was the worst game we played in the season and you can't ignore it.It can happen."The first goal (against Huddersfield) we forced the situation.The second one after a set-piece felt like Christmas.We had a lot of good set-pieces today."The third one was nice play.Big relief.The pressure was there.I could hear it.People didn't like the first half too much."It was not too difficult to fix at half time.We had more players between the decisive lines and it was more difficult for Huddersfield to defend."Three goals, three points, clean sheet."
Aviva Premiership round-up: Saracens reclaim spot while Wasps show signs of recovery:::::Harlequins 41-35 Worcester Warriors Poor goal-kicking cost Worcester as they missed six kicks to allow Harlequins a 41-35 win in a try-fest at the Stoop.Warriors outscored their opponents by six tries to five to secure two valuable bonus points but a victory was well within their grasp.They led 18-10 before they suffered crucial injuries with Quins scrum-half Danny Care taking full advantage in the third quarter to inspire his side to victory.Care, Jamie Roberts, Mat Luamanu, Charlie Walker and Marcus Smith were Quins' try-scorers with Smith converting all five.The outside half and Tim Swiel also added a penalty.Dean Hammond scored twice for Worcester with Perry Humphreys, Jack Singleton, David Denton, and Josh Adams also on the score sheet.Jono Lance kicked a penalty and Tom Heathcote a conversion.Northampton Saints 22-38 Wasps Injuries to Elliot Daly and Matt Mullan were the only blemishes as Wasps continued to display signs of revival after a troubled start to the season in a 38-22 Aviva Premiership victory over Northampton.Daly failed to appear for the second half at Franklin's Gardens after sustaining a problem to his right knee before Mullan departed nursing a left shoulder complaint.Adding to England's list of casualties was Piers Francis, the Northampton playmaker who had to be helped from the pitch in the closing moments.All three have been named in England's training squad for their autumn series opener against Argentina at Twickenham on November 11 and are due to attend next week's training camp in Portugal.Injury-hit Wasps hardly needed fresh admissions into their treatment room but could at least celebrate a second successive victory that continues to place their five-match losing run in the rear view mirror.The Premiership runners-up were more like the team that illuminated the top-flight over the last two seasons, crossing through Christian Wade, Ashley Johnson, Josh Bassett and Juan de Jongh to claim a bonus point.Northampton slipped to a fourth successive defeat and there was a hint of controversy over the first of their two tries, but Wasps were also to blame for Ahsee Tuala dashing over in the 18th minute.Saracens 44-13 London Irish Owen Farrell scored 19 points as Saracens moved back to the top of the Aviva Premiership with a bonus point 44-13 win over London Irish at Allianz Park.Mako Vunipola forced his way over in an opening half which saw Farrell miss three attempts at goal but still manage a conversion and two penalties.The England fly-half converted his own try after the break though as Liam Williams and Chris Wyles ensured the bonus point before two late Nathan Earle scores.David Paice managed a consolation score for Irish but Saracens remain unbeaten at home in the league since March 2016.
Joc Pederson: 'You like that' after home run (video):::::I dont think Joc Pederson is a Redskins fan.Hes from California and hes never tweeted about them.But he is at least a fan of Kirk Cousinss 2015 You like that!exclamation.After giving the Dodgers a big cushion with a three-run homer in the top of the ninth, Pederson broke out that very same phrase.It cant be a coincidence, right?He does the same pointing gesture Cousins did and repeats the phrase twice, just like Cousins.I think its weird that your first instinct is to celebrate with a two-year-old reference to a team you dont even support, but then again Ive never hit a home run in the World Series.Maybe that has a strange effect on your brain.
Free Agent Wide Recievers 2018, Marcell Dareus Trade:::::1.The Bears acquired Dontrelle Inman from the Chargers earlier this week.Hes a huge upgrade over anyone Mitchell Trubisky has to throw to, which is both insulting and entirely true.I cant remember a time when there were so many teams trotting out such bad groups of receivers.Since, as friend of the show Rainbow Cave points out, its a week short on big-time games, and because Im the kind of guy who lays on the horn at the Taco Bell drive-through if my order takes longer than 40 seconds, lets all be impatient jerks and peek ahead to what should be a fascinating market for passing-game weapons this offseason.Right now, the Bears, Bills, and Browns, as well as the injury-ravaged Giants and (while theyre now getting healthier) Ravens are running out receiving corps comprised of players who would most generously be described as all having two hands and legal eligibility to work in the United States.The lack of weapons have completely crippled each of those passing offenses.Its been especially cruel for the rookies, Trubisky and DeShone Kizer.Remember how shaky Carson Wentz during the dog days of the 2016 season?Part of it was opposing defenses making adjustments, but the issue was compounded by a lack of anyone who could make a play or draw double coverage.Similarly, Jared Goff was plagued by offensive line problems a year ago, but his struggles were also the result of life with Kenny Britt as your No.1 target.Last winter, Wentz picked up Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith, and while neither has lit it up Jeffery demands extra attention and Smith stretches the opposing secondary (plus, having them on the perimeter allowed Nelson Agholor to move to the slot where he has thrived).In L.A., rookie Cooper Kupp has provided Goff with a true security blanket possession receiver, while Sammy Watkins consistently tips coverages, making life much easier for the second-year QB.For the teams desperately looking for help at receiver, they might not find it in the draft.SMUs Courtland Sutton is the way-too-early consensus No.1 wide receiver available (assuming he declares), and while hes a physical marvel hes also exceedingly raw.One year after a surprisingly soft market for receivers, the way to go might be a free-agent market with a wealth of high-risk, high-reward talent (listed here in no particular order): Alshon Jeffery: He hasnt found the chemistry Wentz yet, but if you have a QB whose comfortable with a contested catch receiver, this is your man.Sammy Watkins: Dont obsess over the numbers, hes still a stud when healthy, and hes trending toward his old self.Jarvis Landry: There are few empty calories in his numbers; so many of his catches are in-traffic and come in key situations.The Dolphins can not afford to lose him.Larry Fitzgerald: Its either Arizona or retirement though, right?Allen Robinson: Great in 2015, shaky in 2016, now coming off a torn ACL.Hes interesting on a one-year, prove-it deal.Terrelle Pryor: His development was re-set when he changed offenses, but his upside is still enormous and he probably has three or four years left in his prime.Jimmy Graham: Im assuming its unlikely Seattle will reinvest in him.Hes 30, but could still be effective as a moveable chess piece for an offense that doesnt need him to bang away as a blocker.Davante Adams: I dunno, what is he without Aaron Rodgers?I suppose were about to find out.Martavis Bryant: Not a free agent, but hed like to be available.He can match-up with anyone on this list from a pure talent standpoint; someone should be desperate enough to take the plunge this winter considering Bryant will make less than a million in the final year of his rookie deal.It will just be a matter of Pittsburghs asking price (if the Steelers indeed have an asking price).The market was soft last year, with Jeffery and Pryor settling for one-year deals.Considering how many teams are desperate for help in the passing game, I cant imagine it will work out that way again.2a.I cant believe you cant believe the Marcell Dareus trade!O.K., fair enough, no one ever gets traded, so you were right to spit-take.And, actually, its pretty stunning that now two teams have been willing to take on the albatross that is Dareuss contract.I could be wrong (I often am!), but I am bordering on physically ill over this deal from the Jaguars standpoint.(I also just ate 11 ounces of candy corn, which could be a contributing factor.)There are the obvious non-football concerns with Dareus; hes been suspended twice under the leagues substance-abuse policy and the Bills sent him home from a preseason game this past summer for violating team rules.After that, he was made him available via free stuff ad on Craigslist and a guy from West Seneca emailed to say hed take him but then never showed to pick him up.The contract, signed in 2015, was absolutely toxic, one of the worst deals for any team in football, hefty and inescapable for a player who can be great but more often ...well.But a 2018 cap hit just north of $10 million for a high-risk player is only part of the problem.There is incredible depth at interior defensive line across the NFL right now.Remember what happened to Johnathan Hankins this past offseason?Hes a quality interior D-lineman, and he eventually had to settle for course credit as compensation with the Colts, and hes not even sure those credits are gonna transfer.I kid, he got a three-year $27 million deal with the $10 million in guarantees due up frontessentially a one-year deal with two one-year options for the teamwhich means he has a more palatable deal than what remains on Dareuss contract.Hankins, of course, isnt quite the talent Dareus is.But he also doesnt bring the baggage.The point is, its a buyers market on defensive tackles these days.The Jaguars didnt have a lot of options for a mid-season upgrade.They wanted help against the run (I wouldnt say needed, especially because they could find more snaps for Paul Posluszny at Myles Jacks expense if they wanted to upgrade their run D), and they think Dareus gives them that help.Plus, Doug Marrone had Dareus for the two best seasons of his career and surely knows what hes getting himself into here.But this is a team thats built to be good beyond 2017 (footballs best CB tandem and theyre both young, Leonard Fournette, a sustainable pass rush, etc.).The Jaguars were already setting up to be snug against the cap in 2018, and theres still the little matter of quarterback as they approach an offseason in which multiple quality QBs could be available for the first time in a long time.(Theres also the matter of the Jaguars finding people for that quarterback to throw to; Allen Robinson is a free agent and coming off a torn ACL, Marqise Lee is also a UFA and Allen Hurns is a potential cap casualty, even more likely with this acquisition).Theyll presumably move on from Abry Jones, and might have to do the same with Malik Jackson to make space for Dareus in 2018.Even if they free up $19 million by letting Blake Bortles go, that basically covers their 2018 draft class.If, say, Drew Brees (who can not be tagged in New Orleans) follows through on his professed love for all things Doug Marrone and wants to come to Jacksonville, or if Eli Manning, who has some kind of past relationship with Tom Coughlin (I dont know the details, I think they were roommates in Bayonne, New Jersey), want to come to Jacksonville, the Jaguars would presumably figure out a way to make it work.But it just got a lot more difficult, and much more likely that theyd have to part ways with quality players for it happen.This feels like the move of a franchise panicking as the window closes.Punting any remaining 2018 cap flexibility for a team thats built to last, plus the potential headaches that come with Dareus, is a steep price to pay for the hope of a short-term run D upgrade.2b.In case it wasnt clear, congrats to Brandon Beane for getting anything in exchange for getting out from under Dareuss deal.The man is doing Gods work.3.Theres no good solution to the Joe Flacco near-decapitation play on Thursday night.A scrambling quarterback running for what might be a big third-down conversion, he slides late ...its a lot to ask a linebacker coming at a full sprint to find a way to hold up.(Its fair that Kiko Alonso was penalizedI wouldnt object to a suspensionI also think its fair that Ryan Jensen tried to decapitate Alonso after the play because two severe concussions make a right.)One common-sense rule change that could at least contribute to preventing hits like this would be adapting the college rule: Once your knee hits, youre down.If Flacco dives head-first, he has a first down.If he slides, he doesnt.Youre asking the tackler to anticipate what the QB is going to do, especially difficult on a third down in what was (at that point) a competitive game.If the play is over once a knee touches no matter what, then the tackler has more reason to hold up.It also eliminates the occasional peoples elbow (thats the only thing I know about post-80s pro wrestling) on a player who has slipped.The only thing you lose is the once-in-a-season hilarity of a receiver making a diving catch, the defenders forgetting to touch him and the receiver getting back up and running.Or the hilarious-er young receiver goes down then leaves a live ball on the ground (though when Victor Cruz did that a couple years ago they officials decided theyd call it differently than they ever had before, so whats the point?).Its an archaic rule that unnecessarily creates a gray area for a defender and puts players in danger for no good reason.4.I have missed Josh Norman tremendously and, considering the lack of big matchups in a 13-game week, am very happy to have him back to face off against Dez Bryant.And not just because of the commercials where they draw stuff on their phones.Ive been drawing on phones for years.Ruined a lot of phones that way.5.Cam Newton can present himself to fans and the public at large however he sees fit, but just a couple of notes on Cam vs.The Media IV: This Time Its ...Not Really Any More Interesting Than the First Three Times But Were Going to Talk About It Anyway.a.Is it unfair that Belichick and Popovich can get away with it, but when Cam does it we all get nuts?Yup!But then, Belichick and Popovich dont show much interest in the entertainment business and dont have a show on Nickelodeon and dont have a bunch of national endorsement deals.Cam can do the curmudgeon thing full-time if he wants, but from what I can tell thats not him and if it was him he wouldnt have these opportunities off the field.He is an absolutely magnetic personality; Ive only been in this industry for a decade-plus and Ive only been around Cam for two days (for a TV show, at that), but Ive never seen anyone else like him (Karl-Anthony Towns is the only one who comes close).If you put him in a room of 100 people, spread across demographics, and told him he had 20 minutes to make every one of them smile, he could do it with about 12 minutes to spare.Thats why its so jarring when he gets into these press conferences and goes positively turdular foras far as most of us can tellno good reason.So, sure, Cam can go the Belichick route, but if he does hes really got to go the Belichick route 24/7.(And, just a reminder: Belichicks approach wasnt charming until he started winning Super Bowl rings on a fairly consistent basis.)b.Its not outrageous to ask an NFL teams quarterback to hold a post-game press availability and a mid-week press availability during the season.In baseball, the starting pitcher is almost always available at his locker after a game.In basketball, the superstars hold court with varying degrees of frequency and then after every postseason game.Every other quarterback in the league does these press conferences, and theyre largely uneventful because you stand out there, act civil, give some boilerplate answers then everybody goes home ...not so much happy, but at least feeling nothing.c. Theres always criticism of the questions at these press availabilities (and often from people who have never been to one).Every reporter would love to sit down and have a weekly, in-depth one-on-one with the quarterback of the team they cover.But instead, they sit in a media scrum in which they might only get one question off, and try to phrase it both softly enough to not offend and openly enough to get an expansive answer.The question that seemed to reallyas the kids saybiff Newton on Wednesday: Big plays, big chunk plays, kind of get to that energy I think that you were talking about.Does this offenseI know you had several in Detroit and New Englanddo you think you guys have the wherewithal to do that consistently, week in and week out?Thats a gentle, courteous phrasing of what a lot of people around the league and Im sure a lot of Panthers have been wondering.The more honest phrasing would have been: You guys were really good when you were turning in big plays against the Patriots and Lions, but the last two weeks youve been really s---ty because you havent gotten any big plays.Why is that, how can you go about getting more big plays and therefore being less s---ty, or do you think youre just going to be s---ty for the rest of 2017?d. If everyone agrees that press conferences are obsolete and that the lamestream media isnt up to the task and Twitter is the future old man (or whatever, I dont deal with young people unless Im cursing them for trampling my lawn), Im all for any alternatives that get interested parties (i.e.fans) the information they want.If we dont like the press conferences, I suggest allotting 15 minutes, twice a week, for unscreened questions directly from fans (which Im sure would go over great after, say, a 17-3 loss in Chicago).e. Again, these press availabilities can be whatever you make of them.As head coach of the Golden State Warriors, Steve Kerr has to talk to the media all the time.On the same day Cam was doing a spot-on Liz Lemon impression because someone asked him about problems with an offense that just created 14 points for an opponent and only three points for themselves, Kerr opened his media availability by praising his organization for the spirit of openness, inclusion and respect for fellow humans created by the Warriors LGBT night.Especially now that everyones going to be paying at least slightly more attention to these press conferences, Cam should open with a monologue about the Cam Newton Foundation, Make-A-Wish Weekend, his 7-on-7 series.Its all great stuff, and a lot of people dont hear about it.They just see Newton at a press conference sulking about something or berating someone or bristling at some question that doesnt warrant getting upset.These press conferences are a platform.He should use it.6.We finally got that long-awaited apology from DeShone Kizer for being in a bar two nights before a game.Where he was standing.Presumably like Rory Calhoun.Kizer has played poorly for a myriad reasons, but being out at a bar two nights before a game is not one of them.However, I look forward to future apologies from Kizer: the time he substituted double fries for a side salad (nutrition is important!), and the time in May he binge-watched House of Cards Season 5 (when he could have been studying the playbook!).7a.Correct me if Im wrong (seriously, Ive looked and havent found this but maybe I just missed it), but it seems pretty telling that not one Houston Texans player has said anything in defense of Bob McNair.Not in defense of his comment specifically, but something along the lines of he said a dumb thing but he also does good things.The ownership/union relationship has been contentious across the league, but perhaps this serves as a lesson for owners to have a little more of a human touch with the players on their team.7b.One aside on the fantastic Van Natta/Wickersham ownership meeting tick-tocks: Dan Snyder always seems to make an appearance, but only as the comic relief.There was the $40 million comment in the last one, and this time the 96% line.Maybe he has a habit of saying dumb things in these meetings.Or maybe one of the sources really dislikes him.But probably both those things.8.Just a quick commendation for my podcast co-host and personal stylist Andy Benoit.This piece on the emergence of Alvin Kamara and similar multi-purpose running backsrelating to spread concepts and the struggles of teams to block on offense and cover on defenseis immensely interesting, easily digestible and thoroughly enjoyable if you want to gain a better understanding of football.Andy is the best at what he does because hes not just a film junkie, he is also always talking to people around the league because he knows there are things that he doesnt know (scorching hot take: crowd-sourcing NFL coordinators will make you a more knowledgeable analyst than crowd-sourcing Twitter will).The Kamara piece is some of his best work.9.Ladies and gentlemen, for my daughters birthday her favorite band, Nirvana!Question or comment?Email us at talkback@themmqb.com.
Russell Westbrook: Thunder G has triple double vs. all teams:::::Thunder star Russell Westbrook has now done something no NBA player in history has accomplished before.It involves triple doubles, naturally.With his 12-point, 13-rebound, 13-assist effort against the Bulls on Saturday, Westbrook became the only NBA player to record a triple double against 29 different teams.Westbrook set an NBA record last season with a total of 42 triple doubles.He is only the second player in league history to average a triple double over the course of the season.In his previous 17 games against the Bulls, Westbrook averaged 22.8 points, 7.5 assists and 6.1 rebounds per game.The closest he had come to a triple double against Chicago was in January, when he finished just one rebound shy.
Wyoming football: Josh Allen's crazy scramble (video):::::As I write this, Wyoming is putting a righteous beating on New Mexico.The Cowboys are up 420 at the half and star quarterback Josh Allen has already thrown four touchdowns.So things are going just fine, but I cant help but feel a little bit bad for Allen.Early in the second quarter, facing a third-and-9, Allen couldnt find an open receiver and decided to improvise.The ensuing scramble is too wild to describe in full but it including tip-toeing the sideline, dropping 19 yards behind the line of scrimmage and a front flip.And what did it net him?Eight yards.After all that, Wyoming had to punt.But New Mexico muffed the punt, Wyoming recovered and scored two plays later.I guess thats karma.
World Series first pitch: Hailey Dawson uses 3D-printed hand:::::Seven-year-old Hailey Dawson wants to throw out a first pitch at all 30 MLB ballparks.She crossed another one off her list on Saturday.Hailey was born with a birth defect that left her missing three fingers on her right hand, so she uses a prosthetic made by a 3D-printer.Her story about wanting to throw a first pitch at every stadium went viral back in September and many teams quickly reached out to help make it happen.She never mentioned wanting to throw out a World Series pitch, so Saturdays appearance at Minute Maid Park was just an added bonus.Hailey Dawson brings the Houston crowd to its feet!#WorldSeries pic.twitter.com/0WlCoxXQ2j Play Ball (@PlayBall) October 29, 2017 Earlier today, J.Verlander presented NV native Hailey Dawson, who will throw 1st pitch w/robotic hand, cleats w/ Vegas Strong inscription.pic.twitter.com/taHkdoHlep Alyson Footer (@alysonfooter) October 28, 2017 If you look closely, you can also see that Hailey wore a special World Series-branded hand for the occasion.
Baker Mayfield shirt: Oklahoma QB trolls Texas Tech fans:::::It isnt quite planting a flag at midfield but Baker Mayfield is getting under the skin of an opposing fanbase again.With Oklahoma taking on Texas Tech for the final time of Mayfields college career, Mayfield got in one last shot against his former school.ESPN Mayfield spent one season with the Red Raiders before transferring to Oklahoma under contentious circumstances.When Mayfield and the Sooners traveled to Lubbock last season, a whole bunch of Tech students wore the shirt Mayfield did on Saturday.Seen a few of these shirts in the Texas Tech student section: pic.twitter.com/K0g5eCBHsx Jake Trotter (@Jake_Trotter) October 22, 2016 All Mayfield did that day was throw for 545 yards and seven touchdowns, so maybe its just good luck.
Tennessee-Kentucky: Wildcats, Volunteers given personal fouls:::::The referee in Saturdays Tennessee-Kentucky game took the unusual step of assessing a personal foul penalty to every single player in the game.After a kickoff early in the first quarter, players from both sides confronted each other in the center of the field.The officiating crew decided to squash any potential chippiness right then and thereand issued a preemptive warning to both sides.Every player, even those not involved in the tussle, was given an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.Of course, a second personal foul penalty gets a player ejected from the game, so the officiating crew was trying to keep the game from getting out of hand by forcing every player to play with one personal foul hanging over their head.The strange ruling came back to bit two players not long after.Late in the first half, Kentucky defensive back Davonte Robinson and Tennessee linebacker Daniel Bituli were ejected after trading shoves because it was technically their second unsportsmanlike conduct foul of the game.Tennessee defensive back Rashaan Gaulden and Kentucky receiver Tavin Richardson were also ejected for unsportsmanlike conduct after some extracurriculars in the fourth quarter.As the Lexington Herald-Leader points out, officials pulled the same move in a game last season between Missouri and LSU.
Ohio State beats Penn State behind brilliant J.T. Barrett:::::However Urban Meyer imagined his No.6 Ohio State team would begin Saturdays crucial matchup with No.2 Penn State, it wasnt what actually took place.Neither the Buckeyes offense or defense had taken the field before Nittany Lions star Saquon Barkley was brushing off a desperate tackle attempt from junior place kicker Sean Nuernberger and flying down the sideline, having knifed through shoddy special teams coverage to run back the opening kick 97 yards for a touchdown.A few minutes later, the Nittany Lions went up 14-0 after capitalizing on the short field created by a fumble with a 13-yard touchdown pass.Those two scores turned the most highly anticipated game of this college football season so far into an imminent rout.Ohio State had blundered its way into a big early hole against a formidable foe with the talent and depth to keep it there.Penn State tacked on 14 more points before the half, but the Buckeyes rallied to win, 39-38, on the strength of a reputation-warping performance from veteran quarterback J.T.Barrett.In the process, Ohio State improved its record to 7-1, took out its biggest challenger in the Big Ten at home a year after losing to it on the road and asserted its status as the conferences top College Football Playoff contender.Nearly two months after coming under heavy scrutiny following an underwhelming showing in a 31-16 loss to Oklahoma in Columbus, Barrett brought his A-Game at an opportune moment, roasting Penn States defense to guide the Buckeyes back from a 15-point deficit midway through the third quarter.Barrett went 13-for-13 with three touchdowns in the fourth quarter as part of a streak of 16 consecutive completions.He finished with 318 yards and four scores on 33-of-39 passing, as well as 95 rushing yards on 17 carries.In what amounted to a firm rebuttal of the charge that Ohio State couldnt win big games with him under center, Barrett upstaged Barkley and potentially catapulted himself to the front of the Heisman Trophy chase.One controversial call seemed to cripple the Buckeyes comeback bid.Ohio State had scored on a two-yard touchdown run from Mike Weber Jr. to narrow the deficit to 11 with about five minutes remaining before the half, and a 36-yard field goal from Nuernberger early in the third quarter made it a one-score game.Penn State counterpunched a few minutes later, when junior quarterback Trace McSorley found junior wide receiver DeAndre Thompkins on a 37-yard touchdown pass.The play, which culminated with Thompkins and Ohio State defensive back Denzel Ward jostling for the ball on the end zone turf, was initially ruled an interception, but it was overturned upon review, putting the Nittany Lions up 35-20.Barrett took over from there, and the Buckeyes defense deserves credit for keeping in check a Penn State offense that rung up 8.30 yards per play against a stout Michigan D a week ago.On Saturday, the Nittany Lions managed only 4.4 YPP, compared to 6.8 for Ohio State, and Barkley totaled only 44 rushing yards on 21 carries.This game offered the Buckeyes an opportunity to avenge a 24-21 upset in State College last season.They bounced back from that loss to make the playoff, but entering Saturday it was clear that another defeat to the Nittany Lions would incinerate their chances of getting to the Final Four again.Unlike last season, when it notched a double-digit win at Oklahoma in mid-September, Ohio State dropped its only non-conference tilt of consequence, a rematch with the Sooners in Columbus.Since then, the Buckeyes had coasted against weak competition while rising up the polls.Had it fallen short on Saturday, Ohio State wouldnt have been anywhere near the top four when the selection committee put out its first set of rankings on Tuesday.Now it has a strong case for being placed in that range.Ohio State has lost only once, to a top-five opponent (Oklahoma), and it has downed its chief conference competitor.In all likelihood, a league championship is a prerequisite for the Big Tens CFP representative, and the Buckeyes now have the inside track on getting to Indianapolis out of the East.Remaining trips to Iowa and Michigan present challenges, the latter in particular, but before this weekend Football Study Hall gave Ohio State an 89% and 85% chance to win those games, respectively.Their win probabilities in intervening home bouts against Michigan State and Illinois are 87% and 99%.This will go down as one of the most valuable wins any team records this season.Ohio State fought back to knock off an offensive juggernaut powered by maybe the best player in the sport and quash any doubt about its status as a real-deal national title contender.
Notre Dame: Josh Adams, run defense boost Irish vs. NC State:::::On Saturday, as it has all year, Notre Dames 35-14 win came down to the run game.Josh Adams was Josh Adams, and the Irishs run defense stifled NC State all afternoon, eliminating any balance from the Wolfpacks offense and dominating the games second half.Nothing about any of this should come as much of a surprise.Its exactly what Notre Dame has done all year, but as the second half unfolds, its coming against better and better opponents.Adams rushing for 202 yards, as he did Saturday, is pretty par for the coursehe racked up 229 yards against Boston College in September and 191 against USC last week.And Notre Dames defense limiting NC State on the ground wasnt anything close to novel, either, considering the unit held USC to just 76 yards rushing last week and came into the game giving up 126.1 rushing yards per game.But for the Irish, this season has looked like a tale of two halves since day one.Before its bye, Notre Dames only notable opponent was Georgia, which it lost to by one point.After it stood several surefire ranked opponents: USC, Miami, Stanford with NC State joining those ranks after a strong start.Now, two games into the Irishs grueling second half, Notre Dame is 7-1, having dispatched two ranked opponents in the past two weeks thanks in large part to Adams and that physical run defense.On the day, Adams racked up more than 200 yards while barely playing in the fourth quarter.He averaged 7.5 yards per carry and scored a touchdown on a 77-yard breakaway run in the third quarter.His performance Saturday pushed him above 1,000 yards on the seasonhe now has 1,169 through eight gamesand the touchdown was his ninth of the year.Though Adams still trails Stanfords Bryce Love in most offensive categories, he mounts a more and more convincing Heisman candidacy with every game as his performance anchors Notre Dames offense.On the other side of the ball, coach Dave Doerens team entered the game averaging a perfectly respectable 177.4 yards per game on the ground.Its nothing flashy, but the Wolfpack had prided themselves on a balanced offense through their six-game winning streak heading into Saturdays game.Against the Irish, NC State eked out just 50 yards on the groundaveraging 2.1 yards per carryas its offense stalled completely in the second half and was held scoreless.At the end of the games first quarter, it was a different story.The Wolfpack were outgaining the Irish, 118 yards to 81, and Notre Dame had failed to complete a third down in three tries.But Brian Kelly and company were able to adjust, scoring four unanswered touchdowns beginning with just under 10 minutes to go in the first half.Things wont get any easier for the Irish, whose second-half break comes next week against a Wake Forest team that beat Louisville Saturday and has enough talent to play spoiler.From there its off to Miami, then a game at home against Navy and finally a trip to Stanford to close out the season.Were a long way from an 11-1 Irish teambut that outcome is becoming more and more realistic by the day.And if it does, the playoff committee will have its first independent team to contend with in Notre Dame, a team that by then will certainly have played enough talent to deserve a shot at the national title.
New Jersey high school football refs walk out after protest:::::MONROE, N.J. (AP) A father and son who were to officiate a high school football game Friday night walked off the field after members of one team knelt during the national anthem.Ernie and Anthony Lunardelli said they told officials from Colts Neck and Monroe high schools before the game they would not work if any players protested.They were replaced by two officials in training after four Monroe players took a knee on their home field.The two officials told mycentraljersey.com they respect the players right to protest, but they believe such acts are disrespectful.The pair stood on the field with their hands on their hearts while the anthem was played, then left immediately.What they are doing with this kneeling and everything, they have the right do to that, but the national anthem has nothing to do with them kneeling, said Ernie Lunardelli, who is in his 18th season of officiating scholastic football games.The flag has got nothing to do with why they are protesting.If they want to protest, let them protest, but dont disrespect our country, the flag and the Armed Forces.Ernie Lunardelli was scheduled to work the game as the head linesman, while his son was to be a line judge.The newspaper reported that Monroe High School Athletic Director Greg Beyer declined comment on the officials decision not to work the game.He said it is school district policy to permit players to protest peacefully.Officials who oversee the referees declined to speculate on what action, if any, would be taken against the Lunardellis if either school files a complaint over their refusal to work the game.
TCU football: Kenny Hill struggles in loss to Iowa State:::::This was the Kenny Hill game everyone with TCU ties was dreading.Hill, the former Texas A&M sensation that had hit the reset button in Fort Worth, had played largely mistake-free football in leading the Horned Frogs to a No.4 ranking a few days before the College Football Playoff selection committee releases its first rankings, with 15 touchdowns against just three interceptions after tossing 13 picks in 2016, his first season as the starter.In Ames, the inaccuracy and inconsistency returned, as the Horned Frogs offense was kept out of the end zone and Iowa State notched its second stunning upset of a top-five Big 12 foe this season, hanging on for a 147 win that leaves a logjam of four Big 12 teams with one conference loss atop the league standings.Hill finished 12 of 25 for just 135 yards and accounted for three giveaways and several general misfires that turned a long day for the TCU offense into a season-defining one.Each of Hills three turnovers was a uniquely cruel backbreaker: 1.On the Frogs second offensive possession of the second half (KaVontae Turpin opened the quarter with a 94-yard kick return TD for their only points of the game), Hill led the offense inside the 10, then threw a third-down pass between two receivers who werent expecting it and into the arms of defensive back Brian Peavy, who returned it 70 yards the other way.2.Then with TCU back inside the five with a chance to tie the game midway through the fourth quarter, another disaster: Hill dropped back for a play-action pass, was wrapped up by an Iowa State rusher, raised his arm with the intention of getting rid of the ball, thought better of it too late and left his throwing arm vulnerable, losing control as he went to the ground.The Cyclones recovered and bled what little clock their offense could manage.3.TCUs last-gasp drive that began with 83 seconds left lasted just two plays, as Hill had his first passed tipped away and his second picked off by Marcel Spears.Back when the Horned Frogs knocked off Oklahoma State and West Virginia in back-to-back games and established themselves as national contenders, this stretch seemed like the easy part, ahead of a visit from Texas and road trips to Oklahoma and Texas Tech in November.But in the span of a month, Iowa State turned into world-beaters under the direction of second-year head coach Matt Campbell, proving its early-October upset of Oklahoma was far from a fluke with a pair of blowout wins against Big 12 foes thought to be its middle-of-the-pack peers.The Cyclones terrorized TCUs defensive backs, particularly senior Ranthony Texada, with their pair of hulking perimeter receivers: 6' 5" Allen Lazard finished with a game-high 106 receiving yards and 6' 6" Harrison Butler caught the eventual game-winning touchdown.But at every step of the way over the seasons first half, Hill and the Horned Frogs offense had come up with enough big plays to avoid disaster.That magic ran out with a flourish on Saturday in Ames, and if Hill finds a way to rebound and steer TCU through November unscathed, a ridiculously improbable rematch with these same Cyclones in the Big 12 title game is looking more and more realistic.
Georgia beats Florida, Jim McElwain's future in doubt:::::JACKSONVILLE, Fla.There was no drama on the field, but there was plenty off it in Georgias 42-7 win against Florida.Here are three thoughts from a game that felt like the end of an era.1.People in Floridas program wore these shirts this week.The hope was that reminding the Gators of the opening line (Georgia by 14.5 points) might sufficiently enrage them and that the anger over being disrespected might inspire them to prove the number wrong.People around Floridas program have been wearing this shirt this week.The number is the opening line on the game.pic.twitter.com/PbxQ97Ak9V Andy Staples (@Andy_Staples) October 28, 2017 Halfway through the first quarter, there was no doubt about the outcome.Georgia had scored touchdowns on its first three possessions and was well on its way to covering that hefty spread.The Bulldogs averaged 22.3 yards on those three drives and put Florida in a deep hole.Then they rolled the rest of the way for their first win against the Gators since 2013.Saturday did, however, produce further doubt about coach Jim McElwains future at Florida.The day began with athletic director Scott Stricklin refuting a report that Florida had already begun negotiating a buyout of McElwains contract.That denial only applies to pregame Saturday, though.A dissolution of the union between McElwain and the Gatorsand soonremains very much on the table after a bizarre week in Gainesville.The oddity began Monday when McElwain claimed he and his family had received death threats because of Floridas recent losses.McElwain declined to follow up when asked by reporters about his claim, and then he declined to elaborate when Florida administrators asked him for more information.That led to this statement from the athletic department: The University Athletic Association takes the safety of our student-athletes, coaches, staff and families very seriously.Our administration met with Coach McElwain this afternoon and he offered no additional details.In an athletic department run by a former sports information director, that last sentence didnt get worded that way by accident.It was a message that all is not well between McElwain and Floridas administration.Suddenly, a coach who had been quite safe because of a huge buyout ($12.5 million) and two SEC East titles in his first two seasons didnt seem so safe anymore.Then came Saturday, when McElwains team left no doubt about the direction of the program.2.Georgia, meanwhile, seems headed straight toward Atlanta.The Bulldogs, who have underachieved most years in this series since Steve Spurrier took over at Florida in 1990, actually played like the vastly superior team when they were the vastly superior team.Tailback Sony Michel carried six times for 137 yards and two touchdowns, and the Bulldogs averaged 8.3 yards a carry as a team.Georgia starting quarterback Jake Fromm only attempted seven passes, completing four for 101 yards with a touchdown and an interception.Meanwhile, Georgias defense stuffed Florida on fourth-down plays in the second and third quarters and held the Gators to 3.8 yards a play for the day.The move to fire Mark Richt and replace him with Kirby Smart following the 2015 season continues to look like the best outcome for both parties.Richt is undefeated at Miami, and Smart has the Bulldogs playing in ways they havent played since the early years of the Richt era.Saturday was the kind of game that probably would have been too close in the waning years of Richts tenure.Smarts Bulldogs sensed weakness and poured on the punishment.If Tennessee beats Kentucky in a game that kicks off at 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Georgia can clinch the SEC East title by beating South Carolina next week in Athens.The last time Georgia won the SEC East was 2012.Just like that year, the Bulldogs appear to be on a collision course with Alabama.3.So what happens next at Florida?ESPNs Edward Aschoff reported Saturday that Florida officials are discussing whether they can fire McElwain for causewhich means the Gators wouldnt owe the coach a buyout.To do that, theyd have to find an action by McElwain that violates the terms of his deal and be comfortable that reasoning would hold up in court.One of the clauses of McElwains contract states that he can be fired for cause for any failure by the coach to respond accurately and fully within a reasonable time to any reasonable request and/or inquiry relating to the performance of the coachs duties relating to this agreement Conceivably, McElwains refusal to elaborate when asked by his boss about the death threat claim could constitute such a failure.But that might be dicey for Florida.Given McElwains high profile and fan anger over the Gators lack of recent success, it probably wouldnt be that difficult for McElwain or agent Jimmy Sextons team to dig up something awful someone wrote to McElwain or a family member on social media prior to this past Monday.If Florida officials dont find a valid reason, they have a few options should they choose to make a change.They can simply pay the buyout, which rose to $12.5 million when McElwain received an extension this past offseason.It drops to $10 million next year.They can offer to forgive the amount McElwain would owe ($3 million) if he broke the contract and took another job.That would require McElwain to have another job lined up, and it also would require him to be willing to walk away from a potential $12.5 million payday.The two sides could negotiate a buyout somewhere between the $0 Florida would like to pay and the $12.5 McElwains side would like to get.Florida officials leaking that they might try to fire McElwain for cause could be the opening salvo in such a negotiation.No matter what happens, it could happen quickly.After this past week, reconciliation between the Gators and McElwain seems impossible.
Jim McElwain: Florida Gators want to fire coach with cause:::::Florida administrators are trying to determine if they can fire head coach Jim McElwain without paying his $12.9 million buyout, ESPNs Edward Aschoff and Mark Schlabach report.Officials believe they may be able to fire McElwain with cause after they were unable to confirm McElwains claims made earlier this week that he and his staff have been subjected to death threats, according to the report.McElwain admitted on Wednesday that threats he referred to were made in the past and that he was wrong to mention it.Its just something that came up and obviously was on my mind, the coach said.It doesnt make it right.It doesnt make it right to air that laundry.ESPN reports that Florida administrators believe McElwains dishonesty has given the school enough cause to fire McElwain without having to pay his buyout.Matt Baker of the Tampa Bay Times reports, however, that Florida does not believe it can fire McElwain with cause.McElwains Gators were blown out by Georgia on Saturday to drop to 34 on the season.
Penn State touchdown: Interception call overturned (video):::::For the second time on Saturday, Ohio State was denied a key interception by questionable officiating.In the third quarter, Denzel Ward appeared to intercept Trace McSorely on a pass in the end zonea play that would have given the Buckeyes possession of the ball and kept them within one score.The play was called an interception on the field but the officials called for a replay review.Ward and Penn States DeAndre Thompkins corralled the ball nearly simultaneously and it was ruled a touchdown on review.TD or INT?You make the call.pic.twitter.com/YfOe1RikCw FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) October 28, 2017 Earlier in the game, Ohio State appeared to have another interception in the end zone but the play was wiped out by a phantom pass interference call.The penalty set up the Nittany Lions at the one-yard line and the scored a touchdown to go ahead 2810.
Delaware football's Nasir Adderley makes catch (video):::::There is a tendency these days to liken every one-handed catch to something Odell Beckham would do, but what Delaware defensive back Nasir Adderley did on Saturday really is straight out Beckhams playbook.In the second quarter of the Blue Hens game against Towson, Adderley picked off Ryan Stover with a jaw-dropping grab.The teams Twitter account naturally compared it to Beckham, but the resemblance is even closer than you could have expected.Look at how Adderley secured the ball.Fox College Sports Now check out this still from Beckhams legendary catch against the Cowboys.NFL Right hand extended all the way behind the head.Ball resting in the fingertips.Body off balance and falling to the ground.Its like looking in a mirror.
What is Brandon Ingram's Ceiling?:::::In the latest open floor podcast, Andrew Sharp and Ben Golliver took a look at Brandon Ingram's ceiling and his growing mean streak.Can Ingram evolve into an all-star?(The following transcript has been edited for clarity.)Andrew Sharp: How could you not watch Brandon Ingram against the Wizards and not see him becoming a star at some point?Ben Golliver: Well I'm not sure if I would put it like that from one game where he is finally hitting his mid-range jumpers and shooting confidently.But it did seem like his confidence was there in a way against Washington that it hasn't been consistently during his career.He was really pulling up and really going for it.Going for that lefty pull-up he likes from the mid-range.I think it says something about Washington honestly.The Lakers were not afraid of the Wizards.I really hate to break it to you.There was no fear factor.Didn't matter if John Wall was on him or Otto Porter, he was going for the throat.Sharp: I have been a big believer in Ingram for the last few years and it's not even about him making his shots against the Wizards.I felt this watching him even against the Clippers which was a rough night for him.But I think just watching him move, he got so much length that it's hard to imagine a version of his career where he doesn't sort of grow into a problem for teams.He's not going to be Giannis and I'm not trying to put him in that category.So far this season our podcast has decided that Giannis is going to be the greatest player of all-time (laughs).Golliver: He is our future overlord.Sharp: I'm not saying Ingram is going to be that level of superstar but like he does some things and has that tools that will make life difficult for any team trying to deal with him.Watching him now reminds me a lot of early Giannis except that he's saddled with all these expectations.If you go back to the second year of Giannis's career, every time he did something impressive it was treated as a nice little bonus.Everyone in Milwaukee was like 'hey the future is bright we don't know what we have here but it is something.'Where as with Ingram after the Washington game Luke Walton came out and compared him to Kobe and there were Lakers writers reporting that he will be the closer now.There is also the secondary story with the Lakers and Ingram and how he better do this every night or we're trading him to clear space for LeBron's supporting cast.It just an insane situation to be in but just talent wise he's got a lot working in his favor and he is still really young.Golliver: I understand why he bothers people because there is a fine line between like smooth and just passive.He is walking back and forth between that line a lot.There are times where he will go invisible.Sharp: That is a good point.That ultimately will probably set him apart from Giannis.Where Giannis in a year two or three you can see that he had a real mean streak to him and will go for the kill sometimes and that is the one thing you can't project with Ingram.Golliver: I don't necessarily like this comparison to Giannis, I think the one people have made with KD is a little similar vain because KD is not going to be that lead ball-handler for your offense like Giannis is just as Ingram isn't either so there is always going be a certain reliance upon others to get him involved and to keep him involved and to me, I am not sure Ingram has KD ceiling.I'm sure he doesn't.I should put it that way.He is the passiveness that people sort of read on to him, it is just in part of his personality.He is quiet and very soft-spoken.I interviewed him in Las Vegas this summer and it was hard to hear what he was saying sometimes.I think the silent ones are the ones you need to worry about right?The silent killers.And I think he has some of that in him and wants the ball late.He's still working on it but the people who are trying to write these guys off this early is silly.They are going to be the ones that delete their tweets in two years.Sharp: I am not going to sell any Brandon Ingram stock that is all I will say.Golliver: I think that draft was pretty solid at the top between the one and two pick.I still think Simmons has a higher ceiling as an overall one man offense, I think he is going to be better player still than Ingram but I always thought Ingram was going to be really good.Sharp: I don't think Ingram is a guy that you can build your team around.He's not going to be a franchise guy but I think he is an all-star that can fit with any team in the NBA.I think that is where he will be in year five or six and that is still pretty early.To hear more from Andrew Sharp and Ben Golliver, subscribe to the Open Floor podcast on iTunes.
Athletic Bilbao 0-2 Barcelona: Blaugrana Extend Lead at Top of La Liga Thanks to Outstanding Messi:::::An unstoppable Messi and summer signing Paulinho dictated the rules at San Mames stadium and sent Barcelona three points ahead of Atletico and Real Madrid, with a confident 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao.Barcelona continued their impressive unbeaten run - which now stretches to ten games - and left La Catedral once more with all the points thanks to their incredible leader, Messi, who transformed a neat cross from Jordi Alba into Barcelona's ticket to the victory, during the first half.In the closing moments, Paulinho doubled the scoreline and confirmed the result after profiting from a poor parry by Bilbao keeper Kepa.Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/GettyImages Athletic suffered their fifth defeat of the campaign but fought well to counteract the league leaders, with the likes of Aduriz and William pushing forward through the flanks and often threatening ter Stegen's goal.Barcelona dictated the pace from the first half and saw their first opportunity of the game come from Messi, who, left alone in the box, picked up a rebounded ball and shot a beautiful half-volley which, however, was too central.Despite Barcelonas ball possession, Athletic refused to back down, often tried to run through the flanks and had several chances.First, William reached the byline and crossed into the box, finding Adurizs head, but the shot lacked power and ten Stegen saved comfortably.ANDER GILLENEA/GettyImages A few seconds later, the away team sleepily let Boveda fool the defence and scuff the ball, only to see it cleared by Sergio Busquets.Aduriz subsequently picked up the ball, passed the centre backs and found himself face to face with ter Stegen, but again failed to find the net.Twenty minutes in, and Barcelona went very close to scoring again, as Messi, who was left wandering alone inside Bilbaos box, eased past Kepa but missed an incredible opportunity to score, as his shot hit the post.That Bara move deserved a goal... Messi has hit the woodwork 10 times now this season and still scored 15 goals, too.Samuel Marsden (@samuelmarsden) October 28, 2017 Messi's inevitable goal arrived nine minutes before the breaks.The Argentine number 10 profited from a moment of confusion in Athletic Bilbao's defence to pick up a stunning cross from Jordi Alba, and magnificently curled the ball low into the bottom right side of the goal.It took the away side only two minutes to pose just another threat to Bilbao, as Paulinho, who was on the edge of the box, thumped the ball on the bar.The Basque side poorly tried to equalise before the break, but Barcelona were good enough to hold them back.Athletic returned from the changing rooms with a renewed thirst for goals and once again the woodwork was tested, this time by the home team, as Raul Garcia's header passed over ter Stegen but slammed the crossbar.Half an hour before the final whistle, the Blaugrana nearly doubled their advantage thanks to the wonders of Ivan Rakitic, whose magnificent shot from distance forced a brilliant save from Kepa.Bilbao desperately attempted to give their fans something to cheer and besieged Barcelona's box, with 15 minutes left.And we're done.Second half was mostly a garbage fire with Sam and Marc as firefighters and a goal at the end just to stick the knife into Athletic's heart.Diana Kristinne (@DianaKristinne) October 28, 2017 Garcia wasted a good chance when he picked up the ball and had enough time to prepare a shot, which ended up drifting wide.Atheltic proved to be too tired to put up a fight until the end.During the first minute of added time, a beautiful one-two between lethal duo Suarez and Messi saw the former's shot deflected by Kepa.However, it was picked by Paulinho, who was in the right place at the right time and gently curled it home for Barca's second.Ernesto Valverde's first return to Bilbao, as Barcelona manager ended in victory thanks to difference makers like Lionel Messi, who he could barely even dream of during his time in the Basque country.

Eden Hazard Keeps Champions Chelsea In Title Hunt:::::Eden Hazard quietened the debate surrounding Antonio Conte's future with the second-half goal that secured a 1-0 win at Bournemouth on Saturday and maintained champions Chelsea's hold on fourth spot, nine points adrift of Premier League leaders Manchester City.Chelsea manager Conte had reacted angrily to suggestions in the build-up to this game that fellow Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti was being lined up as his successor amid talk of dissent among the London club's squad.Those concerns were stilled as Chelsea showed enough resolve to overcome a determined Bournemouth side whose display suggested they are capable of moving out of the bottom three, with Hazard's 51st-minute goal proving the difference between the two sides.Conte's outburst came after a positive week for Chelsea that began with an impressive comeback to beat Watford and continued with the midweek League Cup defeat of another Premier League side in Everton.Had Chelsea failed to recover after falling behind to Marco Silva's Watford, their prospects of retaining the title would have receded even further.That only increased the pressure on Chelsea against a Bournemouth side also boasting back-to-back victories in league and cup.Victory at Stoke City was only the Cherries' second league win of the season while they set up a League Cup quarter-final with Chelsea after beating second-tier Middlesbrough.Conte's selection against south coast side Bournemouth suggested he had one eye on Tuesday's Champions League tie away to Roma, with captain Gary Cahill on the substitutes' bench.Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe, meanwhile, was able to recall Jermain Defoe after the striker had been forced to sit out the last two games with a hamstring problem.It was the home side who carved out the first clear opportunity in the 17th minute only for Benik Afobe to take the wrong option before eventually seeing a shot deflected wide when a second chance came his way.That proved a rare chance for Bournemouth, who found themselves forced to defend against a growing wave of Chelsea pressure.They didn't help themselves when goalkeeper Asmir Begovic scuffed a clearance straight to Hazard.The Belgian set up Alvaro Morata 12 yards from goal but the Spain international pulled his shot wide.Tiemoue Bakayoko then directed a free header straight at Begovic shortly before Morata thought he had made up for his earlier miss when he followed up David Luiz's shot only to have the effort ruled out because Cesar Azpilicueta had strayed offside.Hazard made the breakthrough in the sixth minute after the break.Morata did well to fend off two challenges in the middle of the pitch before chipping a pass towards Hazard that Simon Francis should have cut out.The Bournemouth defender failed to reach the ball, handing Hazard a clear run on goal that was capped by an angled finish that exposed Begovic's failure to cover his near post.
FIFA U-17 World Cup In India Becomes Most Attended In Event's History:::::The 17th edition of the FIFA U-17 World in India on Saturday turned out to be a milestone event as it became the most attended and the highest scoring tournament ever.Not only that, this U-17 World Cup even shattered the most attendance record of FIFA U-20 World Cup -- 2011 Colombia edition's 1,309,929 mark.It thus became the most attended men's age-group World Cup ever.With 66684 spectators turning up to watch the summit clash between England and Spain at the Salt Lake Stadium here, the total attendance at the six host venues across the country logged 1347143, which is 116,167 more than the earlier record attendance of 1,230,976 set in the first edition of the tournament in China in 1985.The total number of spectators in this FIFA U-17 World Cup is also 37,214 more than the record of highest attendance in an U-20 World Cup -- that of 1,309,929 in Colombia in 2011.In fact, the most attendance record was already reached during the third place play-off match between Brazil and Mali earlier in the day, which had attracted 56432 spectators.The attendance for matches of the FIFA U-17 World Cup India 2017 had breached the million mark in the last Round of 16 match on October 18.In terms of the number of spectators per match, this India edition is second -- at 25,906 -- behind the inaugural edition in China (which was 38,469) as the number of participating teams and number of matches were lesser at that time.Sixteen teams competed till the 2005 edition in Peru (when the tournament was known as FIFA U-17 World Championships) before the number of participating countries was increased to 24 from the 2007 edition in South Korea.The number of matches was also increased from 32 to 52 from 2007 onwards.Understandably, Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium has the highest attendance per match.The venue has so far logged a total of 608809 spectators from 11 games, at a staggering average of 55346 per match.The stadium has a total capacity of 66.600.This India edition also became the highest scoring tournament with 177 goals from 52 matches, bettering the earlier highest of 172 scored during the 2013 edition in the United Arab Emirates.This edition also has the highest goal average of 3.40 per match since the tournament format was changed in 2007 to a 24-team affair from the earlier 16-team participation.Overall, the number of goals scored per match is the third in tournament history behind the 1997 Egypt and 2003 Finland editions, when 117 goals were scored from 32 matches at an average of 3.66 goals per match.
Premier League: Manchester City Maintain Lead, Arsenal Rally To Beat Swansea:::::Sergio Aguero was left waiting to become Manchester City's outright all-time leading goal-scorer as his side remained five points clear at the top of the Premier League table on Saturday.Aguero was named on the bench as City saw off West Bromwich Albion 3-2, having failed to surpass the club record of 177 goals he shares with Eric Brook during a midweek League Cup penalty shoot-out win over Championship side Wolves.There were three goals in a frantic five-minute spell at The Hawthorns on Saturday.Leroy Sane produced a stunning strike to give City a 10th-minute lead only for West Brom's Jay Rodriguez to equalise soon afterwards.But come the 15th minute, City were 2-1 up after Fernandinho let fly with a speculative shot that deflected off Gareth Barry and went in off the post.City substitute Raheem Sterling gave the visitors a two-goal lead with a close-range finish in the 64th minute only for the Baggies' to pull a goal back late on through Matt Phillips after a defensive blunder.Second-placed Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur started the day level on points but Jose Mourinho's men edged ahead after substitute Anthony Martial's goal nine minutes from time gave them a 1-0 win over a Spurs side missing injured England striker Harry Kane.'Last ball of their careers' "Today, every ball looked like the last ball of their careers," said United manager Mourinho, who slammed his players' attitude following a shock 2-1 loss to Huddersfield last week.This was Spurs' second defeat of the week after their League Cup loss to London rivals West Ham."It was unlucky that in the last 10 minutes we conceded our goal," said Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino."It was our mistake," he added after his defence failed to deal with a long clearance from United goalkeeper David De Gea that Romelu Lukaku headed on to Martial.Tottenham's north London rivals Arsenal had to come from behind to see off struggling Swansea 2-1.The Gunners fell behind when Sam Clucas put the visitors 1-0 up in the 22nd minute.But Arsene Wenger's men were back on level terms early in the second half at the Emirates when Sead Kolasinac rifled a shot past former Arsenal goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski from 15 yards out.Kolasinac then turned provider for Aaron Ramsey as the Wales midfielder made it 2-1 in the 58th minute."Our pace wasn't sharp enough in the first half, we and we had to up the tempo," said Wenger after his 800th Premier League game in charge of the Gunners.Liverpool, fresh from an embarrassing 4-1 loss to Tottenham, beat Huddersfield 3-0 despite Mohamed Salah missing a first-half penalty in a match that pitted Reds manager Jurgen Klopp against Terriers boss David Wagner -- the best man at his wedding.'Nice day' for Liverpool Daniel Sturridge broke the deadlock five minutes into the second half before Roberto Firmino doubled Liverpool's lead in the 58th minute with a header.Georginio Wijnaldum then added a third late on."The first half was a little bit stiff, that was clear," said Klopp."We were more direct (in the second half) and now it is a nice day!"Wilfried Zaha's goal in the seventh minute of stoppage time saw basement club Crystal Palace come from 2-0 down to salvage a 2-2 draw with West Ham at Selhurst Park.Javier Hernandez and Andre Ayew, with a 25-yard shot that went in off the crossbar, put the Hammers 2-0 up before Palace pulled a goal back through a penalty from Luka Milivojevic."It feels like a defeat," said under-pressure Hammers boss Slaven Bilic, but Roy Hodgson reckoned a draw was the least his Palace side deserved from a game "where you only faced two shots and you've had 20-odd, and hit the post and had one cleared off the line".Former Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher's 16th-minute goal gave Stoke City a much-needed 1-0 win at Watford.South coast duo Brighton and Southampton meet on Sunday when Leicester play Everton in former Saints boss Claude Puel's first game in charge of the Foxes.Burnley welcome Newcastle to Turf Moor on Monday.
Pardeep Narwal Shines As Patna Pirates Make It A Hat-Trick Of Pro Kabaddi League Titles:::::Patna Pirates romped to their third straight triumph in the Pro Kabbadi League, outclassing debutants Gujarat Fortunegiants 55-38 in the final of the 2017 edition at the Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium in Chennai on Saturday.After a close first-half, Pardeep Narwal's Patna Pirates stepped up the pace and cruised to victory.Narwal was the star for the Patna team, as has been the case right through the tournament.He topped with 19 raid points and capped a memorable PKL-Season 5 by guiding the team to a hat-trick of titles.The Pirates, who have been the best raiding team in the tournament, kept up the pressure on the Fortunegiants, with some superb work, to win 32 raid points.Monu Goyat began the night with a stellar raid to pick up the first points for Patna.Fortunegiants bounced back almost immediately and kept pace with the Pirates and trailed 18-21 at the end of the first half.The second half was in contrast to the first as the formidable Pirates riding on Narwal's brilliance broke down the resolute Gujarat defence and pulled away, inflicting an all out in the 23rd minute to lead 27-21.Fortunegiants scored three successive points in the next three minutes as they trailed 25-29.Vijay scored with a crucial do-or-die raid in the 30th minute as Patna Pirates led 30-26 and got Narwal back on the mat.Narwal came up with a super raid as Patna inflicted another all out in the 32nd minute to lead 38-26.He attained a super 10 while Jaideep got a high five as Patna Pirates led 39-28.Gujarat Fortunegiants came back strongly as they scored five points in two raids to trail 33-39.Narwal came up with another super raid in the 36th minute as Patna Pirates led 43-34.The Pirates forced a super tackle in the same minute to extend their lead to 45-34.Sachin was the top scorer for the Gujarat team with 11 points but Narwal's brilliance carried the day for Patna Pirates.Monu Goyat scored nine points whereas Jaideep chipped in with five tackle points.It was a disappointing night for Gujarat as their famed defence failed miserably on a night when it mattered the most.Gujarat managed just five tackle points and couldn't contain Narwal and Goyat.Narwal ended the season as highest raid point scorer with 369 and fittingly lifted the trophy besides taking the 'Most Valuable Player' award.
FIFA U-17 World Cup 2017: England Crowned Champions After Stunning Comeback Vs Spain:::::England made a remarkable comeback from two goals down to outclass three-time runners-up Spain 5-2 and clinch their maiden FIFA U-17 World Cup at a packed Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Saturday.England have now done a FIFA double in the same year, having won the FIFA U-20 World Cup in June.Spain took the early advantage in the final, thanks to a first-half brace by Sergio Gomez.The Spaniard found the net in 10th and 31st minute of the game.But his effort was wiped out soon and England piled on the misery by scoring five back-to-back goals against Spain to clinch their maiden title.England scored five goals through Rhian Brewster (44th), Morgan Gibbs White (58th), Phil Foden (69th, 88th) and Marc Guehi (84th).England missed a couple of chances in the first half, but Rhian Brewster's 44th minute goal helped his team make it 1-2 against Spain at a jam-packed Salt Lake stadium.Both teams went into the half-time with score reading 2-1 in favour of Spain.Things changed dramatically in the second half as England got on the offensive and put the Spanish back-line under tremendous pressure.Gibbs tapped home an inch-perfect cross to make it 2-2.Foden then found the target in the 69th minute and the winners literally sealed the issue in the 84th minute with the fourth goal scored by Marc Guehi.The Young Lions rubbed salt on Spain's wound by scoring a 88th minute goal to make it 5-2.It was a sweet revenge as England had lost to La Rojas juniors in the U-17 European Championship, earlier this year.Earlier Brazil beat Mali 2-0 in the third-place playoff to earn a consolation after they lost to England in the semi-final.Alan scored in the 55th minute when Mali goalkeeper Youssouf Koita fumbled the Palmeiras striker's shot which went past him into the net.Substitute Yuri Alberto scored the second in the 88th minute.With the Mali defence tiring, Brenner crossed from the right and Yuri was unmarked to fire in from close range.(With PTI Inputs)

5 Wickets In 5 Balls! Australian Cricketer Claims Incredible Triple Hat-Trick:::::Australian cricketers, playing in the local leagues, seem to be making a habit of achieving some remarkable feats.Only recently, Josh Dunstan, playing for West Augusta B Grade in South Australia, smashed 307 in a 35-overs-a-side match where he plundered 40 sixes in his whirlwind knock.His triple-century made up more than 86 per cent of West Augusta's 354 for nine.And now, a Victorian third-grade cricketer has achieved another astonishing feat -- this time with the ball in hand.Nick Gooden, playing for Yallourn North in the Central Gippsland cricket competition, managed to incredibly take a triple hat-trick, which basically means five wickets in five balls.And all this carnage because Gooden and his teammates wanted things to get over quickly to "get on the frothies".Not just that, Gooden ended up taking a total of eight wickets from just 10 deliveries."Theres nothing special about it theres definitely no pace involved," Gooden was quoted as saying by Weekend Sunrise."The general plan when we got out there was just to get off as quick as we could so we could get on the frothies," he said."I said to the boys lets just roll through these guys and get off and have a beer.I think we were having a beer at about three oclock."The feat was even more incredible considering that Gooden claims to be a "right-arm medium plop", and the fact that he was playing his first match since December last year.Gooden admitted that normally his bowling is nothing too special."I just roll the arm over, I'm not fast or anything like that.I really wasn't bowling very well," said Gooden."I started with two wides ... one was a big off-side wide and the other was a big leg-side wide and everyone was laughing at me.""But for some reason I just couldn't miss, and I hadn't trained or anything so it was out of control."
India vs New Zealand: More Excitement Than Pressure Ahead Of Series Decider, Says Tim Southee:::::With the three-match One-day International (ODI) series tied at 1-1, the visitors are more excited than tense at the prospect of winning their maiden ODI series in India at Kanpur, said pacer Tim Southee.The visitors came close to winning the series last year before going down 2-3 and now they have another shot at going past the formidable Virat Kohli-led side in their own backyard.Southee further added that there was an air of excitement at the training and the team is freshened up after an off day.But the pacer maintained that the series is on the line."No pressure, it's more excitement I would say.There was an air of excitement around the guys today at training.Obviously, we feel freshened up after the day off yesterday.The series is on the line tomorrow," Southee said."That's what we play for and like I said, good sides have come here and walked away empty handed.I guess it'll be nice to seal the series here.But India is a tough team in their own conditions as they have shown that over a while," he added.India have won their last six ODI series in a row after losing at home in October 2015, when they went down 2-3 to South Africa.The cooler weather means conditions at Kanpur are different to what teams faced in Mumbai and Pune, and Southee said his team would have to adapt quickly to have any chance of winning tomorrow."The beauty of a series is as it goes on it's the same for both teams.You get more information about the opposition batters and there's information going out there as well."Obviously it's a different ground and it offers different challenges, so if we can adapt to that quickly and see what is working then we'll go a long way in a good bowling performance," he said.The pacer himself is looking forward to bowling in the pleasant weather."Training today was nice; it wasn't too hot.We know that coming to India, the heat is always a challenge.What we experienced in Mumbai was something, some of the players never experienced before...the humidity and the amount of fluids lost.Pune was relatively nice.It is different again here."Asked if the current side is among the most prepared to tour India, Southee said, "We were involved in a lot of preparations coming into the series.Various guys were participating in different competitions around the world, be it in the Caribbean or in England or some of the guys on the A tour here.""Some of the guys had breaks too.We came together in Mumbai where we had two good warm-up games before that first one-dayer.India bounced back nicely.Now with the series on the line, as I said, a lot of good sides have come here and haven't been able to move India over, so it'll be very satisfying if we could do that tomorrow."(With PTI inputs)
India vs New Zealand: Twitter's Hilarious Reply To Ross Taylor's Question For Virender Sehwag:::::Kane Williamson-led side is currently touring India for a three-match One-Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20Is) series.Apart from the on-field rivalry, cricketers from both teams seem to be enjoying each other's company.After Ross Taylor and Tom Latham stitched together a massive 200-run partnership to get their team over the line in the first ODI, former India opener Virender Sehwag took to Twitter to appreciate Taylor's knock of 95 off 100 balls.He had tweeted, "Well played @RossLTaylor Darji ji.Great effort after handling the pressure of Diwali orders".Following which, cricketing fans were treated to some great banter between the New Zealander and Sehwag -- that also in Hindi.Ahead of the third and final ODI at Kanpur, the stylish right-handed batsman took some time off to go bowling and then posted a photo on Instagram of his name being misspelt on the scoreboard."Tenpin bowling #Kanpur styles.Started with Taylor, then I was 'Darji' which in Hindi means 'Tailor'... now I am Taler ????wonder how else my name can be spelt ??.Any ideas?#Taylor #Darji #Taler #India @virendersehwag," wrote Taylor.No sooner was this post uploaded on Twitter, Twitteratis flooded the comments section with hilarious suggestions for his name.Hahahahha YES YOUR REAL NAME IN HINDI GULABKUMAR DARJI Dhaval Dabhi (@djdabhi) October 27, 2017 We can also call you "Rose" instead of "Ross" Lakshay Soni (@Lakshay_Soni3) October 27, 2017 Slowly you will become Taller Ankit Singh (@imankitttt) October 27, 2017 Hahahahaha @virendersehwag aapka asar agya sir @RossLTaylor darji ji ko kya tweet kra hai #ViruPanti Parth (@parth8474) October 27, 2017 The Virat Kohli-led side will be aiming to win the final match in order to keep their winning momentum intact.However, it certainly won't be easy against a strong New Zealand outfit.Sunil Gavaskar, in an exclusive chat with NDTV, had said that New Zealand have been presenting different challenges to the Indian side as compared to the other teams in recent times.The final ODI will be played in Green Park Stadium, Kanpur.
Women's Asia Cup: India Thump Singapore 10-0 To Start Their Campaign:::::Indian eves got off to a roaring start at the Women's Asia Cup 2017 with a dominating 10-0 victory over Singapore on Saturday.Navneet Kaur (3rd & 41st minutes), Rani (15th & 18th) and Navjot Kaur (30th & 50th) netted the ball twice, while Lalremsiami (18th), Deep Grace Ekka (25th), Gurjit Kaur (41st) and Sonika (45th) scored once each to ensure India notched up winning points in their opening match of Pool A. India began with positive intent by attacking Singapore's circle constantly, looking for an opportunity to score.The effort worked as the team won back-to-back penalty corners in the first quarter.Though the first PC was saved by Singapore goalkeeper Felissa Lai, it hardly dented India's spirit as they were precise in their counter.It was Navneet and Rani's goals in the 3rd and 15th minute that gave India a 2-0 lead in the first quarter itself.India continued their fine run in the second quarter as well, adding four more goals, to go into the 10-minute half-time break with an imposing 6-0 lead.After Grace scored off a PC in the 25th minute, dragflicker Gurjit was fierce in her strike to score India's seventh goal through another PC in the 41st minute.India stayed resolute as they continued to put pressure on Singapore's defense, pumping two more goals in the third quarter through Navneet and Sonika.The final 15 minutes saw India win back-to-back PCs but Singapore defense averted conceding goals.However, a quick-thinking Navjot scored a field goal in the 50th minute to earn her team a 10-0 lead.India's defense, meanwhile, put up a strong display throughout the match.Earlier in the day, China beat Malaysia 5-4 in a closely fought encounter.
India vs New Zealand: I Have Improved My Pace Without Losing Out On Swing, Says Bhuvneshwar Kumar:::::In-form India pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar on Saturday said that not losing the ability to swing the ball despite adding extra pace to his bowling has helped him improve as a bowler.Bhuvneshwar along with Jasprit Bumrah is doing wonders for the Indian side with the new ball in the limited overs cricket for India.Captain Virat Kohli had praised the bowler after the second ODI and had said that he has come of age.However, in recent years, Bhuvneshwar had lost his natural ability to swing with extra pace but the bowler expressed happiness on finding his mojo back."As a player, I feel I have grown in the past couple of years.I have improved my pace without losing on the swing.That is something I am really happy about.In batting also I have improved a bit," he said.Bhuvneshwar further added that India's bowling coach Bharat Arun helped him get his swing back."So he shared some fine points that helped me get my swing back.His role in the team is invaluable," said Bhuvneshwar.Talking about the three-ODI series, which is currently tied 1-1, Bhuvneshwar said the match will be another high-pressure encounter."We have not been challenged like this in a while and it is a short series.So there was pressure in the last game that we could lose the series (having lost the first match).But the way we came back shows the character of the team.Tomorrow's match is also about handling pressure.We will try to play like we played the last game," Bhuvneshwar added.Asked about the approach in a three-match series compared to a longer one, Bhuvneshwar said, "It is a short series but mental approach is the same as any other series.But as I said, we have not been challenged in a while at home, so everyone is looking forward to the challenge."Bhuvneshwar further remarked that playing against familiar foes like New Zealand can work both ways.Most of the top Kiwi players feature in the IPL including captain Kane Williamson and Trent Boult, who have been Bhuvneshwar's teammates at Sunrisers Hyderabad."Last series I played against New Zealand the planning was easy, it is the same for them also.Knowing them well and vice versa makes planning tougher.So it is a positive as well as a negative," he insisted.(With PTI Inputs)
This Day, That Year: Sachin Tendulkar Became First Indian To Score A Century and Take 4 Wickets In ODIs:::::It was on this day (October 28, 1998), 19 years ago that a young Sachin Tendulkar almost single-handedly took India to the semi-finals of the Wills International Cup in Dhaka against Australia.After being put into bat, India found themselves in a spot of bother, losing Sourav Ganguly and skipper Mohammad Azharuddin in quick succession.It was then that Tendulkar took matters in his own hands and scored a brilliant 141 off 128 balls to take India to a challenging total of 307 for 8.On his way to a century, Tendulkar hit 13 fours and 3 sixes and took the Australian attack to the cleaners.Rahul Dravid (48) and Ajay Jadeja (71) gave him good support as the Aussies ran out of ideas to dismiss the little master.Chasing a huge target, Australia got off to a great start and were in the match till the time Tendulkar came to the attack.Known to be the 'man with the golden arm' in those days, Tendulkar had an uncanny knack of picking up wickets at crucial stages of the match.Tendulkar first struck with the ball by removing Michael Bevan and followed it up by dismissing the Australian skipper Steven Waugh.Damien Martyn and Brad Young were the other two Aussies to fall prey to Tendulkar's bowling as India won the match by 44 runs.Although India made it to the semis, they lost out on a spot in the final by losing to West Indies.South Africa went on to win the tournament.The Wills International Cup was the first tournament apart from the World Cups to involve all test playing nations.The tournament was later renamed as the ICC Champions Trophy.

India vs New Zealand, 3rd ODI: Hosts Aim To Ride Momentum In Series Decider:::::India would look to seal the series against New Zealand in Kanpur India would look to seal the series against New Zealand in Kanpur AFP India would aim to play with the same grit and gumption they displayed in the second match in Pune when they square off against New Zealand in the ODI series-decider on Sunday.Faced with tremendous pressure after a long time following their loss in the first ODI of the three-match series, the Indian players showed a lot of character as they put up a near flawless performance in the second game to level the series 1-1.Captain Virat Kohli and his team thrive on challenges and they will back themselves to win their seventh ODI series in a row, when they take the field at the Green Park Stadium, which will be hosting its first ever 50-over game under lights."We look forward to challenges.We spoke about bouncing back, and we have bounced back here (in Pune).We would look to play a similar sort of game in Kanpur as well," said Kohli after the six-wicket win over the Kiwis in the second ODI.Both teams arrived here on Thursday, giving themselves enough time to get used to the cooler conditions in the northern part of India.The Indian team executed its plans perfectly in Pune, especially on the bowling front with in-form pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah doing the job early on as well as in the death overs.The spinners bounced back well after an off-day in Mumbai.Yuzvendra Chahal, who failed to pick up a wicket in the first game, struck twice while Axar Patel, replacing chinaman Kuldeep Yadav, found the stumps of the in-form Tom Latham.Part-timer Kedar Jadhav bowled eight overs, conceding just 31 runs.Kohli may not want to tinker with a winning combination, therefore, it remains to be seen whether Yadav gets a chance to play in front of his home crowd on Sunday.On the batting front, a big positive for India in Pune was Dinesh Karthik delivering at No.4 with an unbeaten 64.The team management has tried as many as 11 players at the number four spot since the 2015 World Cup and Karthik certainly did enough to stake his claim in that position going forward.He had batted at number five in the series opener but he himself said that four is his preferred spot.Shikhar Dhawan getting a fifty plus score after six innings was also good news for India.The stylish southpaw struck the ball beautifully and would be hoping to give his team another good start in the must-win game on Sunday.However, his opening partner Rohit Sharma is due for a big score after making 7 and 20 in the earlier games.Just like the home team, the Black Caps would look to get back to winning ways as they remain within touching distance of winning a rare series in India.For starters, they would have to put up a much better batting effort than what they managed in the previous game.Ross Taylor and Latham had bailed them out in Mumbai with a match-winning 200-run stand after New Zealand had lost their top three for 80 runs.The top three did not do much either in Pune but with Taylor and Latham also not firing on that occasion, they ended up with a below par 230.There can't be a better time for captain Kane Willamson to lead from the front after a couple of failures.With the batting letting the team down, the potent bowling line-up comprising Trent Boult and Tim Southee did not have enough runs to defend.Three hundred has not been crossed in the series so far but that could well be the case here on Sunday.South Africa had posted 303 in the last ODI, played at Green Park two years ago and India fell short by five runs.India also lost the T20 International played against England here in January this year.Squads: India: Virat Kohli (captain), Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, Dinesh Karthik, MS Dhoni (wk), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Shardul Thakur.New Zealand: Kane Williamson (captain), Trent Boult, Colin de Grandhomme, Martin Guptill, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Henry Nicholls, Adam Milne, Colin Munro, Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor, George Worker and Ish Sodhi.Match Start: I:30 pm IST.
Tiger Woods Pleads Guilty To Reckless Driving:::::Tiger Woods pleaded guilty in a Florida court on Friday to reckless driving, the state attorney said, after police found the golf champion asleep in his Mercedes-Benz beside the road last May.Under the plea agreement reached in Palm Beach County, north of Miami, Woods will not serve jail time unless he commits major violations of his probation.The deal requires Woods, winner of 14 major golf championships, to spend one year on probation, pay a $250 fine, perform 50 hours' community service, and complete "DUI (driving under the influence) school", among other conditions, Dave Aronberg, the state attorney for Palm Beach County, told AFP."He was calm" while entering the plea, Aronberg said.Woods, 41, had five drugs in his system, including the opioid painkiller hydrocodone, when he was arrested on May 29 in Jupiter, Florida, according to a toxicology report police released at the time.They arrested him on suspicion of driving under the influence.The toxicology report also showed the presence of the powerful painkiller hydromorphone; anxiety drug alprazolam (also known as Xanax); sleep drug zolpidem (also known as Ambien) and THC, a chemical component of marijuana.Woods told officers he was taking Vicodin and Xanax to deal with pain from back surgery, which he underwent in April for the fourth time.According to Aronberg the golfer must "subject himself to random drug and alcohol testing through the year" and enter into a program requiring counseling.He must also refrain from using or possessing alcohol or drugs unless they are prescribed by a doctor.Woods last played competitively in the Dubai Desert Classic in January but withdrew with back spasms.ESPN reported in mid-October that doctors have cleared him to resume full golf activities, though his rehab post-surgery is ongoing.
After Steve Smith's Brain-Fade Moment, Fawad Ahmed Joins The Act:::::Fawad was seen hitting his helmet with the bat for being so silly this time.Fawad was seen hitting his helmet with the bat for being so silly this time.(Photo: Twitter/CricketAus) Australia cricketer Fawad Ahmed has been making the news off late for reasons which just about can be related to cricket.He made the headlines in March, when he forgot to get his bat while walking out to bat in a Sheffield Shield match between Victoria and Western Australian.While he seems to have learned from that mistake, he has conjured up new ones instead.This time Fawad did bring his bat, only to figure out mid-way that he was carrying the wrong set of gloves.Maybe he just doesn't want to bat.In a video posted by cricket.com.au on Twitter, Fawad is seen walking out to bat in a match between Victoria and Queensland and then all of sudden turns back only to signal to his teammates that he has got the wrong set of gloves.The video has been doing the rounds in social media as cricket.com.au captioned it, "Well, at least Fawad Ahmed is improving!??Another classic reaction...#SheffieldShield #QLDvVIC."The last time it happened, Fawad shared a laugh with the Western Australia players, having seen the funny side of it but this time, he was seen hitting his helmet with the bat for being so silly and it is only a matter of time before the 35-year-old becomes an internet meme for his forgetfulness.After all this, Fawad could make little impact with the bat as he was dismissed for 1 run from 4 balls to Mitchell Swepson.His batting might not be one of the talking points but he made up with the ball in hand by picking up a couple of wickets and dismissing Usman Khawaja in the first innings of the match.
Conduct dope tests on Indian cricketers: Govt to NADA:::::NEW DELHI: The sports ministry has directed the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) to enforce the World Anti-Doping Agency's ( WADA ) Code in all its "fairness and entirety" on the BCCI and conduct dope testing of cricketers during domestic and international matches being played in India.The ministry has given NADA the "full authority and powers" to send its 'dope control officers' to the BCCI recognised tournaments and matches to collect in-competition blood and urine samples of the cricketers.The TOI had exclusively reported on October 28, 2017 that WADA has asked ICC to direct BCCI to allow dope testing of Indian cricketers by NADA.WADA had also written to India's sports ministry asking it to ensure that BCCI is WADA-compliant.WADA had threatened to cancel NADA's accreditation if this was not ensured."I have instructed NADA's director general (Navin Agarwal) to send his DCOs to cricket tournaments in India to collect the samples of cricketers.If the BCCI resists or creates any hurdle in NADA's functioning, we won't hesitate from taking further action against the cricket board," secretary sports Rahul Bhatnagar told TOI on Saturday."We will first start with in-competition testing during matches played in India.Then, we will gradually move forward (to conduct out-of-competition testing).If the BCCI has not responded to NADA's previous mails, doesn't mean we (ministry) will stop discharging our duties.Let them first stop us from conducting dope tests.We will see what more needs to be done.The important thing is we will conduct testing within our parameters and rules and regulations as stipulated in the WADA Code," Bhatnagar added.Another official told TOI that the ministry would drag BCCI to court if it continued to defy NADA."BCCI is a public body.It's true that it doesn't take any financial grant from the ministry, but like any other national sports federation (NSF), it has to take permission to hold international tournaments and bilateral series.So, it can't continue saying we won't allow NADA to test cricketers, but engage a private international dope testing firm (IDTM) for sample collection," the official added.Bhatnagar said: "We have to take this issue to its logical conclusion once and for all.For now, we are going ahead with the sample collection.We don't want to become non-compliant to the WADA Code."It's been learnt that NADA will start dope testing of cricketers in the ongoing Ranji Trophy season.NADA DG and BCCI office-bearers, including Committee of Administrators (CoA) chairman Vinod Rai, couldn't be contacted for their response.But a BCCI source said the board would only look into the matter seriously after the Supreme Court proceedings in the Lodha committee recommendations case reaches its conclusion.
FIFA U-17 World Cup 2017: England beat Spain 5-2 to claim maiden FIFA U-17 World Cup title:::::KOLKATA: Revenge is a dish best served cold.And if you have doubts, ask anyone from Steve Cooper 's pride of Young Lions to vouch for it.England defeated familiar foes Spain in a ruthless, magnificent manner at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.It was an under-17 World Cup final, and England fought and won in style, defying odds and decorating it with an incredible turnaround.It was a performance from Phil Foden and Co that had the record-breaking 66,684 crowd stand up and bow in admiration.England were 0-2 down after the first half an hour of play, but blew away Spain 5-2 in a sensational fightback and emerged the new under-17 World Cup champions.It was an exhibition of their pure class and character where they married their style with a lion-hearted spirit.And the outcome was simply devastating - pure joy to watch, too.It also signalled the birth of a new and young England, at least at the junior level, as they capped their already successful summer - following their under-20 World Cup and Euro under-19 triumphs this year - with another global trophy here.When Spain raced to a 2-0 lead thanks to a brace from Barcelona 'B' team star Sergio Gomez (in the 10th and 31st minutes), it looked to be a one-sided contest and Spain appeared to be on course for their destino perfecto.But from the depth of apparent defeat, England rose like a phoenix and turned the game on its head the way very few would have anticipated.Each time promise revealed itself, even amidst the enormity of the task, England swooped on it and made it count.Rhian Brewster started the turnaround jabbing home Steven Sessegnon's right-wing cross on the cusp of halftime on way to sealing the Golden Boot award for himself with eight goals.And when Morgan Gibbs White made it 2-2 in the 58th minute providing finish to another Sessegnon pass, the game had already started changing course and contour.From there on, Foden - who later received the Golden Ball award from FIFA president Gianni Infantino - took the game away from the Spaniards with a brilliant performance.When the Manchester City wunderkind turned in Callum Hudson-Odoi to make it 3-2 in the 70th minute, England sensed their chances and went about burying the ghost of their under-17 European championship, which they lost in penalty shootout.And when it happened, the noise at the stadium was incredible, almost dizzying.Spain tried their best, pressing and running but without troubling goalkeeper Curtis Anderson.They were simply irresistible for the first half an hour, shredding England's defence at will and showing why they are called the gold standard of passing football.But England overwhelmed them by guile, speed and quality.The intensity of their football was embodied by the magnificent Sessegnon, who played with pace and intelligence, challenging their side backs for oxygen, let alone the ball.And Foden added a touch of beauty to this never-say-die mentality.Centre-back Marc Guehi joined the party in the 84th minute, providing the finish to a beautiful training-ground drill following Hudson-Odoi's free-kick.The entire England bench, including coach Cooper, entered the ground to celebrate the goal.The contest was over and the pain of losing to Spain in Croatia was buried for good.But Foden still had time to inflict more ignominy on the Spaniards, turning Hudson Odoi's brilliant delivery across the face of the goal into the net.
French Open Badminton 2017: Srikanth beats Prannoy to enter final, PV Sindhu out:::::PARIS: Kidambi Srikanth's dream season turned even better with his fifth entry into the Super Series final while World Championship silver medallist PV Sindhu crashed out in the semi-final of the French Open, here on Saturday.In an all-India semi-final, Srikanth, who won the Denmark Open last week, beat compatriot HS Prannoy 14-21, 21-19, 21-18 in 62 minutes.Having already completed a hat-trick of Super Series titles, Srikanth will be aiming to win his fourth title of the season.He will meet Kenta Nishimoto of Japan, who defeated Anders Antonsen 21-17, 21-15 in the other semi-final.Srikanth once again showed his stamina and ability to take the match deep even after Prannoy started on a rousing note with 21-14 victory in the first game.It was battle on even keel during the next two games as Srikanth's big match temperament came to the fore during big points.Earlier, PV Sindhu had a below-par outing as Japan's Akane Yamaguchi beat the World Championship silver medallist 21-14 21-9 in a thoroughly one-sided semi-final.It took fifth seed Yamaguchi only 37 minutes to blow away the Indian challenge in the last four clash.While the first game lasted 19 minutes, the second game's duration was a minute less.There was a sudden drop of intensity in Sindhu's performance in the first game at 14-14, when Yamaguchi reeled off seven straight points to wrap it up at 21-14.Yamaguchi repeatedly attacked Sindhu's left side as she found it difficult to control.The Olympic silver medallist was sluggish in her movement as Yamaguchi, with her powerful smashes, did not allow Sindhu to approach the net.The second game was a one-way traffic as Yamaguchi straightaway went 5-0 up and, at the mini-break, was leading 11-2.She did win a few points with some deft drop shots, but it was too late in the day, as Yamaguchi won the second game at 21-9 to make it to the summit round.
A surreal win: England U-17 coach:::::KOLKATA: Speechless about their stunning turnaround to defeat Spain and win their maiden FIFA Under-17 World Cup England head coach Steve Cooper said their surreal performance speaks volumes about their character.England bounced back from a two-goal deficit to down Spain 5-2 and to win the U-17 title and continue their dream journey in the age group level where they have won the U-20 World Cup earlier this year in June."My feeling is speechless, a little bit surreal.I may be better tomorrow once I realise what we have done.The football that we played, the individual talents, the team identity we showed from being 0-2 down against run of play and win 5-3 tells something about the character," Cooper said at the post-match news conference.The Three Lions had never gone beyond the quarter-finals in the tournament before but emulated England U20s who won their World Cup in June."This trophy is a dedication to the good work done we have done in England, the developmental academies the dedicated work being put at the Football Association...It's the recognition of where English wanted to go.It's pretty special."Phil Foden, an outstanding talent for Manchester City and the man of the match, stole in at the back post to put England ahead in the 69th minute as England avenged Spain's victory in the European Championship final in May."We beat Spain playing our game, England team will typify that.This is doing our thing our way, and doing at the biggest stage is so rewarding."Spanish U-17 coach Santiago Denia was heartbroken at the loss but said he's proud of the work showed by the team."To be honest, I'm heartbroken because of the boys.But I'm very proud of them, the work we have done with them in the past three years that goes beyond the result of the final."This was final and the level expected to be this high.One thing we have accomplished is to be a team," he said underlining the fact that they are European champions and runners-up in the world."As a coach my job was to create a group and we did that.I'm proud of that."Spain looked fluent in the first 30 minutes before Rhian Brewster reduced the margin going into the break."We could not maintain that score.England stepped forward and put pressure on us.They forced us to play the transition game and they are very good at it.We didn't have the control of the game as much as we would have liked to."
Higuain scores 100th Serie A goal as Juve sink Milan:::::MILAN: Gonzalo Higuain scored twice, including his 100th Serie A goal, to give Juventus a 2-0 win at AC Milan on Saturday, putting them level on points at the top of Serie A and plunging their big-spending opponents back into crisis.Champions Juventus joined Napoli on 28 points while Milan, who spent more than 200 million euros ($232 million) in the transfer market in the summer to try and revive their fortunes, were left languishing in eighth with 16.Briefly boosted by a 4-1 win at Chievo on Wednesday, Milan have five wins, five defeats and one draw from their 11 games.Napoli host lowly Sassuolo on Sunday (1400 GMT).Milan started well but quickly fell away and Juve's growing pressure paid off in the 23rd minute when Paulo Dybala slipped the ball through to Higuain who drilled his shot past Gianluigi Donnarumma.It was the Argentine's 100th Serie A goal in 153 games for Juventus and Napoli, adding to the 107 goals he scored in La Liga for Real Madrid.Zlatan Ibrahimovic is the only other player in the last 20 years to have score 100 goals or more in two of Europe's big five leagues.Nikola Kalinic had two good chances to level for Milan, just failing to connect with Fabio Borini's low cross and seeing a close-range effort tipped on to the bar by Gianluigi Buffon.Juve struck again in the 63rd minute with a superbly-worked goal as Kwadwo Asamoah surged through the Milan midfield and found Higuain with the help of a Dybala dummy.Higuain, in turn, slipped his marker and scored from 20 metres with a low shot which went in off the foot the post.
FIFA U-17 World Cup 2017: We stuck to our plan despite poor start: Phil Foden:::::KOLKATA: The England players' joy knew no bounds.From the time Paraguayan referee Enrique Caceres blew the final whistle, the Rhian Brewsters and the Phil Fodens embraced each other, jumped around and danced in sheer ecstasy at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday night.It was not just the expression of winning the country's maiden U-17 World Cup, but the manner of doing so -turning the final against Spain on its head from being 0-2 down to win it 5-2.Not just the final, England have been brilliant from their very first match against Chile and never let the intensity and momentum drop even for a day .Having lost to Spain on penalties in the final of the under-17 European championship a few months ago, revenge couldn't have been sweeter for the Young Lions.And, to think that England did not get the services of one of their star players Jadon Sancho after the group stage.What makes their triumph even more satisfying is that they beat teams like Japan, USA, Germany, Brazil and finally Spain on their way to the title.No doubt, coach Steve Cooper was delighted."I am proud of my boys.We stuck to our style and plan and the boys executed it brilliantly," Cooper said.Manchester City's Phil Foden proved through the tournament why Pep Guardiola rates him so highly and is set to give him a senior debut at Manchester City.The No.7 was absolutely fantastic through the tournament and produced another high-class performance in the summit clash.Not only did he score two goals, he orchestrated most moves.No wonder, he was awarded the Golden Ball."We did not have a good start, but we came back well and stayed true to our plan.The coach told us to be attacking and we tried doing that," Foden said as all his teammates jumped onto him.The under-17 World Cup is the third major title of the year for the England youth sides.They had won the FIFA under-20 World Cup in June in South Korea followed by the UEFA under-19 European championship in Georgia the following month.As expected, the under-17 World Cup in India has set the record for maximum attendance at any FIFA age-group meet for boys.With 56,422 people at tending the third-place match between Brazil and Mali, the total attendance went up to 12,80,449.The previous best at an under-17 WC was 12,31,000 at the 1985 edition in China.The cumulative attendance for the tournament was 13,47,133 after 66,684 people watched the final.The previous all-time highest in all age-group meets was 13,09,929 at the 2011 under-20 World Cup in Colombia.
FIFA U-17 World Cup 2017: FIFA U-17 World Cup: Brazil two good for Mali in bronze battle:::::KOLKATA: If a video is compiled on the shocking moments from the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup, the howler by Mali goalkeeper Youssouf Koita in the playoff for third place against Brazil at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday would almost certainly top the list.That fortuitous goal, and a late strike by substitute Yuri Alberto, helped Brazil win 2-0 and clinch the bronze medal.This is Brazil's best finish since finishing runners-up in the 2005 edition.The match was into its 55th minute, with the deadlock yet to be broken.Alan did well to snatch the ball from a Mali defender and attempted a weak shot at goal from outside the Mali box which Koita should have collected with ease.But an extremely casual approach from the goalie saw the ball touch his hand and roll into the goal.While the Brazil players celebrated, Koita just could not believe what had just transpired and had to be consoled by his teammates and a Brazilian player.Considering the fact that he made the maximum number of saves amongst all goalkeepers (23) in the tournament, Koita's blunder came as a bolt from the blue.It was similar to the mistake committed by England custodian Rob Green in the 2010 World Cup against USA.Brazil coach Carlos Amadeu had said on the eve of the match that motivation would not be a problem for his players despite the semifinal defeat to England.On the field, though, there was a lack of urgency in Brazil's game.Amadeu's claims notwithstanding, the boys in yellow failed to combine well.Mali, led by midfielder Salam Jiddou, looked the better side in the early stages, making some forays into rival box without being clinical enough.In the 22nd minute, Jiddou exchanged slick passes with Ibrahim Kane and Lassana N'Diaye but his shot from top of the box failed to test Brazil goalkeeper Gabriel Brazao.In the 38th minute, Jiddou let go an outstanding piledriver which was acrobatically tipped over by Brazao.

India v New Zealand: Kohli skips optional practice ahead of series decider:::::KANPUR: Captain Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya were among the five Indian team members who skipped the optional practice session ahead of the series decider against New Zealand on Sunday.Left-arm spinner Axar Patel , who played in Pune in place of Kuldeep Yadav , too, did not take part in the afternoon session.It remains to be seen whether Kohli goes with the same playing XI that played on Wednesday or bring in Yadav in front of his home crowd.The chinaman had a lengthy spell in the nets and so did leggie Yuzvendra Chahal Among the batsmen, Shikhar Dhawan went through a long session as he batted in the nets before practising the pull shots off fast full-tosses on the outfield.India had their nets at the centre square while New Zealand had them placed on the boundary wickets.Compared to the hosts, the visitors underwent a much longer session in the morning that went beyond three hours.Both teams hit the nets for the first time since arriving on Thursday.After the practice, New Zealand pacer Tim Southee said the mood in the team was upbeat ahead of the pressure game."There was an air of excitement around the guys today at training.Obviously we felt freshened up after the day off yesterday.The series is on the line tomorrow.That's what we play for and like I said, good sides have come here and walked away empty handed."It'll be nice to I guess to seal the series here.But India are a tough team in their own conditions as they have shown that over a while," said the senior Kiwi pacer.
WTA Finals: Venus rallies past Garcia to set up Wozniacki final:::::SINGAPORE: Venus Williams rallied from the disappointment of losing a tight first set to blast her way past Caroline Garcia 6-7(3), 6-2, 6-3 and set up a WTA Finals title showdown against Caroline Wozniacki on Saturday.The evergreen American has enjoyed a brilliant campaign, reaching two grand slam finals in 2017, and the 37-year-old American was able to call on all her experience to find a way to stifle her upset-minded opponent in an engrossing encounter.In the first semi-final, Denmark's Wozniacki stood her ground in the face of some incredible early pressure before pinning down Karolina Pliskova with a 7-6(9), 6-3 victory that ensured Simona Halep will end the year as world number one.Williams and Garcia took the court in a battle between two players possessing huge forehands and a tendency to attack their opponent's second serve, the contest starting out as slow burner that lacked fluency after they traded early breaks.Williams appeared troubled by a hip injury and was trying to keep the points short while Garcia became tentative every time she had a chance to break free, especially when she fashioned her first set point that came and went at 5-4.Garcia was rewarded for being more positive in the tiebreak as Williams' serve wavered and the Frenchwoman wrapped up the opener on her second set point when her opponent sent another groundstroke wide and long.The American increased her intensity in the second set and took advantage of Garcia's passivity to storm 4-1 clear, with Williams breaking for a second time in the eighth game against a weary-looking opponent to level up the contest.Garcia had won nine of her last 10 three-set matches but was struggling to grab any sort of foothold in Williams' service games and the American shifted up a gear to grab the only break she needed in the eighth game and served it out for the win."Garcia competed so well in the whole tournament," Williams said of an opponent who won back-to-back titles in China to sneak into the event as the last qualifier."Every time I thought I had her, she would play amazing shots... but it's never over until the fat lady sings and I'm not fat," joked Williams, who won the tournament in 2008.Wozniacki's victory, completed in a just under two hours, was built on the Dane's resilience, consistency and greater variation on the key points, and put the 27-year-old into her second final at the eight-woman event after losing in 2010."We have had a lot of close matches this year and I was hoping today was my turn.It feels great to be in the final and I have been playing some great tennis this week," Wozniacki said in a courtside interview.The first five games went with serve until the Czech edged ahead by instigating a run of four straight breaks of serve as Wozniacki staved off three set points in the 10th game to stay alive in the set and eventually force a tiebreak.The Dane then raced into a 6-1 lead over the sleepwalking Pliskova before the Czech rose from her slumber to first save all five set points and then fashion three more of her own, which Wozniacki somehow managed to survive.Wozniacki continued to cover every inch of the court to set up another set point, her sixth, with more defensive brilliance, and the former number one sealed the opener 11-9 in the breaker when Pliskova found the net with a backhand.Wozniacki changed tactics again, opting to push the ball into the corners to force Pliskova into making errors as she struggled out of position and the Dane forged a vital break for a 5-3 lead.This time there would be no way back for Pliskova as Wozniacki sent a backhand crosscourt winner past her stranded opponent to storm into the final.
Kidambi Srikanth: We are physically more stronger than others, says Srikanth:::::PARIS: Indian shuttlers are physically much stronger now than their competitors and the ability to play longer matches gives them the edge over others, believes Kidambi Srikanth , who reached his fifth final this season.Srikanth, who clinched titles at Indonesia, Australia and Denmark, saw off compatriot H S Prannoy 14-21 21-19 21-18 in the French Open Super Series semifinals to become the first Indian to reach five summit clashes in a season.The World No.4 credited this to a change in mindset brought about by new Indonesian coach Mulyo Handoyo "It is the kind of mindset we have these days, we are not really scared of longer matches and that gives us the edge over any players," Srikanth said when asked about the contribution of Mulyo."If you play against few Chinese players, you have to be ready to play longer matches.Now we are ready to play that.I think we are physically much stronger than any of the players."Srikanth also praised Prannoy for his run in the tournament."He really played well.The second and third game could have gone either way, throughout the tournament he was fantastic."It is always tricky when you play against a fellow player whom you play 365 days.It is always tough.Today both of us played well.There was 18-18 in both the games and then I got three crucial games and that made the change."He is also an aggressive player, when he gets going, it really hits it hard.There were times in the match when I could not react to his smashes.It is tough when he gets going."Srikanth will face Japan's Kenta Nishimoto in the final for his fourth title of the year."I think I am feeling tired now, just one more left.I just hope I can recover myself for tomorrow's match.I am really thinking of doing well.I am not worried about the results, it is just to play my best, that's it."A tad disappointed but Prannoy gave credit to Srikanth and said he needs to be more consistent."He played very well in the end of the game.I don't think I played any bad strokes today or my plan went wrong.Just feel he took the chances in the end and came good in both the games.The shuttles were fast, his drives came good," he said."It is just the one who executes well on the particular day wins and he did that in the end.I need to be a little more consistent in the couple of rounds."Olympic silver medallist PV Sindhu , meanwhile, suffered a 14-21 9-21 loss to Japan's Akane Yamaguchi "Playing semifinals is great but I am a bit upset though as I couldn't make it to the finals.I have to learn from my mistakes and comeback," she said.Talking about the match, Sindhu said: "In the first game it was 14 all and I gave away many points.I gave a huge lead in the second also.She had a 10-12 points lead and to cover that was tough to comeback.There were too many unforced errors from my side and overall I couldn't play my game."Her defence is very good.She was taking all my smashes today, I think I could have mixed it up.I played attacking and I could have changed a bit a little more in the first game but overall she played very well.In the second game she didn't even make any mistake.I could have played more rallies."

Manchester United: Supersub Martial stars as United down Spurs:::::MANCHESTER (United Kingdom): Anthony Martial came off the bench to earn Manchester United a 1-0 win over Premier League title rivals Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on Saturday.Victory saw United, who had started the day ahead of Spurs on goal difference alone, go three points clear of their London rivals.France international Martial, currently battling to win a regular starting place under Jose Mourinho, did his chances no harm with the manner of his 81st minute winning goal, even if it was a curiously direct affair.A long kick forward by goalkeeper David De Gea was headed on by Romelu Lukaku and Martial sprinted away from the Spurs back line before calmly beating the keeper with an excellent finish.It was a disappointing way for Spurs to lose a game and the fact that the London club were without injured leading striker Harry Kane is bound to revive the debate over whether their bid to be crowned champions is too reliant on the England forward.After being widely criticised for their negative approach in the recent goalless draw at Liverpool, United showed more ambition against another of the division's top clubs on their own turf, although the result was still a lack of real goalscoring chances and entertainment.Within two minutes, Lukaku chased onto a through ball and his low, driven cross-shot was well cut out by the alert Hugo Lloris, with Marcus Rashford poised in the middle in front of an open net.Ashley Young's penetrating run might have carved out a chance but his drag-back passed through the area and narrowly out of reach of three team mates before a 35-yard Rashford free-kick was turned around the post by the diving goalkeeper.Spurs, understandably given the absence of Kane, adopted a more cautious approach but grew into the game as the half progressed.Early chances were limited to long shots -- Serge Aurier and Moussa Sissoko forcing De Gea into simple stops and Toby Alderweireld shooting into the side-netting from outside the area.But by the time Christian Eriksen floated over a delightful pass in the direction of Dele Alli, who was denied the chance to volley on goal by two defenders, Spurs looked comfortable.When Tottenham did create a real chance, it was in bizarre circumstances as De Gea made a routine catch from a Ben Davies cross but collided with Phil Jones and dropped the ball.Alli was alert and passed the ball back to Sissoko who fired well over the crossbar from the edge of the area.Soon, Young and Alli were involved in an altercation, after the United man was accidentally hit in the face by Aurier, with players from both teams squaring off in an incident which breathed much-needed life into the game.Tottenham reacted first as Alli saw his header, from a Davies corner, blocked by Eric Bailly and then the England midfielder found space for a shot which failed to trouble De Gea.Another Davies corner again caused problems before De Gea caught Eric Dier's hooked shot towards goal.United opened the second half in more committed fashion and, finally, after 54 minutes, the home crowd had something to cheer as the Reds created three quick chances in succession.A mistake by Davies presented Henrikh Mkhitaryan with an opportunity for a shot which Lloris fumbled.But for Davies atoned for his error with a superb cover-tackle to deny Rashford a simple goal from the rebound.The attack continued with Ander Herrera setting up Antonio Valencia , whose shot was blocked.Lukaku then shrugged off Jan Vertonghen before sending a low shot just wide of the goal.Both teams had chances to break the deadlock shortly before Martial scored the only goal of the game.Alli flicked agonisingly wide after a brilliant chip forward from Eriksen and Lukaku headed against the post from Jesse Lingard's cross.

Manchester City: Aguero kept waiting as Man City maintain lead:::::LONDON: Sergio Aguero was left waiting to become Manchester City 's outright all-time leading goal-scorer as his side remained five points clear at the top of the Premier League table on Saturday.Aguero was named on the bench as City saw off West Bromwich Albion 3-2, having failed to surpass the club record of 177 goal he shares with Eric Brook during a midweek League Cup penalty shoot-out win over Championship side Wolves.City manager Pep Guardiola blamed Aguero's failure to score against Wolves on the different ball used in the League Cup and there were three goals in a frantic five-minute spell at The Hawthorns on Saturday.Leroy Sane produced a stunning strike to give City a 10th-minute lead only for West Brom's Jay Rodriguez to equalise soon afterwards.But come the 15th minute, City were 2-1 up after Fernandinho left fly with a speculative shot that deflected off Gareth Barry and went in off the post.City substitute Raheem Sterling gave the visitors a two-goal lead with a close-range finish in the 64th minute only for the Baggies' to pull a goal back late on through Matt Phillips after a defensive blunder.Second-placed Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur had both started the day level on points but Jose Mourinho's men edged ahead after substitute Anthony Martial's goal nine minutes from time gave them a 1-0 win over a Spurs side missing injured England striker Harry Kane.It was just the result United manager Mourinho would have wanted after slamming his players' attitude following a shock 2-1 loss to Huddersfield last week."We all feel we have to win every match so that's why I felt disappointed at Huddersfield," Mourinho told Sky Sports."Today, every ball looked like the last ball of their careers.This was Spurs' second defeat of the week after their League Cup loss to London rivals West Ham."It was unlucky that in the last 10 minutes we conceded our goal," said Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino."It was our mistake," he added after his defence failed to deal with a long clearance from United goalkeeper David De Gea that Romelu Lukaku headed on to Martial.Meanwhile Spurs's arch north London rivals Arsenal had to come from behind to see off struggling Swansea 2-1.The Gunners fell behind when Sam Cluca scored with Swansea's first touch inside the Arsenal penalty area to put the visitors 1-0 up in the 22nd minute.But Arsene Wenger's men were back on level terms early in the second half at the Emirates when Sead Kolasinac rifled a shot past former Arsenal goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski from 15 yards out.Kolasinac then turned provider for Aaron Ramsey as the Wales midfielder made it 2-1 in the 58th minute.Liverpool missed a penalty but still beat Huddersfield 3-0 in a match that pitted Reds manager Jurgen Klopp against Terriers boss David Wagner -- the best man at his wedding.Shortly before half-time, Liverpool were awarded a penalty after Tommy Smith grabbing Roberto Firmino's shirt only for Mohamed Salah to fire his spot-kick straight at Jonas Lossl.But Daniel Sturridge broke the deadlock five minutes into the second half before Firmino doubled the lead in the 58th minute with a header from a corner.Gini Wijnaldum then added a third late on.Meanwhile Wilfried Zaha's goal in the seventh minute of stoppage time saw basement club Crystal Palace came from 2-0 down to salvage a 2-2 draw with West Ham in a London derby at Selhurst Park.Javier Hernandez and Andre Ayew, with a 25-yard shot that went in off the crossbar, put the Hammers 2-0 up before Palace pulled a goal back through a penalty from Luka Milivojevic.Former Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher's 16th-minute goal gave Stoke City a much-needed 1-0 win at high-flyers Watford.Bournemouth face Chelsea in Saturday's late kick-off.South coast duo Brighton and Southampton meet on Sunday when Leicester play Everton in former Saints boss Claude Puel's first game in charge of the Foxes.Burnley welcome Newcastle to Turf Moor on Monday.
