Twitter suspends longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone:::::Longtime Trump ally Roger Stones account was suspended by Twitter on Saturday but the self-styled agent provocateur is vowing to return to the social network.I have been informed that I have been suspended for 3 hours and 12 minutes, Stone told Fox News in a text message.While I am uncertain why, sometimes the stark truth offends some people.Added Stone, I'll be baaaaaak.As of Saturday evening, the @RogerJStoneJr account was still unavailable.This account has been suspended, the page for Stones account read.A Twitter spokesperson told Fox News they do not comment on individual accounts.But the company cited its policy on abusive behavior that states users may not incite or engage in the targeted abuse or harassment of others.On Friday, in a series of offensive tweets, Stone lashed out at some of CNNs personalities, including anchors Jake Tapper and Don Lemon.It came as the network reported that a federal grand jury has approved the first charges in special counsel Robert Muellers Russia investigation.MUELLER HAS FILED CHARGES IN RUSSIA-TRUMP ASSOCIATES PROBE: MULTIPLE REPORTS In one tweet, he called Lemon a dumb piece of s--t. He also called him dumber than dog s--t. He also referred to Lemon and Tapper as human excrement and CNN contributor Ana Navarro as a dumbf--k. Stone, who was interviewed by the House Intelligence Committee for its Russia probe, is a colorful political consultant and longtime informal adviser to Trump who often serves a surrogate for the president in the media.
House Intelligence Committee strikes deal for access to Fusion GPS bank records:::::The House Intelligence Committee said Saturday it has struck a deal to gain access to bank records from Fusion GPS, the firm behind the salacious anti-Trump dossier.The company had recently attempted to block the committees subpoena for its banking records.The parties have reached an agreement related to the House Intelligence Committee's subpoena for Fusion GPS's bank records that will secure the Committee's access to the records necessary for its investigation, the intelligence committee said in a statement released Saturday.Lawmakers for months have been trying to investigate the origin of the salacious anti-Trump dossier, which claimed the Russian government had compromising material on President Trump.It was provided to journalists and the FBI last year, when Trump was still a Republican candidate.CONSERVATIVE WEBSITE FUNDED INITIAL FUSION GPS TRUMP OPPOSITION EFFORT Over the last week, it was revealed that Fusion GPS was retained last year by Marc E. Elias, an attorney representing the DNC and the Clinton campaign.The firm then hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to write the dossier.On Friday evening, it was revealed that the opposition research project was initially backed by the conservative Washington Free Beacon website.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., had issued a subpoena on Oct. 4 for Fusion GPS TD Bank records.In seeking a "temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction" to block the release of those records, Fusion argued the release would them their rights to free speech and expressive association as guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution."Earlier this month, two officials from the political research firm invoked their Fifth Amendment right and refused to answer questions Wednesday before the same House panel on Capitol Hill.Fusion GPS co-founder Peter Fritsch and top lieutenant Thomas Catan both took the Fifth on every question posed.Fox News Catherine Herridge contributed to this report.
Mattis says nuclear threat by North Korea is accelerating, slams 'outlaw' behavior:::::U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Saturday that the threat of a nuclear missile attack by North Korea is accelerating.Mattis, who made his remarks with South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo during his visit to Seoul, accused the hermit kingdom of illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear programs - and vowed to defeat any attack.North Korea has accelerated the threat that it poses to its neighbors and the world through its illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear weapons programs, Mattis said.MATTIS: US WILL NOT ACCEPT A NUCLEAR NORTH KOREA Mattis said North Korea would be vastly overmatched by the firepower and cohesiveness of the decades-old U.S.-South Korean alliance.Make no mistake any attack on the United States or our allies will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons by the North will be met with a massive military response that is effective and overwhelming," he continued.Mattis remarks come less than a week before President Trumps slated tour of East Asia.Trump has bolstered his own rhetoric against the isolated nation.In August, Trump warned the North not to make any more threats against the United States, and said that if it did, it would be met with "fire and fury like the world has never seen."MATTIS STRESSES DIPLOMACY IN VISIT TO KOREAN DEMILITARIZED ZONE This was Mattis's second visit to South Korea since taking office in January.He made a point of going to Seoul and Tokyo on his first overseas trip in February, saying he wanted to emphasis the importance he places on strengthening alliances and partnerships.On Friday he visited the Demilitarized Zone that forms an official buffer between the two Koreas.He appeared there with Song in what they both called a show of solidarity.On Wednesday, Trump teased the possibility of visiting the Demilitarized Zone as well, The Hill reported.Well, I'd rather not say, but you'll be surprised, Trump said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Trump vows to release 'ALL' JFK files after bending to intelligence groups he mistrusts:::::President Trump said Friday that hell release ALL of the remaining John F. Kennedy files, after being forced by U.S. spy agencies of which he has been leery to withhold thousands of still potentially sensitive documents."After strict consultation with General Kelly, the CIA and other agencies, I will be releasing ALL JFK files other than the names and addresses of any mentioned person who is still living," Trump tweeted."I am doing this for reasons of full disclosure, transparency and in order to put any and all conspiracy theories to rest."The National Archives on Thursday released 2,800 once-classified records related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.Behind the scenes of the much-anticipated release, Trump and his White House lawyers were purportedly until the last minute going back and forth with U.S. intelligence officials over their requests for additional redactions.And the requests irritated Trump, who continued to resist signing off on the request, according to an account by two White House officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity.Late last week, Trump received his first official briefing on the release in an Oval Office meeting that included Kelly, his chief of staff; White House Counsel Don McGahn and National Security Council legal adviser John Eisenberg.Just before the documents release, Trump wrote in a memorandum that he had "no choice" but to agree to requests from the CIA and FBI to keep thousands of documents secret because of the possibility that releasing the information could still harm national security.Two aides said Trump was upset by what he perceived to be overly broad secrecy requests, adding that the agencies had been explicitly warned about his expectation that redactions be kept to a minimum.According to White House officials, Trump accepted that some of the records contained references to sensitive sources and methods used by the intelligence community and law enforcement and that declassification could harm American foreign policy interests.But after having the scope of the redactions presented to him, Trump told aides he did not believe them to be in the spirit of the law.On Thursday, Trump's top aides presented him with an alternative to simply acquiescing to the agency requests: He could temporarily allow the redactions while ordering the agencies to launch a new comprehensive examination of the records still withheld or redacted in part.Trump accepted the suggestion, ordering that agencies be "extremely circumspect" about keeping the remaining documents secret at the end of the 180-day assessment.The tale of the final hours before the congressionally mandated 25-year release deadline adds a new chapter to the story of Trump's troubled relationship with his spy agencies.Between the time Trump was elected in November 2016 and took office in January, he slammed the CIA for concluding Russia hacked Democratic Party emails to help him win the White House over Democrat Hillary Clinton.And Trump has been critical of how the FBI handled the investigation into then-Secretary of Clintons private email servers -- to the point of firing Director James Comey.Since taking office, Trump also has moved to exert more control over U.S. spying agencies and accused his predecessor of using government spycraft to monitor his campaign.In the JFK files matter, one White House official said, Trump wanted to make clear he wouldn't be bullied by the agencies.Under a 1992 law, all of the records related to the assassination were to be made public unless explicitly withheld by the president.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Mueller has filed charges in Russia-Trump associates probe: multiple reports:::::A federal grand jury has approved the first charges in special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into possible collusion between Russia and members of the Trump presidential campaign, with indictments to be announced as early as Monday, according to multiple news agencies.The charges being filed was reported first by CNN, which said anyone charged will be taken into custody Monday.However, the charges have been sealed by a federal judge.So whoever is charged and whether the charges are criminal remains unclear.During a Saturday appearance on Fox News, former Department of Justice official Robert Driscoll told anchor Leland Vittert its possible the indictment might not even be directly tied to Russian collusion.Think back to the Clinton years, Driscoll said.The Whitewater investigation was about an Arkansas land deal.And it ended up being about something else completely.Driscoll added, Robert Mueller is free to look at taxes, is free to look at lobbying filings, foreign agent filings.Things like that could all be involved that wouldnt necessarily touch on the issue of Russia collusion that everyone seems focused on politically.Speculation has focused on former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn as likely targets.Manafort has been the subject of a longstanding investigation into his dealings in the Ukraine several years ago -- for which he did not file as a foreign agent until June 2017.Federal agents, reportedly in search of evidence related to the Russia investigation, this summer raided his northern Virginia home.He also was reportedly wiretapped by investigators before and after the 2016 presidential election.Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, was a Trump surrogate during the campaign and briefly served as national security adviser before being fired for failing to fully disclose his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, then-Russian ambassador to the United States.The FBI also secured approval from a federal court to monitor the communications of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.On Saturday, Page released a statement to Fox News in response to questions about whether he or his lawyers have been notified about any charges.Page said in the statement that he has worked with the executive branch and Congress since being contacted in March.But he also suggested that revelations about the Democratic Party having helped finance a dossier to smear Trump has tainted any Russia probe.In terms of charges', I cant even imagine what might even be considered now that the false evidence from the politically-motivated, big-money-financed Dodgy Dossier that started this extrajudicial disaster has instead been so thoroughly exposed as a complete sham, Carter wrote in the statement.The Wall Street Journal reported at least one person could be taken into custody as early as Monday.Richard Hibey, an attorney for Manafort, told Fox News on Friday that neither he nor any of his colleagues representing Manafort had been informed of any indictment of their client.Manafort has been the subject of a longstanding investigation into his dealings in the Ukraine several years ago for which he did not file as a foreign agent until June 2017.In addition to his home being raided, Manafort was reportedly wiretapped by investigators before and after the 2016 presidential election.A retired Army lieutenant general, Flynn served as a Trump surrogate during the campaign and briefly served as national security adviser before being fired over his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, who was Russia's ambassador to the United States.Mueller has reportedly probed whether Flynn was involved in a private effort to get former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's emails from Russian hackers.NBC reported Saturday that Mueller will make public an indictment on Monday.The Justice Departments special counsels office declined to comment on the reports of filed charges.There was no immediate comment from the White House.Trump has denied allegations that his campaign colluded with Russians and condemned investigations into the matter as a witch hunt.Fox News' Catherine Herridge, James Rosen, John Roberts, Brooke Singman and Kaitlyn Schallhorn contributed to this report.
Corker doesn't rule out challenging Trump in 2020 Republican primary:::::Less than three weeks after calling the White House an adult day care center, U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., on Friday appeared open to the idea of challenging President Donald Trump in the 2020 GOP primary.But while speaking to reporters at the 64th annual Governors Conference on Economic and Community Development, Corker said it was way, way too early" to decide whether to compete for the Republican presidential nomination, USA Today reported.So the only thing that Im thinking about right now over the next 14 months truly is doing the best job I can as a senator, Corker said.You know, I dont know what Im doing next Sunday.The notion that Trump will be impeached is unrealistic, Corker said, even as some media reports speculated he was building a case for the president's removal from office.Corker added that he was wary of contemplating a presidential run because of how it would affect his current responsibilities."I think that if you even begin thinking those things, everything you do becomes viewed through a different lens," he said.Corker, who has announced that he will not seek a third Senate term in 2018, has long feuded with the president.After the deadly violence at protests in Charlottesville, Va., in August, Corker said that Trump had demonstrated neither the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful."On Oct. 8, after Trump tweeted that Corker was a negative voice who lacked the guts to run for reelection without the presidents endorsement, Corker likened the White House to an adult day care center.Later that day, Corker told the New York Times that Trump was setting the U.S. on the path to World War III.The president hit back, calling the senator a lightweight who "couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee."Corker again excoriated the president Tuesday, tweeting that he was utterly untruthful and vowing he would not support Trump in any future campaign.But Corker acknowledged his attacks on Trump might not be endearing him to many of his constituents.In a survey conducted this month, Corkers disapproval rating had soared to 41 percent in Tennessee, marking a 14-point increase since last spring.Meanwhile, Trumps approval rating in the state has held steady at approximately 50 percent."We were surprised that it hadn't dropped further than it did," Corker said of his approval rating.The Associated Press contributed to this story.
Florida Senate's top Democrat resigns after admitting affair:::::The Florida state Senates top Democrat resigned Friday after admitting to an extramarital affair with a lobbyist.State Sen. Jeff Clemens emailed his decision to Floridas Senate president after Politico Florida reported the Lake Worth Democrats affair with a Broward County lobbyist.Earlier Friday, Clemens office issued a written apology, in which the Democrat said he had made mistakes, the Tallahassee Democrat reported.The people of Florida deserve better, wrote Clemens, who also apologized to his wife.Clemens, 47, was elected to the Florida Senate in 2012 after previously serving in the House.He was expected to become minority leader after the 2018 elections.He was the second Florida state senator to resign this year.Previously, Republican Sen. Frank Artiles resigned after a loud, profanity filled incident at a private club, the Tallahassee Democrat reported.Politico Florida reported that the affair became known soon after lobbyist Devon West disclosed the affair to Clemens wife after West came into possession of Clemens laptop, which contained a list of his personal contacts.The disclosure of the affair came less than two weeks after a Florida political blogger wrote an op-ed in the Sun-Sentinel, predicting that sexual transgressors in Florida's male-dominated state politics would be exposed.
Mattis: US will not accept a nuclear North Korea:::::U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a stern warning to North Korea on Saturday: Despite its ongoing missile and nuclear programs, it is simply no match for the U.S.-South Korea alliance.Make no mistake, Mattis said during a news conference in Seoul, any attack on the United States or our allies will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons by the North will be met with a massive military response that is effective and overwhelming.During the joint appearance with South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo, Mattis acknowledged that the threat of a nuclear missile attack by North Korea was accelerating.The CIA says North Korea could be just months away from being capable of hitting the U.S. with a nuclear strike, Reuters reported.Mattis accused the regime of Kim Jong Un of illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear programs -- and vowed to defeat any attack.He said the North engages in "outlaw" behavior and that the U.S. would never accept a nuclear North.He added that regardless of what the North might try, it is overmatched by the firepower and cohesiveness of the decades-old U.S.-South Korean alliance.North Korea has accelerated the threat that it poses to its neighbors and the world through its illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear weapons programs," Mattis said, adding that U.S.-South Korean military and diplomatic collaboration thus has taken on "a new urgency."I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power," he said."I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power."- U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis As he emphasized throughout his weeklong Asia trip which comes ahead of President Donald Trumps own scheduled tour of East Asia next week -- Mattis said diplomacy remains the preferred way to deal with the North.Mattis's comments in Seoul did not go beyond his recent statements of concern about North Korea, although he appeared to inject a stronger note about the urgency of resolving the crisis.While he accused the North of "outlaw" behavior, he did not mention that President Donald Trump has ratcheted up his own rhetoric.In August, Trump warned the North not to make any more threats against the United States, and said that if it did, it would be met with "fire and fury like the world has never seen."Limits would be lifted Song, the South Korean minister, told the news conference that he and Mattis agreed that limits on South Korea conventional missile warhead payloads would be lifted.He offered no specifics.Also discussed were the conditions under which South Korea would be given wartime operational control of its forces.Currently, if war with the North broke out, the South's forces would operate under the U.S.-led U.N. Command.Trump entered office declaring his commitment to solving the North Korea problem, asserting that he would succeed where his predecessors had failed.His administration has sought to increase pressure on Pyongyang through U.N. Security Council sanctions and other diplomatic efforts, but the North hasn't budged from its goal of building a full-fledged nuclear arsenal, including missiles capable of striking the U.S. mainland.If Trump sticks to his pledge to stop the North from being able to threaten the U.S. with a nuclear attack, something will have to give - either a negotiated tempering of the North's ambitions or a U.S. acceptance of the North as a nuclear power.The other alternative would be U.S. military action to attempt to neutralize or eliminate the North's nuclear assets - a move fraught with risk for South Korea, Japan and the United States.At his Seoul news conference, Mattis said the North is, in effect, shooting itself in the foot.If it remains on its current path of ballistic missiles and atomic bombs, it will be counterproductive, in effect reducing its security," he said.The North says it needs nuclear weapons to counter what it believes is a U.S. effort to strangle its economy and overthrow the Kim government.Second visit to region This was Mattis's second visit to South Korea since taking office in January.He made a point of going to Seoul and Tokyo on his first overseas trip in February, saying he wanted to emphasis the importance he places on strengthening alliances and partnerships.On Friday he visited the Demilitarized Zone that forms an official buffer between the two Koreas.He appeared there with Song in what they both called a show of solidarity.U.S. government officials for decades have confidently but mistakenly predicted the approaching collapse of North Korea, given its economic and political isolation.Twenty years ago, Mattis's predecessor five times removed, William Cohen, said as he peered into North Korea from inside the DMZ that its communist system was "decaying and dying."His view was widely shared in Washington, but, like others, he underestimated the resilience of Pyongyang's family dynasty, which began with Kim Il Sung.The current ruler assumed control of the country shortly after his father, Kim Jong-Il, died in December 2011, and has accelerated the country's nuclear and missile programs.The Associated Press contributed to this story.
Obama called for jury duty in Chicago:::::Former President Barack Obama may have thought hed be taking a long break from public service when he left the White House in January.But it seems Obama might have at least one more job: He has been called for jury duty in Chicago.Cook County, Ill., Chief Judge Tim Evans told county commissioners during a budget hearing Friday that Obama, who owns homes in Washington, D.C., and Chicago's Kenwood neighborhood, is scheduled to serve in November.The former president is registered to vote in Chicago.Evans said security for Obama would be uppermost in our minds when the former presidents service begins.Those called can be put either in the pool for criminal case or civil hearings.They can be called to any of the county's Chicago or suburban courthouses.All jurors watch a decades-old video about their duties narrated by a mustachioed Lester Holt, once a local news reader and now anchor of NBC Nightly News.Jurors in Cook County are paid $17.20 for each day of service.
Conservative website funded initial Fusion GPS Trump opposition effort:::::Fusion GPS was initially hired by the conservative Washington Free Beacon website to conduct opposition research into then-candidate Donald Trump and other GOP contenders for the White House, it was revealed late Friday.Free Beacon editor-in-chief Matthew Continetti and chairman Michael Goldfarb said in a statement that the publication had retained Fusion GPS to "provide research on multiple candidates in the [2016] Republican presidential primary," as well as Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.Continetti and Goldfarb denied that the Free Beacon "had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele," the former British spy who compiled the now-infamous Trump-Russia dossier.The file, which was published by BuzzFeed in January, contained unverified and lurid allegations about dirt the Russians had on then-candidate Donald Trump and his campaigns possible connections to Moscow.Free Beacon's connection with Fusion GPS was first reported by the Washington Examiner.According to the Examiner's report, lawyers for the Free Beacon told the House Intelligence Committee that the website funded the research between the fall of 2015 and the spring of 2016.At some point after that, Fusion GPS was retained by Mark Elias, an attorney representing the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.Fusion GPS hired Steele after the Free Beacon left the project.Committee spokesman Jack Langer told Fox News that the Free Beacon "has issued a statement asserting that it had no involvement with Christopher Steele or the dossier he compiled from Russian sources.The Beacon has agreed to cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee to help the Committee verify this assertion."Earlier this week, the Washington Post reported that the Clinton campaign and the DNC paid more than $9 million to Elias firm, Perkins Coie, which, in turn, retained the political consultants who commissioned the research.But its unclear how much of that $9 million went toward the dossier.And its unclear who exactly at the Clinton campaign and DNC might have known how it was being spent.In their statement, Continetti and Goldfarb denied having any knowledge "of the relationship between Fusion GPS and the Democratic National Committee, Perkins Coie, and the Clinton campaign.""We stand by our reporting, and we do not apologize for our methods," they added."We consider it our duty to report verifiable information, not falsehoods or slander, and we believe that commitment has been well demonstrated by the quality of the journalism that we produce."The Washington Free Beacon was initially founded as a project of the conservative nonprofit group Center for American Freedom, as an alternative to liberal news sites run by progressive nonprofits.The Center for American Freedom was organized as a 501(c)4 and did not reveal its donors, but a person close to Goldfarb said Singer was an early backer of the project.Later, the Free Beacon was spun-off into a for-profit website.Goldfarb was deputy communications director on John McCain's presidential campaign.Singer has been a major player in Republican politics in recent years and maintains ties to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and several powerful Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan.A representative to Singer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Singer was backing Rubio's presidential bid at the time of the Free Beacon's involvement.Rubio's team insisted this week that they had no knowledge of the dossier.Singer's close associate Dan Senor also served as Speaker Ryan's chief adviser during the 2012 president campaign.Fox News' Brooke Singman and the Associated Press contributed to this report.
Trump is leaning toward Jay Powell for next Fed chair, but remains undecided: Source:::::President Donald Trump is leaning toward naming Jerome "Jay" Powell as Fed chair but remains undecided, a source told CNBC.For weeks, Powell has been considered the front-runner for the job as the president considers who will steward the central bank when Janet Yellen's term expires in February.However, the competition has turned into a derby in which various candidates have moved to the front only to get pushed back in the wake of news developments.On Saturday, a source also told The Wall street Journal that Powell was Trump's likely pick for the Fed chairmanship.Powell, a current Fed governor, has the advantage of presenting Trump with a chance to break from the Yellen Fed yet maintain many of the same policies that have kept the stock market rally intact and interest rates low."If Trump believes Yellen's approach is best for keeping market levels growing, he is going to seek a Fed chair who can carry on her mantle but under the Trump brand.The best non-Yellen Yellen is Powell," Beacon Policy Advisors said in a report Friday morning.Powell was appointed to the Fed in 2012 to fill an unexpired term that won't end until 2028.He has emerged as a compromise candidate as Trump considers reappointing Yellen or moving to a starker alternative like Stanford economist John Taylor, who would be expected to push for higher rates and a faster reduction in the Fed's $4.5 trillion balance sheet.The president has praised Yellen in recent days, but the chance to make a break from the past could prove too enticing."Given the president's propensity for comparing himself against President Obama and seeking to continually undercut his legacy, choosing the Obama-appointed Yellen for another term would not give Trump the satisfaction of leaving his own mark on the Federal Reserve," the Beacon noted added."Some Senate Republicans are making grumblings about Powell and his allegiance with Yellen's decision making while at the Fed, however, Senate Republicans will not obstruct a Trump nomination of Powell."Trump previously has indicated he will make a choice before he leaves on his next foreign trip next Friday.
Rep. Kevin Brady says lawmakers considering raising 401(k) contribution limit:::::Lawmakers are considering increasing the contribution limit for a popular retirement savings plan, CNBC has learned.CNBC has confirmed that lawmakers are now looking at raising the 401(k) contribution limit to $20,000 or more.That is a reversal from earlier reports that lawmakers were considering reducing that tax-deductible amount to as low as $2,400.Earlier, top House tax writer Rep. Kevin Brady said that he would like changes to "help people save more, sooner."The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee said he has talked to President Donald Trump twice this week about 401(k)s. "He'd like to raise the limits so people can save more in those plans.So do I. I think that's a good start," Brady said.Under current law, taxpayers can put a specified amount in 401(k) retirement savings plans without paying taxes upfront.Lowering the amount could help to raise tax revenue as the GOP looks for ways to offset across-the-board individual and corporate tax cuts.The amount workers can contribute to a 401(k) rises to $18,500 next year, up from $18,000 in 2017.People age 50 and older can tack on a so-called catch-up contribution of $6,000.Potential changes to the popular retirement savings have been all over the map.On Monday, Trump emphatically tweeted that "there will be NO change to your 401(k)."He called the 401(k) tax benefit a "great and popular middle class tax break that works."But on Wednesday afternoon, the president appeared to back off that tweet, calling 401(k) plans "very important."Trump said he didn't want a proposal to change them to "go too far."CNBC's Ylan Mui and Jacob Pramuk contributed to this report.
The only thing growing faster than the economy is our deficit:::::"These projections foreshadow another period of trillion-dollar deficits at a time when the United States has experienced one of the longest continuous economic expansions in history and an unemployment rate of 4.5 percent," the center's analysis concludes.Noting deficit trends since 1980, the analysis adds that the nation "has piled up debt more than twice as fast as economic growth."In January, the CBO projected a fiscal 2018 deficit of $48 billion, rising to $1 trillion by 2023.Over the 10-year period from 2018-2027, it forecast deficits totaling $9.4-trillion.By June, the CBO revised all those numbers to reflect more-than-expected red ink.It pegged the 2018 deficit at $563 billion, a $1.02 trillion deficit in 2022, and 10-year deficits of $10.1-trillion.The Bipartisan Policy Center analysis updates those projections.It assumes $200 billion over 10 years for the costs of recent wildfires, hurricane damage and flooding.And it folds in the $1.5 trillion in higher deficits allowed by the new budget resolution Congress has passed to smooth the way for tax cuts.The $1 trillion deficit level held symbolic power for Republicans during President Barack Obama's tenure.They used the prospect of "trillion-dollar deficits as far as the eye can see" to win back the House in 2010 and force a Democratic administration into contentious budget negotiations.A GOP-controlled Congress has since eased the spending caps that resulted from those budget talks.House conservatives pushed for new spending cuts in the 2018 budget resolution but abandoned them under pressure from the Senate.The question now is whether the $1 trillion figure still has symbolic power as it shadows a Republican drive to cut taxes.A former GOP staff director at the Senate Budget Committee, who helped produce the new deficit analysis, hopes so but doesn't expect it."I'm afraid not," said Steve Bell, who is now at the Bipartisan Policy Center."What you're hearing from me is the last squawk of a dying deficit hawk."
New White House report predicts corporate tax cuts will boost GDP by 3 to 5 percent:::::President Donald Trump's Council of Economic Advisers on Friday released the second in a series of reports on how proposed changes to the tax code could influence economic growth.The CEA predicted that corporate tax cuts alone would produce GDP growth of between 3 and 5 percent in as little as three years.The cuts are part of the tax reform package currently being finalized in Congress and expected to be unveiled as a bill next week.From the report: "Our findings indicate that the business side of the Unified Framework would increase GDP by between 3 and 5 percent over the baseline long-run projection.The GDP effects we estimate are growth impacts from corporate tax reform alone.The literature and models vary as to the timeframe over which these benefits could be realized; some have the effects as soon as 3 to 5 years, others find it could take at least double that time.There will be additional GDP effects from reforms to individual income and pass-through business taxes, which we have not modeled."On a call with reporters Friday, CEA Chairman Kevin Hassett said he was optimistic that the Trump administration's current budget proposal, combined with corporate tax cuts, would create enough growth to make overall tax cuts revenue neutral once they were fully implemented into the economy."We want to help the middle class get the raise it deserves, and the best way to keep the economy going and to knock it out of the low growth of past decades is to do something to give it a boost in the arm, and that's tax reform, regulatory reform and infrastructure," Hasset said."That's corporate tax reform in particular, that defeats the offshoring model and encourages firms to locate their activity back here in the United States."Hassett acknowledged that CEA's models would likely be impacted by the results of ongoing negotiations on Capitol Hill to finalize the tax reform bill."We modeled the corporate side with the details available.We really need to know where the individual brackets are and how that relates to income distribution," he said.Hassett also emphasized the dual importance of cutting the statutory corporate tax rate and easing the repatriation of funds U.S. companies hold overseas."Our current tax code incentivizes this shell game, and massively increases our trade deficit," Hassett said of the practice known as offshoring.By reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, "firms will have much less incentive to play this round-trip game."Hassett's predictions about corporate profits and wage growth have already come under scrutiny from some economists, who argue that the administration is drawing conclusions about growth that are not backed up by historical or empirical evidence.Former Clinton administration Treasury Secretary Larry Summers recently wrote in a blog post that the Trump administration's predictions linking wage growth and corporate tax cuts are "some combination of dishonest, incompetent and absurd."Read the entire report below.
US drug overdose deaths topped 60,000 in 2016, with more potent illicit drug use on the rise:::::Potent synthetic opioids such as fentanyl have already accelerated the number of deaths from drug overdose in the U.S. in recent years.And now, even stronger versions may make the opioid crisis in the U.S. even worse, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Deaths from drug overdose in this country exceeded 60,000 last year, partially driven by a fivefold increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, according to data released Friday.And analogs of fentanyl, such as carfentanil used to tranquilize large animals were increasingly implicated in overdose deaths, particularly in Eastern states, according to the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.Often the substances were found along with illicit drugs such as heroin and cocaine, raising a concern that these more potent drugs "have become a part of illicit opioid markets in multiple states," the authors wrote."Because of its extreme potency, even limited circulation of carfentanil could markedly increase the number of fatal overdoses," they said.Already the numbers are staggering, driven since 2013 by the introduction of fentanyl into the market for heroin, the CDC said.Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine; carfentanil is estimated to be 10,000 times more potent than morphine.Other fentanyl analogs are thought to be less potent.The variability can lead to disaster."The increased mixing or co-use of fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, and varying fentanyl analogs might contribute to increased risk for overdose because persons misusing opioids and other drugs are exposed to drug products with substantially varied potency," the report authors wrote.The data show that the number of overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids rose to 20,000 last year, from 3,105 in 2013.The report examined data from 10 states, using information from death certificates and coroner reports, in addition to information from death scene investigations and results of forensic toxicology testing.The CDC said this is the first report to use "toxicologic and scene evidence from multiple states to characterize opioid overdose deaths."There were about 700 deaths in which fentanyl analogs were involved."This finding raises concern that in the near future, fentanyl analog overdose deaths might mirror the rapidly rising trajectory of fentanyl overdose deaths that began in 2013 and become a major factor in opioid overdose deaths," the authors wrote.They say the CDC has expanded the number of states participating in its Enhanced State Opioid Overdose Surveillance program to 32 and Washington, D.C., from the 10 included in this report, and increased funding to improve forensic toxicologic testing.The authors also said measures should be taken to address the growing number of opioid overdose deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, including increasing access to medication-assisted treatment a move also endorsed this week by Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and increasing availability of the overdose-reversal drug naloxone.
Ex-US ambassador: Trump has gotten China to do more on North Korea than any American president:::::Former ambassador: Trump needs to get China to turn up heat on North Korea 8:22 AM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 | 02:56 President Donald Trump, in unprecedented fashion, has been able to get the Chinese government to turn the screws on North Korea in hopes of getting Kim Jong Un to halt military provocations, according to a former diplomat who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents."The Chinese have done more under President Trump's prodding than any other American president.They signed on to the UN sanctions.There are now individual Chinese sanctions; the central bank governors instructed banks in China to wind up loans to North Korea," Nicholas Burns told CNBC on Friday.He appeared on "Squawk Box," a week before Trump embarks on a trip to Asia, which includes stops in China and South Korea."The Chinese are clearly frustrated with the North Koreans.The Chinese don't want a war on the Korean Peninsula.They want trade," said Burns, who served as U.S. ambassador to NATO and was the State Department's third-ranking official during George W. Bush's presidency.He also advised the administrations of George H.W.Bush and Bill Clinton.Chinese President Xi Jinping, who was just given a major governing mandate, will be "eager to cooperate" with Trump, said Burns, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government."The president [Trump] has obviously gone slow on any kind of major [trade] sanctions against China because he's prioritizing the North Korean issue.The Chinese understand that."
Trump responds to California billionaire urging impeachment:::::President Donald Trump is responding to a California billionaire who has vowed to spend at least $10 million in advertising calling for the president's impeachment.Trump is using Twitter to call Tom Steyer "wacky & totally unhinged."He says Steyer "has been fighting me and my Make America Great Again agenda from the beginning," adding the billionaire environmentalist "never wins elections!"Steyer recently launched the advertising, which has been running on Fox News and other national outlets, arguing that Trump should be ousted from office.Steyer contends Trump is pushing the U.S. toward a nuclear war, is obstructing justice at the FBI and threatening to shut down news organizations he doesn't like.Steyer wants viewers to call their members of Congress and tell them to bring articles of impeachment.
Mattis talks diplomacy on North Korea ahead of Trump's Asia tour:::::U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis emphasized diplomatic efforts instead of military ones to resolve the crisis with North Korea as he stood at the tense and heavily-fortified border between North and South on Friday, saying: "Our goal is not war."His remarks came before U.S. President Donald Trump who has threatened to destroy the North, if necessary leaves on his first trip to Asia next week.His tour will include a stop in South Korea to meet President Moon Jae-in.Moon, after talks with Mattis, said the "aggressive deployment" of U.S. strategic assets on the Korean peninsula had been effective in deterring the threat from North Korea.Separately, North Korea said it will release on Friday a South Korean fishing boat that was found to be in North Korean waters illegally, state media said, as the U.S. defense secretary visited the border dividing the Korean peninsula.The tension between North Korea and the United States has been building after a series of weapons tests by Pyongyang and bellicose verbal exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, stoking fears any miscalculation could lead to an armed confrontation."North Korean provocations continue to threaten regional and global security despite unanimous condemnation by the United Nations Security Council," Mattis said in prepared remarks as he visited the demilitarized zone (DMZ)."As Secretary of State Tillerson has made clear, our goal is not war, but rather the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."Standing alongside Mattis, South Korean Defence Minister Song Young-moo said: "We together will continue to defend peace through strong will and strong might."The proposed return of the South Korean fishing boat and its crew would avoid potentially worsening already strained relations between Pyongyang and South Korea and its U.S. ally.The South Korean fishing boat was seized on Oct. 21 and investigation by the North found the boat and crew entered North Korean waters for fishing, state news agency KCNA reported.North Korea decided to release the boat after "taking into account the fact that all the crewmen honestly admitted their offense, repeatedly apologizing and asking for leniency," the report said in English.The vessel and its crew would be released in waters at the military boundary between the two Koreas, which are still technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.North Korean fishing boats have at times been found drifting south of the maritime border between the two Koreas, often having run out of fuel or broken down.Most North Korean crew are released to the North after interrogations by intelligence officials if they wish to return.It is more unusual for South Korean fishing vessels to be found in similar circumstances.A South Korean Unification Ministry official said it was aware the fishing boat had gone missing earlier in the week.The crew of 10, including seven South Koreans and three Vietnamese, would be questioned by officials on their return, he added.
British newspaper got anonymous call 25 minutes before JFK assassination:::::LONDON Twenty-five minutes before John F. Kennedy was assassinated, a British newspaper received an anonymous tip about "some big news" in the United States, according to the trove of more than 2,800 documents released late Thursday by the National Archives.The mystery call was made to a senior reporter at the Cambridge News, a paper that serves the East Anglia area of eastern England, on Nov. 22, 1963, at 6:05 p.m. local time.Kennedy was shot shortly afterward, as he rode in a presidential motorcade in Dallas, Texas, at 12:30 a.m. CST.Dallas is six hours behind Britain."The caller said only that the Cambridge News reporter should call the American Embassy in London for some big news and then hung up," the memo, from the FBI's deputy director James Angleton to J. Edgar Hoover, its director, said.The revelation, one of many that emerged from the planned release of the Kennedy assassination documents so far, there's no smoking guns adds to the raft of conspiracy theories surrounding his death.In fact, the memo was first released in July, but went unreported until the cache of files was released Thursday.More from USA Today: JFK files: Highlights from 2,800 previously classified records With JFK files open, students say open civil rights cold case files, too Trump withholds others due to national security concerns The memo, dated Nov. 26, 1963, says: "After the word of the President's death was received the reporter informed the Cambridge police of the anonymous call, and the police informed MI5.The important point is that the call was made, according to MI5 calculations, about 25 minutes before the President was shot.The Cambridge reporter had never received a call of this kind before, and MI5 state that he is known to them as a sound and loyal person with no security record."The reporter's name was not mentioned in the memo, which adds that Britain's MI5 security services had received "similar anonymous phone calls of a strangely coincidental nature."The Cambridge Newsnoted in a story Friday that it too did not know the name of the reporter who took the call, although it said the existence of the memo was first discovered by a lawyer, Michael Eddowes, who devoted much of his life to investigating the mystery surrounding Kennedy's death.Eddowes, who died in 1992, told the Cambridge News in 1981 that he believed the anonymous caller was a British-born Soviet agent named Albert Osborne.Two months before Kennedy's assassination, Eddowes believed that Osborne, who also apparently used the alias John Howard Bowen, had befriended Lee Harvey Oswald, the man ultimately charged with murdering Kennedy.Eddowes' theory was that the call was made "because the Soviet Union was eager that the assassination should be seen as a conspiracy," according to the paper.
Putin oversees test fire of four nuclear-capable ballistic missiles:::::Russian President Vladimir Putin personally oversaw the launch of four nuclear-capable ballistic missiles as part of a test for Moscow's strategic nuclear forces, according to the Kremlin.The training exercise, which was conducted Thursday evening, included the testing of land, air and submarine-based ballistic missiles, Russia's defense ministry said in a statement.A Topol intercontinental ballistic missile was tested from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia, hitting a target thousands of miles away at a military testing range on the Kamchatka Peninsula.Three other intercontinental-range ballistic missiles were launched from nuclear-powered submarines."The training assignments were accomplished in full and all the practice targets were successfully destroyed," the ministry said.In a tweet at 7:09 p.m. London time (2:09 p.m.ET) on Thursday, Russia's defense ministry posted a video that appeared to show the nuclear-capable ballistic missile tests.Last month, Russia launched two intercontinental missiles in the space of two weeks amid escalating geopolitical tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
The US is operating three carriers in the Pacific for the first time in a decade:::::The Navy has three carrier strike groups currently in the Pacific where North Korea's nuclear saber rattling has the U.S. and its Asian allies keeping a close watch on the pariah state.The last time the Navy operated three carriers together in the Pacific Fleet was back in 2007, and the current show of force comes just before an upcoming state visit to South Korea by President Donald Trump."Three carrier groups is certainly a robust force," said Dean Cheng, a defense expert and senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based conservative think tank.Defense experts say the carrier-based aircraft has the ability to perform a preemptive strike against North Korea and fleet escort ships could fire cruise missiles.The North's new air-defense system, though, might be capable of intercepting the military aircraft and missiles."This gives us the ability to actually do something as opposed to other kinds of military-symbolic gestures," said Denny Roy, an Asia Pacific security expert and senior fellow at the East-West Center, a think tank in Honolulu.In the past, he said, the U.S. has tended to use symbolic flights of aircraft along the border or sending a single ship near North Korea.The carrier power in the Pacific comes as the Pentagon's top general Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is in South Korea to meet with leaders of South Korea's military "to examine strategies, plans and means needed to deter any North Korean aggression," according to the Department of Defense.
Obamacare insurers were on track to break even, analysis says:::::Obamacare health plans "were on track to break even or make modest profits" on average in 2017 before the Trump administration decided this month to end reimbursement payments to insurers, a new report says.The analysis also said prices for Obamacare plans next year likely would have risen by just mid-to-high-single-digit percentage points on average if President Donald Trump had not for months threatened to end those payments, and if Republicans in Congress had not repeatedly tried to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act in 2017.Instead, because of the lack of a "stable policy environment," the average price of the most popular type of Obamacare plan is rising by an average of 34 percent in most of the United States next year, the analysis said.The report also found that the individual health plan market's "risk pool" or mix of customers whose premiums are supposed to more than offset their respective health benefit costs was not weakened by price hikes for Obamacare plans in 2017.In other words, those premium increases did not "drive many healthy enrollees from the individual market," the analysis found.The report issued Friday was written Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in the Brookings Institution's Economic Studies Program.Fiedler's research was conducted as part of the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy.It comes less than a week before next Wednesday's start of open enrollment in Obamacare plans.Fiedler, in an interview with CNBC, said his analysis shows that "after a rocky start, this market was really on a path to stabilize."He also said that "it's important for people to understand that what we're seeing here" with sharply higher premium prices "is not an inherent feature of this market, but a consequence of a conscious policy choice."Both points are disputed by the Trump adminstration, which claims that Obamacare has inherent flaws that are leading to high premium prices for consumers, and to insurers exiting individual health plan marketplaces.In an interview Monday with WKYC-TV in Cleveland, Seema Verma, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said, "There's a lot of problems with the Affordable Care Act that I think are creating barriers for people to get affordable, accessible coverage.""We had the same problem last year before the Trump administration came here," Verma said."If you look at last year, look at the headlines: a number of insurers leaving the marketplace, we saw double-digit increases.That's exactly the same thing that we're having here," she said."Those problems existed before and that's because the Affordable Care Act's fundamental structure isn't working, so the exact same issues happened last year as well."But according to his report, Fiedler's analysis "estimates that insurers were on track to incur small losses averaging 0.4 percent of premium revenue on [Obamacare]-compliant plans in 2017 before the Trump Administration ended cost-sharing reduction payments for the final quarter of the year."And the report adds there is reason to believe that the data Fiedler analyzed "may systematically understate insurers' actual financial performance, suggesting that insurers were, in fact, on track to make modest profits" on Obamacare plans on average nationwide this year.The Trump administration on Oct. 12 said it would no longer pay Obamacare insurers reimbursements for discounts that those insurers offer to low-income customers in their out-of-pocket health costs.Those discounts must continued to be offered by law.But the Trump administration said the reimbursements for their costs to insurers had to be discontinued, because Congress never directly appropriated the money.Because of threats to cut off that money in the past year, many insurers had raised their prices more sharply for 2018 plans than they otherwise would have.A coalition of 18 states and the District of Columbia is suing the administration to compel restoration of the payments, which would be worth an estimated $10 billion to insurers next year.A federal judge in California on Wednesday rejected an emergency request to restore the payments temporarily while that case proceeds.
US publishes thousands of previously secret documents about JFK assassination:::::There are approximately 5 million pages of documents about Kennedy's 1963 assassination and the vast majority has been publicly available since the late 1990s.But President Donald Trump blocked the release of certain files on Thursday, placing them under a six-month review."I have no choice," he said in a memo, according to White House officials."Additional records will be released subject to redactions recommended by the executive offices and agencies," the National Archives said in a statement on Thursday, adding that it would process those records as soon as possible on a rolling basis.No major insights are expected from the latest trove.The Associated Press contributed to this report
Trump holding back some JFK files, releasing others:::::President Donald Trump acted Thursday to block the release of hundreds of records on the John F. Kennedy assassination, bending to CIA and FBI appeals to keep those secrets."I have no choice," Trump said in a memo, according to White House officials.He was placing those files under a six-month review while letting 2,800 other records come out Thursday evening, racing a deadline to honor a law mandating their release.Officials say Trump will impress upon federal agencies that JFK files should stay secret after the six-month review "only in the rarest cases."Much of Thursday passed with nothing from the White House or National Archives except silence, leaving unclear how the government would comply with a law requiring the records to come out by the end of the day unless Trump had been persuaded by intelligence agencies to hold some back.White House officials said the FBI and CIA made the most requests within the government to withhold some information.No blockbusters had been expected in the last trove of secret files regarding Kennedy's assassination Nov. 22, 1963, given a statement months ago by the Archives that it assumed the records, then under preparation, would be "tangential" to what's known about the killing.But for historians, it's a chance to answer lingering questions, put some unfounded conspiracy theories to rest, perhaps give life to other theories or none of that, if the material adds little to the record.Researchers were frustrated by the uncertainty that surrounded the release for much of the day."The government has had 25 yearswith a known end-dateto prepare #JFKfiles for release," University of Virginia historian Larry Sabato tweeted in the afternoon."Deadline is here.Chaos."Asked what he meant, Sabato emailed to say: "Contradictory signals were given all day.Trump's tweets led us to believe that disclosure was ready to go.Everybody outside government was ready to move quickly."Trump had been a bit coy about the scheduled release on the eve of it, tweeting: " The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow.So interesting!"Experts say the publication of the last trove of evidence could help allay suspicions of a conspiracy at least for some."As long as the government is withholding documents like these, it's going to fuel suspicion that there is a smoking gun out there about the Kennedy assassination," said Patrick Maney, a presidential historian at Boston College.The collection includes more than 3,100 records comprising hundreds of thousands of pages that have never been seen by the public.About 30,000 documents were released previously with redactions.Experts said intelligence agencies pushed Trump to keep some of the remaining materials secret the CIA didn't comment on that.Whatever details are released, they're not expected to give a definitive answer to a question that still lingers for some: Whether anyone other than Lee Harvey Oswald was involved in the assassination.The Warren Commission in 1964 reported that Oswald had been the lone gunman, and another congressional probe in 1979 found no evidence to support the theory that the CIA had been involved.But other interpretations, some more creative than others, have persisted.The 1992 law mandating release of the JFK documents states that all the files "shall be publicly disclosed in full" within 25 years that means by Thursday unless the president certifies that "continued postponement is made necessary by an identifiable harm to the military defense; intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations."That doesn't allow the president, for example, to hold some records back because they might be embarrassing to agencies or people."In any release of this size, there always are embarrassing details," said Douglas Brinkley, a professor at Rice University.The law does not specify penalties for noncompliance, saying only that House and Senate committees are responsible for oversight of the collection.
Trump declares the opioid epidemic a public health emergency:::::President Donald Trump on Thursday declared the nation's opioid epidemic a public health emergency, the first time since 2010 that the federal government has designated such an emergency nationwide.But the president stopped short of officially labeling the crisis -- which claimed the lives of 64,000 Americans in 2016 -- a state of national emergency."I'm officially declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency under federal law," Trump said at a White House event.Ending the epidemic "will require the resolve of our entire country," he said.Calling the crisis a "national shame and a human tragedy," Trump vowed to crack down on heroin imports from Mexico and fentanyl imports from China.He also pledged to use evidence-based addiction treatment, and to reduce drug use among young people through a national advertising campaign.The president also discussed his personal experience with addiction: Trump's brother, Fred Trump, died of complications from alcoholism."Fred was a great guy, and he would tell me, 'don't drink, don't drink.'He would constantly tell me this, over and over."Trump credits his brother's example with convincing him to never drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes.Trump singled out China, which exports an incredibly strong opioid, fentanyl, which officials believe is responsible for thousands of deaths.Trump also said he would raise the issue of fentanyl exports with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to the country early next week.He also pledged to go after companies that produce and distribute certain opioids wholesale to "pill mill" medical practices."We will be bringing some very major lawsuits against people and against companies that have been hurting our communities," he said.In a move reminiscent of the war on drugs in the 1980s, Trump also said clever advertising could play a major role in discouraging young people from using drugs."Our most important thing is going to be really, really great advertising, so people don't start and don't have to go through these problems," he said.The designation of a public health emergency would expand the ways that individuals can get treatment for opioid addiction, which could particularly benefit people in rural areas.The emergency declaration would also free up public health emergency funds at the Department of Health and Human Services, and grant individual states more flexibility in how they use federal dollars, and allow them to direct more funds toward addiction treatment and prevention.Labor Department grants known as National Dislocated Worker Grants would also be available to workers who cite opiate addiction as the reason they're applying for the grants.Those grants are typically only available to victims of natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires.
Paul Ryan is confident he can sweeten tax reform to win over GOP holdouts:::::"The Ways and Means Committee will be putting out a specific plan very shortly, and they're going to work with all of our members to look at and consider and address these concerns," Ryan told reporters Thursday."I believe that the Ways and Means Committee will be working with these members in particular to find a solution."Nearly all Republicans will get behind a bill to chop tax rates in an effort to spur economic growth.However, lawmakers have expressed concerns about other specific provisions in a tax framework released last month, most of which are intended to raise money.GOP leaders have called for scrapping state and local tax deductions, a popular provision that largely benefits high-tax blue states.Some lawmakers in the Northeast opposed the budget resolution, but they never truly imperiled its passage.Later Thursday, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, told reporters that a meeting with the Republicans in favor of state and local deductions did not yield a compromise."They made it clear.They need this problem solved before they vote 'yes' on tax reform," he said.Before the vote, the House Liberty Caucus, led by Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., also announced it would oppose what it called "wasteful" spending in the budget measure.The group raised concerns about deficits generated by it.The budget also allows for tax cuts to add up to $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over a decade.Ryan on Thursday described the budget as "really important" to passing tax reform.It unlocks budget reconciliation, which allows the Senate to pass a plan with only a simple majority, or at least 50 of 52 GOP votes with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a tie.Ryan did not answer questions about whether the House would make other controversial tweaks to the tax code, like changing the popular 401(k) contribution benefit.He deferred specific policy questions to the House Ways and Means Committee, the chamber's chief tax-writing panel.Brady said the House will introduce a bill on Wednesday and start committee deliberations on Nov. 6.CNBC's Christina Wilkie contributed to this report.
Billionaire Insys founder charged in US opioid bribe case:::::The billionaire founder of Insys Therapeutics was arrested on Thursday on charges that he participated in a scheme with other executives to bribe doctors to prescribe a fentanyl-based cancer pain drug and to defraud insurers.John Kapoor, 74, who stepped down as chief executive of Insys in January, was charged with having engaged in conspiracies to commit racketeering, mail fraud and wire fraud in an indictment filed in federal court in Boston.He was arrested in Arizona, where Insys is based, and added as a defendant in a previously filed case against six former Insys executives and managers, including former Chief Executive Michael Babich, prosecutors said.Brian Kelly, Kapoor's lawyer, said in an email: "My client is innocent and he intends to fight these charges vigorously."Insys, which has been in settlement talks with the U.S. Justice Department in connection with the probe, declined to comment.Its stock price fell 4.56 percent to $7.08 in midday trading on Thursday.The charges marked a major escalation of the ongoing investigations of Insys related to Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray that contains fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic opioid.Those probes have come amid a national opioid abuse epidemic.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were involved in over 33,000 deaths in 2015.The death rate has continued to rise, according to estimates.Kapoor, who founded Insys in 2002 and remains a board member, stepped down in January as the company's chairman and chief executive, a role he took on in November 2015.He is currently the chairman of drugmaker Akorn and president of investment firm EJ Financial Enterprises.According to the indictment, following the launch of Subsys in 2012, Kapoor and Babich grew dissatisfied with the drug's success in its initial three months on the market.It says they, with others, devised a scheme to pay bribes in the form of speaker fees and food and entertainment to medical practitioners to prescribe Subsys and to increase the dosage and volume of existing prescriptions.They also sought to mislead and defraud insurers who were reluctant to approve payment for Subsys when it was prescribed to patients who did not have cancer, the indictment said.
New sanctions on North Korea announced by the Treasury Department:::::New sanctions on North Korea announced by the Treasury Department 12:12 PM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 | 00:25 "Today's sanctions target the North Korean military and regime officials engaged in flagrant abuses of human rights.We also are targeting North Korean financial facilitators who attempt to keep the regime afloat with foreign currency earned through forced labor operations."The newly sanctioned parties include North Korean diplomats, military security officers and officials with state-owned construction companies.According to the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the DPRK's Military Security Command and two of its top officials, Jo Kyong-Chol and Sin Yong Il, will be put under sanction, as will Ri Thae Chol, the country's first vice minister of the Ministry of People's Security.The diplomats being sanctioned are Ku Sung Sop the consul general in Shenyang, China and Kim Min Chol, who works at the North Korean Embassy in Vietnam.The other targeted parties are connected to a system of North Korean construction companies that export labor overseas, often to work in slave-like conditions, the U.S. said.The country's External Construction Bureau and its director, Kim Kang Jin, will be sanctioned, as will the Ch'olhyo'n Overseas Construction Company.In September, the Treasury Department announced sanctions in against eight North Korean banks and 26 people linked to the country's financial networks.The actions come as the U.S. presses the communist dictatorship to end its nuclear weapons testing and missile launchings.
House narrowly passes budget, clearing the way for tax reform:::::Among the no votes from New York were Republican Reps. Peter King, Lee Zeldin, John Faso, Elise Stefanik and John Katko; noes from New Jersey included Reps. Frank LoBiondo, Tom MacArthur and Leonard Lance.These members hoped that by stalling the tax-reform process, they might gain enough leverage to protect a popular deduction for state and local taxes, known as the SALT write-off.The current GOP tax framework calls for eliminating the SALT deduction to help pay for the tax cuts.But this would likely have a disproportionate impact on middle-income taxpayers in places like New York, New Jersey and California, and as of late Wednesday, it was still unclear how many of the 30 Republicans who represent high-tax states would vote against the budget."Why should I vote for something that would end up decimating my district?"King told Reuters on Wednesday.Also among the no votes were some of the most fiscally conservative members of the House Republican caucus, who were concerned that the budget contained too much spending.Shortly before the vote, the House Liberty Caucus released a statement opposing the budget.With the budget vote out of the way, Republicans must now move on to the brass tacks phase of reforming the tax code.Shortly after the vote on Thursday, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Calif., announced that a tax reform bill would be formally introduced on Wednesday, with a markup in his committee slated to begin Nov. 6."Today is a historic day, and we are ready to deliver tax relief that improves the lives of middle income Americans and struggling families who have been left behind in our slow-growing economy," Brady said in a statement.
The Fed chair contest is Trump's version of 'The Bachelor':::::Like pretty much every big personnel call in this White House, President Donald Trump has turned his selection of a Federal Reserve chair into a version of "The Bachelor" with everyone feverishly guessing who will get the role of leading the world's most important central bank.Trump has gone so far as to solicit advice from Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs in a televised interview."Tell me who your preference is," Trump asked Dobbs."I'd love to hear it.You could even cut it out if you want.You don't have to I would love to hear you.I only want that from people I respect."Dobbs went on to suggest keeping Janet Yellen, something that I'm told is at least somewhat attractive to Trump given that markets love the current chair and would likely react favorably to her status quo renomination.But a source who talks to the president regularly about the Fed and other economic matters tells me that while Trump does like Yellen, he is not going to renominate her because he wants to put his own mark on the central bank something the president also suggested to Dobbs.Just after this conversation, another senior source close to the Fed nomination process cautioned me not to rule Yellen or anyone else out."He changes his mind about it every day," this person said.But a consensus among people close to the process has emerged that the race is likely down to either current Fed Governor Jerome "Jay" Powell or Stanford economist John Taylor.Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh sparked increasing speculation after a meeting last week with Vice President Mike Pence.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is pushing against Warsh and in favor of Powell, whom he got to know in recent months working on financial reform issues.National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn has been mostly out of the running for weeks now both because of his clash with Trump over the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and because the president wants the former Goldman Sachs president to keep working on the high-stakes tax cut push.An announcement on the Fed chair pick could come any day, but sources close to the matter say it will most likely happen next week before the president departs for a 12-day trip to Asia.Even that is not assured, however.If Trump can't make up his mind, the announcement could wait until he gets back.The Senate needs to have hearings before the Banking Committee and a full vote prior to Yellen's term expiring on Feb. 3.Ideally, the process of sending up the next nominee would start soon.The Senate can move quickly when it wants to it's basically up to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell so next week is really not a hard deadline for the president.The arguments favoring a Powell chairmanship include that it would allow Trump to install his own pick while also likely continuing the very modest approach to rate normalization and balance sheet drawdown initiated by the Yellen Fed.Taylor, while much more beloved by conservatives on the Hill and places like The Wall Street Journal editorial board, would present at least something more of a hawkish risk that might spark jitters on Wall Street.Some conservatives on Capitol Hill have led a behind-the-scenes campaign against Powell and in favor of Taylor or Warsh.But it's not clear that those efforts will produce results, especially given that Trump generally does whatever he wants with limited regard for what Republicans in Congress say.And Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., is among the few on record arguing against Powell.Taylor won a straw poll when Trump met with Senate Republicans earlier this week and quizzed them on their Fed preference, but there is very little chance many would vote "no" if Trump actually sends up a Powell nomination.And Powell is a former banker rather than a wonky economist like Taylor, a style Trump tends to prefer in his nominees.So the betting line remains on Powell for chair and perhaps Taylor for vice chair, if he is willing.Heavy caveats continue to apply.Trump could change his mind at the last minute and turn the process on its head, possibly even electing to simply stick with Yellen, though that remains unlikely.The rose is still up for grabs.Ben White is Politico's chief economic correspondent and a CNBC contributor.He also authors the daily tip sheet Politico Morning Money [politico.com/morningmoney].Follow him on Twitter @morningmoneyben.
Trump apparently is having a hard time making up his mind for Fed chair:::::'Nobody has been ruled out' for Fed chair -Senior administration official 3:42 PM ET Wed, 25 Oct 2017 | 02:58 The race to see who will lead the Federal Reserve in 2018 and beyond is becoming a process of elimination, with two and perhaps three candidates remaining.President Donald Trump apparently has solidified his thinking and is now choosing between Fed Governor Jerome "Jay" Powell and Stanford economist John Taylor.However, several twists have been interjected into the equation."Trump changes his mind about it everyday," a source told Politico, according to a report posted Thursday.The site speculated that current Chair Janet Yellen remains in the mix because Trump is worried that removing her might disrupt the hardy stock market rally that has taken place since his election.The Dow industrials have surged more than 30 percent from the low just a couple days before the Nov. 8 election.However, one source reportedly close to Trump did tell Politico that Yellen was out of the race completely.The report adds further detail on how the process has unfolded.Former Governor Kevin Warsh, once considered a favorite for the job, has fallen out of favor, perhaps because of a long-simmering feud he has had with recently appointed Governor Randal Quarles, according to a Bloomberg report that Politico cited.Meanwhile, Keith Hennessey, a former advisor to President George W. Bush, is backing Warsh.Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic advisor, also has been ruled out in a number of reports, though an administration official told CNBC otherwise.And Trump added to the strangeness of the process when he asked Lou Dobbs, a host on Fox Business, whom he thought the president should appoint.That comes just a few days after Trump asked members of the GOP leadership for a show of hands on what they thought he should do.Dobbs said he thought Yellen was worth considering for reappointment."We're obviously doing very well together if you look at the markets," Trump said on the show.CNBC has reached out to those involved for comment.Read the full Politico report here.
Corker: Some items in tax bill are just buying off special interests:::::Senator Bob Corker says some tax efforts are ridiculous 10:58 AM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 | 02:02 Some of the items in the GOP tax reform discussion are just "buying off" special interests and serve no other purpose, Republican Sen. Bob Corker told CNBC on Thursday."Some of the things we're doing, I'm sorry, are ridiculous," Corker told "Squawk Box," though he did not mention any specifics."I'm sorry, but we live in a political world," said Corker, a member on the Senate Budget and Banking committees.Those things are "not going to drive 1 ounce of economic growth.But it's what you have to do to pass a tax bill."Corker described some efforts to pass tax reform as "unfortunate.""It's buying off of people to pass tax reform," Corker said."We could take a lot of this off in the trash can and make it easier and actually do something that grows our economy and increases our wages," he said.President Donald Trump and the GOP have been pushing for a major overhaul to the U.S. tax code.They believe tax relief would give the current economy a boost.House Republicans on Thursday narrowly approved a budget deal, a crucial step toward passing tax cuts later this year.Corker, who has been highly critical of Trump, told CNBC that despite his war of words with the president he's "all in" on tax reform.Corker is not seeking reelection.The Tennessee Republican said he wants to "go out with afterburners trying to make things happen."
Sen. Bob Corker: Criticism of Trump will 'absolutely not' affect my tax-reform vote:::::Sen. Bob Corker: Some of the 'ridiculous' things in tax reform are just 'buying off' lawmakers to pass it 11:18 AM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 | 00:50 Sen. Bob Corker told CNBC on Thursday his sharp criticism of President Donald Trump's fitness for office will "absolutely not" influence his vote on tax reform.The Tennessee Republican described himself as "all in" on the GOP effort to overhaul the tax system, regardless of his feelings on the president's competence."This tax reform is our agenda, it's the Republican Senate agenda," Corker said in a "Squawk Box" interview."It would be like somebody in your listening audience representing their company, sitting across the table from someone they may have a low regard for, but are they going do something that's going to damage their company because of that?Absolutely not."The spat between Corker and Trump erupted anew on Tuesday, when Trump unleashed a blistering string of tweets following the senator's assertion that the White House should "step aside" and let Congress handle writing the tax bill.Later responding to Trump, Corker said the claims in the president's tweets were untrue.He said Trump "debases our country" and will not "rise to the occasion as president."
Trump to declare public health emergency for opioids, a partial measure to fight drug epidemic:::::WASHINGTON President Trump will order his health secretary to declare the opioid crisis a public health emergency Thursday but will stop short of declaring a more sweeping state of national emergency, aides said.In an address from the White House, Trump will also try to rally the nation to a growing epidemic that claimed 64,000 American lives last year, and will advocate for a sustained national effort to end to the addiction crisis."Drug demand and opioid misuse is the crisis next door," said Kellyanne Conway, a senior counselor to the president, previewing the tone of Trump's speech Wednesday."This is no longer someone else's co-worker, someone else's community, someone else's kid.Drug use knows no geographic boundaries or demographic differences."More from USA Today: FDA chief supports opioid prescription limits, regrets agency's prior inaction Trump says he'll declare opioid crisis a national emergency.Here's what that could mean As he chairs Trump's opioid commission, Christie champions his home-state drug companies To respond to that crisis, Trump will sign a presidential memorandum ordering Acting Secretary of Health and Human Services Eric Hargan to waive regulations and give states more flexibility in how they use federal funds, said four senior officials responsible for crafting the administration's new opioid policy.The officials previewed the action to USA TODAY on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak ahead of the president's announcement.Trump first promised to declare a national emergency to combat the crisis on Aug. 10, and repeated that pledge last week.Speaking to reporters on the south lawn of the White House Wednesday, Trump touted a "big meeting" on opioids, and said a national emergency "gives us power to do things that you can't do right now."But there's a legal distinction between a public health emergency, which the secretary of Health can declare under the Public Health Services Act, and a presidential emergency under the National Emergencies Act.The latter is what the president's own opioid commission recommended in July.Declaring a state of national emergency would give the president even more power to waive privacy laws and Medicare regulations to increase the number of beds available to treat substance abuse.Those facilities are now limited to 16 beds.James Hodge, a law professor at Arizona State University, said a "dual declaration" using both laws would make a larger difference, but that any emergency would be a welcome response to the crisis.Trump's decision to go with a more measured response, a public health emergency, demonstrates the complexity of an opioid crisis that continues to grow through an ever-evolving cycle of addiction, from prescription pain pills to illegal heroin to the lethal fentanyl.But the legal powers Trump is invoking were designed for a short-term emergencies like disasters and infectious diseases.
New screenings begins for passengers on US-bound flights:::::New security screenings for all passengers on U.S.-bound flights began on Thursday, with airlines worldwide questioning flyers about their trip and their luggage in the latest Trump administration decision affecting global travel.However, confusion still remains about the new regulations, which come at the end of a 120-day period following the United States lifting a ban on laptops in airplane cabins affecting 10 Mideast cities.The new regulations cover all the 2,100 flights from around the world entering the U.S. on any given day.Some airlines said they had received permission to delay implementing the new rules until January.At Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel, long-haul carrier Emirates began questioning passengers about their luggage, liquids they were carrying and where they were coming from.Passengers also had to have their carry-on bags searched, along with their electronics.Emirates declined to discuss the new procedures in detail on Thursday.On Wednesday, it said it would conduct "passenger pre-screening interviews" for those traveling on U.S.-bound flights in concert with other checks on electronics.Elsewhere, things did not appear to be going so smoothly.In China, an official in the Xiamen Airlines press office, who would only give his surname as Qiu, said that the airlines received a "demand" about the new U.S. regulations and planned "to take some security measures, including security safety interviews from today on.""We're not going to interview all passengers, but focus on those with a certain degree of risk when checking the passengers' documents on the ground," he said, without elaborating.An official with the Eastern Airlines publicity department said that she saw media reports about security safety interviews but didn't have immediate details on what her company was doing.An official at the Beijing Airport press center would only say: "We always strictly follow relevant regulations of the Civil Aviation Administration when conducting security checks."Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity under regulations.At Air China, the country's flag carrier, an official who only gave his surname, Zhang, said it would comply."We will meet the demands from the U.S. side, but as for the detailed measures (we will take), it is inconvenient for us to release," he said.South Korea's Transport Ministry said that the United States agreed to delay implementing the new screening for the country's two biggest carriers, Korean Air Lines Co. and Asiana Airlines Inc., until next year on condition they deploy staff at boarding gates to monitor travelers.Royal Jordanian, based in Amman, also has said it would introduce the new procedures in mid-January.Other airlines with U.S.-bound flights at Seoul's Incheon International Airport brought in as many as seven extra staff Thursday to question passengers under the new rules but there were no major delays, airport spokesman Lee Jung-hoon said.Singapore Airlines passengers may be required to "undergo enhanced security measures" including inspection of personal electronic devices "as well as security questioning during check-in and boarding," the carrier said on its website.Other carriers who announced the new regulations on Wednesday included Air France, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., the airlines of Germany's Lufthansa Group and EgyptAir.In Hong Kong, passengers described some of the questions they were asked."They asked me if I packed my own bag, where I packed it from, where I came from, they looked at my itinerary, verify where I was, who I was, from where I came from," said Fran Young, who was travelling to Los Angeles.Some showed displeasure."It's a little inconvenient, I kind of just want to get my printed ticket and then just go inside," passenger Gavin Lai said."I don't want to wait on people to interview me like that.So it's a little annoying."U.S. carriers also will be affected by the new rules.Delta Air Lines said it was telling passengers traveling to the U.S. to arrive at the airport at least three hours before their flight and allow extra time to get through security.United declined to comment, while American did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In March, U.S. officials introduced the laptop ban in the cabins of some Mideast airlines over concerns Islamic State fighters and other extremists could hide bombs inside of them.The ban was lifted after those airlines began using devices like CT scanners to examine electronics before passengers boarded planes heading to the U.S.Some also increasingly swab passengers' hands to check for explosive residue.The laptop ban as well as travel bans affecting predominantly Muslim countries have hurt Mideast airlines.Emirates, the region's biggest, said it slashed 20 percent of its flights to the U.S. in the wake of the restrictions.
Final trove of documents to offer new details on JFK assassination:::::More than half a century after U.S. President John F. Kennedy was struck down by an assassin's bullet in Dallas, Texas, the United States is due on Thursday to release the final files on the investigation into the killing that rattled a nation.Academics who have studied Kennedy's slaying on Nov. 22, 1963, said they expected the final batch of files to offer no major new details on why Lee Harvey Oswald gunned down the first and only Irish-American Roman Catholic to hold the office.They also feared that the final batch of more than 5 million total pages on the Kennedy assassination held in the National Archives will do little to quell long-held conspiracy theories that the 46-year-old president's killing was organized by the Mafia, by Cuba, or a cabal of rogue agents.Thousands of books, articles, TV shows and films have explored the idea that Kennedy's assassination was the result of an elaborate conspiracy.None have produced conclusive proof that Oswald, who was shot dead a day after killing Kennedy, worked with anyone else, though they retain a powerful cultural currency."My students are really skeptical that Oswald was the lone assassin," said Patrick Maney, a professor of history at Boston College."It's hard to get our minds around this, that someone like a loner, a loser, could on his own have murdered Kennedy and changed the course of world history.But that's where the evidence is."In 1992, Congress ordered that all records relating to the investigation into Kennedy's death should be open to the public, and set a final deadline of Oct. 26, 2017, for the entire set to be made public.President Donald Trump on Saturday confirmed that he would allow the documents to be made public.The documents to be released on Thursday will likely focus on efforts by the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine what contact Oswald had with spies from Cuba and the former Soviet Union on a trip to Mexico City in September 1963, experts said."There was a real concern that Oswald was maybe in league with the Soviet Union," Maney said.Kennedy's assassination was the first in a string of politically motivated killings, including those of his brother Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., that stunned the United States during the turbulent 1960s.He remains one of the most admired U.S. presidents.
Republican tax fight complicates plan to pass budget in House:::::A budget plan crucial to President Donald Trump's hopes for large-scale tax cuts looked set for a close vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday after some Republicans vowed opposition in an effort to protect a popular tax break.The rebellious faction is resisting a proposal to eliminate a federal deduction for state and local income taxes, which would hit middle-class voters in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California.The idea is one of several that have been floated as Republicans craft a tax-cut plan.The budget blueprint, which has already been approved by the Senate, is central to their efforts to push tax legislation through Congress in the face of staunch opposition from Democrats.The proposal "is obviously an issue of concern to a group of members, and the shared goal is to work together to address the issue and move forward," an aide to House Majority Whip Steve Scalise said on Wednesday.With the clock ticking toward a vote, the impasse had yet to be settled.Republican lawmakers had planned to meet in House Speaker Paul Ryan's office at 9 p.m. to try to hammer out a resolution, but the meeting was postponed until after the budget vote, which was set for 10:30 a.m. (1430 GMT).Republican Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey told reporters it was possible there were enough votes to block the budget plan."It's got to be close," he said.Scalise predicted victory."We're going to get it done," he told Fox News Channel.Republicans have sketched out a tax package that independent analysts say would cut taxes for businesses and individuals by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, but detailed legislation is not expected to be unveiled until next week.If Congress approves a tax-cut plan, it would hand Trump his first major legislative win since he took office in January."I am urging Republicans who have questions about SALT (the state and local tax deduction) to vote no tomorrow and keep voting no until we get some compromise we can live with," Republican Representative Peter King of New York told Reuters.An aide to Republican Representative Tom Reed of New York said there was discussion of a compromise that would call for a tax credit up to a certain income amount to replace the deduction, and that he would support it.Republican Representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey told Reuters he was not interested in a compromise at this time, and instead wanted the repeal provision taken off the table."I will be voting no on the budget tomorrow," he said.
Trump says Russia is hurting US efforts on North Korea nuclear issue:::::President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Russia was hurting U.S. efforts to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons while China had been helpful.In an interview with Fox Business Network, Trump said it would be easier to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue if the United States had a better relationship with Russia."China is helping us and maybe Russia's going through the other way and hurting what we're getting," Trump said of the North Korea situation.A series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have ratcheted up tensions.
Commerce Sec. Ross explains how GOP could strike a deal on taxes:::::Disagreements over controversial pieces of the Republican tax proposal threaten to trip up the party's efforts to approve a tax overhaul this year.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Wednesday at the NetNet event outlined a possible compromise for lawmakers.The House hopes to pass a budget on Thursday and move one step closer to approving a tax plan.If House Republicans can clear a budget resolution already passed by the Senate, they hope to release a tax bill next week and pass it by Thanksgiving.Already, sticking points in the plan have emerged, threatening the loss of votes for a party that holds only a narrow majority in the Senate.Ross identified multiple "hard" questions facing the GOP as it aims to broadly chop tax rates for individuals and businesses.Republicans have to decide whether to add a fourth, highest income tax rate on the wealthy above the top 35 percent outlined in a framework last month.They also have to consider how to handle several popular deductions like state and local tax deductions.Republican lawmakers in the high-tax blue states that benefit from the provisions already have fought back against a proposal to scrap them.Ross suggested a cap on the income levels at which the deductions could be used.The income cap could also apply to popular provisions like the charitable deduction, he said.Doing so "saves some of the money but doesn't do away with the concept," Ross said.While the White House has given input on the tax plan, like President Donald Trump did when he urged Congress not to change a retirement savings benefit, the congressional tax-writing committees will ultimately decide the bill's shape.The tax writers sought to get rid of some deductions to offset the deficits created by the tax cuts.A major deficit increase could put off some GOP lawmakers concerned about fiscal discipline.On the timeline for passing a tax plan, Ross echoed Trump and GOP congressional leaders in saying he wants a bill approved this year.He added: "I think what's more important is to get it done and get it done properly and to endorse the directional guidance the president has given."However, Ross said that taking longer to pass a tax proposal could create "indecision" or "paralysis" when businesses or individuals plan financial moves at the end of the year.While Ross is a top economic advisor to Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and chief economic advisor Gary Cohn have led the White House effort on taxes.Ross added that he believes the U.S. will ultimately reach a deal with Canada and Mexico on revising the North American Free Trade Agreement.Negotiations on reworking the deal will go into next year.
Most popular Obamacare plans cost average of 34 percent more for 2018:::::The average price of the most popular types of Obamacare health plans sold on the federal insurance marketplace will be at least 34 percent higher in 2018, according to an analysis released Wednesday.The Avalere Health analysis also found lower but still double-digit average price hikes for the other types of Obamacare plans, which go on sale Nov. 1.Continued uncertainty in Obamacare markets, and the Trump administration's threats and eventual decision to cut off key payments to insurers are fueling the higher prices, Avalere said.Many Obamacare customers will be insulated from those sharply higher rates because their premiums are subsidized by the federal government.The subsidies can significantly reduce what a customer directly pays in premiums, with many subsidized customers being able to find a plan for $100 per month or less.More than 80 percent of Obamacare customers who buy plans on government marketplaces get such subsidies, in the form of tax credits, because they have low or moderate incomes.But customers who do not qualify for subsidies will get hit with the full impact of the price hikes.In many states, nonsubsidized customers will have to shell out more than $100 per month more than what they currently pay for their plans.About 18 million people who do not get health coverage through a job, Medicare or Medicaid are covered by the types of individual health plans whose prices Avalere analyzed.And about 11 million of those people buy coverage through a government-run exchange.Avalere's analysis came on the same day that prices for 2018 insurance plans were posted for public view on HealthCare.gov, the federally run exchange that sells individual plans in 36 states.
Will Congress Ever Limit the Forever-Expanding 9/11 War?:::::Previous efforts collapsed under disagreements between lawmakers opposed to restricting the executive branchs interpretation of its current wartime powers and those unwilling to vote for a new blank check for a forever war.Among the disputes: whether a replacement should have an expiration date, constrain the use of ground forces, limit the wars geographic scope and permit the government to start attacking other militant groups merely associated with the major enemies it would name.Adding to the political headwinds, two of the Republican lawmakers most interested in drafting a new war authorization law are lame ducks and estranged from the White House: Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has proposed a new war authorization bill with Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia.Both Republican senators, who have announced that they will not seek re-election, have publicly denounced Mr. Trump in recent weeks as dangerously unfit to be the commander in chief.Photo But as the 9/11 war enters its 17th year, questions about the scope and limits of presidential war-making powers are taking on new urgency.Mr. Trump is giving the Pentagon and the C.I.A.broader latitude to pursue counterterrorism drone strikes and commando raids away from traditional battlefields.Two government officials said Mr. Trump had recently signed his new rules for such kill-or-capture counterterrorism operations, without major changes to an interagency agreement first described last month by The New York Times.Under the Obama-era rules, there was individualized high-level vetting of proposed strikes, and targets had to pose a specific threat, as individuals, to Americans.Under the new Trump rules, the administration will instead approve a persistent campaign of direct action for various countries where Islamist militants are operating, without higher-level review of particular strikes, and targets may include any suspected member of a group deemed covered by the 9/11 war authorization.And while the Trump administration decided to keep an Obama-era requirement of near certainty that no civilians would be killed, it reduced the required level of confidence that the intended target was present in a strike zone from near certainty to reasonable certainty, one official said further lowering constraints on attacks.Moreover, NBC News reported this past week that the Trump administration was exploring arming the surveillance drones that now fly over Niger and Mali in search of suspected Islamist militants.The new rules could also permit the Pentagon to carry out offensive ground combat operations in North and West Africa, escalating deployments that key lawmakers seem to have been only dimly aware of before the deaths of the four soldiers this month.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I didnt know there was a thousand troops in Niger, Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, recently told NBCs Meet the Press.Mr. Graham opposes rewriting the 9/11 war authorization law but wanted more information about what the government is doing with it, saying: This is an endless war without boundaries, no limitation on time and geography.You got to tell us more.The questions about Mr. Trumps interpretation of his war powers range beyond conventional counterterrorism operations.For example, Mr. Trump has suggested that he may abandon diplomatic efforts to curb North Koreas testing of nuclear bombs and longer-range missiles and order an attack.But he and his administration have said nothing suggesting that they would seek prior authorization from Congress and the United Nations Security Council.Photo On April 6, Mr. Trump ordered airstrikes against Syrian government forces as punishment for using chemical weapons, without going to Congress or the United Nations for permission.His administration refused to answer questions about why it thought he had lawful authority to carry out such an act of war unilaterally, especially as a matter of international law, leaving it unclear whether it had first considered potential legal constraints.A Freedom of Information Act lawsuit recently revealed that Mr. Trumps legal team did draft and internally circulate a seven-page, unsigned memo analyzing a legal basis for potential military action against Syria.While the memo is undated, Justice Department lawyers said it was probably produced on April 6, the day of the strikes.But the administration is keeping the memos contents secret, so it is not clear what, if anything, it says about international law.The United Nations Charter, a treaty ratified by the United States, forbids attacking another sovereign country without Security Council permission or a self-defense claim.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.It is also not clear whether the memos analysis of domestic law claimed constitutional power for Mr. Trump to lawfully attack Syria merely because he decided that it would be in the national interest as a set of leaked administration talking points maintained or whether it invoked the 9/11 war authorization law as purported congressional sanction.But in June, after the United States military shot down a Syrian government fighter jet prompting Russia to threaten to shoot down any American aircraft that flew west of the Euphrates River the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., asserted that the executive branchs legal authority to attack the Syrian jet came from the 9/11 war authorization law.General Dunfords rationale was that the American presence in Syria stemmed from its fight against Al Qaeda and the Islamic State under that law, and that the jet had been menacing a rebel militia the United States was supporting.Several lawmakers and witnesses at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in June on whether to replace the 9/11 war authorization law criticized his claim as stretching the 2001 law too far.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The existence of the April 6 memo came to light via a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by Protect Democracy, a government watchdog group founded by former Obama administration lawyers.On Thursday, the group filed a new lawsuit for documents that could similarly reveal whether the Trump administration has developed any analysis about a legal basis for a potential pre-emptive attack on North Korea.Protect Democracys executive director, Ian Bassin, said the Senate should ask the top Trump administration witnesses on Monday to explain their understanding of Mr. Trumps powers to unilaterally start or expand wars beyond those linked to the much-stretched 9/11 war authorization law.Senator Corker may be worried about the lack of adult day care in the White House, but the framers actually assigned those duties to Congress, Mr. Bassin said, invoking the chairmans rejoinder to Mr. Trumps insults on Twitter earlier this month.With a commander in chief unilaterally launching missiles at Syria and threatening nuclear war against North Korea, Corker needs to focus on more than an Islamic State A.U.M.F.He needs to put safety bumpers around the president.
Conservative Website First Funded Anti-Trump Research by Firm That Later Produced Dossier:::::It has long been known that Fusion GPS was first hired by Republicans, but it was not known who was the source of the funding.This week, Mr. Trump and his allies seized on the fact that Democrats had paid the firm for the research as evidence that the dossier was part of a political smear campaign.Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that it was a disgrace that Democrats had funded the dossier, calling it a very sad commentary on politics in this country.At the heart of the story is Fusion GPS, a Washington-based research firm founded by former Wall Street Journal employees.Little is known about the firms list of clients, and Republicans in Congress have pressed the firm and one of its founders, Glenn Simpson, to hand over documents about the funding and research that produced the dossier.The Free Beacons editor, Matthew Continetti, and its chairman, Michael Goldfarb, said in a statement that the website was not involved in the dossier.All of the work that Fusion GPS provided to The Free Beacon was based on public sources, and none of the work product that The Free Beacon received appears in the Steele dossier, they said.The Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele.The Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee retained Fusion GPS to research any possible connections between Mr. Trump, his businesses, his campaign team and Russia, court filings revealed this week.Working for them, the firm retained Christopher Steele, a respected former British intelligence officer.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.He went on to produce a series of memos that alleged a broad conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election on behalf of Mr. Trump.The memos, which became known as the Steele dossier, also contained unsubstantiated accounts of encounters between Mr. Trump and Russian prostitutes, as well as real estate deals that were intended as bribes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Speculation had circulated for months that Mr. Singer was involved in the dossier, but his allies had denied that.On Friday, an associate said Mr. Singer had not been aware of the dossier or Mr. Steeles involvement in Fusion GPSs research until January, when BuzzFeed published the dossier.Mr. Singer was among the leading Republican critics of Mr. Trump during the Republican presidential primary race.Even after Mr. Singers first choice, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, dropped out of the race, Mr. Singer continued to fund efforts to block Mr. Trump from the partys nomination.The revelation of The Free Beacons involvement with Fusion GPS threatens a rapprochement between Mr. Trump and Mr. Singer, who donated $1 million to the presidents inaugural fund and has visited the White House on multiple occasions.After one such visit, Mr. Trump declared that Mr. Singer was very much involved with the anti-Trump or, as they say, Never Trump, and Paul just left, and hes given us his total support and its all about unification.Josh Levy, a lawyer representing Fusion GPS, said questions about who funded Mr. Steeles work should be secondary to its credibility.The Free Beacon has a history of employing so-called opposition research firms to assist in news articles critical of targets like Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton.In their statement, Mr. Continetti and Mr. Goldfarb said that we stand by our reporting, and we do not apologize for our methods.Investigators working with several congressional committees and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, have delved into Mr. Steeles work as part of inquiries into connections between Russia and Mr. Trump and his associates, including whether they conspired to influence last years election.The Free Beacons notification to the House Intelligence Committee came a few days before a deadline set by a federal judge for Fusion GPSs bank to respond to a subpoena issued by the committee for financial records that could have revealed who funded the dossier.Fusion GPS had filed a motion to block the subpoena on the grounds that it would irreparably damage the companys business and also chill its free speech rights and those of many others engaging in opposition research on political candidates.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a telephone conference with representatives for Fusion GPS, the committee and the bank, the judge hearing the case said that Fusion GPSs clients have the expectation of confidentiality.But the judge added that it was not to say that the congressional committee doesnt have interests that may trump those expectations of confidentiality.The firms connection to Democrats was revealed in a letter this week from Matthew J. Gehringer, the general counsel of the law firm Perkins Coie.The letter said that Fusion GPS had already been conducting the research for one or more other clients during the Republican primary contest, and urged the earlier clients to waive their confidentiality given the interest in this issue.Perkins Coie was paid $12.4 million to represent the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 race, according to campaign finance filings, though most of that money probably went to legal compliance.
The Trump Dossier: What We Know and Who Paid for It:::::Democrats argue that who paid for the research is irrelevant to the veracity of its claims, which they say should be thoroughly investigated.Yet some of the Democrats who funded the dossier have been leery about being associated with it.The lead Perkins Coie lawyer representing both the campaign and the D.N.C., Marc Elias, pushed back earlier this year when asked whether his firm was the client for the dossier, whether he possessed it before the election and whether he was involved in efforts to encourage media outlets to write about its contents.On Tuesday, the veteran Democratic consultant Anita Dunn, who is working with Perkins Coie, explained Mr. Eliass earlier response.Obviously, he was not at liberty to confirm Perkins Coie as the client at that point, and should perhaps have no commented more artfully, Ms. Dunn wrote in an email.Is this sort of research common or legal?Campaigns and party committees frequently pay companies to assemble whats known in politics as opposition research essentially damaging information about their opponents and nothing is illegal about the practice.However, Republicans and campaign watchdogs have accused the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C.of violating campaign finance laws by disguising the payments to Fusion GPS on mandatory disclosures to the Federal Election Commission.Their disclosure reports do not list any payments from the Clinton campaign or the D.N.C.to Fusion GPS.They do list a total of $12.4 million in payments to Perkins Coie, but thats almost entirely for legal consulting, with only one payment of $66,500 for research consulting from the D.N.C.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In a complaint filed with the F.E.C.on Wednesday, the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit group that urges stricter enforcement of election laws, alleged that at least some of those payments were earmarked for Fusion GPS, with the purpose of conducting opposition research on Donald Trump.The complaint asserts that the failure to list the ultimate purpose of that money undermined the vital public information role that reporting is intended to serve.Graham M. Wilson, a partner at Perkins Coie, called the complaint patently baseless, in part because, he said, the research was done to support the provision of legal services, and payments made by vendors to sub-vendors are not required to be disclosed in circumstances like this.Who else knew about Mr. Steeles research during the campaign?Officials from the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C.have said they were unaware that Perkins Coie facilitated the research on their behalf, even though the law firm was using their money to pay for it.Even Mrs. Clinton only found about Mr. Steeles research after Buzzfeed published the dossier, according to two associates who discussed the matter with her.They said that she was disappointed that the research as well as the fact that the F.B.I.was looking into connections between Mr. Trumps associates and Russia was not made public before Election Day.But word of the memos and their contents had circulated in Washington political and media circles before the election.In British court filings, Mr. Steeles lawyers said that he and Fusion GPS briefed journalists from a range of media outlets, including The New York Times, on his research starting in September of 2016.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yet the research and even the existence of the dossier were not reported by the media, with the exception of Mother Jones magazine, which published a story in the days before the election that described the dossier, its origin and significance, while omitting the salacious claims.How much of the dossier has been substantiated?There has been no public corroboration of the salacious allegations against Mr. Trump, nor of the specific claims about coordination between his associates and the Russians.In fact, some of those claims have been challenged with supporting evidence.For instance, Mr. Trumps longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, produced his passport to rebut the dossiers claim that he had secret meetings in Prague with a Russian official last year.Where does the dossier fit in with the governments Russia investigations?James B. Comey, the former F.B.I.director whose firing by Mr. Trump prompted the appointment of a special counsel to oversee the Justice Departments Russia investigation, received a copy of the memos after Election Day from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.Mr. McCain had dispatched David J. Kramer, a former top State Department official, to obtain the dossier directly from Mr. Steele.And before Election Day, the F.B.I.reached an agreement to pay Mr. Steele to continue his research, though that plan was scrapped after the dossier was published.During the presidential transition, senior American intelligence officials briefed Mr. Trump and President Barack Obama on the dossier.Investigators from the House and Senate intelligence committees and Mr. Muellers team have been exploring claims made in the dossier.Mr. Muellers team reportedly interviewed Mr. Steele over the summer.
Talking Points Brought to Trump Tower Meeting Were Shared With Kremlin:::::The matching messages point to a synchronized information campaign.Like some other Russian experts, Stephen Blank, a senior fellow with the nonprofit American Foreign Policy Council in Washington, said they indicate that Ms. Veselnitskayas actions were coordinated from the very top.The Trump Tower meeting is of keen interest to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as he investigates Russian efforts to help Mr. Trumps campaign.At least one participant at the meeting has already testified before a federal grand jury.Photo Ms. Veselnitskaya declined to be interviewed, saying in an email that The New York Times had published lies and false claims.The memo that Ms. Veselnitskaya brought to the Trump Tower meeting alleged that Ziff Brothers Investments, an American firm, had illegally purchased shares in a Russian company and evaded tens of millions of dollars of Russian taxes.The company was the financial vehicle of three billionaire brothers, two of them major donors to Democratic candidates including Mrs. Clinton.By implication, Ms. Veselnitskaya, said, those political contributions were tainted by stolen money.Kremlin officials viewed the charges as extremely significant.The Ziff brothers had invested in funds managed by William F. Browder, an American-born financier and fierce Kremlin foe.Mr. Browder was the driving force behind a 2012 law passed by Congress imposing sanctions on Russian officials for human rights abuses.The law, known as the Magnitsky Act, froze Western bank accounts of officials on the sanctions list including Mr. Chaikas deputy and banned them from entering the United States.It was named after Sergei L. Magnitsky, a tax lawyer who had worked for Mr. Browder and who died in a Moscow jail after exposing a widespread fraud scheme involving Russian officials.In his speech to Western academics at a Black Sea resort last week, Mr. Putin said that American authorities had ignored the allegations against Mr. Browder and his investors because the Ziff brothers were major political donors.They protect themselves in this way, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A spokesman for Ziff Brothers Investments declined to comment.Mr. Browder said the charges were concocted to discredit him and to undermine the Magnitsky Act sanctions.How Ms. Veselnitskayas allegations made their way to the upper reaches of the Russian government, and then to the Trump campaign, is a tangled tale.A former prosecutor for the Moscow regional government, Ms. Veselnitskaya lives and works in Moscow but has traveled frequently to the United States in recent years, partly to lobby against the Magnitsky Act.She was also the lead defense lawyer in a civil fraud lawsuit brought by the Justice Department against a Russian firm in New York.The firm, which ultimately settled the case for about $6 million without admitting fault, was accused of using real estate purchases to launder a portion of the profits from the tax fraud that Mr. Magnitsky had uncovered.Mr. Browder provided much of the prosecutions evidence.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.While investigating Mr. Browder and his investors, Ms. Veselnitskaya unearthed what she considered evidence of a financial and tax fraud scheme.In October 2015, she took her findings about Mr. Browder and the Ziff brothers directly to Mr. Chaika, Russias top prosecutor and a man whom she has said she knows personally.Mr. Chaika was highly pleased with her report, according to a former colleague of Ms. Veselnitskaya who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions.In April 2016, Ms. Veselnitskaya teamed with Mr. Chaikas office to pass the accusations to an American congressional delegation visiting Moscow.An official with the Russian prosecutor generals office gave a memo detailing the charges stamped confidential to Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican who is considered to be one of the most pro-Russia lawmakers in Congress and who heads a subcommittee that helps oversee U.S. policy toward Russia.Ms. Veselnitskaya handed a nearly identical memo to Representative French Hill, Republican of Arkansas.She has said she also met with Mr. Rohrabacher then, although he said that he does not recall the encounter.The next month, Mr. Chaikas office described the alleged scheme on the prosecutor generals website.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Precisely how Ms. Veselnitskaya ended up at the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting to present her findings remains in dispute.She asked Aras Agalarov, a well-connected Russian oligarch who knows the Trump family, to help her share her allegations with the Trump campaign, according to Mr. Agalarovs attorney, Scott Balber.She may have told Mr. Agalarov that she had previously conveyed the same information to Mr. Chaika, Mr. Balber said.Mr. Agalarovs son then enlisted his publicist, Rob Goldstone, to broker the meeting.In emails to Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Goldstone wrote that a Russian prosecutor an apparent reference to Mr. Chaika had met with Mr. Agalarov and wanted to offer the Trump campaign official documents that would incriminate Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Goldstone described the proposed meeting as part of the Russian governments effort to help Mr. Trumps candidacy, and said a government lawyer would fly to New York to deliver the documents.Photo Donald Trump Jr. has dismissed Mr. Goldstones emails as goosed-up.Mr. Balber blamed miscommunication among those arranging the meeting.Mr. Agalarov unequivocally, absolutely, never spoke to Mr. Chaika or his office about these issues, he said.Donald Trump Jr. enthusiastically accepted the offer of information that might damage the Clinton campaign.I love it, he wrote in an email agreeing to meet the Russian lawyer.Ms. Veselnitskaya came to Trump Tower with a memo that closely resembled the document that prosecutors had given to Mr. Rohrabacher in Moscow two months earlier.Some paragraphs were incorporated verbatim, according to a comparison of both documents, which were provided to The Times.By all accounts, the Trump campaign officials were unimpressed even baffled by her 20-minute presentation.Some D.N.C.donors may have done something in Russia and they didnt pay taxes, Donald Trump Jr. said later.I was, like, What does this have to do with anything?After the meeting came to light last summer, Ms. Veselnitskaya insisted it was not related at all to the fact that Donald Trump Jr. was the son of the candidate.But by last weekend, she was describing herself as a kind of whistle-blower who was trying to expose American political corruption.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Last Friday, she told Rossiya 24, the state television network: Of course they dont like it when somebody says, even in a friendly tone, Guys, what is happening with you at home?Who is in charge of your politics?Who is paying these politicians, and for what?In a follow-up television interview broadcast early this week, Mr. Chaika charged that Mr. Browder and the Ziffs had illegally used Russian money to lobby for the sanctions law.Russian elites have been known to mount independent initiatives to curry favor with the Kremlin.But a number of Russian analysts called it inconceivable Ms. Veselnitskaya would have bypassed her own government to deliver what are now unmistakably official allegations to an American presidential campaign.Said Gleb O. Pavlovsky, the president of the Fund for Effective Politics, a Moscow research institute: She had guidance.
Trump Unworried About What Former Aides Will Tell Mueller, Lawyer Says:::::He likes and respects Mr. Manafort and appreciates the work he did for him during the three months he was with the campaign.He likes General Flynn personally, but understands that they have their own path with the special counsel, Mr. Cobb said."I think he would be sad for them, as a friend and a former colleague, if the process results in punishment or indictments.But to the extent that that happens, thats beyond his control.Mr. Mueller is investigating whether Mr. Manafort violated federal tax laws or lobbied on behalf of foreign officials without registering.His team is also investigating Mr. Manafort for possible money laundering, a line of inquiry he took over this spring from federal prosecutors in Manhattan, according to lawyers and federal officials.Many of the activities Mr. Mueller is scrutinizing date back years, well before Mr. Manafort joined the Trump campaign.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Manafort has said from the beginning neither he nor anyone else in the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government to undermine the 2016 election, said Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Mr. Manafort.Finally, everyone seems to be coming to that same conclusion.The special counsel is also examining Mr. Flynns financial ties to Russia and whether he concealed lobbying he did last year for Turkey.The White House has given Mr. Mullers team documents related to Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn, as well as the firing of the F.B.I.director, James B. Comey, and other topics.Mr. Trump has instructed all White House staff members to cooperate with investigators, Mr. Cobb said.Mr. Mueller has begun interviewing White House staff members, but he has not yet asked to speak with Mr. Trump.Wed have to address that in the future if they see a need to talk to him, Mr. Cobb said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Cobb said none of the White House documents turned over to Mr. Mueller showed evidence that that anyone colluded with Russia, or that Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice.The president is fully cooperating with the special counsel, he said.I think the path that he chose of trying to minimize conflict and maximize cooperation is one that benefits the country as he tries to erase this cloud, Mr. Cobb said.Which I think he will ultimately achieve.He did not say when he believed that would happen, but he predicted the end of the investigation was nearing.I dont think that its far away, he said.____________ How do I listen?On your iPhone or iPad: Open the preloaded app called Podcasts; it has a purple icon.If youre reading this from your phone, tap this link, which will take you straight there.(You can also use the magnifying glass icon to search; type The New Washington.)Once youre on the series page, you can tap on the episode title to play it, and tap on the subscribe button to have new episodes sent to your phone free.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Or if you prefer another podcast player, you can find The New Washington there.(Heres the RSS feed.)On your Android phone or tablet: You can listen and subscribe using the free app RadioPublic, which is available worldwide.If youre reading this from your phone, tap this link to play the latest episode and learn more about the app.Or if you prefer another podcast player, you can find The New Washington there.(Heres the RSS feed.)From a desktop or laptop: Click the play button above to start the show.Make sure to keep that window open on your browser if youre doing other things, or the audio will stop.

James Madisons Lessons in Racism:::::Most of what can be learned about Madisons racial attitudes is found in letters of his that remain largely unexplored.In one astonishing document, written in 1783, he explained to his father that he faced a quandary with respect to an enslaved man named Billey, whom Madison had brought with him to Philadelphia as his manservant while he was in Congress.Madison wrote that he could not bring Billey back to the family plantation, because after Billey had experienced the relative freedom of Pennsylvania, his mind is too thoroughly tainted to be a fit companion for fellow slaves in Virginia.Madison could not think of punishing him, he wrote, merely for coveting that liberty for which we have paid the price of so much blood, and have proclaimed so often to be the right, and worthy pursuit, of every human being.In other words, Billey possessed the same right of liberty as every other human being the right they had fought for in the Revolutionary War.But it was a time of economic crisis.Madison felt he could not free Billey because he could not afford to.His compromise was to sell Billey into a term of indentured servitude, as allowed by Pennsylvania law, at the end of which he would become free.Madison therefore got some value for his slave, while satisfying his conscience.At the end of his term of service, Billey was indeed freed, taking the name William Gardener, marrying and staying in Philadelphia, where Madison continued to have contact with him for years.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Madison understood perfectly well that slavery was morally wrong and why.But he also could not overcome the economic reality on which his entire livelihood and that of the family plantation was based.Thanks to Madisons influence, his characteristic treatment of race principled ideals followed by compromise made its way into the Constitution itself.The story begins in 1783, four years before the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia.The Continental Congress had asked the states for annual contributions of money, determined proportionally based on population.Southerners wanted to count slaves as little as possible to reduce their share; Northerners wanted to count slaves fully so that the South would pay more.Madison proposed counting three-fifths of slaves as a compromise, believing it was very near the true ratio with respect to the taxable wealth produced by them.All but two states approved of the proposal, but because unanimity was required, it did not pass.At the Constitutional Convention in 1787, the tables were turned.Southerners wanted to count slaves fully to increase their legislative representation, while Northerners argued that slaves, who couldnt vote, should not count at all.The three-fifths compromise was adopted precisely because everyone knew that the number had been used when both sides saw things the other way.Madison was happy to see it adopted.There was also the issue of the constitutional provision that preserved the slave trade for 20 years after ratification.Madison objected strongly to it.Like other slaveholders, he considered trade in slaves more odious than ownership.Yet when it became clear that South Carolina and Georgia, backed by Connecticut, insisted on protecting the slave trade as a condition for agreeing to the Constitution, Madison went along.Reaching consensus was paramount.Without the guarantee of slavery and the slave trade, there would have been no Constitution and that was Madisons highest priority.Further demonstrating the tension between his beliefs and his actions, Madison called for abolition but only in private.In 1790, just after drafting the Bill of Rights, Madison argued in a letter for creating a colony in Africa to resettle freed slaves.That would, he said, afford the best hope yet presented of putting an end to the slavery in which not less than 600,000 unhappy Negroes are now involved.His reason for sending former slaves to Africa was the prejudices of the whites, which would make integrating freed blacks impossible.He thought that because prejudice derived principally from the difference of color, it must be considered as permanent and insuperable.Years later, Madison proposed that Congress sell the public the Western lands included in the Louisiana Purchase to raise $600 million to purchase and free all 1.5 million slaves.But ultimately Madison could not afford even to free his own slaves in his will.According to family lore, he left separate instructions to Dolley, his wife, to emancipate his slaves upon her own death.If this message in fact existed, she was unable or unwilling to fulfill it.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Madisons contradictions resonate with our own vexed racial situation.From the 14th Amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and affirmative action, America, at its best, has repeatedly aspired to establish racial equality in the face of our past of slavery and segregation.Yet the need to accommodate the realities of economics, politics and the prejudice of others which is to say, the difficulty that even well-intentioned people can have in accepting the true cost of meaningful change has continued to hold back equality in practice.Madison had many remarkable qualities.He was a constitutional genius, an accomplished statesman and a calm, rational leader, even in wartime.When it came to race, however, he had feet of clay, as do most Americans still.Our founders can serve as important role models for us provided we try to learn from their mistakes and flaws as well as their successes and virtues.

Trump Unlikely to Name Top Two Fed Officials at Same Time, Mnuchin Says:::::I do have a good relationship with Yellen, said Mr. Mnuchin, who was careful not to tip his hand.I expect whoever is appointed by the president as Fed chair, I would expect to have a very good relationship with.Mr. Mnuchin is in the midst of a four-country swing to discuss efforts to combat terrorist financing.He held meetings with business leaders and government officials in Saudi Arabia and Israel and on Saturday was en route to the United Arab Emirates, which he will visit before finishing his trip in Qatar on Monday.The possibility of more sanctions on Iran has been an important topic of discussion with his counterparts in the Middle East, said Mr. Mnuchin, who criticized the Iranians for violating various United Nations resolutions and creating problems in the region.Earlier this week, Mr. Mnuchin commemorated the establishment of a new center in Saudi Arabia targeting terrorist financing that is a collaborative effort between the United States and several Gulf nations.The Treasurys lack of action on new Russia sanctions mandated by Congress has irked some Senate Republicans.Mr. Mnuchin said in the interview that he had been in touch this past week with Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, to discuss the status of those sanctions.The Trump administration missed a deadline imposed by Congress to start the process, but Mr. Mnuchin denied that the administration was dragging its feet.We expect that to come out in the near future, Mr. Mnuchin said.Its a lot of specific details to go through, but theres no specific delay per say.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Middle East trip comes at a hectic time for the Trump administrations domestic agenda.Not only is the Fed decision expected this coming week, but Republicans in the House of Representatives are due to release tax legislation on Wednesday.Mr. Mnuchin said he had been having daily telephone calls with his Treasury colleagues and with lawmakers in the House and Senate as they put the finishing touches on a tax bill.Despite the fact that they have been working on a plan since January, Mr. Mnuchin said there were still active discussions taking place over various provisions.Those include finding a way to prevent a new 25 percent tax rate for pass through businesses from becoming a loophole that would allow wealthy individuals to lower their tax bills.And he said it was too soon to say if Republicans would fully repeal the state and local tax deduction, which allows homeowners to deduct property and state and local income taxes from their federal tax bill.Weve been having a lot of discussions on the SALT issue, Mr. Mnuchin said, using the acronym for the deduction, and what the impact of that is in several states that are a big part of the economy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Mnuchin said on Saturday that he remained optimistic that the tax cuts could be passed and signed by the president by December.If we could do it quicker, that would be great, he said.Mr. Mnuchin also said it was difficult to define which American families should be defined as middle class or rich a key question lawmakers face as they set income levels for new tax brackets.He said that relative wealth varies with states and cities cost of living but that his priority is for people around the national median income level to get tax cuts.In Saudi Arabia and Israel, where Mr. Trump is popular, Mr. Mnuchin drew a warm welcome.Mr. Mnuchin, his wife, Louise Linton, and a Treasury delegation toured the Old City of Jerusalem for more than an hour on Friday.Several onlookers who recognized him approached to shake hands, offer praise and pose for photographs.Surrounded by a phalanx of Secret Service agents, Mr. Mnuchin and his group meandered though the stone pathways of the Muslim, Christian and Jewish quarters.They also visited the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and the Western Wall, where Mr. Mnuchin prayed and inscribed the guest book at one of the most holy sites in Judaism.After his prayer, Mr. Mnuchin expressed hope for strength, peace and prosperity.
F.B.I. Agents Faced Arrest and Ruin After Trying to Conceive a Child:::::At every step, Ive been waiting for the light bulb at the F.B.I.to turn on and realize this was just a mistake and make everything right, Mr. Litton, 46, said recently during an interview.The F.B.I.declined to comment.Mr. Litton met his future wife, Katia, around 1998 while he was stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina.She had worked at a local television station near the Army post, and the two fell in love.They tried to have children but without success.Mr. Litton knew it would be difficult.Since the early 1990s, he had periodically seen blood in his urine and semen, and he had received a diagnosis of sterility from Army doctors in 1997.He joined the F.B.I.in 2001 and hoped that a job with more stability would allow him time to deal with his infertility, but after the Sept. 11 attacks, he was recalled to active duty, leading a seven-man Army Special Forces team in Afghanistan.Photo He returned to the United States in late 2003, and the following year a physician concluded that he might have a condition known as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.He learned that a side effect of his sterility was low hormone levels.Essentially, Mr. Litton said, he had the hormone levels of a 70-year-old man.Mr. Litton believes that his repeated exposure to explosive blasts while in the Army and the F.B.I.induced the sterility.Brain injuries can cause the pituitary gland to stop producing sufficient levels of hormones, medical studies have found.In 2006, a doctor said that his low hormone levels were a side effect of a pituitary disorder/disease.In addition, Mr. Littons wife had a thyroid disorder.Together, they sought treatment, and by searching online found a doctor in Michigan who could help them.Their insurance, provided by the F.B.I., paid for the hormone treatment.His consisted of testosterone, human growth hormone and other drugs, and his sperm count improved dramatically.My wife and I had given up and were planning on adopting, Mr. Litton wrote to his doctor in 2006.Your treatment has apparently fixed whatever that was broken because my numbers are through the roof.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Litton joined the F.B.I.after applying in 2003.The couple did not note on standard bureau medical forms that they had taken the drugs for his infertility and her thyroid disorder.The couple did not view it as relevant to their work they were simply trying to have a baby.But their insurance company had started to dig into the billing practices of the doctor prescribing the drugs and found them questionable.The company referred the findings to the F.B.I.The doctor has said the prescriptions were legitimate.Mr. Litton and his wife were two of four bureau employees seeing the doctor, and federal agents arrested all of them in September 2010, saying they had lied about their steroid use.By then, Mr. Litton was a veteran of the Hostage Rescue Team and multiple deployments to Iraq, and his wife was a counterintelligence agent in the bureaus Washington field office.They were charged with making false statements, and both were suspended without pay.They had to halt the in vitro fertilization treatment they had scheduled for the following month.Instead, the $50,000 they had saved was used to pay lawyers.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.The same month as Mr. Littons arrest, the F.B.I.completed his performance review.He received an excellent rating, and his superiors wrote that he had represented the F.B.I.and the rescue team in an exemplary manner and maintains high standards of professionalism.Neither of the Littons worked for more than 500 days while they were suspended without pay.Eventually, the criminal case against them fell apart, and prosecutors dropped the charges in November 2010 and later declined to refile them.They returned to work in February 2012, but their ordeal was not over.The Justice Departments inspector general was continuing a separate inquiry, and in February 2014, the F.B.I.notified both of the Littons that the government intended to fire them.They had, the F.B.I.said, provided false or misleading information on the medical forms and exhibited a lack of candor during the internal inquiry.Investigators also concluded that fertility problems were not the only reason Mr. Litton had started taking the drugs.Emails indicated that he might have been using them to improve his performance on the rescue team, which Mr. Litton denies.Advertisement Continue reading the main story They were again suspended without pay.And that September, the couple were finally fired.The decision infuriated Mr. Littons lawyer, Kristin D. Alden, whose firm specializes in representing federal employees.Medical records show he was dealing with infertility issues as far back as 2001, she said.We gave it to the F.B.I.before he was fired.It didnt matter.By that time, Katia Litton was carrying the couples first child, going through a high-risk pregnancy because of her age and miscarriages.Ms. Alden implored the F.B.I.not to cancel her health insurance.They didnt care, she said.In January 2015, Ms. Litton gave birth to a daughter.The Littons were desperate and broke, facing staggering legal fees.They had already cashed out their retirement plans months earlier for money to live on.We had no income, Mr. Litton said.They scraped by, relying on money borrowed from relatives and the support of friends on the Hostage Rescue Team.Mr. Litton said they were at the end of their rope.Photo But then, a ruling came down in the Littons favor.In May 2016, the F.B.I.s disciplinary board determined that Ms. Litton could return to work.She accepted a 20-day suspension, and was reinstated in March.It took months for her to regain her security clearance.For his part, Mr. Litton had appealed to what is known as the Merit Systems Protection Board, which provides federal employees with an opportunity to appeal adverse and unfair personnel decisions, according to its website.Most F.B.I.employees do not qualify for the right to appeal to the board, but Mr. Littons veteran status made him eligible.The hearing was scheduled for January.Over three days, Mr. Litton endured hours of intense questioning by both F.B.I.lawyers and his own.At one point, his own lawyer asked Mr. Litton why he had failed to detail his prescriptions on the medical forms.Was he trying to hide them from the F.B.I.?No, Mr. Litton said.I just considered it my private information.He continued: Because it has to do with sperm and semen and my wifes uterus and, you know, hopefully nobody ever has to go through it, but failed pregnancies, miscarriages you dont want to have to talk about that stuff.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After the hearing, the couple waited months for a ruling from the judge.They celebrated the birth of their second child, a girl, in July.Then another gift arrived.In September, the judge ruled that Mr. Litton had a disability his sterility and that he did not need to disclose the treatments.The judge said the F.B.I.s use of the medical form violated the Americans With Disabilities Act.The judge also said Mr. Litton was telling the truth when he said the sole reason for seeking the drugs was to treat his condition.There are still hurdles ahead.Ms. Litton is owed substantial back pay.It is not clear whether Mr. Litton will ever be able to return to the F.B.I.The appeals process could drag on for years.Nevertheless, Mr. Litton, who is eligible to retire in three years, hopes his ordeal will end at some point.He wants to go back to work on the Hostage Rescue Team, which undertakes some of the F.B.I.s most dangerous missions, both in the United States and abroad, and works closely with the military.I love being an operator, he said.I miss the team.
In Virginia Governors Race, Immigrants Turnout May Be Key:::::Mr. Northam, who is from the southern part of the state, is not well known in the vote-rich Washington suburbs, and even some Democrats have said the campaign has failed to generate excitement.Photo It still feels a little quiet for a gubernatorial race, said Senator Mark Warner, the states senior Democrat.But the stakes in Virginia for Democrats nationally are high.The party has failed to win any significant races since President Trumps election, and the fundamentals are weighted in their favor in Virginia, where the president is deeply unpopular and the last time a Republican won a statewide top-of-ballot race was in 2009, when Bob McDonnells election as governor presaged Republican gains nationally the following year.Outside the Washington suburbs, Republicans dominate vast swaths of the state, mainly in areas where the population and economy are flat or declining.The political divide mirrors a fractious cultural one that has played out in fights throughout the state over whether to remove Confederate monuments, ban sanctuary cities or round up immigrants in the country illegally.If the core constituency that helped Democrats carry the state in the last three presidential elections does not turn out, it will be that Republican Virginia that prevails.Its really not old vs. new, said David Ramadan, a Republican who served in the state legislature representing the region.Its NOVA vs. ROVA, Northern Virginia vs. the Rest of Virginia.With its thriving technology sector and data centers that sprout up like the crops that preceded them on one-time farmland, Northern Virginia is the economic engine of the state, attracting a diverse, highly skilled and well-paid work force, many of them immigrants.The three major metropolitan areas in the state (Northern Virginia, Richmond and Hampton Roads) contain more than 90 percent of the total growth, Qian Cai, director of demographic research at the University of Virginias Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, said in an email.She also noted that between 2010 and 2016, 45 of Virginias 95 counties witnessed population decline.Photo Virginias immigrant population grew four times as fast as its native-born population from 2007 to 2015, according to the nonprofit Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, bringing its numbers to about one in eight Virginians.And more than two-thirds of the states immigrants live in Northern Virginia.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In Loudoun County, several elementary schools are majority South Asian.The area is also home to one of the largest mosques on the East Coast.Vietnamese and Korean immigrants have long been a presence.And, as in other places across the country, the number of Latinos moving into the area is growing rapidly as well.Many of these immigrants, who tend to be socially and fiscally conservative, are not naturally Democrats.But Mr. Ramadan and others said Republicans harsh approach to immigration has driven them to be Democrats, and it may be difficult to get them back.They are people of faith.They came here for less government.They are natural voters for the Republican Party, Mr. Ramadan said.But they are also emotional voters.They want to feel accepted.They want to feel welcome, but the Republican Party has failed to do so.Democrats have done a much better job.Tom Davis, a former Republican congressman who represented Northern Virginia, said he saw the transformation happening under my feet.We are losing ethnic voters en masse, Mr. Davis said.Vietnamese, Koreans used to be the backbone of my vote.They are very Republican in the way they live their lives, but I saw the immigration issue just turn it south.Photo In a presidential election year, Democrats have been able to rack up large majorities in the counties near Washington.But turnout drops substantially in off-year cycles, and Republicans can capitalize on a more loyal core of voters.Turnout among immigrants is not the only concern for the Northam campaign.He will need another crucial part of the Democratic coalition: African-American voters in Northern Virginia, Richmond and the Hampton Roads area.Mr. Northam has been trying to stoke energy in urban areas, and former President Barack Obama recently appeared with him at a rally in Richmond.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I think the big question for me on the election is: Can Lieutenant Governor Northam excite the traditional Democratic voting base in Northern Virginia and the urban centers, said Bill Bolling, a Republican former lieutenant governor.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.That explains why both Mr. Gillespie, who as a national party leader tried to reach out to minority voters, and Mr. Northam, who some Republicans once wanted to try to recruit to switch parties, have been running campaigns aimed at base voters, with Mr. Gillespie emphasizing crimes by illegal immigrants and pledging to oppose sanctuary cities even though Virginia does not have any and Mr. Northam trying to yoke his opponent to Mr. Trump.Mr. Ramadan said he ran as a conservative and won a district that was 60 percent Democratic in his state delegate race from a Loudoun County district.I have been telling my party until there is no breath left in me, you truly need to widen the tent and not just talk about it, Mr. Ramadan said.And start working the new voters of Virginia and not the old voters that are shrinking in Southwest.The future is Northern Virginia.The future is the Asian vote.The future is the Latino vote.Photo Mr. Warners career has tracked the tensions between old and new.He was elected governor in 2001, largely by mitigating losses in rural areas by devoting large amounts of time to campaigning there.It worked for him then, and again in 2008 when he won his first term in the Senate.Even as the states voting population was changing, though, he barely defeated Mr. Gillespie in 2014 to keep his Senate race, losing even rural areas where he had been popular.The new voters in Northern Virginia did not turn out, and the rural voters Mr. Warner had courted spurned him.It is an open question now whether it is even worth a Democrats time to try to win those rural areas, given the possible yield to be had by campaigning more vigorously in Northern Virginia.But the transition from old to new Virginia is still evolving.From her fifth-floor office, Phyllis J. Randall, a Democrat and the first African-American woman to lead a Virginia county board of supervisors, can look down on the courthouse square in Leesburg, the Loudoun County seat.Just beyond her view is a monument to Confederate soldiers that has been the subject of heated protests.She favors moving the monument but said older members of her board and community disagreed.It is so generational, she said.People 35 and younger grew up in a more multicultural area, so I think there are times when younger people have a lesson to give older people.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In Manassas, where Mr. Iyers restaurant does brisk lunch business, schools and car dealerships incorporate the word battlefield, a reflection that the areas tourism economy thrives in part by celebrating both sides of Civil War heritage.And yet, at the Stonebridge at Potomac Town Center shopping mall on a recent morning, the majority of morning customers at Starbucks and the Apple store were minorities.Mr. Trumps turbulent first nine months as president will also affect the outcome.Many of his policies will excite the voters in rural areas.Mr. Trump has backed Mr. Gillespie via Twitter, though so far he has not campaigned with him.Mr. Northams hopes rest in part on the votes of people like Mr. Iyer.When I had a choice I feel that the Democratic Party views are more inclusive, more tolerant, more favoring, he said.Republicans want to keep it for Americans.America is a great country, but these foreign nationals relate more to a feeling of being included.
The Little-Known Pragmatist Who Is Shaping the Trump Tax Cuts:::::The rapid rise of Mr. Muzinich, a lanky father of two from Manhattan, is emblematic of the new power dynamics in Mr. Trumps Washington, where business experience and New York roots are often pathways to top posts.He fits the mold of Mr. Trumps top economic advisers, Mr. Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, both of whom made a career on Wall Street.While not a Goldman Sachs alumnus, as they are, he brings an extensive background from the world of finance, having been a banker at Morgan Stanley and the president of Muzinich & Co., an international investment firm founded by his father.Yet for all the intricacies of Wall Street finance, Mr. Muzinich has had to scale a steep learning curve in understanding the peculiarities of the tax code and the legislative land mines that have roiled previous attempts to rewrite tax law.Some lobbyists have expressed frustration that Mr. Muzinich and his Treasury team have been overly secretive about the tax plan and that, despite his business background, he does not always appear enthusiastic to be haggling over tax code deductions with representatives of American industries.A congressional tax staff member who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings said that it had sometimes been evident that Mr. Muzinich was learning on the job in a world of tax and accounting technicians, but added that he had a strong sense of business economics, asked smart questions and was comfortable with data.His Wall Street brashness sometimes shines through when he gets into deal-making mode.Like other political newcomers in the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich has occasionally shown frustration with the grinding pace of legislating.On Capitol Hill, Mr. Muzinich is often paired with Mr. Cohns top deputy, Shahira Knight, to convey the administrations views in big tax meetings.He speaks almost daily with Mr. Mnuchin and, according to congressional aides, it is apparent that he has the authority to speak on behalf of the secretary.Justins leadership and expertise has been essential in advancing tax reform, which has been our administrations top domestic priority, Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement.Mr. Muzinich, who holds an M.B.A. from Harvard and a law degree from Yale, was relatively unknown in tax policy circles before he was plucked from Wall Street to join the Treasury Department.His most notable prior experience in the world of policy came while working on the campaign of one of Mr. Trumps arch rivals: Jeb Bush.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Bush first learned of Mr. Muzinich because of his work as an informal adviser to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, another nemesis of Mr. Trump.While Mr. Trumps personality-driven campaign was lean on policy, Mr. Muzinich was busy overseeing a team that cranked out detailed proposals for Mr. Bush on taxes, education and health care.Those attracted little public attention for Mr. Bushs failed White House bid, but the experience gave Mr. Muzinich a taste of doing thankless work in a political caldron and managing big personalities under pressure.One of the earliest iterations of the tax framework unveiled by Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans last month was the one that Mr. Muzinich drafted for Mr. Bush in 2015.Like the current plan, that one would have collapsed the personal income tax brackets from seven to three and lowered the rates.It would have doubled the standard deduction, reduced the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and switched the United States to a territorial tax system, as the current plan would also do.What impressed me beyond his business experience, which is pretty unique, is that hes just a policy wonk, Mr. Bush said in an interview.Justin has a desire to serve and hes getting to do it at a high level, and Im really proud of him for doing it.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Policy has long been a passion for Mr. Muzinich, who regularly sought out opportunities while on Wall Street to publish essays on subjects ranging from foreign aid to the mandate of the Federal Reserve.Some of his earliest writing on tax policy could be considered heretical in an administration with a guiding principle of America First.In a 2007 Op-Ed article in The New York Times, Mr. Muzinich and a co-author, Eric Werker, called on Congress to offer tax credits to companies that build factories in developing countries and to offset the lost revenue with reductions in foreign aid.Gregory Mankiw, the Harvard economist, called the idea clever at the time but suggested that such a concept would be panned as the outsource American jobs to third-world sweatshops tax credit.Mr. Muzinich has also written extensively on issues that extend far beyond taxes.In 2010, he wrote a long essay for the Hoover Institution on modernizing nuclear nonproliferation strategy in international waters.He grew up and studied in Democratic havens like New York City and Harvard, but Mr. Muzinichs conservative leanings were obvious at an early age.Former colleagues describe his views on tax policy as center-right, with a focus on spurring economic growth by broadening the base of taxpayers and lowering tax rates.Like many officials who have joined the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich is straddling two worlds.His wife, a doctor, and young children still live in New York, and he spends his weeks living out of hotels in Washington and commuting home to the Upper East Side on the weekends.A squash enthusiast, Mr. Muzinich has little time for the courts amid the crush of meetings and number crunching, according to friends who keep in regular touch with him.While many members of the Trump administration have become household names defending the president and his policies on television, Mr. Muzinich, who declined to be interviewed, has kept his distance from public political combat and maintained a low profile.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I think that he is pragmatic, said Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School, where Mr. Muzinich taught before joining the Treasury Department.Hes looking for good policy solutions, not policy positions.Critics have accused the Treasury Department of taking a different approach.Some economists have scoffed at Mr. Mnuchins promises that tax cuts would more than pay for themselves because of the robust economic growth he says they will create.The department came under fire for removing from its web site an economic study that contradicted the secretarys analysis of the benefits of corporate tax cuts.Yet Mr. Muzinichs reputation for pragmatism over ideology is providing comfort for those who know him and disagree with the direction of Mr. Trumps agenda.Im really happy that someone like Justin is working in the administration, because to have thoughtful, level-headed people who are open to evidence, and who are able to bring complicated issues together, I think leaves us better off four years later, said Mr. Werker, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who collaborated with Mr. Muzinich on writing projects at Harvard but is not a Republican.For now, Mr. Muzinich will be consumed with tax rates and distribution tables as he tries to help shepherd tax legislation to Mr. Trumps desk in less than three months.Early analyses of the Republican tax plan have found that it would disproportionately benefit the rich, but the Trump administration is working with tax writers in Congress to make the legislation more progressive.The final shape of the tax plan remains to be seen, but Mr. Taylor, who said that Mr. Muzinich was an above-average student in his Advanced Placement calculus class, is holding out hope that his former pupil will find a way to ensure that the poor are not forgotten.I see him in these pictures marching behind Mnuchin and I say, Oh, Justin, put in a good word for us, Mr. Taylor, a self-described liberal, said.I think people should be caring about other people.
When Silver Costs More Than Gold: How Trumps Actions Have Scrambled Insurance Prices:::::It also organized plans on its site in order of their premium price, so that customers who live in a place where a gold plan costs less than the cheapest silver plan would have an easier time figuring that out.If you live in one of the places where the gold plan is cheaper than the silver plan, and you earn more than about $24,000, you should not buy the more expensive silver option.The gold plan will cost less, and have a lower deductible.There are also high-deductible bronze plans that will have substantially lower premiums that you may also want to consider.If you qualify for a government subsidy, those will be your best options.If you earn too much to qualify for federal help buying insurance, you should also steer clear of the more expensive silver plans on HealthCare.gov.But there may be cheaper options in the silver category if you buy directly from an insurance company.A broker may be able to help you examine all of those options.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If you earn less than $24,000, a silver plan will still be your best choice.Thats because you qualify for additional discounts that will lower your deductible and co-payment, making a silver plan even more generous than a gold plan.Premium subsidies, which are unaffected by the presidents actions, will protect you from premium price increases.The loading of cost increases onto silver plans also makes it hard to easily describe how much more expensive insurance will be next year, compared with this year.The consulting group Avalere Health published a report Wednesday saying that the average silver plan on HealthCare.gov would increase in price by 34 percent by far the largest annual price increase since the Obamacare markets began.Normally, that silver price increase is a good barometer for whats happening with the entire health insurance market.But the Avalere report highlighted that the prices of other plan types arent rising as fast.Gold plans are going up, on average, by 16 percent.Bronze plans are rising, on average, by 18 percent.Some of those increases are probably because of Trump administration actions as well.The government has cut back on advertising and outreach to help enroll healthy customers, and has signaled that it may not enforce the government mandate to obtain insurance as vigorously as the Obama administration did.In their filings with regulators, insurance companies said they were increasing premiums to address that broader policy uncertainty.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Our map draws on prices that were published online Wednesday for 2018 plans on HealthCare.gov.The website serves 39 states, and the precise prices we examined were for single customers who dont smoke, age 40, though the trends should be the same for customers with different family sizes and ages.Information from the remaining states, which run their own marketplaces, will become available next week.
The Unhealthy Politics of Pork: How It Increases Your Medical Costs:::::Advertisement The Unhealthy Politics of Pork: How It Increases Your Medical Costs Image The term pork barrel spending has been around for well over 100 years.It means using government funds on local projects that are primarily used to bring more money to a specific representatives district.Credit Matt Cardy/Getty Images No industry in America spends more on lobbying than health care.In 2016, the health care industry spent half a billion dollars on lobbying, with pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and health professionals making the largest contributions.In 2009, the year the Affordable Care Act was debated, health care lobbying exceeded $550 million.(Last year, by comparison, defense lobbying totaled $129 million, and the gun lobby spent just $10.5 million.)Closely related to industry lobbying is the political maneuvering that congressional leaders use in an effort to pass legislation specifically, targeted provisions known as earmarks, sweeteners or pork barrel spending.The final version of the Graham-Cassidy health bill, for example, would have sent extra money to Alaska and Maine for the crucial votes of senators from those states, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins.In 2010, Democrats hoping to secure votes from reluctant rural state senators added the Frontier States provision to the A.C.A., which increased Medicare payments to five states with low population densities.We all know earmarks and lobbying influence policymakers and policy.In health care, this has critical implications: who gets care, how much they get, how we pay for it.But theres little hard data on exactly who benefits and how large the effects can be.A new study illuminates the ways these political dynamics can change congressional and hospital behavior and how they can increase health care costs for the rest of us.Research by Zack Cooper, Amanda Kowalski and Jennifer Wu at Yale and by Eleanor Powell at the University of Wisconsin-Madison analyzed a provision in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (M.M.A.), known as Section 508, that helped secure Republican votes for the laws passage.The M.M.A., which created Medicare Part D and provided prescription drug coverage for seniors, was a political priority for President George W. Bush ahead of his 2004 re-election campaign.But fiscally conservative Republicans were hesitant to sign on to what amounted to the largest expansion of Medicare in its history, and the bill seemed unlikely to pass.Thats when Section 508 was added.The rate at which Medicare pays individual hospitals is determined largely by a hospitals location and the labor costs, or wage index, in its area.Hospitals can, however, request to be reclassified into a different wage index area to raise their payments.Sometimes there are good reasons for this: Two hospitals might be competing in the same region, and because theyre separated by an arbitrary bureaucratic line, one gets paid more than the other.But Section 508 waivers created new, more ambiguous ways that hospitals in specific districts could appeal their assigned wage index, and gave the executive branch considerable discretion about which requests would be granted and how big the pay increases would be.The Section 508 waivers had large effects on how both politicians and hospitals operated.About 400 hospitals applied for a Medicare pay increase, and 120 waivers were granted.Hospitals in districts represented by a Republican member of Congress who voted for the M.M.A.were seven times more likely to receive a waiver compared with those in districts of members who voted against it.On average, these hospitals saw a 6.5 percent increase in Medicare payments, but the 29 hospitals with the biggest payment increases high 508 recipient hospitals received a 10 percent boost.How did hospitals spend the extra money?Perhaps unsurprisingly, they started treating more Medicare patients about 8 percent more per year.They also expanded nursing staffing by roughly a third, and invested in new technologies.But extra cash also meant big raises for hospital C.E.O.s: nearly half a million dollars per year at each hospital.Over all, high 508 recipient hospitals had $1.25 billion in additional spending from 2005 to 2010 about 25 percent more than they otherwise would have.There was no evidence of improved quality or outcomes.If you told me in advance that wed find this tight a link between Congress and hospitals, I would have been very surprised, Mr. Cooper said.We knew there was some connection, of course, but the more we kept digging, the stronger and more precise the link became.Section 508 payment changes were supposed to expire after three years.But hospitals with lucrative waivers had considerable interest in seeing the program extended, and worked together to form the Section 508 Hospital Coalition.In the years between passage of the M.M.A., and its reauthorization in 2007, legislators in districts with a Section 508 hospital saw a 22 percent rise in total campaign contributions, and a 65 percent increase in donations from the health care sector specifically.In the end, a provision that budgeted $900 million over three years led to billions in extra spending for nearly a decade.Pork, it seems, is as bad for budgets as it is for waistlines.Every time you pass legislation, big or small, these elements are added in, Mr. Cooper said.Its not that any single one is hugely offensive.Its their accumulation and continuation over time.Although Mr. Coopers research offers perhaps the clearest empirical glimpse of the links between lobbying, earmarks and medical spending, this political maneuvering is not new and Medicare hospital payment seems to be a particularly susceptible target.Both Democrats and Republicans have won pay increases for hospitals they represent.In the 1999 budget, the House Republican whip, Tom DeLay, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert reclassified hospitals in their districts into other regions, leading to hundreds of thousands of dollars of extra funding per year.About a dozen years later, in what was called the Bay State Boondoggle , John Kerry, then a senator, succeeded in lobbying for Medicare to pay Massachusetts urban hospitals at the same rate it paid the states rural hospitals.The catch: There was only one hospital that qualified as rural in Massachusetts on the wealthy island of Nantucket.None of this is surprising.A primary motive of elected representatives is getting re-elected.Passing expansive legislation like Medicare Part D or the A.C.A.is hard, especially when legislators cant point to specific benefits for their constituents.But a critical flaw in our current system is that payments are hugely influenced by politicians who have every incentive to increase them for their own districts.You cant get upset at a snake for having fangs, Mr. Cooper told me.We need to design a system that takes payment decisions out of the hands of elected representatives.We think of interest rates as so important and complicated that weve tried to remove politics and give the responsibility to the Fed.The same argument holds for health care.When the government spends a trillion dollars on health care, its too easy for members to direct funds to their districts.Weve been close to a possible solution.The A.C.A.called for establishing an Independent Payment Advisory Board , a 15-member panel charged with making changes to Medicare to control costs.The proposed reforms would have been put into effect unless Congress introduced alternate policies to achieve the same savings.But the advisory board faced fierce bipartisan opposition and was never created.Americas increasingly burdensome health care spending has many roots: new technologies, high drug prices, fragmented care, administrative expenses and the like.But lobbying and political maneuvering can increase costs, too without clear benefits for patients, communities or society at large.Often these costs are borne by all of us, while the benefits if any go to a favored few.Excess medical spending, then, is driven not only by inefficiencies in our health system, but also by those in our political system.Our solutions, it seems, must confront that uncomfortable reality.Dhruv Khullar , M.D., M.P.P., is a physician at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and a researcher at the Weill Cornell Department of Healthcare Policy and Research.Follow him on

Democrats Lack Strong Challengers for Some Vulnerable G.O.P. House Seats:::::Over all, there are 11 districts (out of the 50 districts that ought to be most competitive, by our estimates) where the Democrats dont have a candidate who raised $100,000.On average, those 11 districts are much less educated than the battlegrounds as a whole; just 31 percent of whites over age 25 have a degree.In comparison, whites with a degree represent 41 percent of the population in the other 39 districts that ought to be most competitive.Democratic Fund-Raising Lagging in Working-Class Districts Democratic share of fund-raising in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018, by white educational attainment.20% 40 60 100% 75 50 25 0 Whites with degree Democratic share of fund-raising 20% 30 40 50 60 100% 75 50 25 0 Whites with a college degree Democratic share of fund-raising There is still plenty of time for Democrats to find candidates in those districts.And even in working-class areas, Democrats are doing far better at recruiting and fund-raising than in recent years.They have attracted strong recruits in many competitive working-class districts, like Maines Second, New Yorks 21st and Illinoiss 12th.Democrats even have well-funded challenges in a few working-class districts that werent bound to be competitive at all, like Paul Ryans district in Wisconsin, Kentuckys Sixth or Kansas Second.And working-class districts are often in less expensive media markets, making it easier for Democrats to make a late bid.Photo The Democrats will clearly have the money to compete in expensive markets like Los Angeles and New York.Theyve posted staggering fund-raising totals in many of the best-educated districts, often outpacing longtime Republican congressmen.If anything, Democrats might have the opposite problem in these well-educated areas: too many viable candidates.In Orange County, Calif., Democratic challengers have outraised Republican incumbents by a two-to-one margin this year, even though the Republicans got a head start before their Democratic challengers entered the race.But theres a catch: There are 15 Democratic candidates who have raised more than $100,000 in just those four districts, setting up a series of costly primaries that might ultimately prove detrimental to the partys general election chances.Theres a similar pattern in well-educated districts across the country.Democrats Have Many Candidates in Well-Educated Districts Number of Democrats who have raised over $100,000 in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018.20% 40 60 6 4 2 0 Number of Dems over $100k Whites with a degree Number of Democrats who have raised over $100,000 in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018.20% 30 40 50 60 6 4 2 0 Pct.whites with a degree Number of Dems over $100k The abundance of Democratic challengers in these well-educated districts is a reflection of huge enthusiasm.In these areas, theres no shortage of well-to-do and well-connected political novices looking to do something about Mr. Trumps presidency, just as there was no shortage of well-educated Democrats lining up for the Jan. 21 Womens March or donating to the campaign of Jon Ossoff in Georgias Sixth District special election.Few established politicians are standing in the way of these political newcomers.The Democratic bench is quite weak in these traditionally Republican and often heavily gerrymandered areas.There are no obvious contenders strong enough to clear the field.The enthusiasm among well-educated Democrats and the relative lack of success recruiting established politicians in working-class areas has occasionally led to an odd mismatch: affluent, liberal types running in working-class districts.Take Josh Harder, who worked for a San Francisco venture capital firm but is now running in Californias typically competitive 10th District in the Central Valley, or ex-Obama administration officials like Elissa Slotkin, Lauren Baer and Andy Kim, who are running in middle-class districts in Michigan, Florida and New Jersey.The good news for Democrats is that they dont need perfect recruits to pull off big wins if its a so-called wave election year.Mr. Ossoff was a true political novice and still came close to winning, and the 2006 and 2010 wave midterm elections are full of examples of fairly weak recruits who pulled off important victories.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the G.O.P.starts from a position of strength: The Democrats path to a House majority is much more challenging than it was in 2006, or than it was for the Republicans in 2010.They cant afford to leave many districts like New Yorks 24th or Californias 21st off the board.
The Cookie Crumbles: A Retracted Study Points to a Larger Truth:::::Before the study period, about 20 percent of the children chose an apple, and 80 percent the cookie.But when researchers put an Elmo sticker on the apple, more than a third chose it.Thats a significant result, and from a cheap, easily replicated intervention.While the intervention seems simple, any study like this is anything but.For many reasons, doing research in nutrition is very, very hard.Photo First, the researchers have to fund their work, which can take years.Then the work has to be vetted and approved by an Institutional Review Board, which safeguards subjects from potential harm.I.R.B.s are especially vigilant when studies involve children, a vulnerable group.Even if the research is of minimal risk, this process can take months.Then theres getting permission from schools to do the work.As you can imagine, many are resistant to allowing research on their premises.Often, protocols and rules require getting permission from parents to allow their children to be part of studies.If parents (understandably) refuse, figuring out how to do the work without involving some children can be tricky.Finally, many methodological decisions come into play.Lets imagine that we want to do a simple test of cookies versus apples, plus or minus stickers as this study did.Its possible that children eat different things on different days, so we need to make sure that we test them on multiple days of the week.Its possible that they might change their behavior once, but then go back to their old ways, so we need to test responses over time.Its possible that handing out the cookie or apple personally might change behavior more than just leaving the choices out for display.If thats the case, we need to stay hidden and observe unobtrusively.This matters because in the real world its probably not feasible to have someone handing out these foods in schools, and we need the methods to mirror what will most likely happen later.Its also possible that the choices might differ based on whether children can take both the apple and the cookie (in which case they could get the sticker and the treat) or whether they had to choose one.I point out all these things to reinforce that this type of research isnt as simple as many might initially think.Without addressing these questions, and more, the work may be flawed or not easily generalized.Advertisement Continue reading the main story These difficulties are some of the reasons so much research on food and nutrition is done with animals, like mice.We dont need to worry as much about I.R.B.s or getting a school on board.We dont have to worry about mice noticing whos recording data.And we can control what theyre offered to eat, every meal of every day.But the same things that make animal studies so much easier to perform also make them much less meaningful.Human eating and nutrition are typically more complex than anything a mouse would encounter.Overcoming these problems and proving spectacular results in preteens are some of the reasons this study on cookies and apples, and others like it, are so compelling.The authors have transformed this work into popular appearances, books and publicity for the Food and Brand Lab.Photo But cracks began to appear in Mr. Wansinks and the Food and Brand Labs work not long ago, when other researchers noted discrepancies in some of his studies.The numbers didnt add up; odd things appeared in the data, including the study on apples and cookies.The issues were significant enough that JAMA Pediatrics retracted the original article, and the researchers posted a replacement.The problems didnt end there.As Stephanie Lee at BuzzFeed recently reported, it appears that the study wasnt conducted on 8-to-11-year-olds as published.It was done on 3-to-5-year-olds.Just as mice cant be easily extrapolated to humans, research done on 3-to-5-year-olds doesnt necessarily generalize to 8-to-11-year-olds.Putting an Elmo sticker on an apple for a small child might matter, but that doesnt mean it will for a fifth grader.On Friday, the study was fully retracted.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Making things worse, this may have happened in other publications.Ms. Lee has also reported on a study published in Preventive Medicine in 2012 that claimed that children are more likely to eat vegetables if you give them a cool name, like X-ray Vision Carrots.That study, too, may be retracted or corrected, along with a host of others.As a researcher, and one who works with children, I find it hard to understand how you could do a study of 3-to-5-year-olds, analyze the data, write it up and then somehow forget and imagine it happened with 8-to-11-year-olds.The grant application would have required detail on the study subjects, as well as justification for the age ranges.The I.R.B.would require researchers to be specific about the ages of the children studied.I reached out to the authors of the study to ask how this could have happened, and Mr. Wansink replied: The explanation for mislabeling of the age groups in the study is both simple and embarrassing.I was not present for the 2008 data collection, and when I later wrote the paper I wrongly inferred that these children must have been the typical age range of elementary students we usually study.Instead, I discovered that while the data was indeed collected in elementary schools, it was actually collected at Head Start day cares that happened to meet in those elementary schools.This is a level of disconnect that many scientists would find inconceivable, and I do not mean to suggest that this is the norm for nutrition research.It does, however, illustrate how an inattention to detail can derail what might be promising work.The difficulties of research in this area are already significant.Distrust makes things worse.The social sciences are already suffering from a replication problem; when work that makes a big splash fails to hold up, it hurts science in general.We want to believe there are easy fixes to the obesity epidemic and nutrition in general.We want to believe there are simple actions we can take, like putting labels on menus, or stickers on food, or jazzing up the names of vegetables.Sadly, all of that may not work, regardless of what advocates say.When nutrition solutions sound too good to be true, theres a good chance they are.
Why the Fact-Checking at Facebook Needs to Be Checked:::::Since the 2016 presidential campaign, Facebook has taken a number of actions to prevent the continued distribution of false news articles on its platform, most notably by labeling articles rated as false or misleading by fact checkers as disputed.But how effective are these measures?To date, Facebook has offered little information to the public other than a recent email to fact checkers asserting that labeled articles receive 80 percent fewer impressions.But more data is necessary to determine the success of these efforts.Research (including my own) suggests the need to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of Facebooks interventions.Yales Gordon Pennycook and David Rand offer two principal warnings.First, the effects of exposure to false information are not easily countered by labeling, as they find in a paper they wrote with Tyrone D. Cannon.False information we have previously encountered feels more familiar, producing a feeling of fluency that causes us to rate it as more accurate than information we have not seen before.This effect persists even when Facebook-style warnings label a headline disputed.We should be cautious about assuming that labels tagging articles as false are enough to prevent misinformation on social media from affecting peoples beliefs.Photo In a second paper, Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand find that the presence of disputed labels causes study participants to rate unlabeled false stories as slightly more accurate an implied truth effect.If Facebook is seen as taking responsibility for the accuracy of information in its news feed through labeling, readers could start assuming that unlabeled stories have survived scrutiny from fact checkers (which is rarely correct there are far too many for humans to check everything).Advertisement Continue reading the main story Encouragingly, my students at Dartmouth College and I find that the effects of Facebook-style disputed banners on the perceived accuracy of false headlines are larger than those Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand observed.The proportion of respondents rating a false headline as somewhat or very accurate in our study decreased to 19 percent with the standard Facebook disputed banner, from 29 percent in the unlabeled condition.It goes down even further, to 16 percent, when the warning instead states that the headline is rated false.(We find no evidence of a large implied truth effect, though we lack the statistical precision necessary to detect effects of the size Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand measure.)Other results suggest further reason for caution.Back in April, Facebook provided users with Tips to Spot False News in an article that was linked above users news feeds.We find that general warnings of this sort are also potentially counterproductive.When we showed a warning reminding users to remain skeptical and think critically to spot misleading articles, it did reduce belief in the accuracy of false news headlines somewhat but it also somewhat reduced the perceived accuracy of news articles that were not false.Readers seemed to become more skeptical of all the headlines that they encountered.(A similar effect was not observed for the fact-check banners.)
A Big Test of Police Body Cameras Defies Expectations:::::After the public uprising in response to the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., advocates and many police officials turned to cameras as a way to reduce violent encounters and build trust.By 2015, 95 percent of large police departments reported they were using body cameras or had committed to doing so in the near future, according to a national survey.Photo The cameras provide an independent, if sometimes ambiguous, record of police-civilian encounters.Until now, the most commonly cited study on police body cameras had suggested that cameras did indeed have a calming effect.That experiment took place in 2012 in Rialto, Calif., where officers were randomly assigned cameras based on their shifts.Over a year, shifts that included cameras experienced half as many use-of-force incidents (including the use of a police baton, Taser or gun) as those shifts without cameras.The number of complaints filed by civilians against officers also declined a stunning 90 percent compared with the previous year.The Rialto study had a big impact in policing.Axon (formerly known as Taser International) has sold more than 300,000 police cameras worldwide and cites the Rialto study on its website.A federal district judge also cited the study in 2013 when she ordered the New York City Police Department to conduct a yearlong pilot program using body cameras.(Results are due out this spring.)But the Rialto experiment featured just 54 officers, compared with over 2,000 in Washington.Officers in Washington captured five times as many hours of video.The larger sample size and the long-term way the cameras were assigned added to the reliability of the D.C. results.This is the most important empirical study on the impact of police body-worn cameras to date, said Harlan Yu from Upturn, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit consulting company that studies how technology affects social issues.It was not directly involved in the research.The results call into question whether police departments should be adopting body-worn cameras, given their high cost.The federal government has given police departments more than $40 million to invest in body cameras, and state and local authorities have spent many millions more.The devices vary in price, but the biggest expense is the data-storage cost.In Washington, M.P.D.officers collect about a thousand hours of footage a day.About 40 percent of it is deleted within 90 days, while the rest is to be kept for months, years or decades, depending on the statute of limitations for the charges connected to the footage.Video The cameras also have a cost in terms of privacy violations.In a report on the policies governing police body cams in 50 major departments, Upturn and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights found that many cities have weak rules in place.Those rules can allow departments to refuse to share footage with civilians who want to file complaints, for example.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some companies are exploring ways to integrate facial recognition software into police cameras, a level of surveillance that would disproportionately affect low-income minority communities, where the police tend to spend the most time.D.C. has relatively strong body-worn-camera procedures, Mr. Yu said.In cities that have weaker policies, its certainly possible that the cameras may be doing more harm than good.Like other advocacy groups, the American Civil Liberties Union has supported body cameras.But the study, says Monica Hopkins-Maxwell at the A.C.L.U.of D.C., should give us pause.For now, Washington officials say they intend to continue using cameras.But they admit to being surprised by the findings.I thought it would make a difference on police and civilian behavior particularly for officers, and this is the exception, who might be more inclined to misbehave, said the M.P.D.chief, Peter Newsham.Why didnt the cameras change behavior?After all, we know that other cameras do change behavior.Public closed-circuit TV cameras seem to lead to a moderate decrease in crime, particularly in parking garages.Traffic cameras significantly decrease speeding and fatal accidents.Even the suggestion that someone is watching us tends to influence us: In 2011, researchers at Newcastle University in England posted pictures of a pair of male eyes and the caption, Cycle Thieves: We Are Watching You.Bike thefts decreased by 62 percent in those locations and not elsewhere.One hypothesis is that officers got used to the cameras and became desensitized to them.But the researchers saw no difference in behavior during the initial phase, when the cameras were new.(The researchers also checked the data to make sure officers were turning their cameras on when they were supposed to, and found a very high level of compliance.)Another possibility is that officers without cameras were acting like officers with cameras, simply because they knew other officers had the devices.An equally plausible explanation has to do with fear: In Washington, police officers are instructed to turn on their cameras whenever they answer a call or encounter the public in a law-enforcement context.The kinds of situations that might lead to civilian complaints or use-of-force incidents are high-stress encounters.When frightened, humans tend to act on automatic fear responses (or, in the case of good police officers in an ideal world, training).Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its a lot to ask, psychologically speaking, to not only remember the camera is on but to moderate your behavior, said Mr. Yokum, the head of the Lab @ DC.Photo Finally, cameras may have had less impact in Washington, because the police department there has already had to confront excessive-force problems.After a devastating 1998 Washington Post series revealed that the citys police department had shot and killed more people per resident in the 1990s than any other police force in a large American city, the Department of Justice entered into a memorandum of agreement with D.C. to reform its policing.We went through a transformation with regard to use of force when Justice came in here, Chief Newsham said.Cities that lack such accountability in their police culture may find cameras more effective, under this theory.(The Rialto Police Department had been reeling from a series of scandals when the Rialto study showed a large impact from cameras.)Even if cameras do not reduce violent encounters, they can still offer other kinds of benefits: for training, or to hold a rogue officer accountable after the fact.To Chief Newsham, the cameras primary benefit is to improve relations with the community.The transparency and trust that the community has, knowing your department is recording the interactions, I dont think you can undervalue that, he said.So far, its hard to say for sure if cameras increase trust, but Chief Newsham said hed like to find out more through additional studies like this one.The nine-person research team pre-published its design online, so that there would be less temptation to rejigger the approach after the results were in (an emerging best practice in social science research).We like to be very anecdotal in policing to compare this year to that year, said M.P.D.Commander Ralph Ennis, who oversaw the rollout of the cameras and worked closely with researchers.This study is a whole other thing.An updated version of this article, with more about the national implications of the Washington, D.C., study of police body cameras, can be found here.
The Fed Claims to Be Independent. Thats Mostly a Myth.:::::Over the course of Fed history, we find a dozen and a half other episodes of major overhaul.Some empower the Fed, others limit its autonomy, and some, like Dodd-Frank, do both.Controlling for the duration of recessions, Congress is more likely to amend the Federal Reserve Act when inflation and unemployment tick substantially higher.Congress is also more likely to act when electoral rewards are greatest.If one party controls both the White House and Congress, voters know whom to reward or blame.If the parties divide power, voters have a harder time.Congress is more likely to threaten action than to take it.Using legislative records to document lawmakers attention to the Fed, we examined all the bills introduced in the House and Senate between 1947 and 2014 that address the power, structure and governance of the central bank.Over nearly seven decades, 333 House and Senate members introduced 879 bills.Fingers Point at the Fed When the Economy Misfires Higher unemployment is correlated with the number of congressional bills between 1947 and 2014 addressing the power and governance of the Fed.1960 1980 2000 bills introduced per year 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1960 1980 2000 bills introduced per year 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Viewing the number of bills introduced each year (1947-2014) in the context of when the unemployment rate was above its median makes the pattern clear.When the economy hums, lawmakers leave the Fed alone.For example, congressional attention dropped markedly during Alan Greenspans Great Moderation starting in the 1980s, when the Fed tended to achieve its mandates.When the economy sours, most recently in the wake of the global financial crisis, reactive lawmakers pummel the Fed.The Fed today remains caught in the cross hairs of partisan polarization.Republican proposals to limit its discretion, for instance, would require the Fed to adopt rate-setting monetary policy rules.Others want greater transparency from the Fed, such as allowing auditors to review monetary policy deliberations.Even though the current Fed is still occupied by Obama appointees, Democrats are also critical, favoring stronger limits on emergency lending.Threats matter because they restrict Fed autonomy.Fed officials understand that responsiveness, sometimes even deference, to their congressional bosses lessens the chance that Congress and the president will revise the Federal Reserve Act.Photo Critics in Congress take aim at both monetary goals and tools.In July, the House financial services chairman, Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, warned Ms. Yellen that the Fed should cease and desist from buying assets that venture into fiscal policy: If we are not careful, we may wake up one day to find our central bankers have instead become our central planners.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Feds 2012 adoption of an inflation target also belies any notion of Fed independence.Ben Bernanke, then the Fed chairman, first broached the subject with his colleagues a decade earlier.Fed transcripts reveal acute sensitivity to securing congressional support.As Donald Kohn, then the Fed vice chairman, argued in 2008, having an inflation target wont have any effect if it is repudiated by the Congress.In the immediate wake of the financial crisis, the perceived political risk of setting a target again deterred Fed action.The Fed did not adopt its target until unemployment had finally subsided, years after the crisis.Even today, when former Fed officials recommend a higher inflation goal to generate greater growth, G.O.P.lawmakers direct Ms. Yellen not to change the target.Perhaps the Fed would be less eager to raise interest rates again if it could independently raise the inflation bar instead.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.As President Trump thinks about whether to choose a new Fed leader, Ms. Yellen, whose term expires in February, and her colleagues have been busy normalizing monetary policy.A decade after the financial crisis and near generational lows in unemployment, the Fed is finally unwinding its four-plus-trillion-dollar balance sheet, gradually raising interest rates and keeping an eye on inflation that has been below the desired target.This Fed seems eager to drop Mr. Bernankes crisis prescriptions.At her September news conference, however, Ms. Yellen reminded market participants that future policy makers would have a free hand to follow the Bernanke playbook the next time the country faces a financial crisis.Rates could return to zero, the balance sheet could be expanded, and so-called forward guidance could provide clear communication about future policy.Political interdependence cautions against such certainty.Some of the contenders to replace Ms. Yellen, like Kevin Warsh and John Taylor, show little interest in Mr. Bernankes unconventional policies, underscoring the efficacy of congressional threats.And President Trumps rare opportunity to overhaul the Board of Governors makes room for skeptics of the Feds financial crisis response.A new Fed, backed by an expanding economy, may temporarily quiet the legislative critics.But whether in this presidential term or some later one, an inevitable economic slowdown or a more serious financial panic will surely restart the cycle of crisis, blame and reform.
Mexicos Record Violence Is a Crisis 20 Years in the Making:::::It makes me desperate, he said, shaking his head at his countrys missteps, because this violence, its increasing.Extreme Measures Photo In 2006, a new president and a new drug cartel both took extreme actions, the consequences of which are still unfolding.The implosion of Colombian cartels set off a fierce competition in Mexico for control of the drug trade.A new cartel, La Familia Michoacna, broke off from a larger group, then cemented its power by deploying extreme, theatrical violence.Though they principally targeted other cartels, the gruesome attacks shocked Mexico.That same year, Felipe Caldern won the presidency by a hair.Though monitors approved the vote, his leftist opponent called it illegitimate, and the narrow victory for Mr. Caldern left him without a strong mandate.Shortly after taking office, the new president declared war on the cartels and sent in the military.Critics say Mr. Caldern sought to legitimize his presidency through the show of force.Defenders say he had little alternative.Mexico had been a single-party state and, like most such states, had controlled local officials through patronage and corruption.When that system disappeared, drug cartels filled the vacuum, buying off mayors and judges.Only the military had the firepower and autonomy to take them on.This began the drug war that has killed tens of thousands of people.But it also created a subtler set of problems now driving more and broader violence.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Short-Term Solutions, Long-Term Problems Photo Mr. Caldern adopted the so-called kingpin strategy, in which troops captured or killed cartel leaders.This generated headlines, pleased the United States and could be accomplished top-down, with little input from corrupt or weak local law enforcement.But this short-term solution to the drug war deepened long-term problems.In bypassing mayors and governors because Mexicos pre-democratic practices had left them systemically corrupt and unaccountable, the government further reduced their accountability.And in bypassing already weak local police and judges, the government allowed those institutions to atrophy, with money and political attention diverted to military and federal forces instead.Murder rate per 100,000 15 10 5 0 18.7 1998 2007 2011 2016 15 10 5

officers from conducting investigations drifted.As the kingpin strategy fractured the cartels, smaller groups rose in their place.Since then, said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst, there has been a significant change in the way organized crime works in Mexico.Drug trafficking required resources and infrastructure that the new groups lacked, leading many to turn to kidnapping, theft and extortion.Predatory crimes spiked.Ordinary Mexicans, once bystanders to the conflict, became its targets at a moment when the state had left them vulnerable.In the process of that fragmentation, we didnt do the job of structuring the institutions of the police forces, said Mr. Valds, who ran the civil national security intelligence service as this was unfolding.So we have the worst of the worst.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Key Point of Failure Photo The solution to the problem would seem obvious.Strong police and prosecutors, overseen by politicians who are held accountable by voters, could close the vacuum in which gangs and corrupt officials flourish.Instead, disorder and violence have risen.Joy Langston, a political scientist at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City, traces many of the countrys woes to a seemingly minor quirk in its political system.All candidates are selected by the party, and officials serve one term before being shuffled off to another post.During the one-party era, this was meant to impose accountability, which flowed from party leadership.Oversight institutions, seen as superfluous, never fully developed.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.Democracy, as intended, undercut the partys once all-encompassing power.But the old system built around the assumption of a strong central authority remains in place.This has weakened the state while cementing many of its old problems, creating what Ms. Langston called a nightmare scenario in which the institutions of accountability and transparency are extraordinarily weak even after 17 years of democracy.For example, voters have little opportunity to kick out bad leaders or reward good ones, giving officials little incentive to push through difficult reforms.And criminal groups are able to fill the pockets of notoriously underpaid policemen and other civil servants often providing the wrong kind of incentives.At the end of the day, this is all an issue of accountability, Mr. Hope said.That is the key point of failure in Mexico.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Nothing happens if a police officer does not do their work, he added.Nothing happens if a mayor fails to transform local law enforcement.Nothing happens if a governor fails to invest in prosecutorial services.Nothing happens.A Frail State Recedes Though recent electoral changes will allow some officials to stand for re-election in 2021, deeper problems are taking root.As public outrage over corruption rises, party leaders, seeing their own careers in peril, are becoming more reluctant to

Lagunes, a Columbia University professor who studies corruption.There are people staking their careers on this, but not in the judiciary in the press, Mr. Lagunes said.But, he added, Mexico is one of the riskiest countries in the world to do journalism.The combination of corruption, weak accountability and weak institutions has left the state vulnerable.In poor and rural areas, it has effectively receded.Criminal groups and youth gangs are filling the void, co-opting local officials or simply muscling them out.The result may be less dramatic than Mr. Calderns drug war, in which warring cartels publicly displayed dismembered corpses.But it is just as deadly, playing out in thousands of home invasions, gang killings and stickups gone wrong.State and Society Atomize This is leading communities to do, at the grass-roots level, what Mr. Caldern did a decade earlier: bypass distrusted institutions, worsening the underlying problem.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Businesses and middle-class Mexicans are hiring private security in record numbers.But like the Army, hired guards cannot solve crimes or lock up suspects.Mark Ungar, a Brooklyn College professor, said this growing practice relieves a lot of political pressure on the state to improve the police.Rural communities, which are more vulnerable, have formed self-defense militias to run off gangs and mayors alike.Inevitably, the militias are even more corruptible and less accountable than the police they replaced.Nearly all target their onetime sponsors for extortion, robbery and kidnapping.Many are involved in the heroin trade, which is booming as opioid addiction drives up American demand.In a disturbing trend, desperate and frightened communities increasingly seek at least the illusion of security by lynching suspected criminals.Mr. Ungar said these expressions of vigilantism represent a disempowerment of the state.Paralysis Amid Disaster Photo Mexicans seem keenly aware that their government is growing less responsive just as streets are becoming more dangerous.Polls show growing dissatisfaction, particularly over corruption.We have this political class that totally forgets why they are there, said Armando Torjes, a community activist in Guadalupe, a working-class city in the northeast.Each election, he said, brings a new official with a new three-year plan.Most, he added, leave office conspicuously wealthier.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When officials do act, they address superficial issues, adding more patrols or changing police strategy without confronting what he called the countrys social decomposition.Mr. Valds, the former head of the intelligence service, described facing a similar struggle in top levels of government.We wanted to improve the institutions, the judges, the jails, the police, he said.We spent years trying to convince the political class.But he found those institutions dominated by parties rather than technocrats and subject to the whims of officials who are required by law to cycle out every term unresponsive, just as Mr. Torjes had.Whats happening in Guadalupe is whats happening in all of Mexico, Mr. Torjes said.There was a political demand for change, but nothing really changed for us.
Bipartisan Health Proposal Is Too Late for 2018, but a Salve for 2019:::::It would make it easier for state governments to tweak Obamacares rules on how they run their markets, easing the way for more experiments.The draft bill would make the application process for such state innovation waivers easier to complete, but would still require that the state plans cover a similar number of residents and offer insurance with comparable affordability to plans established under the Affordable Care Act.It would allow more Americans to sign up for very high-deductible insurance plans known as catastrophic insurance under the Affordable Care Act.The current law limits those plans to customers under 30 years old, or those who have demonstrated they cannot afford other insurance options.The draft legislation would also ensure that the federal government assigns money for advertising about the Obamacare enrollment period and for hiring professionals to help customers select and sign up for plans; the money would be a portion of the fees it collects from insurers selling plans on HealthCare.gov.The Trump administration had slashed the budget for both programs in August.It does not include one of the industrys biggest requests: funding that would protect insurers from high costs associated with very expensive patients.Insurers and other experts who testified before the Senate health committee said such a program could help substantially lower premiums.But states may be able to use innovation waivers to establish such programs themselves.Alaska has already had such a waiver approved by the Trump administration.The insurers were generally supportive of the plan, and one of the main associations, Americas Health Insurance Plans, came out with a statement in favor of the proposed bill.But some emphasized that the legislation does not fix all of what ails the market.Weve stated repeatedly that the individual market is not stable, said Joseph R. Swedish, the chief executive of Anthem, a large for-profit insurer that offers Blue Cross plans in several states, although he praised lawmakers efforts to provide more certainty in 2019.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The deals prospects in Congress remain uncertain.Though some senators from each party have endorsed its approach, several Republicans have spoken out against it.In the House, a spokesman for Speaker Paul Ryan said that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare.But even if the deal moves forward quickly, it is unlikely to affect next years health plans.Carriers in most states have raised their prices substantially to make up for the canceled federal payments, and there is little time for them to lower them again if the payments are restored.(The draft bill tries to address this problem, by asking states to establish a new rebate program, where carriers who get paid twice would need to pay back the federal government.)For 2018, it probably wont happen in time, said Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor of law at Washington and Lee University, who monitors health legislation closely.The carriers are thinking now about 2019, and its very important for 2019.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Insurance plans for each year go on sale during the prior fall, but the process of devising plans and setting prices begins months earlier.This year, many current insurers announced their exits from the 2018 Obamacare markets months ago, some explicitly naming President Trumps threats about the cost-sharing payments as a reason.Analysts said it was unclear whether the plan might lure reluctant insurers back into the markets, but they said the funding would cause many insurance premiums to fall in 2019.But the lengthy planning process of insurers means that the proposed bills two-year funding cycle could lead to another round of price increases in 2020, if an extension bill isnt passed far in advance.Many insurers had been hoping that the Alexander-Murray legislation would make the funding permanent.While Mr. Trump has insisted he will not support any legislation that he believes to be a bailout to the insurers, policy experts say the insurers are getting only what they are due under the law.Because the insurers set the prices for their 2017 plans assuming they would receive the federal funding, the presidents decision represents more than $1 billion in lost payments, according to a recent analysis from Avalere Health, a consulting firm.The funding has not contributed to outsize profits for the insurers selling individual policies under the law, in spite of Mr. Trumps recent tweet about the insurers who have made a fortune w/ OCare.Most insurance companies have lost money trying to pursue these exchange markets, said Dan Mendelson, Avaleres president.Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are not allowed to pocket more than 20 percent of their premium dollars for overhead and profits.If they earn more, they are required to return the excess to consumers through rebates.The insurers generally lost money in the first three years of the Obamacare market, said Deep Banerjee, an analyst for Standard & Poors, though it appears they were faring better this year, before the cancellation of government payments.It is not a market that has been profitable for them, he said.While there are exceptions, most insurers are making their money in other insurance markets like the government programs Medicare and Medicaid as well as in the much larger employer market.It gives the market some measure of predictability, Mr. Banerjee said, but he emphasized that the legislation is not a permanent solution.Much of what it does is restore the funding that already existed before President Trumps announcement that he was cutting it off.Its not a huge additional support for the market.
Democrats Think Men Have It Easier. Republicans Disagree.:::::Ninety-six percent of respondents say gender equality is important, but they disagree on whether it has been achieved.Half say the country hasnt gone far enough in giving women equal rights, about 40 percent say it has been about right, and 10 percent say it has gone too far.A Partisan Divide on the Benefits of Changing Gender Roles Changing gender roles have made it easier for: REPUBLICANS DEMOCRATS Women to lead satisfying lives Women to be successful at work Families to earn enough to live comfortably Men to lead satisfying lives Parents to raise children Marriages to be successful Men to be successful at work 36% 53% 40% 30% 32% 26% 23% 58% 57% 54% 48% 48% 47% 27% agree Republicans Democrats Women to lead satisfying lives Women to be successful at work Families to earn enough to live comfortably Men to lead satisfying lives Parents to raise children Marriages to be successful Men to be successful at work 36% 53% 40% 30% 32% 26% 23% 58% 57% 54% 48% 48% 47% 27% agree There really is no consensus among the public about whether changing roles have made things better or easier for families or for men and women, said Juliana Horowitz, associate director of research at Pew and an author of the report.Although there are small gender gaps, the partisan divide drives the differences in responses, she said.Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to say changing gender roles had improved peoples lives.College graduates were also more likely than those without college degrees to say that changing gender roles were a good thing, and that more needed to be done.Of college graduates, 69 percent said men had it easier, compared with 27 percent of those with a high school education or less who said so.Seventy-one percent of college graduates said changing gender roles had given women more satisfying lives, compared with 49 percent of those without college degrees.Views about gender equality reflected experiences with gender discrimination, particularly at work.Women, Democrats and college graduates were much more likely to say they were discriminated against because of their gender, and more likely to think gender equality had not gone far enough.Male privilege allows men to be free to move about in public without threat of harassment, a woman, 54, told Pew, which published responses anonymously.When they speak, they are assumed to have some authority without having to prove it.They still earn more money than women.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But Republican men were more likely than Democratic men to say they had experienced discrimination.And while only 10 percent of the public said the country had gone too far toward gender equality, 23 percent of men who said they experienced discrimination said so.The largest shares of both men and women who said they experienced gender discrimination said it came in hiring, pay or promotions.Ten percent of women said they had experienced harassment or catcalling.People who say women have it easier these days say women get preferential treatment in job opportunities, and those who think men have it easier say they have better pay and job opportunities.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When asked how women have it easier, one respondent, a 53-year-old man, said, Lower standards for the same positions in order to get more women for those positions.Another man, 46, said: Everyone is on the prowl for perceived injustice and attempts to elevate women of all ages.Not so much for males.Explaining why men have it easier, a 29-year-old man said, You simply need to look at the percentages of male C.E.O.s and relative salaries to see there is likely a systematic advantage to being male.Women have benefited more than men from being employed and from having men doing more at home, respondents said.But even for women, fewer than half of respondents said changing gender roles had benefited them outside work.This might be because even though most women work and men do more at home, women still shoulder the bulk of the family responsibilities.When asked how its easier to be a man, one respondent, a woman, 65, said: Because most of them dont have to work outside the home and take care of the children and everything else a woman normally does.A womans work is never done.
Googles Founders Wanted to Shape a City. Toronto Is Their Chance.:::::The Sidewalk Labs proposal in the competitive bid for the project floated all kinds of technological dreams: a thermal energy grid that would be carbon neutral, sensors that separate waste from recycling, modular buildings that convert from retail to housing, monitors that track noise and pollution, self-driving transit shuttles, shared-ride taxibots, adaptive traffic lights, delivery robots, heated bike paths and sidewalks that melt snow on their own.In theory, each of these ideas would be best tested across more than just one building or street, and all of them would be more easily implemented together.Once you cover your traffic lights in sensors, its easier to turn them into air-quality monitors, too; as long as youre redesigning streets around driverless cars, you can also think about what the delivery robots need.Photo The prospect of a city designed by technologists, at least as a thought experiment until now, has made some nervous, urbanists especially.The tech industry is better known in its Silicon Valley backyard for contributing to rather than solving urban problems like unaffordable housing and traffic.And its corporate campuses are mostly models of how not to build cities, with mega office parks (and spaceship designs) dependent on cars and detached from their neighboring communities.Theres no small contradiction in having tech founders muse about how to build better cities from places that bear little resemblance to lively cities at all.The tech industry also thrives by working in ways that can be incompatible with public-sector city building.Its hard to move fast and break things in government, and public funds dont allow for the failure rates that venture capital does.New tech products are often targeted to early adopters, and they spread to the rest of us later.But you cant do that with innovations in public service; if the tech savvy get the nicer bus routes or the new Wi-Fi kiosks first, that raises equity issues for the rest of the city.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Theres also the hitch that cities are inherently organic and unpredictable.They resist omniscient engineering.And past efforts at doing that whether through the urban renewal of individual neighborhoods or the wholesale development of utopias have invariably failed for that reason.Many intractable urban problems are in fact not engineering problems at all, including the ones that most look like it.Housing is very expensive in a place like San Francisco not because we havent developed the right engineering methods to build it more cheaply.Unaffordable housing is largely a political problem we havent developed the societal consensus to build enough of it.Sidewalk Labs, to its credit, has internalized many of these criticisms.The company, formed by Google two years ago, has pointedly been based in New York City and not Silicon Valley.Its staffed by both technologists and government alums.Its leader, the former New York City deputy mayor Dan Doctoroff, openly acknowledges the gulf between technologists and city government types.And Sidewalk Labs says it wants to bridge the two.Photo We all collectively see cities as about friction: good friction and bad friction, Mr. Doctoroff told me not long after Sidewalk Labs started.Good friction is serendipity, its opportunity, its diversity, its seeing 40 different nationalities on the subway as you commute in the morning.Bad friction is congestion, its pollution.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The technologists temptation may be to try to build a city from scratch, with none of that friction.And especially without the greatest friction of all, politics.In Toronto, Sidewalk Labs is looking at something between a blank slate and New York City: a sizable plot of land to develop thats still part of a city large enough that any successful ideas could ultimately spread.Because its looking at a neighborhood and not just a typical developers parcel, Sidewalk Labs can play with all the infrastructure that connects those parcels the utility grid, the street network, the sidewalks.But there would be no point in doing all that if there werent thousands of people nearby ready to move in, as is the case in rapidly growing Toronto.(Google also announced Tuesday that it would move its Canadian headquarters, which are in Toronto, into the first pilot phase of the development.)The challenge now amid all the carbon-neutral, internet-enabled robot-monitor sensors will be to keep those humans in mind.
Trumps Attack on Insurer Gravy Train Could Actually Help a Lot of Consumers:::::The insurer-regulator hack will mean that navigating the Obamacare marketplace will be more complicated for consumers (more on that later).And the change will cost taxpayers more money perhaps $21 billion more in 2018 alone.But, in the end, most customers will be unharmed by the presidents decision, and a substantial fraction will be better off, able to buy plans for about the same price they pay now, yet with lower deductibles.The presidents move was to cut off a form of Obamacare funding known as the cost-sharing reduction subsidies.Those were payments the government made to health insurers to compensate them for lowering the deductibles and co-payments for low-income customers.But he didnt cut off another, more important form of subsidy.The Affordable Care Act also includes tax credits that help low- and middle-income Americans pay their insurance premiums.Those tax credits increase in value along with the price of a certain midlevel insurance plan, known as silver.If you qualify for a subsidy, you can never be asked to pay more for that plan than a set fraction of your income.Insurers in more than 40 states have decided to compensate for the missing cost-sharing subsidies by making hefty increases to the prices of this silver plan but small or no increases to their other plans.Consumers who qualify for subsidies are still asked to pay the same fraction of their income toward a health plan, and the federal government pays the insurers the rest of the higher silver-plan premium.So consumers are no worse off, and insurers make up for the loss of the cost-sharing subsidies canceled by Mr. Trump.And for many Obamacare consumers, theres also a silver lining in these pricier silver plans.There are other kinds of plans being sold on the marketplace: high-deductible plans called bronze and low-deductible plans called gold and platinum.Consumers can use their subsidy to buy any color plan they like.And, with the price of silver plans rising faster than the other categories, most consumers with subsidies will now be able to buy a lower-deductible health plan for the same price as the silver plans that are currently most popular on the exchanges.(They can also choose to buy high-deductible bronze plans for very low prices, or in some cases get them free.)This was a backdoor, unintended way of increasing premium subsidies for some people, said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group.The new pricing structure is the worst for people who earn too much to qualify for a subsidy those earning more than four times the federal poverty level, or about $100,000 a year for a family of four.But most of them will also be protected from the cost increases.If they avoid silver plans sold on the Obamacare marketplaces in most states, they can find plans that dont have the special, Trump-prompted increases.That means that unsubsidized customers who want to buy silver plans will probably need to shop outside of HealthCare.gov, through a human or online broker.Or they can buy a bronze, gold or platinum plan.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its a convoluted kludge of a workaround, said David Anderson, a research associate at the Duke University Margolis Center for Health Policy, who has looked closely at how carriers are pricing their plans.But Mr. Anderson said he thought the upside was strong enough that Congress should abandon its efforts to restore the canceled subsidies.A lot of people are going to see during open enrollment that they are going to be able to afford a better plan with lower deductibles and lower premiums than they could this year, he said.There are still downsides.It is possible that insurers, worried about the lost payments and thin on trust for the federal government, will flee the markets before the enrollment period starts at the beginning of next month.But no major insurer departures have been announced since the president announced his decision on Thursday.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.There are a few states where insurance regulators didnt allow insurers to increase only their silver plan prices.In those states, subsidized customers will be held harmless but no one will get a cheaper gold plan, and unsubsidized customers will face price increases.There are some states where there is no individual market outside the Obamacare marketplace, and in those places, unsubsidized customers wont be able to get a good deal on a silver plan (though they can still buy another color plan).Perhaps the biggest problem: Shopping for a plan is going to be harder.Many Obamacare customers who just renew this years plan will be passing up a better deal, and many scared of initial sticker shock may not realize there are cheaper options.In addition to eliminating the cost-sharing reduction subsidies, President Trumps administration has also cut back on funds for advertising about the marketplaces and on professionals who help customers sign up.(The Alexander-Murray deal would restore much of that funding, but probably not soon enough to make a big difference.)Its hard, said Lori Lodes, a former Obama administration official and co-founder of a new nonprofit group, Get America Covered, focused on helping spread the word about Obamacare enrollment.She says she worries about growing consumer confusion: My biggest concern is really I do not believe that the administration will educate people about this, and so there is going to be an information gap.But the Congressional Budget Office, when considering the effects of ending the cost-sharing subsidies a few months ago, concluded that, over time, the strategy of raising the price of only silver plans would become widespread, and that consumers would figure it out.It estimated that, by 2020, a world with no cost-sharing reductions would be a world with fewer uninsured Americans.The increased subsidies would make purchasing nongroup insurance more attractive for some people, increasing sign-ups, the report said.Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murrays newly announced proposal would fund the payments for two years, increase advertising for the marketplaces and make it easier for states to experiment on how they run their insurance markets.Mr. Trump has indicated that he might sign such a bill.But the deal, even if it does pass Congress, comes too late to affect insurance prices for next year.In 2018, at least, we will be living in a world of high-priced silver plans.Luckily for those who need insurance, that may not turn out as badly as many people had feared.
How a Healthy Economy Can Shorten Life Spans:::::Its a different story with agricultural economies.The Cutler, Huang and Lleras-Muney study, published as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, found that mortality rates fall when such economies are growing.Before 1945, when agriculture was more dominant in the United States economy, growth was not associated with rising mortality either.Photo Other research published in the journal Health Economics supports the pollution hypothesis.In their analysis of the Great Recession in Europe, Jos Tapia Granados of Drexel University and Edward Ionides of the University of Michigan found that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a one percent lower mortality rate for respiratory illnesses, as well as reductions in mortality for cardiovascular disease and heart conditions, which are known to be sensitive to air pollution.In countries where the recession was more severe the Baltic States, Spain, Greece and Slovenia respiratory disease mortality fell 16 percent during 2007-2010, compared with just a 3.2 percent decline in the four years preceding the recession.Other factors contribute to rising mortality during expansions.Occupational hazards and stress can directly harm health through work.Some studies find that alcohol and tobacco consumption increases during booms, too.Both are associated with higher death rates.Also, employed people drive more, increasing mortality from auto accidents.During recessions, people without jobs may have more time to sleep and exercise and may eat more healthfully.One study found that higher unemployment is associated with lower rates of obesity, increased physical activity and a better diet.On the other hand, suicides increase during economic downturns.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Some recent work suggests that economic booms may have become less deadly and busts more so in recent years.This could be a result of less polluting production in modern, expanding economies, or of better medical care for those with conditions sensitive to pollution.Safer roads and cars, and less driving under the influence of alcohol and other substances, could also play a role.Its also possible that opioids and other drugs may have made recessions more harmful to health than they used to be, Mr. Cutler said.Other analysis shows that although smaller economic booms increase mortality, larger ones decrease it.Japans economic booms in the 1960s and 1970s are associated with longer life spans there, for example.Serious and lengthy downturns like the Great Depression are associated with shorter lives, even as smaller ones lengthen them.Wealthier nations are healthier nations, an effect seen across generations.People in their formative years children and teenagers are particularly sensitive to the economic environment.Conditions in utero can have lasting health and economic effects.Graduating from college during a recession can depress ones earnings for a decade.People growing up during a strong economy are more likely to have access to resources and to develop skills and opportunities that promote health.These benefits can last a lifetime, increasing longevity.In total, theres little question that long-term economic growth broadly improves the human condition.But not everyone enjoys the gains equally.In the short run, economic expansions can cut short the lives of some.
Is Uber Helping or Hurting Mass Transit?:::::In new survey data, though, there are some provocative patterns.Researchers at the U.C.Davis Institute of Transportation Studies surveyed 2,000 people about their travel behavior in seven major metro areas, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and including people who live in their suburbs and those who dont use these services.Photo The results suggest that ride-hailing draws people away from public transit.And the authors, Regina Clewlow and Gouri Shankar Mishra, estimate that 49 percent to 61 percent of ride-hailing trips either wouldnt have been made at all if these apps didnt exist, or would have been made by foot, biking or transit.All of those trips, in other words, added cars to the road that otherwise wouldnt have been there.That picture implies that Uber and the like could make traffic worse.And lets further assume that many of those trips additionally require drivers to cruise around waiting for rides, and to deadhead occasionally after the rides are over (to return to, say, the airport with an empty back seat).Among people who use these apps, 3 percent said they rode heavy rail like subway systems more since starting to ride-hail.Thats consistent with the idea that apps could help you travel the last mile home from the train if you dont live near a stop, or that they could help you cobble together transportation options once you ditch your own car.But 6 percent said they rode the bus less, and 3 percent said the same of light rail.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Among the most common reasons people gave for turning away from transit: Service was too slow or unreliable.It potentially does not bode well for public transit, then, that just as these apps are growing more dominant, transit systems in cities like New York, Washington and San Francisco are facing deep problems.In New York, where other data has also suggested that ride-hailing lures riders away from public transit, officials have speculated about Ubers role in recent declining subway ridership.Austin, Tex., offers another intriguing case study.In May 2016, Uber and Lyft temporarily pulled out of the city over a new law that required the companies to submit drivers to fingerprint background checks.Their departure created a natural experiment, and afterward researchers at the University of Michigan, Texas A&M and Columbia University surveyed Austin residents about how the change affected their travel behavior.Asked about the last trip riders took with Uber and Lyft, 3 percent said they took similar trips afterward by public transit instead (Austin has much lower transit usage in general than New York).That also implies some substitution.Further complicating this picture, 9 percent said they bought a personal car as a result of the change.The bulk of the evidence so far shows that these services dont inherently make transportation more efficient at the level of an entire city, even if they have the potential to.They may make your travel more efficient, because you dont have to hunt for a parking spot or wait for the bus.But when you aggregate the behavior of many people, transportation becomes less efficient when transit riders switch to cars, when new car services entice people onto trips they wouldnt otherwise have taken, or when people who give up their cars wind up traveling even more in someone elses.Its equally not preordained that these apps will make traffic worse, or that they must come at the expense of public transit.If more people left their solo cars for car-pooled ride-hailing, rather than leaving public buses for solo Uber rides, that would reduce the number of cars on the road and the miles they travel.If transit agencies partnered with these companies, as some have begun to try doing, ride-hailing could fill niches that trains and buses dont handle well, like late-night journeys, transit for riders with disabilities, and suburban service.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Theres this potential opportunity for policy makers, city planners and these firms themselves to find solutions where were steering toward that future, Ms. Clewlow said.Its unlikely well get there by chance, though.
Paul Ryan begins a make-or-break push for tax legislation  and his future:::::Asked on Oct. 26 about President Trump's involvement in the tax plan, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) joked about Trump being "in Asia" during the tax plan reveal and said that they're working together closely to prevent "surprises."(Reuters) Asked on Oct. 26 about President Trump's involvement in the tax plan, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) joked about Trump being "in Asia" during the tax plan reveal and said that they're working together closely to prevent "surprises."(Reuters) Paul D. Ryan has drifted a long way from the soaring rhetoric he delivered on his first day as House speaker.Nothing could be more inspiring than a job well done, he said after claiming the gavel.Nothing could stir the heart more than real, concrete results.Now, the Wisconsin Republican is more likely to sound like a hardened realist, cracking jokes about how little gets done and even poking fun at himself.As the guest speaker at a black-tie gala Wednesday, Ryan exhorted the media to keep your heads up despite poor approval ratings.It could be a whole lot worse, he said.They could be my approval ratings.Exactly two years ago Sunday, on Oct. 29, 2015, Ryan, then 45, succeeded Republican John A. Boehner of Ohio, then 65, with an aura of generational change and a promise of policy-focused leadership.So far, he hasnt delivered.Even after Republicans claimed control of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue in January, Ryan is still searching for a signature achievement.His enemies and allies alike say he needs a big win, soon.The coming week brings what may shape up as his last, best chance to achieve one and the most important moment of his 19-year congressional career: the debut of legislation to rewrite the tax code.House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announce plans for tax legislation in September.(Melina Mara/The Washington Post) Taxes are supposed to be Ryans issue, his policy wheelhouse.As the disciple of the 1980s fiscal conservative Jack Kemp, Ryans rhetoric is never loftier than when espousing free-market principles and the belief that lower taxes and a streamlined code can help businesses, the economy and even the impoverished.He has craved this moment.He also has good reason to dread it.A major question is whether much has changed since an unruly House Republican Conference, as the caucus is known, forced Boehner out and ground governance to a halt.The conference remains deeply turbulent under Ryan and divided, particularly on the issues of taxes, spending and the national debt.Failure to advance tax legislation even if defeat comes in the Senate, as happened in July with legislation to revise the Affordable Care Act would be crippling.One possibility if Republicans head into 2018 having to explain why they failed on both health care and taxes: a political bloodbath that drops the GOP into the minority and boots Ryan off the dais.The 115th Congress, if we go zero for two, gets a failing grade, said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), the leader of one of the Houses conservative caucuses.I think a lot of us may not come back.Tax reform, in Ryans ideal, was supposed to be bigger than tax cuts.It was supposed to be revenue-neutral lowering some taxes, raising others, closing loopholes and simplifying the code.It wasnt supposed to be so easy to criticize for lowering taxes on corporations and higher-income Americans.President Trump has complicated the challenge by rejecting Ryans branding of tax reform instead calling the effort tax cuts and sometimes tax cuts plus.The president may not be wrong about that distinction, but he has contributed to a mashed-up message on what the bill would actually do, whom it would benefit and importantly, how much it would cost.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Oct. 25 compared the tax reform process to whitewater rafting.and said it's about to hit "Class V rapids."(Reuters) [On taxes, Trump is an eager salesman but the policy action is on the Hill] Even modest tax legislation would in some ways fulfill Ryans calling and offer some much needed momentum to Republicans heading into potentially difficult midterm elections next year.But it requires something that the GOP caucus has long been loath to consider: compromise.In the Boehner days, the grand bargains that Republican leaders sought with then-President Barack Obama frequently ended in ignominious defeat.Skeptics remain dubious that this years bargain will end any differently.I think the broken process has not been fixed, and there are some aspects that have gotten worse over the past few years, Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), a member of the rebellious Freedom Caucus.[Major divisions remain as GOP nears its tax deadline] One problem, Amash said, is that Ryans promise of a bottom-up approach has not materialized.Ryan has won some credit for earlier engagement with the GOPs restive wings, including a weekly lunch with representatives of the Freedom Caucus, Walkers Republican Study Committee and the moderate Tuesday Group.But as Amash noted, It doesnt mean they are actually taking our input.Unlike past years, the GOP moderate wing is a big part of Ryans challenge.Aspirational and even wonky ideas repealing the ACA, for instance were easier to vote for with the certainty of an Obama veto across town.Voting on legislation that could become law is harder and moderates have put up a bigger fight this year, on both health care and taxes, than in any of the previous six years of the House GOPs tenure in the majority.These moderates nearly defeated the budget outline that passed Thursday, including enabling language to pass a tax bill, because the emerging tax proposal might eliminate the federal deduction for state and local taxes a big hit to workers in the blue states where many of these moderate lawmakers live.If you have the Freedom Caucus, and you have New York and New Jersey, youre talking about two opposite ends of the spectrum and a president who sometimes goes his own way, said Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.), who voted against the budget outline.In the Trump era, no one seems particularly happy with Ryan.Some in the conservative intelligentsia, who spent years promoting him, have turned against him for not denouncing whom they see as an anti-intellectual president who rejects Kemps free-market, supply-side philosophy.Staunch Trump supporters dont trust Ryan because of his wobbly support during the 2016 campaign.Democrats now suspect that Ryan, historically unpopular in national polling, might be a more effective boogeyman than Trump in TV ads against Republican incumbents.Liberal satirists have published a 192-page parody magazine devoted to mocking Ryan, poking fun at the most unpopular politician in America and his image as thoughtful policy prince who never delivers.And yet Ryan still has strong support from the people who matter most in keeping his job: House Republicans even those facing tough campaigns next year.Speaker Ryan is always welcome in New Jersey.Hes always welcome in New Jersey, said moderate Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.).Ryan, married with young children, dreaded that part of the job when he took the post two years ago the endless fundraising and travel.But hes blown away the very high cash levels that Boehner hauled in, in part because big donors prefer talking to a high-profile former vice-presidential nominee over the genial but less meaty Boehner.In a cruel twist, failure to enact policy could be Ryans downfall.For the past 30 years, every speaker, Democrat or Republican, has left the job on bad terms, either losing the majority or being chased out by their own party.Ryan will find out soon whether hes about to continue that trend.If were still batting zero on these large items, when it comes to next year, I dont think hell be by himself, said Walker.I think a lot of us will be in trouble.Read more from Paul Kanes archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.
Trump brags of successful outcome Obama initiated:::::Weve done more against ISIS in nine months than the previous administration has done during its whole administration by far, by far.President Trump, in remarks before the Value Voters Summit, Oct. 13, 2017 President Trump has made a variation of this claim repeatedly over the months, starting in July, when he proclaimed: In five months we have done more against ISIS than anybodys done since the beginning, and we are having tremendous success with that.Every month since then, he has repeated the claim, simply updating the number of months.For instance, on Sept. 7, he said, We have done better in eight months of my presidency than the previous eight years against ISIS.(Never mind that the Islamic State terror group emerged as a significant force in Iraq and Syria in 2013, when it captured and raised its flag over Fallujah.)Now, in the wake of the terror groups loss of its de facto capital of Raqqa, Syria, the president is taking yet another victory lap.It raises the question: Has the Trump administration done more in its short term in office than the administration of Barack Obama?The Facts The Islamic State can ultimately be traced back to a group called al-Qaeda in Iraq, which was started by a Jordanian terrorist named Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and arose in response to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.(Trump supported the invasion of Iraq, though he falsely denies that now.)Eventually, al-Qaeda in Iraq had more or less petered out, but the civil war in Syria that started in 2011 breathed new life into what had become a moribund organization, since it led to a vacuum of governance in the country.The Islamic State then moved into Iraq, in part because of Obamas decision to withdraw troops in 2011.(Trump had urged a rapid withdrawal at the time but he ignores that now when he criticizes Obama for this decision.)Then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, in his 2014 memoir Worthy Fights, said he warned Obama that without U.S. troops in place, Iraq could become a new haven for terrorists.Another factor in the rise of the Islamic State was the rampant mismanagement by the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, which greatly degraded the Iraqi military and exacerbated tensions between Sunnis and Shiites.The Islamic State reached its height of control in late 2014, with defense consultant IHS Janes estimating a reach of 35,000 square miles in January 2015.On Sept. 10, 2014, Obama announced the formation of an international coalition to defeat the Islamic State, and a month later the Defense Department formally established Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve, which coordinates the activities of 73 nations in the mission.(Most of them do not contribute to warfighting but are expected to help with stabilization efforts in cleared areas.)U.S. defense advisers then had to train and arm Iraqi security forces from the ground up.After three years, their performance has improved considerably, experts said.A White House official told The Fact Checker the president was referring to the rate of liberation under his watch, both in terms of people and land.From September 2014 through January 2017, land was liberated at a rate of 1,071 miles a month, versus 2,330 a month under Trump, he said.By the time Trump took office, Islamic State territory had fallen to 23,000 square miles, according to Janes.As of June of this year, the Islamic State controlled 14,000 square miles and it has fallen further since.Far more of the liberation of territory, in square miles, took place before Trump took office, including the recapture of east Mosul as well as cities across Anbar province (Fallujah) and key Syrian cities such as Manbij that controlled the Turkish-Syrian frontier.Indeed, the plan that resulted in the liberation of Mosul and Raqqa was launched under Obama, and there wasnt much change other than looser rules of engagement with regard to striking targets of opportunity, resulting in an increased tempo.The assault on Raqqa began in November two months before Trump took office, using the same coalition that ultimately captured the city.There is no doubt that the Trump administration followed the basic strategy set in place by the Obama administration, said Michael Morell, former deputy director of the CIA.There is no doubt that Obama would have gotten where Trump is at this moment as well.There were no significant changes in the overall plan in combating ISIS, said Ali Soufan, chief executive of the Soufan Group, and a former FBI agent who specialized in international terrorism cases.What we are witnessing today is mostly the fruits of what the former administration started.Morell added there is a compelling argument that some tactical changes made by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, such as more Special Forces on the ground and putting them closer to the fight, resulted in an acceleration of the coalition meeting its objectives.Trump also allowed commanders on the ground to make some battlefield decisions, avoiding micromanagement from Washington.(One example often cited by U.S. officials is when Syrian Democratic Forces requested the use of V-22 Osprey aircraft to cross Lake Assad to surprise militants in the town of Tabqa, which was approved on the spot without getting buy-in from the White House.)Another tactical shift was a campaign of annihilation surrounding cities held by militants that has ensured no militants will escape from cities.Obamas defense secretary, Ash Carter, had left an escape route for militants to minimize destruction to cities and deaths of civilians.Human rights groups have protested the change in tactics, saying more civilians have been killed under Trump than under Obama.Statistics from U.S. Central Command suggest the number of civilians killed has more than tripled under Trump, from 199 between 2014 and 2016 to 786 as of Oct. 26, with 519 more cases still under investigation.Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies dismissed land as a fairly useless metric given most of the territory is desert.He said other metrics, such as air power, also bolstered the case Obama had done more.According to Cordesmans calculations, coalition forces have flown 63,758 sorties, of which 23 percent were flown under Trump.As for air munitions used, coalition forces dropped 65,731 in 2014-2016 versus 36,351 in 2017.That amounts to 36 percent under Trump.Obama set up virtually all the structure that did the key fighting under Trump, Cordesman said.He attributed Trumps claims of dramatic success as akin to saying nothing happened in Europe until the allies in the West crossed the Rhine and entered Germany on March 7, 1945.Obama fashioned the strategy, the alliances and assembled the forces to destroy the caliphate, but the culmination of the process has occurred on Trumps watch, said Bruce Reidel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Its a good example of Trump keeping Obama policy basically intact, not dramatically altering it.Now the territorial battle is coming to a close and the much harder ideological conflict is still to be won; that is Trumps challenge.The Pinocchio Test A president taking credit for a successful outcome started by his predecessor is a time-honored tradition.Obama certainly claimed repeatedly that he saved General Motors during the Great Recession, even though he built on steps first taken by George W. Bush.That still does not make it right.Trump exacerbates the braggadocio by specifically saying he has done by far more than Obama, even though he inherited a structure and plan developed by Obama.Experts credit Trump with some tactical shifts that may have stepped up the tempo though the number of civilian deaths has soared as a result.In reality, according to several metrics, more was done under Obama.Trump earns Three Pinocchios.
Paul Ryan begins a make-or-break push for tax legislation  and his future:::::Asked on Oct. 26 about President Trump's involvement in the tax plan, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) joked about Trump being "in Asia" during the tax plan reveal and said that they're working together closely to prevent "surprises."(Reuters) Asked on Oct. 26 about President Trump's involvement in the tax plan, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) joked about Trump being "in Asia" during the tax plan reveal and said that they're working together closely to prevent "surprises."(Reuters) Paul D. Ryan has drifted a long way from the soaring rhetoric he delivered on his first day as House speaker.Nothing could be more inspiring than a job well done, he said after claiming the gavel.Nothing could stir the heart more than real, concrete results.Now, the Wisconsin Republican is more likely to sound like a hardened realist, cracking jokes about how little gets done and even poking fun at himself.As the guest speaker at a black-tie gala Wednesday, Ryan exhorted the media to keep your heads up despite poor approval ratings.It could be a whole lot worse, he said.They could be my approval ratings.Exactly two years ago Sunday, on Oct. 29, 2015, Ryan, then 45, succeeded Republican John A. Boehner of Ohio, then 65, with an aura of generational change and a promise of policy-focused leadership.So far, he hasnt delivered.Even after Republicans claimed control of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue in January, Ryan is still searching for a signature achievement.His enemies and allies alike say he needs a big win, soon.The coming week brings what may shape up as his last, best chance to achieve one and the most important moment of his 19-year congressional career: the debut of legislation to rewrite the tax code.House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announce plans for tax legislation in September.(Melina Mara/The Washington Post) Taxes are supposed to be Ryans issue, his policy wheelhouse.As the disciple of the 1980s fiscal conservative Jack Kemp, Ryans rhetoric is never loftier than when espousing free-market principles and the belief that lower taxes and a streamlined code can help businesses, the economy and even the impoverished.He has craved this moment.He also has good reason to dread it.A major question is whether much has changed since an unruly House Republican Conference, as the caucus is known, forced Boehner out and ground governance to a halt.The conference remains deeply turbulent under Ryan and divided, particularly on the issues of taxes, spending and the national debt.Failure to advance tax legislation even if defeat comes in the Senate, as happened in July with legislation to revise the Affordable Care Act would be crippling.One possibility if Republicans head into 2018 having to explain why they failed on both health care and taxes: a political bloodbath that drops the GOP into the minority and boots Ryan off the dais.The 115th Congress, if we go zero for two, gets a failing grade, said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), the leader of one of the Houses conservative caucuses.I think a lot of us may not come back.Tax reform, in Ryans ideal, was supposed to be bigger than tax cuts.It was supposed to be revenue-neutral lowering some taxes, raising others, closing loopholes and simplifying the code.It wasnt supposed to be so easy to criticize for lowering taxes on corporations and higher-income Americans.President Trump has complicated the challenge by rejecting Ryans branding of tax reform instead calling the effort tax cuts and sometimes tax cuts plus.The president may not be wrong about that distinction, but he has contributed to a mashed-up message on what the bill would actually do, whom it would benefit and importantly, how much it would cost.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Oct. 25 compared the tax reform process to whitewater rafting.and said it's about to hit "Class V rapids."(Reuters) [On taxes, Trump is an eager salesman but the policy action is on the Hill] Even modest tax legislation would in some ways fulfill Ryans calling and offer some much needed momentum to Republicans heading into potentially difficult midterm elections next year.But it requires something that the GOP caucus has long been loath to consider: compromise.In the Boehner days, the grand bargains that Republican leaders sought with then-President Barack Obama frequently ended in ignominious defeat.Skeptics remain dubious that this years bargain will end any differently.I think the broken process has not been fixed, and there are some aspects that have gotten worse over the past few years, Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), a member of the rebellious Freedom Caucus.[Major divisions remain as GOP nears its tax deadline] One problem, Amash said, is that Ryans promise of a bottom-up approach has not materialized.Ryan has won some credit for earlier engagement with the GOPs restive wings, including a weekly lunch with representatives of the Freedom Caucus, Walkers Republican Study Committee and the moderate Tuesday Group.But as Amash noted, It doesnt mean they are actually taking our input.Unlike past years, the GOP moderate wing is a big part of Ryans challenge.Aspirational and even wonky ideas repealing the ACA, for instance were easier to vote for with the certainty of an Obama veto across town.Voting on legislation that could become law is harder and moderates have put up a bigger fight this year, on both health care and taxes, than in any of the previous six years of the House GOPs tenure in the majority.These moderates nearly defeated the budget outline that passed Thursday, including enabling language to pass a tax bill, because the emerging tax proposal might eliminate the federal deduction for state and local taxes a big hit to workers in the blue states where many of these moderate lawmakers live.If you have the Freedom Caucus, and you have New York and New Jersey, youre talking about two opposite ends of the spectrum and a president who sometimes goes his own way, said Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.), who voted against the budget outline.In the Trump era, no one seems particularly happy with Ryan.Some in the conservative intelligentsia, who spent years promoting him, have turned against him for not denouncing whom they see as an anti-intellectual president who rejects Kemps free-market, supply-side philosophy.Staunch Trump supporters dont trust Ryan because of his wobbly support during the 2016 campaign.Democrats now suspect that Ryan, historically unpopular in national polling, might be a more effective boogeyman than Trump in TV ads against Republican incumbents.Liberal satirists have published a 192-page parody magazine devoted to mocking Ryan, poking fun at the most unpopular politician in America and his image as thoughtful policy prince who never delivers.And yet Ryan still has strong support from the people who matter most in keeping his job: House Republicans even those facing tough campaigns next year.Speaker Ryan is always welcome in New Jersey.Hes always welcome in New Jersey, said moderate Rep.

Jeff Flake knew his criticism of Trump would cost him. He couldnt stop himself.:::::Jeff Flakes mind and President Trumps leadership have been taking the Arizona senator in opposite directions all year.Flake said he found himself appalled, again and again, by the presidents boorish behavior and penchant for picking personal fights so much so that he felt compelled to publicly criticize Trump directly, in the press and in a best-selling book.Flake could see the beginnings of political damage during the 2016 presidential campaign, when he first raised doubts about Trump.His decision to retire when his term ends next year, which he announced Tuesday in a dramatic floor speech, came after reams of polling data showed he would lose decisively in a Republican primary battle next year, when he probably would have faced a pro-Trump challenger.But ultimately, Flake said, there was not a single trigger for the decision.If anything, he held on because he is a strong supporter of most of Trumps policies and personnel decisions.He voted for his judicial nominees, his regulatory rollbacks and the GOP health-care plan.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said on Oct. 24 that he will not seek reelection in 2018.Flake said the Republican Party under President Trump is at risk of becoming a fearful, backward-looking minority party.(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) I knew that when I spoke out at that time that I was out of step with a lot of the Republican primary voters, but I felt that I had to do it, he said in an interview.I had hoped and I still hope and Im confident at some point that the fever will break.But it just became more and more apparent that it certainly wasnt going to break by next year.Even if he survived the primary, neither Flake nor others in his orbit deny that the same polling showed he might also have lost the general election to his presumed Democratic opponent, popular Phoenix-area congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema.But it was his disgust with Trumps behavior that proved decisive in his decision to call it quits.I couldnt sleep at night having to embrace the president or condoning his behavior or being okay with some of his positions, he said.I just couldnt do it it was never in the cards.Flakes retirement is not directly tied to the feud between Republican Party leaders and former White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon who is waging a populist war against the GOP establishment but he is a battlefield casualty.The fight he picked with Trump followed years of cooperation with Democrats on immigration policy, global trade deals and reestablishing diplomatic ties to Cuba.Such cooperation is unacceptable to Arizonas most die-hard Republicans.Democrats are saying, See, the Republican Party is falling apart.Then theres the Breitbart Trump people looking at this and thinking, Donald Trump is pushing these RINOs out, said Jarrod White, a longtime party activist who was an Arizona delegate to the Republican National Convention last year, referring to Republicans in Name Only.The truth of the matter is, Jeff Flake is down by double digits in the polls against Kelli Ward.He knows hes not going to win.I think he chose to quit and be dignified and get his final lashes out at Trump.Ward is a former Republican state senator who unsuccessfully challenged Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) last year, accusing him of being past his prime and insufficiently conservative.Just days after the presidential election ended last year, Ward launched her campaign against Flake raising similar concerns about his conservative bona fides.The attacks worked.For now, shes the only GOP Senate candidate.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) walks with his wife, Cheryl, after his surprise retirement announcement, on Oct. 24, 2017, in the Russell Senate Office Building.(Matt McClain/The Washington Post) Ward and her aides did not return multiple requests for comment.But Doug McKee, the head of KelliPAC a group independent of her campaign that first launched during her 2016 bid against McCain said Ward is drawing attention because Flake seems to be a lot more in step with what the Democrats views are as opposed to what the Arizona Republican Party is looking for.A GOP strategist whos reviewed polling in the race concluded that in Arizona and elsewhere, the attacks on Trump are totally unsustainable for anyone.You dont have to be best friends with the guy, but you cant do what Flake did.The old rules still apply local issues matter, said the strategist, who asked for anonymity to speak frankly about Republican dynamics, but the Trump image is the new preeminent test of whether you satisfy the desires of Republican conservative primary voters.Flakes public contortions were apparent throughout the year.In a March interview, he praised Trumps pick of Neil M. Gorsuch to serve as a U.S. Supreme Court justice.A conservative jurist from the West was exactly what Flake wanted to see on the high court.He was also impressed by how the White House introduced Gorsuch to the country in a crisply delivered prime-time address by Trump with GOP senators in the White House East Room to meet the nominee and sing his praises to reporters afterward.It was well done, it really was, both in style and in substance its a really good pick, Flake said at the time.[From March: Home stretch for Trumps Supreme Court nominee could forever alter the Senate] The balancing act and overtures continued in May, when he told constituents back home that he looked forward to working with Trump on confirming other conservative picks to run federal agencies.The president has assembled a pretty good Cabinet.Hes surrounded himself with a good group of people, Flake said during a tour of a nuclear power plant, citing picks for regulatory agencies in particular.But under questioning by a voter at an event in Glendale, Ariz., he said I have a hard time believing that a GOP-controlled Congress could fulfill Trumps wish to quickly pass health-care reform.When a hospital employee asked about how to save the Medicaid program, Flake said, Were trying to find that balance, and we arent close yet, frankly.But Flake voted for the GOP health-care reform plan, even as McCain famously voted no.[From May: Do Republicans who criticize Trump face peril?Jeff Flake is about to find out.]Then Congress went home for August recess and Flake published his best-selling treatise, Conscience of a Conservative, which leveled a blistering attack on Trump.The president responded by relentlessly going after the senator on Twitter.He then announced plans to visit Phoenix for a campaign-style event with speculation building that Trump could endorse Ward or another Flake challenger.It wasnt the Trump rally, but it was two weeks of media coverage leading up to that rally, where the media said Trump is going to come out and bash Flake and endorse someone else, said a Flake confidant, who asked for anonymity to maintain his close relationship with the senator.It was millions of dollars in earned media that basically said, Jeff Flake is going to get roasted by Trump.And then he came out here and that didnt happen.Frosty Taylor, a Republican activist and the editor of a daily email newsletter for thousands of Republicans in Maricopa County, Ariz., warned at the time that most of her readers were disenchanted with Flake.They want him replaced.Theyre just not happy with him, she said in August.Hes not following the way they want him to vote.Hes voting with Democrats on a lot of issues.Hes following John McCains lead on a lot of stuff thats a problem here for a lot of people.Flakes retirement announcement Tuesday came just minutes after Trump left a luncheon with Republican senators.He had talked about the race generally with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), but Flake said he didnt give him much advanced warning.He also didnt call his longtime friend and ideological brother-in-arms, Vice President Pence, with whom he once served in the House.I didnt want to put him in a bad position of knowing that and not sharing it.Hes a trusted friend, Flake said of Pence but the two havent spoken since the announcement.Flake warned that while his criticism of the president helped lead to his downfall, GOP candidates should also be wary of embracing him too tightly.Any Republican who simply aligns themselves for the purpose of the primary with the president on every issue and basically contracts out any thinking on policy issues, and is willing to condone any behavior that the president exhibits I think they put themselves at great risk in a general election, he said.Now free of campaign politics for the first time in 18 years, Flake is focused on how to make his last months in office meaningful while enjoying his newfound political freedom.I dont have any fundraising calls to make, he said.That in itself is a pretty good feeling.Read more at PowerPost
Republicans horrible week (and not-great year) was entirely predictable:::::Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said on Oct. 24 that he will not run for reelection in 2018.Flake said the GOP is at risk of becoming a "fearful, backward-looking minority party."(U.S. Senate) Nine months into gaining full control of Washington, Republicans are not where they hoped theyd be.Very far from it, actually.They have no major legislative accomplishments to tout.After this week, they are tipping into a civil war.And early polls suggest voters would rather elect a generic Democrat than a generic Republican in next years congressional elections.All of this was entirely predictable not that there was much Republican leaders could do about it.And yes, Im referring to President Trump.But Republicans fracturing was evident long before Trump rode down that escalator in Trump Tower two and a half years ago.I think were trying to figure out when Republicans are either going to hit rock bottom or make the party great again, said Doug Heye, a former top Republican House aide and GOP consultant.And to me, Trump is a symptom of that as much as he is a current cause.Lets run down three main reasons that the difficult week Republicans just had and the not-great year theyre still having were entirely predictable.1.Trump is Trump.After Trump got elected, congressional Republicans made a decision to forget the campaign.The ninth Supreme Court seat, repealing Obamacare and passing the first tax bill in decades all took precedence over all the negatives that come with Trump, including the Access Hollywood tape, Trump's unpredictability, his rhetoric toward the GOP in the campaign and his fundamental opposition to traditional Republican positions on issues such as trade policy.But Trump wouldnt let them forget.Day by day, he proved many Republicans worst fears about him.A short list: 1.Hes very defensive and prides himself on counterpunching regardless of whether the criticism is coming from within his own party.2.He demands loyalty without returning it and casts Republicans as the reason for his failures without apparent consideration of his own role.3.Hes an untrustworthy dealmaker who can flip positions at a moments notice.4.Hes not ideological and has little grasp of policy.Republicans hoped against all evidence that Trump would change his ways after the campaign and become more like them.Instead, over the past few weeks, weve heard some powerful Republicans proclaim they think Trump is a danger to American democracy.During a rally in Youngstown, Ohio, July 25, President Trump said he "can be more presidential" than all U.S. presidents except Abraham Lincoln.(The Washington Post) Trump is Trump, and Republicans voters and congressional leaders knew exactly what theyd be getting when he got elected: an erratic leader who thrives on chaos.Its hard to tell how serious he is, Alice Rivlin, a former Clinton administration official and economics and health-care policy analyst with the Brookings Institution, told The Fix in September.Hes made his deficit of trust bigger and bigger.2.They are trying to pass major social and economic reform legislation by themselves.After a majority of senators voted against the GOP "skinny repeal" health-care bill, July 28, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said it was "clearly a disappointing moment."(U.S. Senate) By themselves, I mean without incorporating Democrats, which limits the total number of votes they have to pass legislation.Pushing through major legislation on party line votes is also a political risk.One that is predictable.In 2010, Democrats passed Obamacare without any Republican votes, and they paid the political price.In the election immediately after Democrats passed Obamacare, they lost 63 seats in the House of Representatives.They have yet to win back the majority.Republicans arent heeding recent historys warnings.In the summer, they tried to push through an unpopular Obamacare repeal without any Democrats votes.After a few Republican defections, it failed by one vote in the Senate.Now, Republicans are trying the same party-line strategy on a tax bill.[Trump's bipartisan kick seems less than sincere] 3.The Republican Party is changing Tea party activists on Capitol Hill in 2013.(J. Scott Applewhite/AP) And has been happening for a while.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) retired this week because he determined he couldnt win a GOP primary as a Trump critic.He also said he thought the fever that is Trumpism would eventually break, just not in time for the 2018 election.Dont be so sure about that, says The Fixs Aaron Blake.Trumps anti-establishment and pro-culture war vigor have been in demand among the GOP base for the better part of the past decade.See: The tea party and all the controversial GOP Senate candidates that movement helped elevate.The irony is that Senate Republicans thought they had tamped down on that section of their party.Then Trump happened.They hadnt lost a primary race in five years until the fall in Alabama, where pro-Trump forces sided against them.Now, the Republican establishment is in a war against those same Trump forces for the soul of their party.Some Republicans think nothing less than their electoral future is on the line.I dont think we know if it is Trumps party yet, said Steve Bell, a former GOP Senate aide who is now with the Bipartisan Policy Center.If it becomes defined by him, though, we will be a minority party for many years.Republicans troubles were relatively easy to see coming: The tea party.Brushing aside hard lessons learned by Democrats on policymaking.Nominating Trump.For those reasons, if Republicans worst-case scenario happens, and they lose control of Washington, we can say that, too, was entirely predictable.
Washington Free Beacon reported an unknown GOP client funded Fusion GPS. It was the Beacon.:::::Fusion GPS is an opposition research firm run by ex-journalists, but how is it connected to the Trump dossier, Donald Trump Jr.'s Trump Tower meeting and the 2016 election?The Fact Checker's Glenn Kessler explains.(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) The Washington Free Beacon disclosed in congressional testimony on Friday that it is the mysterious client that initially paid for opposition research on Donald Trump performed by Fusion GPS, the firm that later worked with a former British spy to produce a dossier of claims about ties between Trump and Russia.Just three days earlier, the Free Beacon, a conservative news site founded in 2012, told its readers that before Democrats hired Fusion GPS in April 2016, the firm's work was funded by an unknown GOP client while the primary was still going on."The GOP client was not unknown not to the Free Beacon, anyway.The site's feigned ignorance would have led any reasonable reader to conclude, wrongly, that it was not involved in the work of Fusion GPS.Free Beacon editor in chief Matthew Continetti did not immediately respond to a Fix inquiry about his site's lack of disclosure.But he and Free Beacon chairman Michael Goldfarb posted a statement on the site Friday night, in which they said that the Free Beacon routinely has retained third-party firms to conduct research on many individuals and institutions of interest to us and our readers.In that capacity, they continued, during the 2016 election cycle, we retained Fusion GPS to provide research on multiple candidates in the Republican presidential primary, just as we retained other firms to assist in our research into Hillary Clinton.Continetti and Goldfarb said they did not know about Fusion GPS's subsequent work on behalf of Democrats during the general election.The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee contracted Fusion GPS to dig up dirt on Trump, an effort that resulted in the dossier authored by Christopher Steele, which, in turn, yielded leads that the FBI investigated.We stand by our reporting, and we do not apologize for our methods, Continetti and Goldfarb wrote.Fusion GPS is run by former Wall Street Journal reporters Glenn Simpson, Thomas Catan and Peter Fritsch.One could argue that the Free Beacon's hiring of Fusion GPS amounted to bringing in a few experienced, big-league journalists as consultants.It's a serious organization, New York Times columnist Bret Stephens, another Journal alumnus, said of Fusion GPS on MSNBC this week.But President Trump and his allies have sought to cast Fusion GPS as a shadowy, illegitimate outfit that produced a fake dossier.And the Free Beacon this week has published such characterizations unchallenged without noting that it considered Fusion GPS reliable enough to pay for its services.
Trump tells reporters children they have no weight problems, as he passes out Halloween candy:::::President Trump passed out candy to the costumed children of White House reporters in the Oval Office on Oct. 27.(The Washington Post) President Trump handed out treats to the costumed children of White House reporters in the Oval Office on Friday.He passed out a few tricks to their parents, too, in the form of jabs coated in humor.I cannot believe the media produced such beautiful children, the president quipped, gesturing to kids dressed as Star Wars characters, super heroes and witches.How the media did this, I don't know.Oh, Trump groaned at one point, you gonna grow up to be like your parents?Mmm, he said, shaking his hands.Don't answer.That can only get me in trouble, that question.Trump tried another question: So, how does the press treat you?I bet you get treated better by the press than anybody in the world.As he passed around a box of candy, the president assured the children that they need not worry about portion size because their waistlines are fine.You have no weight problems; that's the good news, right?he said.So, you take out whatever you need, okay?If you want some for your friends, take 'em.We have plenty.Trump isn't always so charitable toward adults.A former Trump Organization executive told the New York Times last year that Trump once joked that she enjoyed sweets a little too much.You like your candy, Barbara A. Res recalled Trump telling her.It was him reminding me that I was overweight.[Donald Trumps weight problem: He cant stop talking about fat people] Well, congratulations, folks, the president told journalists on Friday, wrapping up the photo op.You did a good job.You did a good job here you did a good job, he said, pointing to the children.Then he motioned toward himself.I wouldn't say you did very well here.

Clinton lawyer kept Russian dossier project closely held:::::Marc Elias served as counsel to both Hillary Clintons campaign and the Democratic National Committee in 2016.(David Jolkovski/For The Washington Post) When Marc Elias, general counsel for Hillary Clintons presidential campaign, hired a private research firm in the spring of 2016 to investigate Donald Trump, he drew from funds he was authorized to spend without oversight by campaign officials, according to a spokesperson for his law firm.The firm hired by Elias, Fusion GPS, produced research that resulted a dossier detailing alleged connections between Trump and Russia.While the funding for the work came from the campaign and the Democratic National Committee, Elias kept the information about the investigation closely held as he advised the campaign on its strategy, according to the spokesperson, who requested anonymity to discuss the internal dynamics.Eliass involvement in the financing and internal dissemination of the Trump research underscores the influence he wields behind the scenes in Democratic politics a role that is now being pushed into the spotlight amid multiple investigations into Russias attempts to meddle in the 2016 elections.The 48-year-old lawyer and his firm, Perkins Coie, represent many of the partys political committees and candidates.Elias also has worked on behalf of companies such as Facebook, fighting in 2011 to exempt the social media network from disclaimer rules on political ads.The companys sale of ads to Russian actors during last years campaign triggered calls on Capitol Hill for more disclosure of online ads.Eliass robust client list which included both Clintons campaign and the Democratic National Committee last year has led to questions about how he juggles competing interests and whether some of the arrangements create awkward dynamics.Fusion GPS is an opposition research firm run by ex-journalists, but how is it connected to the Trump dossier, Donald Trump Jr.'s Trump Tower meeting and the 2016 election?The Fact Checker's Glenn Kessler explains.(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) Elias declined to comment.In September, he accompanied former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta to a closed-door interview with Senate Intelligence Committee staffers, during which Podesta said he had no knowledge of payments to Fusion GPS, according to CNN.At the time, it was not publicly known Elias had hired Fusion GPS; that was revealed by The Washington Post this week.Elias, who was there as Podestas lawyer, did not participate in the interview as a witness, CNN reported.Podesta did not respond to a request for comment.While it is common for campaigns to conduct opposition research, Eliass decision to hire Fusion GPS has drawn intense interest because it resulted in the controversial dossier.Republicans have said their effort to investigate Fusions role in producing the dossier will intensify with the revelation that it was funded by Clintons campaign and the DNC.President Trump seized upon the news, saying this week that this was the Democrats coming up with an excuse for losing the election ...they made up the whole Russia hoax.The dossier was part of research into Trump that Fusion GPS began in the Republican primaries for the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication that receives financing from billionaire GOP donor Paul Singer.The Beacons role was first reported Friday by the New York Times.The Washington Posts Adam Entous looks at the role that Hillary Clintons campaign and the Democratic National Committee played in funding the research that led to a dossier containing allegations about President Trumps links to Russia.(Bastien Inzaurralde,Patrick Martin/The Washington Post) After the Free Beacon stopped funding the project, Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson met with Elias at his Washington law office and asked if he was interested, according to people familiar with the arrangement.Elias agreed, deciding Fusion GPS had more capacity than the campaigns in-house operation to do sophisticated research, according to the Perkins Coie spokesperson.Elias drew from funds that both the Clinton campaign and the DNC were paying Perkins Coie, The Post reported this week.It is unclear who else was familiar with the arrangement, or who knew that Fusion GPS hired a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, who wrote the dossier.Clinton has not responded to requests for comment.A spokesman for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.), who was DNC chairwoman at the time Perkins Coie contracted with Fusion GPS, said the former chair was not aware of the law firms arrangement with Fusion.[Former Clinton, DNC aides largely silent on funding of Trump-Russia dossier] Elias himself did not receive the dossier but was briefed on some of the information in it, according to his firms spokesperson.The dossier was published by BuzzFeed after the election.Clinton campaign officials who said they were not aware of Eliass arrangement with the firm defended his decision to tap its resources.Marc is known as one of the most skilled professionals in Democratic politics, in addition to being the partys top election lawyer, said Brian Fallon, who served as a spokesman for the campaign.I am damn glad he pursued this on behalf of our campaign and only regret more of this material was not verified in time for the voters to learn it before the election.Among Perkins Coies clients is Facebook, which Elias helped in 2011 when the company was asking the Federal Election Commission for an exemption from having to include political disclaimers on the small ads that appear on its site.Advocates for more transparency of online ads said that better disclosure requirements could have prevented a Russian troll farm from running ads during last years election that were aimed at sowing divisions between groups of Americans.Facebook, which noted that it has pledged to create a system to disclose the ads run on its site, declined to comment on Eliass role.Elias is well known in political circles for his work on voting rights cases, an effort that has been funded by Democratic megadonor George Soros.Elias also has scored major victories in hard-fought election recounts, including the 2008 election of Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.).His role as the go-to Democratic lawyer in Washington was spotlighted this week when he was slated to testify in the federal bribery trial of one of his clients, Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.).Elias, who had been expected to testify about the advice he gave Menendez about how to fill out financial disclosures, was ultimately stricken from the witness list by the judge.Even as he has built a robust Democratic client list, Elias has often been at odds with groups that advocate for stricter campaign finance rules, including many on the left, over his efforts that have expanded the influence of wealthy donors in politics.He has done good stuff on the voting rights side, but he has also been an opponent of many campaign finance reforms and has been largely responsible for some of the loopholes that exist in the campaign finance laws, said Lawrence Noble, a former Federal Election Commission general counsel who now works as a senior director at the advocacy group Campaign Legal Center.Elias played a key role in helping craft a massive expansion of party fundraising that was slipped into a 2014 end-of-the-year spending bill.That measure created new party accounts that can accept donations three times larger than contributions to the general party fund.The Republican National Committee is now using money raised by one of those funds to help pay for the legal bills accrued by President Trump and his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., in the multiple Russia probes.[RNC taps legal account to help pay for lawyers for President Trump and son Donald Jr. in Russia probes] In 2015, Elias appeared before the FEC to seek greater interplay between candidates and super PACs, which can collected unlimited contributions.Critics saw it as a way around campaign finance laws that set a strict cap on donations to candidates.Then-commissioner Ann Ravel, a Democratic appointee, objected to the idea and was berated by Elias, who said she should have raised her concerns earlier, she said in an interview.A key element of the measure passed by a 4-to-2 vote, with Ravel in opposition.He was always trying to figure out a way to get around campaign finance restrictions, Ravel said.Veteran election law attorney Robert Bauer, who founded the Perkins Coie political practice and recruited Elias, said that anyone practicing political law cannot escape the politics.It understood that your clients, and their objectives, will come under fire, Bauer said.But it is wrong to find fault in a lawyer because he is effective in making the clients case for a particular law or rule.Former secretary of state John F. Kerry, who hired Elias as general counsel for his 2004 presidential campaign, called Elias an outstanding lawyer.He always gave us advice to live up to the law and not avoid it, Kerry said.Former Senate Democratic leader Harry M. Reid, who won a 1998 recount with the help of Elias, said the lawyers decision to tap Fusion GPS for research makes good sense.Time is not on your side in these elections, Reid said.Franken, who declined an interview request, praised Elias in a statement for helping him secure his Senate seat, while saying that I dont always agree with what he advocates for including when it comes to campaign finance.In his book Al Franken, Giant of the Senate, published this year, the senator ribbed Elias about the size of his legal fees, which totaled $3.6 million, according to federal filings.Franken wrote that he was often sequestered at home, calling people for money to pay our bafflingly large and expensive team of lawyers, led by Democratic super-attorney Marc Elias.(If youre ever in Washington, check out the Franken Wing of the Perkins Coie law office its gorgeous.)Tom Hamburger contributed to this report.
Trump, Republicans steer Russia probes in new directions:::::President Trump and Republicans in Congress are demanding new scrutiny of Hillary Clintons actions as secretary of state, potentially jeopardizing investigations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election just as the probes are closing in on Trumps inner circle.In the span of a week, House and Senate Republican leaders announced two investigations into Obama-era decisions involving a uranium deal that increased Russias share of the U.S. nuclear market and another into how the FBI handled Clintons use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.Trump has cheered on the new Republican-driven investigations, which have resurrected some of the presidents most- favored jabs against Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign.Asked about the uranium deal Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: I can tell you that we do think that theres a lot of cause for concern regarding that deal, and we certainly think it should be looked into.She denied, however, that the White House is trying to steer the congressional investigations away from Russian meddling.The Washington Posts Adam Entous looks at the role that Hillary Clintons campaign and the Democratic National Committee played in funding the research that led to a dossier containing allegations about President Trumps links to Russia.(Bastien Inzaurralde,Patrick Martin/The Washington Post) The president wants to see this completed, she said.Theres still no evidence of collusion between the president and anyone....If any collusion took place, it would be between the DNC and the Clintons.And I think were starting to now see that all of the things that the Democrats had accused this president doing, they were actually guilty of themselves.The DNC refers to the Democratic National Committee.Democrats have cried foul, charging that the investigations are a blatant strategy to distract attention from the investigations into Trumps alleged Kremlin ties, and suggesting the White House may be improperly working to assist the GOPs efforts.Democrats were particularly alarmed by news that Trump urged the Justice Department to lift a gag order on an FBI informant whom House leaders see as a key witness in their new uranium investigation.A White House official confirmed Friday that Trump had discussed the issue with staff and that White House counsel Donald McGahn relayed Trumps position to the Justice Department.But the official said Justice made its own decision on the issue.The partisan breakdown has rocked all but one committee investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, including the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the House Intelligence Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.The exception is the Senate Intelligence Committee.The breakdown also threatens to push the majority of congressional probes into Russia meddling into a political sideshow.It comes just days before Silicon Valley tech giants are scheduled to publicly testify on Capitol Hill about the details of Russias disinformation campaign and just months before lawmakers want to deliver their findings, in part to help the public avoid a similar crisis during the 2018 election.Republicans were careful to avoid focusing on Clinton as they launched one probe into former FBI director James B. Comeys handling of the Clinton email case and another into the Obama-era Justice Departments examination of Russian attempts to influence the U.S. nuclear industry.But Trump took no such precautions, stating Friday on Twitter that there was collusion with HC and Russia an apparent reference to his hotly disputed charge that Clinton helped secure a favorable ruling on the uranium deal in exchange for Russian contributions to her family foundation.[House GOP launches probes into Obama-era uranium deal, Clinton email inquiry] The developments prompted Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, to demand on Twitter a new investigation into whether the president personally intervened w DOJ to advance case against political opponent, something he called beyond disturbing.The White House official denied Friday that Trump had done anything inappropriate.Are we directing it?No.Are we welcoming it?Yes, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.Democrats have little power to make good on their threats beyond raising a political clamor.Schiff has no independent ability to subpoena sources or records without the cooperation of the committee chairman, Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who is the main force behind the House GOPs uranium probe, along with House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.).Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the Senate Judiciary Committees ranking Democrat, told reporters this week that Democrats on the panel largely would strike out on their own.But she faces a similar limitation in compelling sources to furnish documents and testimony.Nonetheless, on Friday Feinstein released copies of five letters seeking information that she had sent to the White House, Trumps personal lawyer Michael Cohen, the heads of Facebook and Twitter, and data firm Cambridge Analytica, which did work for the Trump campaign and whose chief executive had contact with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.As both sides press forward with their new probes, the political battle lines are forming along familiar fissures.The relationship between Judiciary Chairman Sen. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa) and Feinstein has long teetered between collegial and combative.Each side has accused the other of slowing the Russia investigation.Feinstein is frustrated that Grassley wants to couple the probe of Trumps Russia ties with inquiries into Clintons emails and the Russian uranium deal.Grassleys side maintains that Feinsteins resistance cost the committee a chance to interview former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in July, before his house was raided by federal agents.While Grassley has indicated a preference for cooperating with Feinstein going forward, there is little indication they will.This month, Grassley sent dozens of letters demanding information and interviews from various individuals connected to a June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer in Trump Tower, the FBIs Clinton email investigation, the Russian uranium deal and a dossier of salacious allegations about Trumps exploits in Moscow research that Clintons campaign and the DNC paid for.Feinsteins signature was not on any of them.[Clinton campaign, DNC paid for research that led to Russia dossier] In the House, divisions are even more severe.Nunes was accused this past spring of plotting with the White House to launch dubious claims that the names of Trump transition team officials appearing in surveillance reports had been improperly exposed.No evidence was found to support his conclusion, and Nunes under political pressure and an ethics inquiry ceded control of the Russia investigation to Rep. K. Michael Conaway (R-Tex.).Democrats are now accusing Nunes of similar coordination.Nunes and a White House official both said that they had not been in touch about the uranium investigation and were not working together.But Nunes did not rule out briefing the White House about his investigation in the future.Meanwhile, Gowdy and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) are partnering to examine the FBIs handling of Clintons email probe.They announced their investigation in the same hour as Nunes told the news media about his uranium probe.Apparently, if President Trump says jump, House Republicans say how high?And if he says heel, they stand down from conducting serious, credible oversight, the Oversight Committees ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), said in a statement this week.The next day, Cummings joined with the House Judiciary Committees ranking Democrat, Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), to send letters to Trumps campaign consultants, including Cambridge Analytica, demanding information.Cummings and Conyers do not have independent power to subpoena information from witnesses; on their committees, that power rests with the Republican chairman alone.Read more at PowerPost

On taxes, Trump is an eager salesman  but the policy action is on Capitol Hill:::::President Trump walks with Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), left, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), right, to the Senate Republican Policy Luncheon on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.(Matt McClain/The Washington Post) President Trump is cajoling Republican senators on the golf course.He is taking Democratic senators for rides on Air Force One.He is calling up fierce critics such as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) to find common cause.He is deploying his daughter and adviser, Ivanka, to pitch activists and swing suburban voters.And he is using his megaphone, Twitter, to boast about it all.On tax policy, the most consequential legislative fight of his presidency so far, Trump has emerged as a relentless salesman, proclaiming one promise after another.The tax cuts will be big, he tweets.Historic.The biggest TAX CUT in the history of our country.But for all the bustle emanating from the White House, most of the policy action is at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, in the Capitol, as Republicans try to rush through a sweeping tax cut package by the end of the year.Lawmakers are relying on the president to build public pressure.But on policy details, legislators are focused inwardly as they endeavor to write a bill that could pass the Senate.Republicans narrowly control the Senate, where some tensions are boiling over tax policy details as well as Trumps leadership in general.In the House, the administration faces other challenges including that some GOP lawmakers are tuning out Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn is acting as a key interlocutor with Capitol Hill on tax cut legislation.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) The secretary typically would serve as the administrations chief negotiator on anything related to tax policy.But House Republican leaders have made clear to the White House in recent weeks that they do not want Mnuchin, who has struggled to command respect on Capitol Hill, trying to negotiate with rank-and-file lawmakers, according to three people with direct knowledge of the situation.National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn whom Trump considers a master salesman and who gained firsthand experience with corporate tax policy during his years as a Goldman Sachs executive is serving as a key interlocutor with Capitol Hill, along with White House legislative affairs director Marc Short.White House officials said Mnuchin and Cohn are working in tandem, with the treasury secretary playing a more behind-the-scenes role in shaping the policy and promoting it.[Step one is done.But Republicans are still a long way from a tax bill becoming reality.]Hungry for a signature piece of legislation to sign, Trump is fully invested in the tax fight, his advisers said.President Trump is incredibly engaged and knows this issue really well, said Hope Hicks, the White House director of communications.To him, it represents so many different tenets of his core campaign promises job growth, economic development, bringing jobs and money back home from overseas, helping the forgotten men and women.Trump spends long stretches of his day working in his private dining room, just off the Oval Office, where he sits at the head of a table with a stack of newspapers and a phone beside him.The television often is turned to cable news, and advisers come and go for impromptu huddles.When the topic turns to the tax cut push, which happens more and more these days, Trump sometimes yells to his assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, to get one of the big six lawmakers on the phone to talk about his new idea, according to aides.But Trump is learning that his willfulness has its limitations, with many other forces within the Republican Party driving the process.As much as the president wants a win, congressional Republicans are asserting themselves as they turn to the details of legislating.Ivanka Trump, the presidents daughter and a White House senior adviser, speaks during a town hall meeting on tax reform in Richboro, Pa., on Monday.(Rich Schultz/AP) One of the most intense periods in the tax fight will come in early November.Legislators will release the bill, lobbyists will start picking it apart and Trump will be half a world away, on a 12-day tour of Asia.Lawmakers seem to be okay with that.Asked if he was concerned that Trump might tweet something that disrupts the carefully planned rollout of the tax legislation, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) deadpanned Thursday: Hes going to be in Asia.Ryan went on to say that he is working very, very closely with the White House.But Trump intends to stay involved while overseas, getting regular updates from staff and perhaps tweeting his views.Cohn will stay behind to work with Congress, and Vice President Pence and some Cabinet secretaries plan to do media interviews and hold public events to galvanize support, White House officials said.It is difficult to overstate the stakes for Republicans.The party has a unified government controlling both chambers in Congress and the White House but after a series of defeats is under intense pressure to prove it can govern effectively ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.For Republicans, this is existential, said Stephen Moore, a Heritage Foundation economist who advised Trump during last years campaign.For Trump specifically, Moore said, this is the big prize.Hes all-in on the tax bill.Having worked with him, I dont think he cares too much about the exact details of this.I think he wants a bill that helps the middle class and cuts the corporate tax.All the rest is just window dressing to him.[Major divisions remain as GOP near its tax deadline] David Stockman, who worked as President Ronald Reagans budget director the last time major tax reform was passed, in 1981, said Trump and congressional Republicans are barely out of the batters box.Trump is living up to his reputation as the great disrupter, Stockman said.I dont see the tax bill happening before year end.Even if something passes next year, it will be a pale shadow of what people are talking about and what the market seems to have priced in.On Wednesday, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.)plans to release his draft of the tax cut legislation, holding a committee vote on the measure the following week.The tax plan is based on several broad ideas, but many provisions remain unresolved.Trump and GOP congressional leaders want to slash the corporate tax rate far below 35 percent and simplify the taxes paid by families and individuals.They want to expand the child tax credit, eliminate the estate tax, and incentivize companies to bring money and jobs back to the United States.The tax plan would add at least $1.5 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years and, according to numerous budget experts, provide disproportionate benefits to companies and the wealthy.These are just some of the key issues Republicans are trying to address before they bring legislation to the House and the Senate for votes, worried that a few unhappy Republicans could kill the bill.One of those potential dealbreakers is Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), who met with Pence in his West Wing office this week.MacArthur said in an interview that he tried to convince Pence that the GOP tax plan could drive up taxes for people in his state.Pence heard MacArthur out but was noncommittal, telling him Trump wanted to cut everyones taxes.That was not the answer MacArthur was looking for, he said.He wanted substance and a commitment to detailed changes that would help New Jersey.The congressman then voted Thursday to try to block a GOP budget plan in an effort to thwart the entire tax cut push until his concerns were addressed.He did not succeed.Asked if the House Republican leaders were sympathetic to the points he tried to make to Pence at the meeting, MacArthur said, They are only sympathetic to votes.Many of the decisions about the bill are being made by Brady and his colleagues, which is one reason Pence did not have the power to promise MacArthur that he could make changes.Mnuchin and Cohn were able to persuade Ryan to back away from a demand that would have included a new way of taxing imports amid concerns that the change could drive up prices on items such as clothing, electronics and automobiles.But the administration made concessions in other areas.It fell to Mnuchin and Cohn last month to persuade a disappointed Trump to agree to a target for the corporate tax rate that was higher than the president had wanted.Trump had insisted for more than a year that the corporate tax rate should be lowered from 35 percent to 15 percent, but congressional Republicans stressed that this was not possible, as it would add too much to the debt.Trump ultimately agreed to a rate of 20 percent, which the White House views as an achievement, considering that some House Republicans argued that the rate should be closer to 25 percent.Still, there are other examples of GOP leaders ignoring some of Trumps demands.The biggest flash point came this week, when Trump announced in a Monday tweet that 401(k) plans would not be affected by the tax bill, apparently reacting to news reports that House Republicans were considering such changes.[Trump who?Republicans seem to be totally ignoring the president on taxes.]White House aides said the president is especially attuned to how the bill will play with middle-class voters and wanted to make clear that he would protect the popular retirement program.But several senior congressional Republican aides said they were rattled by Trumps unexpected declaration.And two days later, Brady told reporters that there still could be changes to these retirement accounts.Trump has tried to personally win over key Republican senators.He played golf with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on Oct. 15 at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where the three men chewed over tax policy.Trump also has golfed several times recently with Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who is emerging as a central mediator between the president and Senate Republicans.And Wednesday, Trump called McCain who earlier this month blasted Trumps half-baked, spurious nationalism to talk about taxes, and the two made plans to get together soon with Graham, according to a White House official.Ivanka Trump, meanwhile, pitched her child tax credit idea at a town hall meeting in Bucks County, Pa., outside Philadelphia.It cant just be about cutting taxes, she said.Ivanka Trump met recently with Grover Norquist, an anti-tax activist with deep influence among Republican lawmakers, to discuss the idea.Norquist said he told her that he respected her efforts but that the plan may not be passable.She may not be able to get the size or scope of what shes looking at, but this process isnt about getting everything in this specific bill, Norquist said, recalling how he described his outlook to her.It takes time, and there will be more than one plane out of Casablanca on taxes.The president has been trying to woo some Democratic senators to back his tax plan, targeting a handful who are running for reelection next year in states that he won handily.In late September, Trump invited Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.)to fly with him to Indianapolis for the presidents tax speech.During their conversations on Air Force One, Trump pledged to Donnelly that they could work together on taxes and build a bond, leading the senator to feel cautiously upbeat about the prospect of finding consensus, according to four people familiar with the exchanges.Donnellys mood soured, however, once Trump gave his speech at the Indiana State Fairgrounds.The president seemed to threaten the low-key, moderate senator in front of a large home state crowd by warning that we will campaign against him like you wouldnt believe if Donnelly voted against the tax bill.White House aides characterized Trumps remarks as well-intentioned, good-natured ribbing, but Donnelly felt burned by the experience and has since had little engagement with the White House, according to the people familiar with the episode.[Deficits, schmeficits: House conservatives cast aside fiscal warnings to make way for tax cuts] On Oct. 18, Trump gathered a bipartisan group from the Senate Finance Committee at the White House.With cameras rolling, the president leaned over the dark wooden table in the Cabinet Room to promise the largest tax cut in the history of our country.He then joked with Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), the committees ranking Democrat: Im sure well have unanimous support.I have no doubt, right?Right, Ron?I think.Right?Senators chuckled.But once the press corps left the room, there was an immediate disconnect between Trump and some of the Democrats, according to Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.).I said to him very directly, Its good to have this meeting, but I have to tell you, this plan, in my judgment, is a giveaway to the rich, Casey recalled in an interview, adding that he rattled off statistics from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center to make his point.Casey said he and other Democrats there wanted to make clear to Trump that bipartisan support could not be willed by the presidents liveliness.It had to be carefully negotiated, he said.But I just dont see it happening, Casey said.When Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) asked Trump to support two of his proposals on how to craft a middle-class tax cut, such as expanding the child tax credit, Trump seemed excited by the idea and said a new set of working groups could be set up.But later Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.)pushed back against Browns suggestion and said that while he welcomed Democratic input, the committee structure currently in place would drive the talks, according to three people who were briefed on the discussions.As the meeting wrapped up, Trump vaguely warned that he may hound senators who vote against the bill by visiting their states and rallying against them ahead of the midterm elections.He said if those people didnt support a tax cut, it could be pretty tough, recalled Casey, who is up for reelection in 2018.Ill just say, maybe he was offering a price.
Gary Johnson is back, and hes never running for office again:::::Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson at the Libertarian Partys national convention in Orlando in May 2016.(John Raoux/Associated Press) I thought there was no chance that Trump could win, said Gary Johnson.This could be the end of the republic as we know it.It was Wednesday morning, less than 24 hours after Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) had announced that he would reject the politics of President Trump by retiring.Johnson, the 2016 (and 2012) Libertarian Party nominee for president, was in town for another sort of protest.He had sued to be included in the 2016 presidential debates, and he was filing the same lawsuit in another court.Not that he was running for president.Im never going to be a candidate again, said Johnson over a latte in downtown Washington.I dont aspire to be president of the United States anymore, because Trump holds the office.Politics is just toxic.In Arizona, theres going to be crazies running for office.Thats because of Trump crazies are lining up to run.And theyre obsessed with immigration!You know, DACAs one of the most successful immigration programs of all time and space.Wow!A lot of excitement to end rigged 2party debates!See u @SCOTUS 5pm ET #DroptheHammer https://t.co/MuZMPf7OJD Gov.Gary Johnson (@GovGaryJohnson) October 26, 2017 Johnson, who turned 64 this year, was the highest vote-getter of any third-party candidate since the 1990s.He had wanted to win that he did not is part on himself, part on the Commission on Presidential Debates.Instead, he had collected 4,489,235 votes, the most in the Libertarian Partys history, and gotten that party on a few more state ballots.And then, he disappeared.That was always the plan, if he lost.(Johnsons friendly, scattered mien led some to think he was joking.)Johnson vacationed in Aruba, then spent 110 days skiing, then trained for a bike ride across the continental divide, from Mexico to Canada.I did it in 35 days, Johnson said proudly.The record is 14.I think everything being equal I can knock between three and seven days off that time when I do it again.I havent missed a beat, athletically, since Thanksgiving.For a short time in 2016, Johnson speculated about blowing up the two-party system.There had never been a better chance, with two cosmically unpopular candidates nominated by the Democrats and Republicans.He cracked into double digits in some polls, better in some states, but Hillary Clintons campaign must have spent $50 million to stop that.Johnson, who is not bitter about much, is bitter about that.He remembers the Web ads Snapchat ads that showed him speculating about space mining and muffing a question about the war in Syria.An online search for his name still, in October 2017, suggests Aleppo as a companion term If you saw that, youd think I was the dumbest [expletive] on the planet, Johnson said.But the campaign was only partially successful.The Libertarians did beat their records, and turn hundreds of thousands of young and first-time voters into party-crashers.Johnson mostly escaped the rage directed at Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate who got more votes in Michigan and Wisconsin than the winning margin for President Trump.In both states, Johnson tripled up her vote.When she instantly raised millions of dollars to recount the election, he was already out of the country.I think that money ended up in the Green Partys coffers, Johnson said.Neither the Libertarians nor the Greens, with their breakthrough votes, have done much in the shocked country that the election built.Both the Democratic and Republican parties, in many states, have shed voters; the Libertarians have gained some.Just not too many, Johnson said.Theyre up by leaps and bounds, he says, but when you start out at such a low number, leaps and bounds doesnt say as much.Johnson, by his own admission, was not doing anything to help.He was not campaigning for Cliff Hyra, the Libertarian nominee in next months Virginia gubernatorial election.He had not heard much from Libertarians who wanted a star speaker something he heard a lot of between 2012 and 2016.Mostly, he was surprised that the party had not grown and won since he retreated into retirement.How can the Libertarian Party not gain in this kind of environment?Johnson asked.What the Libertarian Party needs is to win, for someone to actually govern.Heres a person with libertarian principles heres how he governed.Anything!Anything, above dogcatcher.The lingering question is: How?Johnson returned to the subject of Flake, who inveighed against Trump like a Roman senator warning about Caesar and then, basically, said that it was up to someone else to fix the Republican Party.Nobody is saying the emperor has no clothes, Johnson said.Hes getting away with stuff that nobody would have gotten away with.It is crazy.It is crazy.Its just amazing to me that every day, theres a new page.The page turns, and it gets crazier.Why, then, wasnt the Libertarian Party surging?Why hadnt Johnson who tried to define the LP as a safe alternative to two dangerous extremes done better?Pro-choice, but anti-taxes.Antiwar, pro-criminal justice reform.The Johnson-branded LPs agenda lined up, in polls, with millions of voters, who then chose sides between Trump and Clinton.Why?Johnson blamed his own way with words.He could not think that the country really wanted what Trump offered.I maintain that what came out of my mouth reflected the feelings of a majority, he said, but Im not a spokesman.For years, peaking with Ron Pauls 2012 presidential bid and Johnsons 2016 bid, libertarians said they were destined to break through.Blaming Johnsons gaffes was one way to explain why they faltered.Another, more pessimistic take was that libertarianism simply could not command majority support.Inside the GOP, libertarian-leaning politicians such as Flake had come around to that conclusion.Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), an ally of the Pauls, said that campaigning for them and against Trump convinced him that voter anger was not really about the desire for smaller government.I thought they were voting for libertarian Republicans, he said in March.But after some soul searching, I realized when they voted for Rand and Ron and me in these primaries, they werent voting for libertarian ideas they were voting for the craziest son of a b- in the race.Asked about Massies comment, Johnson agreed with the premise: Voters had wanted the crazy candidate.Trump was the one who was going to blow things up, he said.Make everybody think youre crazy, and then at the end, show youre not so crazy.Well, he did everything but the last part.Johnson, having been confident about where the country needed to go in 2016, was no longer making predictions.It would be good for Libertarians if someone like Flake jumped over, he said, but he didnt see why he would.Hed find out what I found out, said Johnson, referring to ballot and debate rules.(Austin Petersen, the runner-up for the 2016 LP nomination, has since left to run as a Republican for Senate from Missouri.)At the same time, Flake was willing to predict the end of the GOP, the only party hed won elections with.I think the Republican Partys done for, he said, at the end of Trumps tenure.Why did he think that, given that the party had done fairly well in elections all year?Because of the crazies, the people hed mentioned before.But why would the crazies lose?Asked when and how voters would reject right-wing politics, Johnson kept speculating that politicians were simply stuck in a feedback loop.Presidential nominees needed to win in New Hampshire and Iowa, and Republican voters there demanded anti-immigration policies.Thats what a candidate has to do to win the nomination, he said.Johnsons repeated criticism of Trump prompted an obvious question, one he got visibly sick of in 2016.Trump, he acknowledged, posed a unique threat to the country.Trump made him worry about nuclear war.But unlike Bill Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts who ran as Johnsons vice presidential nominee last year, Johnson was unwilling to suggest that Clinton would have been a better choice.I never got on the lesser evil thing, he said.The republic, he said, would have been in some danger had she won less, but some.You know that during Hillarys entire tenure, it was going to be about the emails, Johnson said.It was going to be about pay-to-play.I pointed out that in conservative media, the defeated Clinton was still being hounded over the scandals that sunk her in 2016.Yeah, I guess she is, Johnson said.
Trump says sex harassment claims are fake news, but there are corroborators:::::Jessica Leeds was one of 16 women who came forward during the 2016 campaign to accuse Donald Trump of sexual harassment.Their claims, however, did not stop him from getting elected to the most powerful office in the world.(Alice Li/The Washington Post) All I can say is its totally fake news.Its just fake.Its fake.Its made-up stuff, and its disgraceful, what happens, but that happens in the world of politics.President Trump, remarks to reporters, Oct. 16, 2017 Jacqueline Alemany of CBS News: Obviously, sexual harassment has been in the news.At least 16 women accused the president of sexually harassing them throughout the course of the campaign.Last week, during a news conference in the Rose Garden, the president called these accusations fake news.Is the official White House position that all of these women are lying?White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders: Yeah, weve been clear on that from the beginning, and the presidents spoken on it.exchange on Oct. 27 As Alemany noted, 16 women have accused Trump of sexually harassing them.While the president dismisses this as fake news, the problem for the White House is that some of these women have produced witnesses who say they heard about the incident at the time long before Trump made his political aspirations known.Such contemporaneous accounts are essential to establishing the credibility of the allegation because they reduce the chances that a person is making up a story for political purposes.In the case of sexual allegations, such accounts can help bolster the credibility of the she said side of the equation.Often, a sexual assault will happen behind closed doors.The contemporary corroborators can explain what they heard at the time and whether the story being told now is consistent with how the story was told years earlier.This does not necessarily mean the allegation is true, but it does give journalistic organizations more confidence to report on the allegation.Below is a summary of the corroborators provided by three of the women who have accusations, drawn from a fact check written during the presidential campaign.That fact check also detailed the witnesses who backed up claims of sexual accusations against former president Bill Clinton who, like Trump, insisted the women accusing him were not telling the truth.Readers can judge for themselves.Kristin Anderson Her allegation: While at a Manhattan nightclub in the early 1990s, Trump slid his fingers under her miniskirt, moved up her inner thigh and touched her vagina through her underwear.Corroborators: Kelly Stedman, a friend.She said she was told about the incident at a womens brunch a few days later.The women found themselves laughing at how pathetic it was on Trumps part.Brad Trent, a New York photographer.He says he heard the story from Anderson at a dinner in 2007.It was just girls saying stories about how they got hit on by creepy old guys, Trent said of the conversation around the table.Natasha Stoynoff Her allegation: While interviewing Trump in 2005 for an article for People magazine about the first anniversary of his third marriage, Trump lured her into a room at Mar-a-Lago and abruptly kissed her, forcing his tongue down her throat.He then said they were going to have an affair.Corroborators: Marina Grasic, who has known Stoynoff for more than 25 years.She said she got a call from her friend the day after the attack, detailing exactly how Trump pushed Stoynoff against a wall.Liz McNeil, at the time a reporter for People (she is now an editor).She said that she heard about the incident the day after Stoynoff returned from her assignment.She was very upset and told me how he shoved her against a wall, she said.Mary Green, another People reporter (now editor) who had just returned to New York.In an early conversation we had in her office, she told me about what happened with Donald Trump, Green said.She was shaky, sitting at her desk, relaying that, He took me to this other room, and when we stepped inside, he pushed me against a wall and stuck his tongue down my throat.Melania was upstairs and could have walked in at any time.Liza Hamm, part of a tightknit group of friends.Natasha has always been a vivacious person who wants to believe in the best of people, and this experience definitely messed with that outlook, she said.Paul McLaughlin, Stoynoffs former journalism professor.He said Stoynoff called him at the time of the alleged incident seeking advice on how to handle it: She didnt know what to do, she was very conflicted, she was angry, she was really confused about how to deal with this.After a discussion, he said, Stoynoff decided it would be best if she kept the incident to herself.Rachel Crooks Her allegation: Trump in 2005 kissed her directly on the lips after she introduced herself and said she was a receptionist who worked for a company that did business with Trump.Corroborators: Brianne Webb, her sister.She said Crooks called her immediately about the incident as soon as she returned to her desk.Being from a town of 1,600 people, being naive, I was like, Are you sure he didnt just miss trying to kiss you on the cheek?She said, No, he kissed me on the mouth.I was like, That is not normal.Clint Hackenburg, her boyfriend at the time.After he asked her that evening how her day had gone, she paused for a second, and then started hysterically crying.(About our rating scale) Send us facts to check by filling out this form Keep

Haley urges Congo leader to hold elections soon or risk international backlash:::::U.N.Ambassador Nikki Haley on Friday demanded that this authoritarian nation hold delayed national elections next year, saying continued international backing for a nation that hosts the largest United Nations peacekeeping mission is at stake.The president must say that were going to have elections in 2018, Haley said ahead of a meeting with President Joseph Kabila, whose term expired last year without a vote.We will not support with funding, resources, anything, if the calendar does not specifically specify no later than 2018 for these elections to happen.It was one of the strongest messages yet from the United States to the leader of this nominal democracy plagued by political repression and where corruption and the detention of journalists is commonplace.This is not a democracy unless the peoples voices are heard, Haley said.We will not support, we will not condone, elections being put off any longer.She later met alone with Kabila at his palatial waterside compound, which includes an enormous statue of his assassinated father out front.It was a firm, candid conversation, Haley said in an interview afterward.We had a conversation about what its like to be a leader.We had a conversation about what is a democracy.We had a conversation about the quality of life of people.We had a conversation about the importance of elections.[Would Haley replace Tillerson at State?She says no.]Kabila does not meet regularly with visiting Western representatives.The unexpectedly long 90-minute session with Haley was more notable because of her public warnings and criticism of a leader she partly blames for a searing humanitarian crisis she witnessed firsthand on Thursday.Haley cried after visiting a United Nations camp housing about 15,000 Congolese forced from their homes by unrest in North Kivu, the remote, lush and dangerous center of cyclical violence that has included mass rape and the abduction of children for use as soldiers and sex slaves.U.N. agencies count 4.5 million Congolese displaced within the country or elsewhere as refugees.Haley walked through muddy, rock-strewn Mungote camp with a woman identified only as Angelique, who told Haley she had been raped in front of her seven children and abandoned by her husband.None of them can leave the camp for fear of various armed groups that prey on locals, the woman said.Haley, looking stricken, hugged Angelique and stood with an arm around her as she cried quietly.When she boarded a U.N. helicopter to leave, scores of children, some in rags, ran to the edge of the landing zone to wave.Aboard the helicopter, Haley cried and put her head in her hands.The reason I got emotional today was the hundred-plus kids that were chasing our cars and seeing us off.All I kept thinking was, whats going to happen to them?Haley said afterward.The sad reality, as it looks now, is that they are going to end up just like their parents.Congo was Haleys final stop on a three-nation visit to Africa focused on delivering tough messages about the limits of U.S. support and countering the spread of violent extremism on the continent.She also visited Ethiopia and South Sudan.In Congo, Haley met with the national election commission and with Catholic elders attempting to broker a solution to the election impasse.She warned against prolonging elections into 2019 or after, saying that would risk the loss of international legitimacy.Kabila has held power since 2001, following the assassination of his father, longtime dictator Laurent Kabila.At 46, he is among the youngest of Africas strongmen.He blames election delays on problems with voter registration and poor security.Aid groups and political observers here say they doubt he will submit to elections anytime soon, and the vocal political opposition accuses him of trying to do an end run around constitutional bars to a third term.Congo government spokesman Lambert Mende said the government wants an election as soon as possible.Its not up to the government, nor to Ms. Haley, to organize the elections, Mende said in a statement, according to Reuters.I dont think that we can be subjected to these kinds of diktats.The head of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Congo has said that international donors have put forward only about 6 percent of the estimated $123 million needed to support an election.Every day we dont have elections in this country, another woman gets raped, another child becomes a soldier, Haley said.All of this has to stop, and the only way they will stop is if we have peaceful elections.
A new reminder that we may never know Hurricane Marias full toll on Puerto Rico:::::President Trump takes part in the distribution of food and supplies at a church in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, on Oct. 3.(Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images) It has been more than a month since Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico.A little less than three-quarters of the island still lacks electricity; earlier this week, the islands former governor shared a photograph of surgeons performing an operation by the light of their cellphones.This is what POTUS calls a 10!Surgery performed with cellphones as flashlights in Puerto Rico today.pic.twitter.com/5pnK5dkkE6 Alejandro (@agarciapadilla) October 21, 2017 Lets assume a worst-case scenario for a patient who is being treated under such conditions.Power is out because of Maria, but, should something go wrong during that surgery, does Maria bear the blame?Its easy to tick off a number of qualifying conditions that would need to be considered: The original condition, what went wrong during the surgery, etc.But this is an example of where data on fatalities in Puerto Rico post-Maria get blurry.Each death is unfortunate, but which deaths might not have happened if Maria had never come ashore?We looked at this question earlier this month, speaking with Joe Trainor of the University of Delawares Disaster Recovery Center.The long and short of it is, no matter what system exists, theres a lot of gray involved in how you will attribute any specific death during this time period, Trainor said, whether you decide its directly or indirectly related to the event itself.Getting hit by a tree branch during hurricane-force winds is one thing.Being unable to immediately get medicine for a chronic condition and dying weeks later?Thats another.Why does that tally matter?A number of reasons, but perhaps the most immediate is that President Trump, during his visit to the island, praised the low death toll (at that point, 16) as an indicator of how much less devastating Maria was to Puerto Rico than Hurricane Katrina was to New Orleans in 2005.(By extension, Trump was saying that his handling of Maria was better than President George W. Bushs of Katrina.)Since that visit, the official total has risen to 51.On Friday, CBS Newss David Begnaud, who has been doing exceptional coverage of the storms aftermath, relayed a statement he had received from the spokesman for Puerto Ricos secretary of public safety, the person responsible for the certified tally of deaths from Maria.Medical examiner in Puerto Rico has authorized 911 cremations of natural deaths since Hurricane Maria https://t.co/65e2pJsW3s pic.twitter.com/8x24XtlK9M David Begnaud (@DavidBegnaud) October 27, 2017 The statement: From the 20th of September to the 18th of October, the medical examiner [for the entire island] authorized 911 cremations of natural deaths.Keep in mind that not all the bodies of persons who died in Puerto Rico go to the medical examiner.But, by law, the medical examiner gives authorization for cremations.The medical examiner analyzes the death summary and the death certificate.If something is suspicious, they assign the case to the pathologist and they can stop the process.They can claim the body and/or call the families for an interview.That 911 people have been cremated suggests a death toll much higher than 51.But notice the caveat: natural deaths.Even had Maria not hit Puerto Rico, people would still have died from old age or car accidents or disease.The implication is that these 911 deaths fit into that category and therefore shouldnt be added to the storms death toll.The question that arises is whether or not that total is abnormally high.If 911 is a lot of deaths for a normal month in Puerto Rico, it may indicate that some hurricane-related deaths are not being counted as such.In 2014, the most recent year for which data were available, 30,152 people died in Puerto Rico.We know from an analysis of national fatality data compiled by ABC News several years ago that there are more deaths in the winter months, correlated to flu season.Between 1995 and 2002, 8.5 percent of deaths in the United States occurred in October.If we assume the same distribution applies in Puerto Rico, that would suggest that some 2,500 people died on Puerto Rico in October 2014.(The CDC did not provide specific figures to The Post by the time this article was published.)In other words, 911 deaths in the month after the landfall would not be abnormally high at all.Begnauds reporting was a response to an article at BuzzFeed detailing how various funeral homes on the island had handled the past month.In several cases, about half of the bodies that the homes had received had been cremated.If we assume that the 911 cremations reported by Begnaud is similarly only half of the deaths, the tally is still not unusually high.Regardless, were still left with the question of where in the gray area those 911 deaths might fall.Part of the statement conveyed by Begnaud was obviously meant to tamp down speculation that the territorial government is covering up hurricane-related deaths by outlining the process by which questions get answered.The death toll is a political issue, but then it always is, as Trainors colleague Benigno Aguirre told us.Sometimes politicians want higher totals (in order to get more foreign aid, for example) and sometimes lower as in the case of Trump and, presumably, some Puerto Rican officials.We asked Trainor when we might have a final, accurate tally of precisely how many people died in the storm.The reality is, he said, we probably will never know.

Would Haley replace Tillerson at State? She says, no.:::::U.N.Ambassador Nikki Haley meets with the president of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, in Juba, South Sudan, on Wednesday.(Albert Gonzalez Farran/AFP/Getty Images) KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo U.N.Ambassador Nikki Haley said Friday that she is tired of speculation that she may soon replace Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, saying that she would reject the offer if it came.I would say no, she said in an interview.Haley spoke at the end of a three-nation African trip in which she often filled the traditional role of the secretary of state, the countrys top diplomat.She met with the leaders of Ethiopia, South Sudan and Congo as an envoy for President Trump and delivered messages about good governance, human rights and security that go beyond her portfolio as ambassador to the United Nations.[Haley emerges as interpreter - and megaphone - for Trump] I just dont want to keep having this conversation.The focus is, I really want to do a good job now in what Im doing, Haley said in an interview with The Washington Post and Reuters.We have a secretary of state.Tillersons not going anywhere, so its really not been a topic of conversation.Pressed, she said she would turn down the position if Trump offered it.[Tillerson: Trump 'speaks for himself' on values] Tillerson, who was traveling in the Middle East and Europe while Haley was in Africa, has denied reports that he is fed up with dysfunction in the Trump administration and planning to quit.His relationship with Trump has cooled in recent months, however, and he has clashed with senior White House officials.In recent interviews, Tillerson has said he intends to remain on the job.
All of the women who have accused Trump of sexual harassment are lying, the White House says:::::White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders speaks to reporters at a news briefing at the White House in August.(Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) All the women who have accused President Trump of sexual harassment are lying, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday when asked for the official White House position on the issue.The question was posed during a White House briefing at a time when numerous men in high-profile positions have been undercut of late by allegations of sexual misconduct, including journalist Mark Halperin, who faced accusations this week from former colleagues.Obviously, sexual harassment has been in the news, Jacqueline Alemany of CBS News asked Sanders.At least 16 women accused the president of sexually harassing them throughout the course of the campaign.Last week, during a press conference in the Rose Garden, the president called these accusations fake news.Is the official White House position that all of these women are lying?Yeah, weve been clear on that from the beginning, and the presidents spoken on it, Sanders said, before quickly pivoting to another reporter to ask a question.[My pain is everyday: After Weinsteins fall, Trump accusers wonder: Why not him?]During the Rose Garden news conference that Alemany referenced, Trump was asked about allegations made by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on his television show, The Apprentice.She has accused Trump of forcibly kissing her and touching her breast.All I can say is it's totally fake news.It's just fake.It's fake.It's made-up stuff, and it's disgraceful, what happens, but that happens in the that happens in the world of politics, Trump told reporters.Since launching his presidential campaign in 2015, Donald Trump has made numerous demeaning comments about women.Here is a list.(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Eleven women came forward during the 2016 campaign to accuse the then-Republican presidential candidate of unwanted touching or kissing.Other women accused Trump of walking in on them when they were undressing at beauty pageants he owned.Besides Halperin, other men whose behavior has been called into question in recent weeks include Bill OReilly, the star Fox News anchor who was ousted less than a year after Roger Ailes, the networks co-founder; and Harvey Weinstein, once regarded as one of the most influential figures in the entertainment business.
This congresswoman is starting #MeTooCongress to draw attention to sexual harassment on Capitol Hill:::::Rep. Jackie Speier (D Calif.) says the current system for reporting sexual harassment in Congress shields offenders and punishes victims.(Clare Major) Rep. Jackie Speier on Friday shared her story of experiencing unwanted sexual advances in Congress, launching a #MeTooCongress campaign to raise awareness about sexual harassment and assault on Capitol Hill.Speier (D-Calif.) urged former and current staffers to share their stories using the #MeTooCongress hashtag, a play on the #MeToo social media posts that have gone viral in reaction to the sexual harassment scandal involving Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.Thousands of women used the hashtag to share their experiences, sparking dialogue about the pervasiveness of sexual harassment.In the video, Speier said Joe Holsinger, chief of staff for then-Rep. Leo Ryan (D-Calif.), held her face and forcibly kissed her when she was a congressional staffer.Speier did not name him in the video but identified him in response to media requests after the video published.Speier was about 23 or 24 at the time, and Holsinger was around 50.Holsinger died in 2004.His family could not be reached for comment.I know what its like to keep these things hidden deep down inside.I know what its like to lie awake at night wondering if I was the one who had done something wrong, Speier said.I know what its like years later, to remember that rush of humiliation and anger.You know what, many of us in Congress know what its like, because Congress has been a breeding ground for hostile work environment for far too long.Speier, who has unsuccessfully pushed to overhaul how harassment cases are handled in Congress, plans to introduce a bill next week to require anti-harassment training every year for all members and staffers and call for a survey to accurately gauge the scope of the problem.On Thursday, Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) introduced a bill to require staffers to receive sexual harassment training every other year.[How Congress plays by different rules on sexual harassment and misconduct] Congress makes its own rules about the handling of sexual complaints against members and staffers and has passed laws exempting it from practices that apply to other employers.There is no mandatory sexual harassment training for all employees; each office decides whether its staff should receive training.Federal agencies, in contrast, are required to provide anti-harassment training.It is not a victim-friendly process.It is an institution-protection process, Speier recently told The Washington Post.I think we would find that sexual harassment is rampant in the institution.But no one wants to know, because theyd have to do something about it.Employees can file lawsuits against perpetrators but only after going through months of counseling and mediation.In contrast, mediation is an option, not a requirement, for executive-branch employees.And when settlements are made, they come out of a special U.S. treasury fund rather than an offices funds, a requirement in other federal agencies.The congressional Office of Compliance, the agency tasked with offering sexual harassment training when requested, sent an email Friday morning reminding congressional offices to prioritize taking its sexual harassment training.I'm sharing my #MeToo moment in the hope that my colleagues, & current/former staff who feel safe to do so, will join me.#MeTooCongress pic.twitter.com/dsGFhJ5joo Jackie Speier (@RepSpeier) October 27, 2017 Since the #MeToo campaign has grown, lawmakers and lobbyists in statehouses across the country have adopted it to draw attention to sexual harassment in their industry.In California, more than 140 women, including legislators and State Capitol staffers, signed a letter calling it a pervasive problem in California politics and urging women to speak up about their experiences.There is nothing to fear in telling the truth, and its time to throw back the curtain on repulsive behavior that until now has thrived in the dark without consequences, Speier said in her video message.The Washington Post is examining workplace violations on Capitol Hill and the process for reporting them.To contact a reporter, please email michelle.lee@washpost.com, elise.viebeck@washpost.com or kimberly.kindy@washpost.com.

Gov.Chris Christie was part of Donald Trumps presidential transition team.(Reuters).To hear Gov.Chris Christie (R-N.J.) tell it, hes unpopular in part because he got ambitious and, in part, because of where that ambition took him.How unpopular is Christie?In New Jersey, President Trump has an approval rating twice as high as Christies despite Trump being a historically unpopular president and losing Jersey in the presidential race by 14 percentage points.Asked about his unpopularity on the Today show on Friday, Christie offered the following explanation.I ran for president.People dont like when you have a job and you are looking for another one right in front of them.I endorsed Donald Trump, and that was incredibly unpopular in my state as a blue state.And, third, Bridgegate happened.I think the combination of those three things, all three of which had really nothing to do with the execution of my job, impacted people and the way they felt about me.In other words, New Jerseyans were mad he ran for higher office and then endorsed Trump (likely with an eye to a role in the administration).Oh, and also because Christie staffers had ordered a traffic backup in a city whose mayor hadnt endorsed the governors reelection in 2013.It was called Bridgegate.Perhaps youve heard of it?(Two of those staffers were sentenced to prison earlier this year.)[Chris Christie flew close to the sun.Now, he sits under it, defiantly.]Put another way, this is a little like Richard Nixon explaining that he resigned because, first, the economy was slow and, second, he wanted to spend more time with his family, and, oh, third, the thing with the hotel.Quinnipiac University has been polling in New Jersey since before Christie first ran for governor there.The graph below shows his net favorability (before being sworn in) and approval ratings during his time in office.(Net approval means the percentage who approves of Christie minus those who disapprove.)Guess what?The order of the causes that Christie articulated is slightly off.Weve marked four key points: the landfall of Hurricane Sandy (five years ago this week), Bridgegate, Christies presidential campaign announcement and his endorsement of Trump.After Sandy, Christies approval rating rose a bit a function of his response to the disaster and effective partnership with President Barack Obama, which improved how Democrats viewed him.But a year later, after Christies reelection, Bridgegate erupted, and the governors numbers tanked.By the time he announced his candidacy for the presidency, the first cause Christie cited to Today, his net approval rating overall was already underwater.Among Republicans it had fallen from plus-87 approval before the Bridgegate revelations to plus-46 in the survey closest to his announcement to enter the race.Among Democrats, his rating fell from minus-13 to minus-71.It is true that Christies approval ratings fell farther during the campaign and after he endorsed Trump.In that sense, all three on his list may have played a role.(By November 2015, 61 percent of respondents told Quinnipiac that Christie should drop out of the race and a majority said they didnt think he could both run for president and serve as governor simultaneously.)But his fate was almost certainly sealed even before his campaign announcement.Again, Trump is twice as popular as Christie right now, suggesting that a closer alliance with Trump might actually be helpful to the governor.Not that it matters; New Jerseyans are headed to the polls next month to pick Christies successor and, after that, he returns to the private sector.The moral of the story for New Jerseys next governor?Running for president in 2020 might be ambitious, but its much less recommended that your staffers screw up traffic for a week in a town out of a sense of political revenge.
Dont confuse volume of news with importance:::::Robert S. Mueller III pauses after making an opening statement at the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on June 19, 2013.(Larry Downing/Reuters) Once the world learned about the private email server Hillary Clinton had used as secretary of state, the government began to release the messages that had been turned over after her resignation (to some extent at Clintons request).Since these were messages involving a top Cabinet official, they needed to be screened to ensure that confidential information wasnt revealed, necessitating a review process before the emails were released.That review process meant that the emails were released in chunks, a group of several thousands messages at a time dropped into the public domain.At each release, the same pattern emerged.Journalists would dive into the emails, picking out interesting messages which may or may not have been the sorts of things that were useful for presidential voters to consider.Clinton didnt know how to use a fax machine, and that became an article in part due to the celebrities are just like us nature of some revelations, in part because unflattering news about Clinton had a guaranteed audience, and in part, no doubt, because the journalists had spent the time poking around on it.(The Post was hardly immune to this.)The effect was broader than that, though.Each time there was a new batch of emails, the story was resuscitated in the public eye.But, more importantly, it seemed as though the story was expanding.Its a bit like watching returns on election night: All the votes have already been cast, but it seems like theres an exciting back-and-forth going on as the votes are counted.Ultimately, there were emails uncovered which were classified, the nut of the critique of the use of the server.But the story metastasized well beyond that, thanks, in part, to how it was necessarily reported.The same thing happened a year later, with different emails.When WikiLeaks started dropping files stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, it didnt do so in one big dump.Instead, the files trickled out.Particularly in the last month of the campaign, new Podesta emails came out on a near daily basis, and each time they were seized upon for any appearance of impropriety.This happened among conspiracy theorists, yes, but also among more mainstream critics of the Clinton campaign.As a result, nearly every day saw revelations about the Clinton campaign though not necessarily any that were informative or instructive.Often, in fact, they werent.Any story about Clinton and email was presumably often conflated into the broader story of Clintons email server, though the DNC and Podesta hacks had nothing to do with Clintons State Department role.The slow accretion of stories gave the impression of a slowly building scandal which it wasnt.That effect almost certainly played a role in Clintons loss.The irony that ensued?Donald Trumps tenure as president has endured a similar phenomenon.Shortly after the election, we learned that the government believed both that the Russian government had stolen the messages released by WikiLeaks and, more broadly, that theyd done so as part of a concerted effort to get Trump elected.Since then, there have been a number of significant revelations about Russias role in promoting its interests during the campaign and how the Trump administration has responded to the investigations into that meddling.The Donald Trump Jr. meeting at Trump Tower.The Facebook ads quietly purchased by Russian agents.Those are significant developments in understanding what happened.But theres also been a slow accretion of news about the Trump investigation that, once you dig in a bit, doesnt really tell us much about what happened.Articles that dont particularly expand the story outward so much as layer more paint on the already-known core.We know that Russians leveraged online networks; does learning that the effort included Pokmon Go significantly change our understanding of the scope of what Russia did?Its not clear, for example, what the Daily Beast scoop about an email from the head of Cambridge Analytica to WikiLeakss Julian Assange actually tells us.Its newsworthy, certainly, but it is not a smoking gun about a link between Russia and the Trump campaign.Its, at best, a link between an agent of the campaign and an agent (allegedly/unwittingly or not) of Russian actors.The Wall Street Journal reports that the communication was an offer to help organize the emails being released which, if accurate, suggests an even less nefarious interaction than some may have assumed.One factor here is the fracturing of the media landscape, which means that a lot more outlets are digging into the same stories and looking for fresh angles.Once those angles are identified, its hard not to seize on them as exclusive scoops, whether or not theyre terribly important revelations.Every outlet and journalist wants to plant a flag; this story has proven to be a good way to do that.The result is that stories may be overhyped as important, just as happened with the Clinton emails and the WikiLeaks revelations.That builds a sense of growing scandal when whats actually happening is the picture is being fleshed out.When you overlay that with an audience looking for a growing scandal either from Clinton before the election or Trump after that effect is magnified.And media outlets are rewarded for hyping things more than they ought to.Again, none of this is to argue that there werent serious revelations uncovered and reported both before and after Election Day.It is, instead, to argue for more caution in evaluating the importance of a story you see on the Internet.Which, at this point, is admittedly a bit like arguing that we ought to close the doors of barns built in 1832 so that long-dead farmers dont lose their long-dead horses.
Exclusive: First charges filed in Mueller investigation:::::Washington (CNN) A federal grand jury in Washington on Friday approved the first charges in the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller, according to sources briefed on the matter.The charges are still sealed under orders from a federal judge.Plans were prepared Friday for anyone charged to be taken into custody as soon as Monday, the sources said.It is unclear what the charges are.A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment.The White House also had no comment, a senior administration official said Saturday morning.Mueller was appointed in May to lead the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.Under the regulations governing special counsel investigations, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has oversight over the Russia investigation, would have been made aware of any charges before they were taken before the grand jury for approval, according to people familiar with the matter.Read More
Watergate and White House interference at DOJ:::::(CNN) A few years after President Richard Nixon resigned, Attorney General Griffin Bell gathered Justice Department lawyers in the department's elaborate Great Hall to address their independence in the post-Watergate world."The partisan activities of some attorneys general ... combined with the unfortunate legacy of Watergate, have given rise to the understandable public concern that some decisions at Justice may be the products of favor, or pressure, or politics," he said in the September 6, 1978 address Resulting Justice Department rules limited White House involvement with law enforcement decisions.The reforms emerged from Nixon's use of the department to conceal his administration's involvement in the break-in at the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate building.Those decades-old reforms were invoked again on Friday, after news that President Donald Trump personally intervened to try to lift a gag order on an undercover FBI informant sought by Republican members of Congress in an investigation of Russian nuclear industry efforts to gain influence in the United States during the Obama administration.It was only the latest chapter in ongoing controversy over White House intervention at DOJ since Trump took office.He has routinely injected himself in politically charged law enforcement matters, including those related to the probe of the Russian government's influence in the 2016 presidential election and potential ties to his campaign.Speaking on CNN's "New Day" Friday, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, deemed the recent disclosure part of a pattern of intervention and "politicization," which included the May firing of FBI Director James Comey, who was overseeing the investigation into Russia's election interference."There were rules in the wake of ... the Nixon improprieties that presidents would not interfere or intervene in ongoing investigations," Blumenthal said."Those norms seem to be violated."Former Sen. Rick Santorum, a Pennsylvania Republican, countered on CNN's "Newsroom," "Donald Trump has every right as President of the United States to advise the Justice Department as to his opinion on these things.I don't have a problem with this at all.It's about providing more information, not less.And I think that's a good thing."Separately on Friday, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told "New Day," "He believes, as many others do, frankly, that the FBI informant should be free to say what he knows."CNN reported Thursday that Trump told his staff to work with the Justice Department to allow a former undercover FBI informant to testify.Republicans on Capitol Hill are investigating the circumstances surrounding the sale of a uranium mining company to Russia's Atomic Energy Agency, Rosatom.The deal was approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a panel composed of representatives from several US government agencies, including the State Department, which at the time was led by Hillary Clinton.A source familiar with the matter told CNN that the DOJ move to allow the informant to speak to members of Congress was made independent of any communications from Trump.Trump's constant interactions with the Justice Department, FBI and US attorneys -- against the backdrop of special prosecutor Robert Mueller's Russia investigation -- cannot help but recall the Watergate era.Nixon Attorney General John Mitchell was convicted and served time in prison for his role in the scandal.Bell, in his 1978 speech, said he worked for almost two years to develop rules to make DOJ "a neutral zone," with the foundation being that the White House should steer clear of law enforcement decisions and the daily operations of the career staff involved in investigations and prosecutions.Bell, who served in the Jimmy Carter administration and died in 2009, noted that under the Constitution, the attorney general is responsible to the president and the president to the public.So, he said, "true institutional independence is therefore impossible."But he emphasized, "the president is best served if the attorney general and the lawyers who assist him are free to exercise their professional judgments."To be sure, not all interactions between the attorney general and president since then have been true to that principle.But at least it has been the ideal."What must be avoided, in fact and in appearance," Bell said, "is pressure from any source that is intended to influence our legal judgment."As he began his address nearly four decades ago, Bell told the audience he was using a prepared text, "because it's an important subject, something that I hope will be left here for years to come."
Sandy, five years later:::::Gragg, who declined to say whether shes a Democrat or Republican, told me she had supported Obama in the past.His visit solidified her vote in the fast-approaching election.It totally impacted my vote.He was there before I was there, she says, noting that she was still evacuated from the town.The fact he cared enough to come and tour these areas immediately meant a lot to me as someone who was devastated by this event.
Q&A: Former FEMA Director Michael Brown gives Trump an A+:::::During Hurricane Katrina all I wanted President Bush to do was to land in Baton Rouge, walk down the steps of Air Force One, walk to the podium.Tell not only the governor of Louisiana, but the governor of Mississippi and Alabama, and all of the mayors, and to tell his Cabinet, we have a horrendous crisis on our hands and I expect full hands on deck.That's the bully pulpit.And if President Bush had done that instead of doing frankly what I call a stupid flyover where they took the picture of him looking out the window, I think the cabinet would have gotten the message.And the governors and mayors would have gotten the message that this is never going to work unless everybody gets in the same room and we get on the same page about what's going on.That's the bully pulpit, and that's the power that any president has.
Americas power centers cant move:::::By the time the doors opened 45 minutes later, Sciaraffo, a 36-year-old employee of the citys parks and recreation department, was enraged.I said, I am not going to let this go, he recounted later.As soon as I get off this train, I dont care what its going to take, Im going to make a stink about this and make sure something changes.Sciaraffo believes another ten minutes of being trapped on the train would have led to serious health consequences for some riders.So ever since that day in June, Sciaraffo has been petitioning the MTA to post clear evacuation plans so every commuter is aware of how to safely exit a train if it gets stuck in a tunnel.(The MTA warns that the dangers of moving trains and electrified third rails makes passenger evacuations highly dangerous.Theyre in the process, they say, of revamping customer communications to make sure passengers arent left in the dark again.)But Sciaraffo is frustrated by the response.I ride this train every day, and the MTA is very good at having a bad situation, and then scooting it under the rug, he says.
Reliving the day Hillary Clinton says cost her the election -- one year laterr:::::(CNN) "I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter, on October 28th, and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off.And the evidence for that intervening event is, I think, compelling, persuasive, and so we overcame a lot in the campaign, we overcame an enormous barrage of negativity, of false equivalency and so much else, but as Nate Silver, who doesn't work for me, he's an independent analyst, but one considered to be very reliable, has concluded: If the election had been on October 27th, I'd be your president."On May 2, 2017, Hillary Clinton sat down for a conversation with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at a Women for Women International event in New York.Nearly six months out from Election Day, Clinton said she took "absolute personal responsibility" for its outcome -- but her remarks strayed from there.In a now famous riff, Clinton paraphrased a tweet from FiveThirtyEight.com's Nate Silver, who said former FBI Director Jim Comey's letter to Congress, delivered 11 days before the vote, shaved off a fateful sliver of her support, enough to ultimately deliver the presidency to Donald Trump.In a brisk note, Comey told lawmakers that the FBI had "learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation" of Clinton's personal server -- the same probe Comey had said over the summer was effectively over.The bureau, he added now, "cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work."Meting out blame (or claiming credit) for Clinton's loss has become a full-time concern for countless interested parties across the political spectrum.Few if any, Clinton included, would suggest any single factor tipped the race -- one she seemed sure to win for long stretches of the summer -- in Trump's favor.Clinton too has cited an assortment of damaging variables, from the foul headwinds of white grievance to bad journalism.Her book, "What Happened," points fingers just about everywhere, including at herself.But even in such a weird and unpredictable campaign, Friday, October 28 -- just three weeks after the "Access Hollywood" tape dropped -- was uniquely gonzo.By the time it was over, with Clinton back in New York ahead of a Saturday trip to stump in Florida, the tone was changed, and the contest was back in doubt.What follows is a look back at that fateful Friday, as it unfolded on social media.10:57 p.m.ET, October 27: Clinton and first lady Michelle Obama embrace in North Carolina.7:20 a.m.ET, October 28: The campaign is an afterthought in the NYC tabloids.Today's cover: Oregon militia leaders acquitted in wildlife refuge standoff https://t.co/WyXhCqpDdN pic.twitter.com/Sjnf7P01ui New York Post (@nypost) October 28, 2016 Today's front page: SANDY RIPOFF https://t.co/hfaTDJSTHb News finds NYCHA consultants ran up costs on hotels, flight, limos even laundry pic.twitter.com/iXgrQhX6gp New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) October 28, 2016 8:13 a.m.ET: A new poll shows Clinton slipping ...

Fusion GPS, House intel panel reach agreement on subpoena:::::(CNN) Fusion GPS, the research firm behind the dossier containing allegations about President Donald Trump and Russia, its bank and the House intelligence committee have reached an agreement over the panel's subpoena of Fusion's financial records.The agreement comes amid revelations that Perkins Coie -- the law firm representing Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee -- and the conservative Washington Free Beacon separately paid the firm to conduct research on Trump.In a statement Saturday, the House intelligence committee said the agreement "will secure the committee's access to the records necessary for its investigation," while a lawyer for Fusion GPS said "it helped the company honor its legal obligations and protect its First Amendment rights."Fusion GPS asked the US District Court for the District of Columbia earlier this month to stop its bank from turning over financial records subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee as part of its investigation into Russia's attempts to influence last year's election, including allegations in the dossier of collusion by Trump's presidential campaign.The firm argued in its court filing that the release of the financial records would reveal the names of its clients and therefore violate its and their First Amendment rights to free speech and free association.It also claimed the subpoena, authorized by intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes, a California Republican, was too broad.
The week in politics:::::Sen. Jeff Flake talks briefly with reporters after announcing Tuesday that he will not seek re-election .In a blistering speech on the Senate floor, the Arizona Republican denounced President Donald Trump and the "discord" and "dysfunction" he says has come to define US politics."With respect and humility, I must say that we have fooled ourselves for long enough that a pivot to governing is right around the corner, a return to civility and stability right behind it.We know better than that.By now, we all know better than that," Flake said in the 17-minute address.This file, dated April 5, 1964, is one of the thousands on President John F. Kennedy's assassination released for the first time on Thursday.President Trump blocked the release of some of the files, citing national security concerns.Among the revelations in the newly released documents: the CIA mulled mafia hits on Cuban President Fidel Castro; someone called the FBI, threatening to kill Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald a day before Oswald's death; and the United States examined sabotaging airplane parts heading to Cuba.US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley meets South Sudanese refugee children at the Nguenyyiel refugee camp in Ethiopia on Tuesday.Haley also visited South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where she was moved to tears during a visit to a refugee camp there."The reason I got emotional today was the hundred-plus kids that were chasing our cars and seeing us off," Haley said."All I kept thinking was, what's going to happen to them?The sad reality, as it looks now, is that they are going to end up just like their parents."Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images President Donald Trump presents the Medal of Honor to retired US Army Capt.Gary Rose during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House on Monday.Alex Brandon/Pool/AP Photo Secretary of State Rex Tillerson talks with pilots in the cockpit of a C-17 aircraft Monday while en route to Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan.Tillerson was on a six-day trip to the Middle East, South Asia and Europe, where he outlined US priorities in the Middle East.Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call/Sipa USA A protester throws Russian flags at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Donald Trump as the latter arrives on Capitol Hill for meetings with senators on Tuesday.The protester, who identified himself as Ryan Clayton with the group America Take Action, threw the flags before being escorted out of the Ohio Clock corridor.The flags had the word "Trump" on them.Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images President Donald Trump holds up a memorandum after declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency.Trump stressed the need for further enforcement to stop the import and sale of illegal drugs.The declaration did not come with authorization for further federal funds to combat the crisis, Instead, the Trump administration will work with Congress to fund the Public Health Emergency fund and to increase federal funding in year-end budget deals currently being negotiated in Congress.Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images Former President Bill Clinton attends a campaign event for Phil Murphy, a Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor, in Paramus, New Jersey, on Tuesday.David Guralnick/Detroit News/AP First lady Melania Trump talks with students during a trip to Bloomfield Hills, Michigan , on Monday.The first lady discussed the need for inclusion and combating bullying."I always believe that you need to treat each other with respect and kindness and compassion, but also stay true to yourself.Just listen to your heart, but be yourself," Trump told students.J.

In Iowa, Donald Trump Jr. focuses on the hunt:::::Story highlights Iowa Rep. Steve King holds an annual pheasant hunt Donald Trump Jr. was this year's guest of honor Akron, Iowa (CNN) At a northwest Iowa hunting preserve more than 1,000 miles from Washington, a group of hunters clad in neon orange formed a line at the top of a hill, proceeding forward through a deep thicket of brush, kicking up pheasants.A bird spooked, was shot with precision, got picked up by a dog and promptly stuffed into the back of a hunter's vest.The President of the United States' eldest son had gotten another.Donald Trump Jr. was the guest of honor at Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King's annual Col.Bud Day Pheasant Hunt on Saturday, kicking off the 2017 hunting season at the Hole 'N the Wall Lodge here in Akron, a couple miles from the South Dakota border.The two-day hunt, a campaign fundraiser for King, garners a few dozen hunters and about hundred guests for a Saturday evening pork chop and deep-fried pheasant dinner at the lodge.Trump traveled to the lodge late Friday evening, flying commercial on American Airlines to Sioux City with a layover at Chicago O'Hare, where CNN spotted an incognito Patagonia pullover-clad Trump grabbing a quick dinner at the food court.Once he arrived, Trump regaled a group of hunters, including King and Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert, with late-night stories of his life on the 2016 campaign trail, when he was a top surrogate for his father's presidential campaign."Don Jr. just held court.It was just a lot of fun," King told reporters after the morning hunt, calling Trump "witty."Trump did not speak to reporters Saturday and maintained his distance from cameras.Read More
Mattis: Cooperation urgent on 'accelerated' North Korea threat:::::(CNN) Secretary of Defense James Mattis said Saturday that the increasing nuclear threat from North Korea has brought "a new urgency" to military and diplomatic collaboration with South Korea."The threat from North Korea has grown markedly even since my trip here earlier this year," Mattis said while appearing alongside his South Korean counterpart, Song Young-moo, at a press conference in Seoul."North Korea has accelerated the threat that it poses to its neighbors and the world through its illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear weapons programs," he added, emphasizing that the US "does not accept a nuclear North Korea."The Pentagon chief made his remarks one day after visiting the demilitarized zone that separates North and South Korea and meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the country's presidential palace.The actions have prompted the United States and United Nations to impose new sanctions on Pyongyang, but China's cooperation is considered critical to putting economic pressure on North Korea.On Saturday, Song called North Korea's actions a "reckless provocation," while Mattis labeled them "outlaw behavior."While diplomacy "remains our preferred course of action," Mattis said, President Donald Trump has made clear that the US commitment to defending US allies and upholding deterrence are "ironclad."JUST WATCHED What North Koreans think about Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What North Koreans think about Trump 03:17 "Make no mistake.Any attack on the United States or our allies will be defeated," Mattis said."Any use of nuclear weapons by the North will be met with a massive military response, effective and overwhelming."The two defense chiefs said they had discussed a range of topics, including the pursuit of new military capabilities and the operational control of South Korean military forces in the event of a war on the peninsula.One issue they said was not discussed during their meetings was whether the United States would once again deploy tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea, a practice that was stopped at the end of the Cold War."Given the national interest considerations at stake we believe that a tactical nuke is not worth deploying to the Korean Peninsula," Song said when asked about the issue by a reporter.Mattis said "this subject has not been broached to me by the Republic of Korea government," and emphasized that the goal of the international community is to denuclearize the peninsula.
Trump promises to release all JFK files:::::(CNN) President Donald Trump said Friday night on Twitter that he would release all documents related to President John F. Kennedy's assassination, a pledge that comes despite national security agencies' last-minute requests to keep some of the records secret.The President said he came to the decision after consulting with his chief of staff, John Kelly, as well as the CIA and other agencies, and would release all files "other than the names and addresses of any mentioned person who is still living.""I am doing this for reasons of full disclosure, transparency and in order to put any and all conspiracy theories to rest," the President tweeted.In a memo Thursday, Trump directed agencies that requested redactions to reassess their reasons for keeping the records secret, and said he would make a decision on those requests within 180 days.But it is unclear what his latest statement would do to that timeline.The White House has not provided a definitive timeline for the National Archives and Records Administration to release all the files; a White House official told CNN that the period of time has not been determined.Read More
Trump leaning toward banker Jerome Powell to run Fed:::::It appears President Trump is zeroing in on a choice for next Federal Reserve chair.Two sources told CNN on Saturday that Trump will likely name Jerome Powell to lead the central bank.Powell, a Republican, has been a governor on the Fed's board since 2012, and he was assigned to lead the bank's Wall Street oversight committee back in April.Trump has yet to make a formal decision, but the White House said he'd announce his choice next week.He could still change his mind, the sources said.His apparent lean toward Powell is a major development.For weeks there has been speculation about whether Trump would renominate current Fed chair Janet Yellen to another four-year term.Yellen was nominated by President Obama in 2013, and her current term expires in February 2018.During his campaign, Trump accused Yellen of making policy decisions aimed at earning political points for Obama.But since Trump was inaugurated, he softened his tone and has even praised Yellen's decision making.Yet, the pair stand at odds on several issues.Trump has promised to start peeling back the financial regulations put in place after the financial crisis of 2008.Yellen is generally not a fan of that idea.She argues they're key to the U.S.'s continued economic recovery, though she has suggested she'd be willing to take a second look at certain Dodd-Frank rules that apply to small banks.Yellen could not be immediately reached for comment on Saturday.Trump's pick for Fed chair is one of the most important decisions he'll make as president.The U.S. central bank leader is considered one of the most powerful posts in the world.On Friday, sources told CNN that the list of candidates Trump was considering was down to about three.The names included Yellen, Powell, and Stanford economist John Taylor Powell would be an unusual pick.Every Fed chair since 1979 has been an economist, but Powell's background is in investment banking.Powell is largely supportive of Yellen's approach to slowing raising interest rates as the economy improves.He's been backed by Mnuchin, who has spearheaded Trump's Fed chair search.
Poll: 71% of Americans say politics has reached a dangerous low point:::::Story highlights Some 70% of those polled said divisions today are at least as big as during the Vietnam War era Fifty-one percent said President Donald Trump deserves "a lot" of the blame for the dysfunction Forty-nine percent place "a lot" of blame on news media for causing the dysfunction Washington (CNN) Amid a growing partisan gap between Democrats and Republicans, a new poll shows that 71% of Americans believe the country's politics have reached a dangerous low point in the Trump era.According to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released Saturday, only 29% said they believed this period in American politics is "similar to most periods of disagreement."And the majority of participants who said politics have reached a dangerous low point said the climate is a "new normal," not "temporary."Some 70% of those polled from September 27 through October 5 said divisions today are at least as big as they were during the Vietnam War era.For individuals polled who were adults during the Vietnam War, the percentage was higher than the average -- 77%.A majority of those polled, 51%, said President Donald Trump deserves "a lot" of the blame for the dysfunction in the American political system, below the share placing as much blame on money in politics (65%), wealthy donors (56%) or people with extreme views (56%), but above the share putting a lot of blame on either party (38% for Republicans, 32% for Democrats) or members of Congress (47%).In addition, 49% place "a lot" of blame on the news media for causing the dysfunction, and the same percentage say social media bears much of the responsibility.Read More
Melania Trump does things her way:::::Washington (CNN) During a Thursday afternoon event in the White House's East Room , first lady Melania Trump stood at the podium and closed her remarks by saying something she has not often said -- and certainly not said lately -- about her husband: "I am so proud to support him today, as he sees this commitment through."It was a perfectly conventional thing for a first lady to say.In this case, she was discussing President Donald Trump's decision to declare a public health emergency to stem the country's ongoing opioid crisis .But like so many other things in the Trump administration, for the first couple, convention is an anomaly and the line of support marked a rare public moment.Melania Trump, in stark contrast to her seemingly ubiquitous husband, has emerged as the most mysterious woman in Washington.Since moving here with her son, Barron, 11, this summer, she has demonstrated none of the extrovert bravado that so defines the man she married.In fact, of late it's been her quietly touted solo activities that have begun to define an otherwise private first lady.'Mrs.Trump is independent' Take, for example, the East Wing response to cries of hypocrisy when she outlined an early platform taking on school bullying The idea that Melania Trump would tackle bullying when her husband is seen by millions as one of the country's best examples of bad behavior sparked countless opinion pieces pointing out how he uses terms such as "wacky" and "liddle" for elected officials.Asked by CNN if the first lady feels the need to reconcile that irony with what she's trying to accomplish, Trump's communications director Stephanie Grisham said flatly, "no.""Mrs. Trump is independent and acts independently from her husband," Grisham told CNN at the time."She does what she feels is right and knows that she has a real opportunity through her role as first lady to have a positive impact on the lives of children.Her only focus is to effect change within our next generation."The statement is clearly meant to separate the first lady from the orbit of her husband, which is fundamentally different than first ladies of recent memory.But the idea that Trump is doing things her own way shouldn't come as a surprise, said Anita McBride, who served as chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush."A first lady gets to rewrite the position and the job description any way she wants to, and Melania has, from Day 1, really, been charting her own course," McBride said."From the beginning, by saying she wasn't even going to move down to Washington right away, she has been very open and honest about doing things on her own time, in her own way."McBride pointed to how the first lady has staffed her office with just nine members, as opposed to the 20 or so that predecessors Michelle Obama and Laura Bush each had."It's not the way it's been done in the past, but this is a first lady who said she was interested in quality and not quantity," she said.But part of Melania Trump's unique path is born of necessity.A former Obama White House official said Michelle Obama, who did pursue an agenda independent of her husband, would never have needed to distance herself so explicitly from him."There would never have been anything similar to that (statement from Grisham) because it wasn't an issue for the Obamas," the official told CNN."Michelle Obama had her own agenda -- Let Girls Learn, Let's Move, Joining Forces -- but at no point did any of those conflict with the President's words, actions, or policies," the source said.Spousal support At a private dinner for the White House Historical Association, Trump told the audience that America is enamored with the first lady."They love her out there ... they're loving Melania," he said, calling her the "star of the Trump family."Still, there are high-profile times the couple appeared out of step.In August, after a spate of national and international crises, from the Barcelona terror attacks to the Charlottesville, Virginia, riots, it became apparent that the first lady's voice of support and condolence, through her social media accounts, was far more timely and compassionate than that of her husband.A White House official said the first lady does not check in with her husband before posting."She is her own person," the official told CNN."She operates the account herself and pays close attention to which events warrant comment, and which do not."The divide in approach again points to a first couple unlike those that came before."Mrs. Bush would always say, 'I'm not here for myself, I'm here for George and because of George,' and that was the prism and the filter she used for her platform," said McBride.Literacy, the cause she championed, fit well into the President's overarching initiatives, so the melding was relatively seamless.Photos: Melania Trump donates her inaugural gown to Smithsonian First lady Melania Trump

"The East Wing definitely has some independence, but not this kind of independence," said the Obama White House official, referring to the Trump's differing philosophies."It hasn't before been as though there's a completely different view of the world from one side than the other."The same could be said of how previous first ladies got in the trenches with their husbands when the heat was on.McBride pointed to Hurricane Katrina as an example of the Bushes having each other's back."There were things like that which were controversial for him, but that didn't stop her from being there, from her going down to New Orleans 26 times after the storm and working on behalf of the administration, even when the administration wasn't necessarily in good standing down there," McBride said.McBride, who also worked in the Reagan administration as director of White House personnel, said Nancy Reagan would speak up quite frequently to West Wing staff when it came to President Ronald Reagan's policies and positions."She always had her antenna up, and in her mind she was doing what she felt best served the President," said McBride."She did it because she 100% was trying to protect him and shape how he was remembered by history."The Trump dynamic doesn't appear to operate in the same manner, at least not on the surface.The first lady rarely gets involved with her husband's scuffles, or his bruising responses to those who oppose him."I think he hears me.But he will do what he wants to do on the end.He's an adult.He knows the consequences.And I give him my opinion.And he could do whatever he likes with it," Trump told "60 Minutes."In June, after the President tweeted harsh words at MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski, Grisham was asked if the first lady had anything to say about the dispute."As the first lady has stated publicly in the past, when her husband gets attacked, he will punch back 10 times harder," was all the statement said.Outside perceptions vs. reality JUST WATCHED Trumps display affection during speech Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trumps display affection during speech 02:03 The observations about the first lady having her own independent methodology does not, however, seem to imply the couple doesn't get along.In fact, one observer who has spent time with them lately says she has seen the President be "very affectionate" with Melania at times, and that he is "deferential to her.""I can appreciate how perceptions of the first couple on the outside are generally wrong," said McBride, who witnessed both the public and private sides of both the Bushes and the Reagans."For President Bush and the first lady, their lives were so completely intertwined, they didn't even have to speak a word, they could merely be in the same room to know what the other was thinking or feeling, so demonstrating that closeness just wasn't necessary -- and that could sometimes be perceived as a coldness or as trouble.But it wasn't," she said.A current White House official said the first lady's primary objective right now has little to do with how her relationship with the President is perceived by White House observers."She wants to establish herself as a first lady who helps children, that's her mission while her husband is in office," the official told CNN.Next week, the first lady will accompany her husband to Asia, where she is expected to attend ceremonies and dinners with him, standing by his side, as she is often seen doing.But CNN has learned Melania Trump also has a number of solo events on the itinerary, too.They are likely to showcase the burgeoning independence that's happening not because of, but perhaps in spite of, her husband's tumultuous presidency.
Denying 'sonic attacks,' Cuba names diplomats, releases medical record:::::Story highlights Cuban state-run TV documentary releases documents on "acoustic attacks" Cuban officials in the documentary deny targeting diplomats Havana, Cuba (CNN) The Cuban government apparently named for the first time some of the US diplomats who suffered health problems as a result of a series of mysterious incidents in Havana that US officials have described as attacks on their personnel.The names of nine people identified as US diplomats were shown briefly on Cuban state-run TV Thursday night during a half -hour program on the incidents that have caused US-Cuban relations to sink to their lowest point in years.Cuban officials in the TV program "Presumed Acoustic Attacks" vehemently denied targeting the diplomats and said no evidence exists to suggest they actually took place.In the April 2017 letter shown on TV, officials from the Cuban Interior Ministry-- the agency investigating the alleged attacks-- requested information from a government hospital in Havana that treats foreigners on whether any of the nine US diplomats named in the letter had received care there.The letter --one of several documents shown on the program-- asks hospital officials if the diplomats were ever treated for "hearing and neurological ailments, which could be linked to harm to their auditory system from being exposed to levels of sound affecting their health."Read More
What Betsy DeVos' schedule tells us about her agenda:::::Washington (CNN) Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has been a lightning rod since taking office in February.But little has been known about her behind-the-scenes work to reform the way American education is delivered.Her office typically releases a listing of public events , but the schedules -- from February 8 through July 19 -- delve much deeper, showing phone calls and meetings with individuals from Silicon Valley, politics and the business world.Here's what her schedule shows: School Visits DeVos's passion for school choice was mirrored in her selections for school visits during first months on the job.She visited 23 schools during her first four-and-a-half months as education secretary.Among schools for children in grades K-12, she made appearances at five charter schools, four religious schools and eight public schools.Education Week's reporting on DeVos's current school visits indicates that the secretary has visited 33 schools since being sworn in, including 16 traditional public schools, seven charter schools and nine private schools.DeVos chaired the pro-charter schools group American Federation for Children and served on the board of the Foundation for Excellence in Education, which promoted school choice and Common Core.In addition to her school visits, DeVos's first months on the job included several meetings with charter school advocates, local and state education groups and religious organizations, according to the schedules.Meetings with conservatives, business groups, and financiers DeVos, the former chair of an investment firm whose husband, Dick DeVos, is the CEO of Amway, met with several business groups interested in learning about her new role.DeVos attended meetings with the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, the South Carolina African American Chamber of Commerce and the Florida Chamber of Commerce.She also met with former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.In his new role with the investment bank Moelis & Co., Cantor and other bankers met with DeVos to talk about the Department of Education's existing portfolio on student loans.A note on the meeting said the investment group was there "to discuss a private/public partnership approach to fund student loans in the future."In addition to investment bankers in Washington, she also visited some big names in Silicon Valley, including Emerson Collective, Google, and Thiel Capital.Not surprisingly, many visitors to DeVos' office have been figures in the education reform movement or stakeholders in her school choice efforts.Some have represented charter schools, such as the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, or religious groups, like the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the American Association of Christian Schools, whose members could see enrollment grow if more states adopt voucher programs.Meetings with celebrities In addition to meeting with Emerson Collective's Laurene Powell Jobs and having breakfast with Peter Thiel at his home, DeVos met with some notable entertainers.In April, DeVos joined musician Pitbull at his charter school in Miami.Thanks @Pitbull for welcoming me to SLAM Academy today and for your commitment to improving options for parents and students!pic.twitter.com/O04JGjlEMZ Betsy DeVos (@BetsyDeVosED) April 6, 2017 She also spent a half hour in her office with Caitlyn Jenner, although the topics discussed in their meeting were not disclosed.Jenner, who says she may run for office, wouldn't go into detail about the meeting, but speaking about the Trump administration's work on LGBTQ issues, told the Daily Beast "(DeVos is) actually on our side.She's extraordinarily good."Jenner has also voiced dissent over President Donald Trump's decision to rescind Obama-era protections which allowed transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice at their schools.And "Hillbilly Elegy" author J.D.Vance got a "lunch and learn" call from DeVos in July.Messaging advice DeVos's schedule also reveals she has been consulting with messaging experts.Conservative messaging guru and pollster Frank Luntz brought DeVos ideas for communicating her policy priorities."Frank has a 60 slide deck of the words to use and the words to lose regarding parental choice, vouchers, charter schools, teacher pay, and all other issues in education reform," reads a note on the June 21 calendar entry.In her second week on the job, DeVos met with Diana Banister, whose firm has worked with conservative clients such as Citizens United, Tea Party Patriots and the Susan B. Anthony List.DeVos also spoke by phone in February with Kayleigh McEnany, who is now a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee and was, at the time, a conservative commentator on CNN.The next day, DeVos attended the Conservative Political Action Conference, where she gave a speech and fielded a series of softball questions onstage from McEnany.DeVos and teachers' unions at war There's no love lost between DeVos and the nation's largest teachers' unions.Lily Eskelsen Garca of the National Education Association labeled DeVos the "the queen of for-profit privatization of public education."Randi Weingarten of the American Federation of Teachers branded her "an existential threat to public education" and bashed school vouchers as "only slightly more polite cousins of segregation."DeVos bludgeoned unions for defending the "status quo" and what she called an archaic "system that by every account is failing too many kids."While both union presidents have lashed out at DeVos, the documents show very different approaches behind the scenes.Eskelsen Garca has kept true to her pledge to not work with DeVos -- neither she nor representatives from NEA appear on DeVos' schedule.Weingarten and DeVos, however, have had an ongoing dialogue.They've talked at least three times by phone -- in February, April and May -- and together visited a public school in Ohio.The first call came a week after DeVos was sworn in.DeVos's office did not comment for this report.
Conservative groups to McSally: Stay out of Arizona's Senate race:::::Washington (CNN) Conservative groups are trying to scare Rep. Martha McSally away from Arizona's Republican primary to replace retiring Sen. Jeff Flake.Since Flake -- faced with an all-but-certain primary loss against former state Sen. Kelli Ward -- announced his retirement this week, Republicans have searched for an alternative to Ward, a conservative firebrand who is seen as prone to missteps and a poor fit for a race against Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema.McSally and Rep. Paul Gosar expressed interest in running for Flake's Senate seat when the state's congressional delegation met Thursday in Washington, an Arizona Republican operative familiar with the meeting said.McSally met with Sen. John McCain on Thursday.McSally, a decorated military veteran and second-term House member who has won in a competitive district and is a strong fundraiser, is seen as the preference of national Republicans and Gov.Doug Ducey.But her history of criticizing President Donald Trump made her the target of a show-of-force statement from conservative groups that spend heavily in GOP primaries, including the Club for Growth, the Senate Conservatives Fund and FreedomWorks.Read More
Barack Obama called for jury duty in Illinois:::::(CNN) Barack Obama has fulfilled his civic duty as president.Now comes another role as a citizen: jury duty.Cook County Chief Judge Timothy Evans told county commissioners Friday that Obama has been summoned for jury duty next month in Illinois, according to CNN affiliate WLS.Obama plans to serve as juror, according to WLS.CNN has reached out to Evans and Obama's representative, but has not heard back.The former president lives in Washington, but maintains a home in Chicago.With a Harvard Law School degree, experience teaching law and eight years as commander in chief, he is a pretty decent candidate for jury duty.Obama is not the first former president to receive a notice for jury duty.In 2015, former President George W. Bush reported for jury duty at a Dallas courthouse.While Bush was not selected, he sat through the process and posed for photos with other potential jurors.Read More
US troops in Niger were separated, lost communication, and counterattacked:::::(CNN) The twelve member Green Beret-led team that was ambushed by militants in Niger earlier this month became separated during the firefight and attempted to mount a counterattack, US officials told CNN Friday.The two groups also lost contact with one another during the battle, likely adding to the confusion surrounding the engagement, one of the officials said.The squad was traveling with 30 Nigerien soldiers when they were attacked by approximately 50 ISIS-affiliated fighters armed with rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and heavy machine guns, according to US military officials.In the subsequent gun battle, which lasted for hours, four US soldiers were killed and two were wounded.Their Nigerien interpreter and four Nigerien soldiers were also killed.US-Nigerien forces managed to kill 20 militants during the fight on October 4 using primarily small arms.At least one vehicle, an unarmored pick-up truck, was disabled by enemy fire in the initial ambush.During the firefight, the US team separated into two groups, with some of the US soldiers dismounting from their vehicle to maneuver on foot in an attempt to counterattack and out-flank their attackers, multiple sources briefed on the investigation told CNN.A Nigerien soldier who was part of the unit that later came to the aid of the joint US-Nigerien force told CNN that wounded Nigerien troops told him that the first two vehicles had been hit by militants and subsequently split from the convoy.As the battle continued, one group of American soldiers lost communication with a second group that included at least some of the Americans killed in action, one source familiar with investigative reports said.Yet despite the two groups possibly losing contact with one another, the Pentagon said Thursday that that at least some of the team maintained the ability to radio back to their base, which enabled them to call in for air support about one hour after the ambush began."Anytime you put a unit out there in place like this, you've got good communications and procedures, you've got a solid, thorough, comm plan that's been tested with backups," Joint Staff Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie said in a briefing with reporters at the Pentagon Thursday."Somebody's always going to answer the radio on the other end when the commander on the ground presses it," McKenzie added.An unarmed surveillance drone arrived within minutes after receiving the call for support, and armed French Mirage jets flew overhead an hour later, with officials saying the French jets' show of force helped disperse the remaining attackers.CNN has also learned that the White House was initially told that all four soldiers could be missing in the wake of the deadly attack.According to an administration official, initial information conveyed to the White House stated that a total of four soldiers were missing in action; the military soon updated its reporting, changing the status of the four soldiers to three killed in action and one missing, Sgt.La David Johnson.A large-scale search and rescue operation involving US, French and Nigerien troops was launched soon after US officials realized US service members were unaccounted for.Elite US special operations forces troops were flown in from the continental US to aid in the recovery effort.US Navy SEALs were deployed to a US military base in Sigonella, Sicily, in anticipation of a possible rescue attempt.Johnson would not be recovered for another 48 hours.French Super Puma military helicopters and contractor aircraft landed to evacuate the wounded US and Nigerien troops, and then later returned for the bodies of the dead.The bodies of three of the fallen soldiers -- excluding Johnson -- were recovered by a separate team of Niger-based US military personnel using contractor aircraft, according to two US defense officials.Johnson's body was finally recovered 48 hours after the attack, nearly a mile away from the scene, four administration officials familiar with the early assessment of what happened told CNN last week.Defense officials have stressed that at no point were any of four dead soldiers "abandoned," saying that the Nigerien relief force accompanied by "a handful" of French military advisers stayed on scene until the bodies were airlifted out.A US intelligence official told CNN this week that ISIS in the Greater Sahara is likely responsible for the ambush.ISIS in the Greater Sahara has attacked pro-Bamako militias supporting French and United Nations forces deployed in northern Mali, and regional security forces in Burkina Faso and Niger.ISIS in the Greater Sahara was established in 2015 after the group's current leader, Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi, broke from the al Qaeda associated al-Murabitun group.
Trump, GOP try to flip the script on Russia collusion:::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump and his allies in Washington are seizing on a pair of revelations about his former rival Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party aiming to flip the months-long narrative about potential Russian collusion.Republicans this week launched a multi-pronged attack -- from the White House, Capitol Hill and politicos around town -- on Democrats and their former nominee after reports revealed that the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee helped fund an opposition research effort that produced a controversial dossier that made allegations (including many salacious and unverified ones) about Trump and his Russian ties; and as new questions surfaced about the circumstances surrounding the sale of a Canadian-based uranium mining company during Clinton's time leading the State Department.Court documents connected with the case reviewed do not reference donations to the Clinton Foundation, nor attempts by US or Russian interests to influence the Uranium One deal decision.Since these allegations have resurfaced in the wake of recent reporting, Clinton and members of her staff have disputed accusations that anything improper occurred surrounding the approval of the Uranium One deal.Clinton said in an interview with C-SPAN this week that any accusations that she was bribed to approve the deal were "baloney" and that they had been "debunked repeatedly."The reaction from Trump and his Republican allies was swift and synchronized, serving to muddy the waters and draw attention away from the investigations and allegations the President and his allies still face."It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump.Was collusion with HC!"Trump tweeted, referring to Clinton.On Capitol Hill, congressional Republicans opened two fresh Clinton-related investigations into the uranium sale and the decision by the FBI not to pursue criminal charges against Clinton over her private email use.And throughout the week, Republican political operations from the RNC to Trump-aligned surrogates flooded the airwaves and reporters' inboxes with allegations that the real tale of collusion was on the other side of the aisle.Republicans, who have spent months on defense amid allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, jumped back into an attack posture."This is a major development and one of the first openings we've had on this issue in months," said an RNC official, who requested anonymity to candidly discuss the Republican strategy.The RNC official and a senior White House official said the revelations gave Republicans and the White House an opportunity to go on the offensive and divert attention from the investigations facing the President.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders did just that on Friday as she took to the White House podium and claimed: "All the things that the Democrats have accused the President of doing, they are actually guilty of themselves.""If any collusion took place, it would be between the DNC and the Clintons," Sanders said.A White House official said Sanders was referring to the Democratic-funded dossier compiled by a former British intelligence official, which leveled allegations about Trump and his associates' ties to Russia as well as to months-old allegations that a DNC contractor met with Ukrainian officials offering information that could be damaging to Trump's campaign.The DNC has vehemently denied any collusion with the Ukrainian government.The White House and its allies' argument: that the dossier -- initially funded by still-undisclosed Republicans during the 2016 primary campaign -- amounts to collusion because it included information sourced to Russian intelligence sources.The allegation is hardly as hard-hitting as those Trump and his allies have faced, particularly given that the federal investigation and the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Russian meddling and allegations of collusion were not triggered by the dossier.Trump, meanwhile, still faces the scrutiny of public investigators for his firing of FBI director James Comey -- which Trump has said was because of "this Russia thing" -- his campaign associates' meetings with Russian officials, including most notably his eldest son's meeting with a Russian lawyer he believed would furnish the Trump campaign with incriminating information on Clinton from the Russian government.And the Trump campaign once again found itself answering questions about allegations of collusion after the Daily Beast revealed earlier this week , and CNN confirmed, that the head of a data firm employed by the Trump campaign emailed WikiLeaks head Julian Assange hoping to gain access to 33,000 emails deleted off of Clinton's server.US intelligence officials believe many of the hacked emails Assange released were obtained as part of a Russian hacking campaign.But the allegations Trump and his allies are now lobbing at Democrats don't have to pan out to be effective.A senior White House official said the allegations would at a minimum "demonstrate that this is a far more complicated matter than people lead on."The allegations and attacks against Clinton mark a return to the tried-and-true GOP attack playbook of raising suspicion about Clinton's actions."The news about Hillary Clinton and the DNC paying for the research behind the Russia dossier raises a lot of questions that I think are fair to ask from the RNC and from other groups," an RNC official said."There's at least a perception that Democrats and the Clinton campaign lied about this -- that this is very Clinton-esque."
GOP megadonor requested Trump's data firm organize hacked Clinton emails:::::Story highlights Cambridge Analytica employees did not start working for Trump campaign until July 2016 The firm was part of the Trump campaign's three-pronged data operation (CNN) Cambridge Analytica funder and Trump donor Rebekah Mercer received an email in August 2016 from someone she had recently met at a political event, suggesting that they create a searchable data base for Hillary Clinton emails in the public domain.Mercer then forwarded the suggestion to several people, including Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, asking if this is something they could do.That is what prompted Nix's email response that he had contacted Julian Assange two months earlier asking for Clinton's emails, according to a source familiar with the Mercer and Nix email chain.The source would not disclose the name of the person who originally emailed Mercer but did say, according to the email, they met at a Ted Cruz related event.Before supporting Trump, the Mercer family backed the Texas Republican's presidential campaign.Read More
Trump. Cambridge Analytica. WikiLeaks. The connections, explained.:::::Washington (CNN) There is a web of connections between the Trump campaign, the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks and the public disclosures it injected into the presidential campaign.Federal investigators are examining some of these relationships and whether any of them were part of an effort to coordinate with Russia's election-meddling campaign.This week, a new thread emerged: Multiple sources confirmed to CNN that the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, contacted WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in summer 2016 to ask for access to emails from Hillary Clinton's private server.Sources told CNN that he asked for the emails because he wanted to catalog them on a searchable database that would be made available to the Trump campaign or a pro-Trump PAC.There is no evidence WikiLeaks ever hacked or possessed the emails sought by Nix.But the contact alone raises new questions about Cambridge Analytica's potential role in Russia's efforts to undermine Clinton's campaign.It's a messy situation and, with so many unanswered questions, such as what Cambridge Analytica knew about Wikileaks' Russia connection when it sought Clinton's missing emails.Still, it's important to consider the broader context.The timeline below tracks how things unfolded, based on all we know.March 10, 2015 -- Clinton acknowledges using private email server Soon-to-be Democratic presidential candidate Clinton publicly acknowledged for the first time that she used a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state.She also said she deleted about 30,000 emails about personal matters unrelated to her work for the Obama administration.The deleted emails, which have never seen the light of day, later became a flashpoint of the campaign.June 16, 2015 -- Trump launches presidential campaign Trump announced that he is running for president , ending months of rampant speculation."I am officially running for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again," he told a crowd at Trump Tower.When he declared his candidacy, Trump was in the middle of the GOP pack, trailing in polls to former Florida Gov.Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio and others.July 2015 -- Russian hackers breach DNC systems Hackers working for Russian intelligence services "gained access to" the Democratic National Committee's computer networks as part of the Kremlin's campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential race, according to the US intelligence community assessment that was published after the election.March 2016 -- Another group of Russian hackers breach DNC systems Another group of Russian hackers -- separate from the group that hacked the DNC in 2015 -- breached the DNC's computer systems, according to a US intelligence report published after the election.The US intelligence community says Russian intelligence related stolen materials from the DNC to WikiLeaks for public release.CNN reported this year that Russia gave WikiLeaks the emails through an intermediary.March 19, 2016 -- Russian hackers gain access to Podesta's emails Russian hackers gained access to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's personal Gmail account by sending a phishing email.The US intelligence community determined in early 2017 that Russian intelligence later gave WikiLeaks hacked emails from Democratic "political figures," an oblique reference to Podesta.CNN reported this year that Russia gave WikiLeaks the emails through an intermediary.May 3, 2016 -- Trump becomes presumptive Republican nominee After Trump's victory in the Indiana primary , his main remaining rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, suspended his campaign.By bowing out, Cruz cemented Trump's position as the presumptive GOP nominee.June 2016 -- Mercer family endorses Trump The Mercer family, led by Republican megadonor Robert Mercer, begins supporting Trump's candidacy and starts donating to pro-Trump efforts.The family previously backed Cruz in the GOP primaries.The family financially backs Cambridge Analytica, which started working for Trump over the summer of 2016.Some members of Cambridge Analytica staff were incorporated in the Trump campaign's data operation team.June 9, 2016 -- Trump tweets about Clinton's deleted emails Responding to a quip from Clinton, Trump posted on Twitter : "How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up--and where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted?"This tweet came the same day that Donald Trump Jr., Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met a group of Russians at Trump Tower.Trump Jr. was told before the meeting that one of the Russians would offer incriminating information about Clinton.June 15, 2016 -- DNC claims it was hacked by Russian intelligence The DNC and CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm it hired to investigate the breaches, revealed publicly for the first time that its servers were penetrated.CrowdStrike said it "identified two sophisticated adversaries on the network" that were associated with Russian intelligence services.Trump dismissed the notion that Russia was behind the hacks, saying "we believe it was the DNC that did the 'hacking' as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader.Too bad the DNC doesn't hack Hillary Clinton's 33,000 missing emails."July 19-21, 2016 -- Republican National Convention is held in Cleveland Trump officially became the presidential nominee for the Republican Party during the Republican National Convention, which was held in Cleveland.During the convention, a handful of Trump campaign advisers briefly met with then-Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.Between July 21 and July 31, 2016 -- Cambridge Analytica CEO emails WikiLeaks Alexander Nix, the chief executive of data firm Cambridge Analytica, emailed Assange seeking access to emails from Clinton's private server so he could turn them into a searchable database for the campaign or a pro-Trump political action committee.There is no evidence that Clinton's deleted emails were ever hacked or that WikiLeaks ever had possession of them.The Wall Street Journal reported that the email was sent in late July 2016 at some point following the Republican National Convention.This was around the same time Cambridge Analytica started working for the Trump campaign as part of its three-pronged data operation based in San Antonio, Texas.Right-wing firebrand Steve Bannon was a member of the Cambridge Analytica board when Nix sent the email, according to The New York Times.Bannon later became CEO of the Trump campaign and stepped down from the data analytics company.He took a top White House job in January but left over the summer.July 22, 2016 -- WikiLeaks releases about 20,000 hacked DNC emails WikiLeaks posted on its website nearly 20,000 emails that were stolen from the DNC servers.Many of the emails were sent by senior DNC officials.Some of the emails suggested that the DNC favored Clinton over Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primaries, leading to allegations that the primary was rigged.July 25-28, 2016 -- Democratic National Convention is held in Philadelphia Democrats held their convention in Philadelphia and formally selected Clinton as their nominee.The gathering was roiled by the WikiLeaks disclosures, which were released days earlier.The emails upset Sanders supporters, and forced DNC chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wassermann Schultz to quit her post July 25, 2016 -- Trump says it's a "joke" that Russia hacked the DNC Trump weighed in on the DNC leaks, saying on Twitter : "The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me."July 26, 2016 -- NYT reports that the US believes Russia hacked the DNC The New York Times published a report that claimed US intelligence agencies told the White House that they were highly confident that the Russian government was responsible for hacking the DNC.This was the first public report suggesting that the US government agreed with the DNC's assessment.July 27, 2016 -- Trump publicly asks Russia to hack Clinton's deleted emails At a news conference , Trump publicly called on the Russian government to hack Clinton's private email server and reveal the deleted emails.Trump's campaign later said his comment was a joke."if it is Russia -- which it's probably not, nobody knows who it is -- but if it is Russia, it's really bad for a different reason, because it shows how little respect they have for our country, when they would hack into a major party and get everything," Trump said."But it would be interesting to see -- I will tell you this -- Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.Let's see if that happens.That'll be next."July 29, 2016 -- Trump campaign pays $100,000 to Cambridge Analytica The Trump campaign made its first of five payments to Cambridge Analytica, cutting a check for $100,000, according to records from the Federal Election Commission.August 8, 2016 -- Roger Stone says he was in touch with Assange During a speech in Florida , former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone claimed to be in touch with Assange and predicted upcoming WikiLeaks releases: "I actually have communicated with Assange.I believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation but there's no telling what the October surprise may be."He later clarified that while he was in contact with Assange, it came through an intermediary.August 14-17, 2016 -- Stone exchanges messages with Russian hackers Stone exchanged direct Twitter messages with Guccifer 2.0, a self-proclaimed hacker who published stolen materials from the DNC earlier in the summer.(These DNC releases were separate from the DNC emails published by WikiLeaks.)The Twitter messages were about the contents of some of the stolen DNC materials that Guccifer posted online earlier that summer.Stone denies any wrongdoing or collusion.Months after these Twitter messages, the US intelligence community announced that Guccifer 2.0 was actually run by Russian intelligence operatives as part of the Kremlin's effort to meddle in the election.August 18, 2016 -- Trump campaign pays $250,000 to Cambridge Analytica The Trump campaign made its second of five payments to Cambridge Analytica, cutting a check for $250,000, according to records from the Federal Election Commission.August 21, 2016 -- Stone predicts upcoming trouble for Podesta Without specifically referencing emails, Stone predicts that Podesta will soon be in hot water."Trust me, it will soon the Podesta's time in the barrel," he tweeted .Stone later claimed that he wasn't talking about the upcoming WikiLeaks releases but was alluding to an expose he was planning on his own.September 1, 2016 -- Trump campaign pays $5 million to Cambridge Analytica The Trump campaign made its second of five payments to Cambridge Analytica, cutting a check for $5 million, according to records from the Federal Election Commission.The massive payment -- the largest from the campaign to the

questioned the recent US intelligence statement that the Russian government was interfering in the 2016 election."I think it's probably unlikely," Trump said."I think maybe the Democrats are putting that out, who knows?But I think that it's pretty unlikely."King's show is broadcast on RT, the Kremlin-controlled news network that targets English-speaking audiences.The US intelligence community says the Kremlin promoted its election-meddling campaign on RT.The Trump campaign said it didn't know King's show was broadcast on the Russian network.September 9, 2016 -- Stone exchanges more messages with Russian hackers Stone exchanged direct Twitter messages with Guccifer 2.0.The emails were about the contents of some publicly released DNC materials.Stone denies wrongdoing or collusion.Months after these Twitter messages, the US intelligence community announced that Guccifer 2.0 was actually run by Russian intelligence operatives as part of the Kremlin's effort to meddle in the election.September 16, 2016 -- Stone predicts WikiLeaks will release Clinton emails Stone says in a radio interview that WikiLeaks will release new Clinton emails."I expect Julian Assange and the WikiLeaks people to drop a payload of new documents on Hillary on a weekly basis fairly soon.And that, of course, will answer the question of exactly what was erased on that email server."October 2, 2016 -- Stone alludes to future WikiLeaks releases Stone appeared to predict that WikiLeaks would soon post damaging materials about Clinton.He posted : "Wednesday @HillaryClinton is

releasing thousands of emailed hacked from Podesta's email account.October 7, 2016 -- US formally blames Russia for DNC hacks The US government broke its silence about the DNC hack.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the entire US intelligence community, announced that the Russian government was behind the hacked emails released by WikiLeaks."The US Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations," the statement said, adding that disclosures on WikiLeaks were consistent with Russian methods.October 7, 2016 -- WikiLeaks begins releasing Podesta emails Shortly after the announcement blaming Russia for the DNC hacks, WikiLeaks began posting thousands of emails stolen from Podesta's Gmail account.WikiLeaks went on to release new Podesta emails on a near-daily basis, creating waves of negative headlines for the Clinton campaign in the closing weeks of the election.Trump regularly cited the latest Podesta releases during campaign rallies in October and November.The US government later said Russia was responsible for the hacks.October 10, 2016 -- Trump says "I love WikiLeaks" At a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump expressed his admiration for the anti-secrecy website that was publishing dirt on his

Conway confirms Trump wanted FBI informant's gag order lifted:::::Washington (CNN) In response to reporting that President Donald Trump personally pressed for an informant's gag order to be lifted, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said Friday that he wanted the informant to be free to speak out."He believes, as many others do, frankly, that the FBI informant should be free to say what he knows," Conway said on CNN's "New Day."CNN reported Thursday that Trump told his staff to work with the Justice Department to allow an undercover FBI informant who played a critical role in an FBI investigation into Russian efforts to gain influence in the uranium industry in the United States during the Obama administration to be free to speak with Congress.Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has called for the Justice Department to do the same.Conway, in the interview, pointed to Grassley's request."That's the proper channel here," Conway said.In an interview on Fox News, Attorney General Jeff Sessions repeatedly said he hadn't discussed the matter with the President."What I would say is that Senator Grassley has been direct with us for some time," Sessions said."We worked with Senator Grassley and are very happy to be able to approve his testimony before the Senate judiciary."White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said she was not aware of any specific involvement by the President, when asked by CNN's Jim Acosta about it Friday at a daily news briefing."The President has pushed for transparency, if that's what you are referring to, when dealing with Congress," Sanders said."I know that's probably something new, for a president to actually push for transparency," she said."But that's what he's done, and that was the purpose what he was trying to do in that process."The Justice Department has strict rules limiting the White House's involvement in criminal law enforcement matters.Any involvement by the White House counsel in the decision is unusual, particularly because it relates to the President's political opponents.Conway, however, defended Trump's interest in the politically charged case: "It's not unusual for a President to weigh in."Republicans want to know the circumstances surrounding the sale of a uranium mining company to Russia's Atomic Energy Agency, Rosatom, which was approved by the Obama administration in 2010.The deal had to be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a panel that is composed of representatives from several US government agencies, including the State Department, which at the time was led by Hillary Clinton.Conway went on to hit Clinton and the Democratic Party for helping fund a dossier of allegations about Trump and Russia, which she said was an improper attempt to use foreign intelligence to hit Trump."Now, we are faced with the possibility -- and it looks like the very real probability -- the DNC and the Clinton campaign paid a foreign agent for information to try to smear Donald Trump," Conway said.Conway slammed the Democrats for contributing funding to opposition research obtained from a foreign source, though the Trump campaign -- prior to Conway's involvement -- met with a Russian lawyer in an attempt to glean potentially damaging information on Clinton, according to Donald Trump Jr.'s own account.Likewise, CNN reported the head of a data analytics company linked to the Trump campaign contacted WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange about emails from Clinton's private server.Conway denied any firsthand knowledge of the effort."I only know what I read in the press on this, which is that he made that entreaty and Julian Assange says that he rejected it, never happened, and the Trump campaign has since spoken on this," Conway said.She went on to say the Trump campaign, which she helped lead through the end of the general election, "beat Hillary Clinton fairly and squarely.""I know nothing about that because I was the campaign manager, and I can't be bothered with any of that," Conway said of the Cambridge Analytica outreach to WikiLeaks."The campaign was not doing that."
White House reiterates Trump's claims that his sexual harassment accusers lied:::::Story highlights White House press secretary Sarah Sanders offered a very short answer Friday "We've been clear on that in the beginning, and the President's spoken on that," she said Washington (CNN) The White House stood by President Donald Trump's previous comments when asked Friday whether the more than a dozen women who have accused him of sexual assault were liars.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders offered a very short answer when asked if the White House thought the women were liars."We've been clear on that in the beginning, and the President's spoken on that," she said.The question came amid revelations in the media and entertainment industries and the realm of politics of stories of women coming forward to share encounters of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace.On the campaign trail, then-candidate Trump dismissed the accusations from the more than a dozen women.Read More
After long delay, State Department advances Russia sanctions:::::Story highlights The State Department had come under sharp criticism for missing the October 1 deadline Washington (CNN) The State Department, facing bipartisan scrutiny from Congress, issued long overdue guidance on which Russian individuals and entities will be subject to sanctions under recently passed legislation -- 25 days after it was due.The notice, required by the law, was due Oct. 1 and is meant to put potential stakeholders -- including US companies -- on alert in advance of the implementation in January.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sent the list to Congress Thursday, State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.The State Department had come under sharp criticism from lawmakers from both parties who questioned why the Trump administration had missed the deadline and whether the delay reflected reluctance from the White House to further sanction Moscow."Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has authorized the department to issue guidance to the public specifying the persons or entities that are part of or operating on behalf of the defense or intelligence sectors of the government of the Russian Federation," Nauert said."What that means is that Secretary Tillerson has signed off on this and it is now being held on Capitol Hill."Nauert said that the State Department was also reaching out to "key US industry stakeholders and our allies and partners" to explain the list.Read More
'We'll see!' How Trump answers tough questions:::::Washington (CNN) Just two weeks into Donald Trump's new presidency, he announced he was going to "look at" the unfounded claim that 3 million people voted illegally in the 2016 election.When pressed on it the next month, he said "we'll see," implying there could be even more illegal votes.Nine months later, we're still waiting for answers.And it hasn't been the only time.The President has been looking into everything from the North Korea crisis to peace in the Middle East, from health care specifics to immigration policy, from infrastructure plans to disaster relief in Puerto Rico.Trump has used this device on a position or action more than 100 times as President, according to a new CNN analysis of transcripts, speeches, tweets and statements compiled by Factba.se The answer is the same whether the subject is the fates of Cabinet officials, the future of trade pacts or pushes to pass major legislation -- he responds with a blanket, noncommittal "we'll see."Scroll down for the full list and see all the times Trump has said he's "looking into" something or that "we'll see."Obviously, Trump is not the first President to evade difficult topics.(All politicians do it.)But Trump has a unique way of dancing around taking clear positions and avoiding transparency.For example, Trump announced in April that he was "looking at" designs for the border wall with Mexico.But then he was "working it out" in June, "seriously looking" in July, "looking" in September and "looking" some more in October.It happens on major legislation, too."We're looking at that, and we're going to announce something very soon," Trump told The New York Times about a sweeping infrastructure plan -- back in April.No plan has been unveiled.Creating uncertainty and unpredictability has been a signature style of the Trump campaign and now the White House.Trump has remarked that he sees perceived unpredictability as an asset in negotiations.On some major issues, he's wiggled a kind of middle ground to avoid a final decision.Trump said "we'll see" about renegotiating the Paris climate agreement weeks after his decision to leave.He's said "we'll see" about the Iran nuclear deal after announcing his intent to decertify it.And on NAFTA, the fate of which still hangs in the balance, Trump has said "we'll see" what happens for several months.When Trump says he's "looking at" or "we'll see" about a government official, it's usually not a good sign.In April, he said "we'll see what happens" about former FBI Director Jim Comey, who was fired days later.In August, he said "we'll see what happens" with Steve Bannon, who was fired.In September, he was "looking into" Secretary Tom Price, who later resigned.But it hasn't been the end of the road for everyone.In July, he said he was "looking at" the fate of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and "we'll see" about Special Counsel Bob Mueller.Both are still in their jobs.Of course, this didn't start when Trump took the oath of office.Trump punted on everything from his relationship with Russia to gun violence during the campaign.And even before that, stretching back to when Trump was mulling a presidential run in 1999, the then-real estate mogul told NBC he was "looking at" a campaign for the White House "very seriously."The words come from a President who largely was not held accountable to shifting or ambiguous positions during the campaign.So will Trump change his ways any time soon?We'll see.Foreign policy National security Other Health care Economy Immigration Did we miss a Trumpian non-answer?Send a note to @ryanstruyk or @spetulla on Twitter.
This has been an incredibly confusing week in politics. That's good for Trump.:::::Washington (CNN) The news this week -- as is typical under President Donald Trump -- came fast and furious.It was also an extremely confusing week in politics.Here's a selection of major stories that have broken just since Monday: * Alexander Nix, the head of the data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, which Trump used during the 2016 election, reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in hopes of getting access to emails from Clinton's private server.What's less clear is whether Cambridge Analytica was on contract with the Trump campaign when Nix made the outreach or whether Nix knew definitively that WikiLeaks was getting the hacked emails from Russia.Investigations!Counter investigations!Dossiers!Assange!It's all too much for people who follow politics casually and are already running on Trump overload.(Hell, it's hard for me to follow it all -- and this is all I do every day.)Combine the complexity of these various stories with both parties' tendency to seize on whatever story reaffirms their broad worldview and insist that it is The Most Important Story Ever and your natural reaction is to simply tune out.To the average observer, it looks like Washington is doing what it always does: Investigate and feud.Who's right and who's wrong becomes secondary.The focus instead is on how messed up Washington -- and everyone in it -- is.That's a win for Trump and his allies as they seek to cast the ongoing special counsel investigation being led by Bob Mueller -- and the multiple congressional committee probes into Russia's attempted meddling in the 2016 election -- as just part of a Washington culture where someone is always investigating someone else -- usually with political gain as one of the main motives.Trump has been doing that on his own for months, regularly referring to the special counsel's investigation and other questions about Russian interference in the election as a partisan witch hunt."The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook," Trump tweeted last month ."What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?"The sheer number of developments over this past week -- and the complexity of each of the issues -- helps Trump drive this "what-about-ism" narrative.While all of these investigations and revelations aren't created equal -- the appointment of a special counsel is a far bigger deal than, say, a Republican-led congressional investigation into whether or not the FBI put a finger on the scale for Clinton in 2016 -- the complexity of the various allegations (and counter allegations) allow for a significant muddying of the waters.The muddier those waters get, the better for Trump.It seems hard to believe that the Mueller report will be filled with terrific news for the President and his administration.But, the more other investigations are happening right around that same time -- and the less people understand the specifics around these investigations -- the easier it is for the President's allies to paint Mueller's findings as a) partisan and b) just a small part of Washington's investigations culture.When you look down at the Washington swamp after this week, you'd be lucky to see your feet.Which means Trump is having a good week.Clarification: This story has been updated to more accurately characterize the Clinton emails Cambridge Analytica was seeking from Wikileaks.
Trump wants remaining State Dept. Clinton emails released:::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has made it clear to the State Department that he wants to accelerate the release of any remaining Hillary Clinton emails in its possession as soon as possible, according to three sources familiar with the President's thinking.This latest move for disclosure from the State Department comes at the same time the President called upon the Justice Department to lift a gag order on a key FBI informant in an investigation into Russian efforts to gain influence in the US uranium industry during the Obama administration.The sources described the President's interest in the release of the emails -- and the testimony of the FBI informant -- as rooted in a commitment to "transparency," with one source adding that "the law requires cooperation with Congress and the courts."After the initial publication of this story, one White House official confirmed the President expressed interest in the release of the Clinton emails, and later -- in a conversation with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- learned of the vast backlog of more than 13,000 outstanding FOIA cases.Those cases involve not just Clinton's emails but a multitude of topics -- some going back almost a decade.Trump then asked Tillerson to work to clear the backlog.In a memo to State Department employees, Tillerson said that the department will commit more resources and workforce to address the long queue of requests.Read More
Trump releases some, but not all, JFK records:::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Thursday agreed not to release the full tranche of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy , acquiescing to last-minute requests from national security agencies that some of those records remain secret.The US government released over 2,800 records Thursday night in an effort to comply with a 1992 law mandating the documents' release, but kept roughly 300 files classified out of concern for US national security, law enforcement and foreign relations.In a memo , Trump directed agencies that requested redactions to re-review their reasons for keeping the records secret within 180 days.Still, Trump's decision to keep some documents secret is likely to keep conspiracy theories alive, fueling those who have long questioned official conclusions about the assassination and argued that the government has helped cover up the truth.On Friday morning, Trump pledged the government would release more of the secret files, but did not commit to making them all public."JFK Files are being carefully released.In the end there will be great transparency.It is my hope to get just about everything to public!"Trump tweeted.JFK Files are being carefully released.In the end there will be great transparency.It is my hope to get just about everything to public!An initial review of some of the previously classified documents shed some light on the circumstances surrounding the Kennedy assassination.One document revealed that the CIA intercepted a call Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald made to a KGB officer at the Russian Embassy in Mexico less than two months before killing Kennedy and that CIA agents speculated that he might be a KGB agent.Oswald spoke to an "identified KGB officer," Russian Consul Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov "in broken Russian."The report says "It is not usual for a KGB agent on a sensitive mission to have such overt contact with a Soviet Embassy," but adds "such contact in official installations may be caused by the agent's own carelessness."The files also revealed new information about threats the FBI received against Oswald after he was arrested.Hoover said on November 24, 1963, he "received a call in our Dallas office from a man talking in a calm voice and saying he was a member of a committee organized to kill Oswald," information the FBI shared with the Dallas chief of police."He again assured us adequate protection would be given.However, this was not done," Hoover said.Oswald's killer Jack Ruby has maintained that he acted alone and it was not clear if Ruby had made the threat to the FBI's Dallas office.What will remain secret?Trump teased the release of the documents twice in the last week, but did not make clear whether he planned to allow the full release, though he noted in a Saturday tweet that he would allow the release of documents "subject to the release of further information."The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow.So interesting!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2017 In his letter, he says more information should eventually be released."The American public expects and deserves its government to produce as much access as possible to the John F. Kennedy assassination records," he wrote."I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted" on the records, the memo said."At the same time, executive departments and agencies have proposed to me that certain information should continue to be redacted because of national security, law enforcement, and foreign affairs concerns.I have no choice -- today -- but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our nation's security."Trump is permitted to block the release of certain documents if he finds "an identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement or conduct of foreign relations" and if "the identifiable harm is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure," according to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.The deadline comes 25 years after the enactment of that law, which mandated the release of all government documents related to the Kennedy assassination in an attempt to quell conspiracy theories that have long swirled around the assassination.But as deadline day came on Thursday, US intelligence and law enforcement agencies continued to make last-minute requests, resulting in a "messy" process in the final hours of the deadline, a senior US official told CNN.The White House did not receive all of the requests until mid-day Thursday.That left Trump's aides scrambling to funnel all of the information to the President, who had only a few hours to decide how to proceed.Administration officials said the sensitive information that will remain redacted for now relates to "intelligence, law enforcement and other details."That includes the identity of individuals involved in the investigation into the assassination, their roles as informants to law enforcement and information about foreign partner organizations that were involved in the investigation, a senior administration official said."The President heard those justifications from the agencies that requested the continuing postponement and he acknowledged that information ... requires protection," the official said.Agencies requesting continued redaction of certain documents will need to submit a report to the US Archivist by March 26, 2018, explaining why those documents meet that standard, the White House said.Documents determined to not meet those standards will need to be released by April 26, 2018.By setting a new deadline in 180 days, Trump's team is hoping to enforce greater accountability from the agencies to get them more thorough accounting for their reasoning on keeping some of the records redacted.What are historians looking for Historians who have closely studied the Kennedy assassination have said they do not expect the documents to reveal any bombshells or to contradict the conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald was solely responsible for killing Kennedy.Still, the files will give Americans a fuller picture of how the 35th US president was killed and the ensuing investigation into his assassination."There's going to be no smoking gun in there," Gerald Posner, the author of "Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK," told CNN's Michael Smerconish on Saturday."Anybody who thinks this is going to turn the case on its head and suddenly show that there were three or four shooters at Dealey Plaza -- it's not the case.""Oswald did it alone," Posner continued."But what the files are doing and why they're important to come out is they fill in the history of the case and show us how the FBI and CIA repeatedly hid the evidence."The CIA and FBI documents could also shed new light on Oswald's mysterious trip to Mexico City weeks before the assassination.The files could also reveal new details about US involvement in attempts to assassinate Cuban President Fidel Castro, notably the CIA's alleged ties to the mob as part of that effort.Trump has been encouraged allow the full release of the files by several Republican figures in the lead-up to the document dump deadline.25 yrs ago Cong said all gov records abt JFK assassination shld b released this month unless Pres blocks No reason 2 keep hidden anymore 1/3 ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) October 4, 2017 "No reason 2 keep hidden anymore," Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, tweeted earlier this month."Time 2 let American ppl + historians draw own conclusions."The President's longtime political adviser Roger Stone, an avid JFK assassination conspiracy theorist, also privately urged Trump to allow the full release of the documents.Stone Thursday night said Trump's decision "has the inadvertent effect of fueling suspicion and skepticism.""If the documents aren't embarrassing, then why withhold them?"Stone told CNN."The issue is it shows the treachery of the Central Intelligence Agency who recruited (Lee Harvey Oswald), who trained him and who placed him."

National Park Service Denies Permit for Huge Naked Woman Statue on National Mall:::::A permit to bring a 45-foot statue of a naked woman to Washington, D.C. was denied by the National Park Service.(Published Friday, Oct. 27, 2017) A group that wanted to bring a 45-foot statue of a naked woman to the National Mall was denied a permit because it would detract from historic monuments and could damage the turf, National Park Service (NPS) officials said."The proposed nearly 48-foot height of the statue introduces a visual element that would diminish the propertys significant historic features by altering the setting and historic character of the National Mall landscape," NPS spokesman Mike Litterst said in an email.Organizers of Catharsis on the Mall wanted the R-Evolution statue to stand near the Washington Monument, facing the White House, for 91 days between November and March.The permit was denied Wednesday, Litterst said.Catharsis organizers claimed in a statement that NPS issued them a permit and then revoked it.NPS did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether that claim was accurate.Catharsis spokeswoman Natalie White accused NPS of denying the permit to silence women."They don't want us to take action, they don't want us to say enough is enough, they don't want this symbol to remind women to stand up to the injustice this administration has forced upon them," she said in a statement.The park service also denied a permit for a memorial temple to stand on the National Mall for 119 days, Litterst said.The statue and temple "would likely cause significant damage to and require replacement of the underlying turf and soil," Litterst said.Rose McGowan Makes First Appearance Since Weinstein Claim Actor and director Rose McGowan made her first appearance in public since she accused film producer Harvey Weinstein of rape, giving a rousing speech against sexual harassers at the Women's Convention in Detroit.(Published Friday, Oct. 27, 2017) Catharsis on the Mall was granted a permit for an event Nov. 10-12 and will be allowed to assemble 30 other temporary structures, Litterst said.The arts festival was granted permission to light a fire on the Mall, Litterst said.This year will be the third year Catharsis on the Mall holds the ceremonial burning, Litterst said.A crowdfunding campaign was launched in October to bring the statue, and reached 73 percent of its $90,000 goal before NPS announced the permit was denied.The R-Evolution statute is intended to represent women free from domestic violence, artist and creator Marco Cochrane said.

Opinion Shifting Toward Athletes' Anthem Protests: Poll:::::AP reporters counted more than 200 NFL players who did not stand during the national anthem before their games on Sunday.(Published Monday, Sept. 25, 2017) Americans are split in a new poll on rules that would require professional athletes to kneel for the national anthem, a real shift in favor of their right to protest, NBC News reported.Fifty-one percent of respondents to an HBO Real Sports/Marist poll said they opposed leagues requiring that players stand, while 47 percent supported such rules.The four-point difference is within the Oct. 15-17 poll's margin of error, which makes it a statistical tie.But when the poll was conducted a year ago, a clear majority supported rules requiring players to stand, by a mark of 52 to 43.Since then, President Donald Trump threw a spotlight on the athletes following the example of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who began kneeling for the anthem in August 2016.
US Now Moving Toward Armed Drones, Lethal Force in Niger: Officials:::::In Washington, there is a search for answers about the ambush in Niger that killed four U.S. Service members.(Published Saturday, Oct. 21, 2017) The Trump administration is paving the way for lethal strikes against terrorists in Niger as the U.S. military pushes forward with a plan to arm the Reaper drones that fly over that country, multiple U.S. officials told NBC News.France has already decided to arm its drones in the region, U.S. documents show, and the move to arm U.S. Reapers has been under consideration for some time long before this month's ambush of a Green Beret unit that resulted in the deaths of four American soldiers.But that incident, details of which are still coming to light, is fueling an urgency within the Trump administration to take more aggressive steps against the terrorist groups that are operating in North and West Africa, according to intelligence and military officials.In the wake of the attack, the U.S. has been pressing the government of Niger to allow armed drones at the U.S. bases in that country, three U.S. officials said.Beset by poverty, weak governance and insurgent movements, the African region that includes Niger and neighboring Mali is considered by U.S. officials to be a fertile recruiting ground for Al Qaeda and ISIS.U.S. officials believe the militants who ambushed the Green Berets belong to a group that has pledged allegiance to ISIS.President Obama declined to allow armed drones to fly over the region, but the military has been pressing for some time to reverse that decision, officials said.Kelly 'Stunned' by Rep.'s Criticism of Trump's Call to Widow

Frederica Wilson and the agency was talking with Des Plaines police."We are aware of a social media posting generated in Des Plaines, IL and are in contact with local authorities, Croon said in an email.Screenshots of the Facebook post which appears to have been deleted along with the users account are being shared on social media, and some have claimed its creator is a former police officer.Croon said he did not know if the alleged author was a police officer.Des Plaines police did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls requesting comment.Chicago police referred questions to Capitol Police, citing a department policy to not comment on threats or security measures for public officials.Capitol Police said they do not comment on "ongoing investigations."The alleged post, which NBC 5 has not verified the authenticity of, contains an image of a glum-looking Wilson in one of her flamboyant signature cowboy hats.Need ten good men to help carry out a lynching, it reads.Must have own horse and saddle.Rope will be provided.The Chicago Tribune reports that 54-year-old Des Plaines resident Tom Keevers says he is receiving death threats after an "anonymous 'meme-maker'" twisted his words in a Facebook post.Calls to a phone number listed under Keevers' name were not immediately returned.The paper reports Keevers floundered through an interview in which he says he didnt write the post, could not remember threatening to lynch the congresswoman and that it was possible someone used his words to make a meme."Dont people get in arguments on Facebook all the time?"the Tribune reports Keevers as saying, before he doubled down on his initial defense: "I did not use those words."The post comes after a public tumult between Wilson and Trump surrounding the congresswomans claim the president botched a condolence call to the pregnant widow of a Green Beret killed in Niger earlier this month along with three of his comrades.Wilson said Trump told the slain soldier's widow her husband knew what he signed up for."Wilson accused Trump of being insensitive.The pregnant widow of Sgt.La David Johnson, Myeshia Johnson, said Monday the phone call she received from Trump before meeting her husbands body at Dover Air Force Base made her more upset as the president struggled to remember her spouses name, NBC News reported.She said thats when Trump told her that her husband "knew what he signed up for but it hurts anyways," "I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt.La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!"Trump tweeted in response.Calls and emails to Wilsons office were not responded to but a statement on her website stands by her assertion that Trump fumbled the phone call."Despite President Trump's suggestion that I have recanted my statement or misstated what he said, I stand firmly by my original account of his conversation with Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt.La David Johnson," the statement reads in part."Moreover, this account has been confirmed by family members who also witnessed Mr. Trump's incredible lack of compassion and sensitivity."Meanwhile, in Des Plaines, authorities continue to investigate the alleged Facebook threat."People threaten Donald Trump all the time and nothing happens," Keevers told the Tribune."I dont think a lot about what I write on Facebook."Threatening a member of Congress, which is a federal crime, can carry a prison sentence of up to five years.Keevers was honored by the FBI in 2003 for helping apprehend a bank-robbery suspect, the Tribune reported at the time.
Nurx, the 'Uber of Birth Control,' Aims to Help Women in the Nation's Contraceptive Deserts:::::Students at the University of California, Davis, can now purchase $30 Plan B emergency contraceptives, pregnancy tests, condoms and other personal care products from a vending machine.The idea came from UC Davis senior Parteek Singh, after a friend was unable to buy emergency contraceptives in time.(Published Friday, April 28, 2017) Often referred to as the "Uber of birth control," Nurx ships birth control directly to a woman's doorstep, bypassing the traditional visit to a clinic or physician typically necessary for getting or renewing a prescription.Available in 15 states plus Washington D.C., the app may simply be an extra modern-day convenience for some women, NBC News reported.But for others, it's the difference between having access to birth control and not.According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, nearly 20 million women in America live in so-called "contraceptive deserts": counties where the number of public clinics is not enough to meet the needs of the county's population.The group estimates that more than 19.7 million females ages 13 to 44 lack reasonable access to public clinics that provide birth control, defined as at least one clinic or provider for every 1,000 women.Trump Cannot Believe the Media Produced Such Beautiful Children

Russia investigation seeks first charges, indictment announcement may come as soon as Monday, sources say:::::The special counsel team investigating Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election and possible links to the campaign of President Donald Trump has sought charges against at least one unidentified target, ABC News has learned.Interested in Russia?Add Russia as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Sources tell ABC News an indictment announcement and arrest could possibly come as early as Monday.A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment.CNN first reported a federal grand jury approved charges brought by Special Counsel Robert Muellers team.Attorneys from Mueller's office were at the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., on Friday, including one of his senior prosecutors who specializes in fraud cases.ABC News confirmed a filing was made at the court Friday.It's unclear at this point how significant this potential action might be.Mueller is investigating whether there was any collusion between members of the Trump presidential campaign and Russia in connection with the 2016 election.The special counsel has also been probing the financial dealings of some key Trump associates.Sources close to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort told ABC News that they have no indication that any charges against him may be imminent.ABC News also reached out to people associated with former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and have so far not received a comment in response.
Former Acting US Attorney General Dana Boente resigns:::::Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who temporarily took over as acting U.S. attorney general, has stepped down.Interested in Trump Administration?Add Trump Administration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Trump Administration news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Earlier this year, Boente briefly replaced Sally Yates as acting attorney general after President Donald Trump fired Yates for refusing to defend his first executive order restricting entry into the U.S. of people from seven Muslim-majority countries.When Yates was removed on January 30, Boente stepped in to direct Justice Department staff "to do our sworn duty and to defend the lawful orders of our president."Boente's tenure as acting attorney general ended when the Senate confirmed Jeff Sessions to be the next attorney general on Feb. 8.Boente, 63, began his career at the Department of Justice in 1984 as a part of the tax division, and went on to serve as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana in 2012, and for the Eastern District of Virginia in 2015.Between those positions, as the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia from 2013 to 2015, Boente supervised the prosecution of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell for public corruption.In a press conference after the governor was sentenced to prison in 2015, Boente told reporters that holding the powerful to account is necessary to maintain the people's trust in public institutions."No one is above the law," he said."Not a high public official; not even the highest public official in the state."The U.S. Supreme Court later vacated McDonnell's conviction, however, and the Department of Justice moved to dismiss the charges against him.
Conservative site with GOP ties funded Trump research:::::A conservative website with strong ties to the Republican establishment triggered the investigation into Donald Trump's past that ultimately produced the dossier that alleged a compromised relationship between the president and the Kremlin.The Washington Free Beacon on Friday confirmed it originally retained the political research firm Fusion GPS to scour then-candidate Trump's background for negative information, a common practice known as "opposition research" in politics.Leaders from the Free Beacon, which is funded largely by Republican billionaire Paul Singer, insisted none of the early material it collected appeared in the dossier released later in the year detailing explosive allegations, many uncorroborated, about Trump compiled by a former British spy."During the 2016 election cycle we retained Fusion GPS to provide research on multiple candidates in the Republican presidential primary, just as we retained other firms to assist in our research into Hillary Clinton," wrote the site's editor-in-chief, Matthew Continetti, and chairman Michael Goldfarb.They continued: "The Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele."Earlier in the week, reports revealed that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee continued funding Fusion's work after the original GOP source lost interest.Trump this week called it a "disgrace" that Democrats had helped pay for research that produced the document.But the original source of the research remained a secret.The president himself hinted that he knew the Republican source earlier in the week, but he refused to share it.The White House had no immediate comment Friday night about the Free Beacon's involvement.The Washington Free Beacon was initially founded as a project of the conservative nonprofit group Center for American Freedom, as an alternative to liberal news sites run by progressive nonprofits.The Center for American Freedom was organized as a 501(c)4 and did not reveal its donors, but Singer was the sole funder of the site as recently as 2014, according to a Republican political veteran familiar with the site.The veteran spoke on condition of anonymity to detail the newspaper's financial background.The Free Beacon first retained Fusion to investigate Trump in the fall of 2015 and ended its relationship after Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in late spring of 2016, according to a person close to Goldfarb, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private discussions.The website and its leaders have strong ties throughout the Republican establishment.Goldfarb was deputy communications director on John McCain's presidential campaign.Singer was backing Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's presidential bid at the time of the Free Beacon's involvement.And one of Singer's closest associates, Republican operative Dan Senor, served as Speaker Ryan's chief adviser during the 2012 president campaign.A representative to Singer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Rubio denied any knowledge of the Fusion research or the dossier this week."As far as whether it was my campaign, it wasn't and I'll tell you why," he told CNN."I was running for president.I was trying to win.If I had anything against Donald Trump that was relevant and credible and politically damaging, I would've used it.I didn't have it."The document, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, emerged this year as a political flashpoint in the broader debate over Trump's ties to Russia.A person close to Singer said the billionaire was not aware of Steele's involvement or the dossier until earlier this year when it was published.The person was not authorized to share internal discussions.Law enforcement officials have worked to corroborate the dossier's claims.James Comey, FBI director at the time, advised Trump about the existence of the allegations, and Steele has been questioned as part of an ongoing probe into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump camp.The U.S. intelligence community has determined that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election.Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the Russian interference and whether it was tied to Trump's campaign.The House Intelligence Committee will help verify whether the Free Beacon had any involvement with Steele or his dossier, according to Jack Langer, a spokesman for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes."The Beacon has agreed to cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee to help the Committee verify this assertion," Langer said.Miller reported from Washington.Associated Press writers Chad Day, Mary Clare Jalonick, Stephen Braun and Tom LoBianco in Washington contributed to this report.
Corker: Possible 2020 run against Trump not ruled out:::::Interested in Republican Party?Add Republican Party as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Republican Party news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee did not rule out a run in 2020 against President Donald Trump when asked about it by reporters Friday, saying he's focused on the next 14 months of his term and isn't thinking that far ahead.The noncommittal response came as Corker doubled down this week on criticism of Trump, calling him "utterly untruthful" and responsible for "the debasement of our nation.""You know, I don't know what I'm doing next Sunday," the senator responded when reporters asked about a potential presidential bid.Corker said it was far too soon to say if he would want a strong Republican primary challenge of Trump, whether by him or someone else."I think that if you even begin thinking those things, everything you do becomes viewed through a different lens," Corker said generally about presidential ambitions.And any impeachment of Trump isn't realistic today and is not going to happen, Corked added.At a Tennessee economic development conference Friday, attendees applauded Corker and laughed when Sen. Lamar Alexander and state economic development chief Bob Rolfe joked about Corker's recent fame.It marked his first public appearance in Tennessee since his latest round of feuding with Trump, which garnered national attention.Corker, a businessman who isn't seeking re-election in 2018, said he has been received similarly well elsewhere of late.The Chattanooga Republican said he wasn't surprised, though, to see his polling numbers worsen in a recent survey conducted Oct. 16-23, just before this week's latest round of back-and-forth jabs with Trump.Corker's disapproval rating increased to 41 percent, a 14-point increase compared with last spring in the Middle Tennessee State University poll.His approval dropped 8 points to 45 percent, though he deemed his approval still pretty high for an incumbent.Trump's approval remained steady at about 50 percent in Tennessee, with a slight uptick in his disapproval rating to 40 percent.The poll of 600 registered Tennessee voters reached via randomly selected cell and landline phones had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points."We were surprised that it hadn't dropped further than it did," Corker said.Early this month, Corker charged that Trump had turned the White House into an "adult day care center" and was setting the U.S. "on the path to World War III."Trump hit back at Corker, tweeting that he was a "lightweight" and charging that the lawmaker "couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee."Trump insultingly dubbed him "Liddle Bob Corker."
23 dead, more than 30 wounded in Mogadishu hotel attack:::::A suicide truck bomb exploded outside a popular hotel in Somalia's capital on Saturday, killing at least 23 people and wounding more than 30, and gunfire continued as security forces pursued other attackers inside the building, police said.Two more blasts were heard, one when an attacker detonated a suicide vest.Speaking to The Associated Press by telephone from the scene, Capt.Mohamed Hussein said 30 people, including a government minister, were rescued from the Nasa-Hablod hotel as heavy gunfire continued in the standoff between extremists and security forces.Three of the five attackers were killed, Hussein said.The others hurled grenades and cut off the building's electricity as night fell.Saturday's blasts came two weeks after more than 350 people were killed in a massive truck bombing on a busy Mogadishu street in the country's worst-ever attack.Al-Shabab, Africa's deadliest Islamic extremist group, quickly claimed responsibility for Saturday's attack and said its fighters were inside the hotel.Among the dead were a mother and three children, including a baby, all shot in the head, Hussein said.Other victims included a senior Somali police colonel, a former lawmaker and a former government minister.Footage from the scene showed twisted vehicles and nearby buildings with only walls left standing.Mohamed Dek Haji said he survived the bombing as he walked beside a parked car that was largely destroyed by the explosion.He said he saw at least three armed men in military uniforms running toward the hotel after the bombing at its gate."I think they were al-Shabab fighters who were trying to storm the hotel," he said, lying on a hospital bed.He suffered small injuries on his shoulder and skull from flying glass.Witnesses in some previous attacks have said al-Shabab fighters disguised themselves by wearing military uniforms.Security officials say Saturday's bomber had pretended his truck had broken down outside the gate.Police Col. Mohamed Abdullahi says the bomber stopped outside the heavily fortified hotel and pretended to repair the truck before finally turning it around and detonating.Al-Shabab often targets high-profile areas of Mogadishu.It has not commented on the massive attack two weeks ago; experts have said the death toll was so high that the group hesitated to further anger Somali citizens as its pursues its insurgency.Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed said the new attack was meant to instill fear in Somalis who united after the Oct. 14 attack, marching in the thousands through Mogadishu in defiance of al-Shabab.Since the blast two weeks ago, the president has visited regional countries to seek more support for the fight against the extremist group, vowing a "state of war."He also faces the challenge of pulling together regional powers inside his long-fractured country, where the federal government is only now trying to assert itself beyond Mogadishu and other major cities.A 22,000-strong multinational African Union force in Somalia is expected to withdraw its forces and hand over the country's security to the Somali military by the end of 2020.U.S. military officials and others in recent months have expressed concern that Somali forces are not yet ready.The U.S. military also has stepped up military efforts against al-Shabab this year in Somalia, carrying out nearly 20 drone strikes, as the global war on extremism moves deeper into the African continent.
JFK files release is Trump's latest clash with spy agencies:::::It was a showdown 25 years in the making: With the world itching to finally get a look at classified Kennedy assassination files, and the deadline for their release just hours away, intelligence officials were still angling for a way to keep their secrets.President Donald Trump, the one man able to block the release, did not appreciate their persistence.He did not intend to make this easy.Like much else surrounding investigations of the 1963 killing of President John F. Kennedy, this week's release of 2,800 records from the JFK files was anything but smooth.It came together only at the last minute, with White House lawyers still fielding late-arriving requests for additional redactions in the morning and an irritated Trump continuing to resist signing off on the request, according to an account by two White House officials.They spoke only on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.The tale of the final hours before the congressionally mandated 25-year release deadline on Thursday adds a new chapter to the story of Trump's troubled relationship with his spy agencies.He again flashed his skepticism and unpredictability in dealing with agencies long accustomed to a level of deference.Intelligence officials, meanwhile, were again left scratching their heads about a president whose impulses they cannot predict.And those officials had their own story tell, some rejecting the notion they were slow to act on Trump's expectations for the documents.The CIA began work months ago to get its remaining assassination-related documents ready for release on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the process.The person, who was not authorized to publicly to discuss the process and spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the goal was to have all the agency's documents ready to be released in full or with national security redactions before the deadline.Since taking office, Trump has challenged the integrity of intelligence leaders, moved to exert more control over U.S. spying agencies and accused his predecessor of using government spycraft to monitor his campaign.In the JFK files matter, one White House official said, Trump wanted to make clear he wouldn't be bullied by the agencies.Whatever occurred in the lead-up to deadline day, Trump was irritated Thursday that agencies still were arguing for more redactions.The president earlier in the week had tweeted to tease the release of the documents, heightening the sense of drama on a subject that has sparked the imaginations of conspiracy theorists for decades.Under a 1992 law, all of the records related to the assassination were to be made public unless explicitly withheld by the president.Just before the release Thursday, Trump wrote in a memorandum that he had "no choice" but to agree to requests from the CIA and FBI to keep thousands of documents secret because of the possibility that releasing the information could still harm national security.Two aides said Trump was upset by what he perceived to be overly broad secrecy requests, adding that the agencies had been explicitly warned about his expectation that redactions be kept to a minimum."The president and White House have been very clear with all agencies for weeks: They must be transparent and disclose all information possible," White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said Friday.Late last week, Trump received his first official briefing on the release in an Oval Office meeting that included Chief of Staff John Kelly, White House Counsel Don McGahn and National Security Council legal adviser John Eisenberg.Trump made it clear he was unsatisfied with the pace of declassification.Trump's tweets, an official said, were meant as a signal to the intelligence community to take seriously his threats to release the documents in their entirety.According to White House officials, Trump accepted that some of the records contained references to sensitive sources and methods used by the intelligence community and law enforcement and that declassification could harm American foreign policy interests.But after having the scope of the redactions presented to him, Trump told aides he did not believe them to be in the spirit of the law.On Thursday, Trump's top aides presented him with an alternative to simply acquiescing to the agency requests: He could temporarily allow the redactions while ordering the agencies to launch a new comprehensive examination of the records still withheld or redacted in part.Trump accepted the suggestion, ordering that agencies be "extremely circumspect" about keeping the remaining documents secret at the end of the 180-day assessment."After strict consultation with General Kelly, the CIA and other agencies, I will be releasing ALL JFK files other than the names and addresses of any mentioned person who is still living," Trump wrote in a Friday tweet."I am doing this for reasons of full disclosure, transparency and in order to put any and all conspiracy theories to rest."Trump returned to the topic in a Saturday night tweet: "JFK Files are released, long ahead of schedule!"The deadline set by law came Thursday, the day the documents were released.Associated Press writer Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.
Icelanders go to the polls for 3rd time in 4 years:::::Icelanders voted for the third time in four years Saturday as the nation tried to shake off the latest political crisis on an island roiled by divisions since its economy was ravaged by the global financial crisis.Voters weary of political and economic chaos weren't expected to produce an outright winner.Polls suggest the election will only lead to complex negotiations over building a coalition government.A record eight parties could cross the 5-percent threshold needed to qualify for seats in the Icelandic parliament, the Althingi.Upstart parties are benefiting from a series of scandals affecting the ruling Independence Party.Political analysts say the most likely outcome eventually is a coalition government led by Katrin Jakobsdottir of the Left Green Movement.The 41-year-old Jakobsdottir holds a graduate degree in Icelandic literature and would be among the world's youngest leaders.The election whose themes have centered on stability and trust was called in September amid allegations that the prime minister's father backed an effort to aid the job prospects of a convicted pedophile.Bjarni Benediktsson's government had come to power only last year after leaked documents linked his predecessor to bank accounts in offshore tax havens.Economic upheaval has dogged this Nordic island nation of 330,000 after its debt-swollen banks collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis.It is now is experiencing a surge in tourism by those eager to see its pristine glaciers, fjords and waterfalls and the Northern Lights.But Icelanders are worried that the worst is not yet over.On social media, voters expressed deja vu, complaining of a revolving door of political leaders and few new ideas.Debate has centered on those still left behind despite the robust economy.A surplus of government revenues gained from an economy growing at a whopping 7 percent last year has spurred questions on lowering public debt, still high since the crash, versus increased government spending."Despite the economic boom, care for societies' basic infrastructure has been left behind," Jakobsdottir said, promising to increase taxes on the financial sector to fund new social policies.Offering the counter view is the unorthodox Center Party, which promises to windfall "every Icelander" with government-owned bank stocks.Iceland, which was declared a sovereign state under the Danish crown in 1918, will celebrate a century of self-rule next year.At the same time, it will also mark 10 years since the International Monetary Fund rescued the country's finances.
Trump responds to Calif. billionaire urging impeachment:::::President Donald Trump is responding to a California billionaire who has vowed to spend at least $10 million in advertising calling for the president's impeachment.Trump is using Twitter to call Tom Steyer "wacky & totally unhinged."He says Steyer "has been fighting me and my Make America Great Again agenda from the beginning," adding the billionaire environmentalist "never wins elections!"Steyer recently launched the advertising, which has been running on Fox News and other national outlets, arguing that Trump should be ousted from office.Steyer contends Trump is pushing the U.S. toward a nuclear war, is obstructing justice at the FBI and threatening to shut down news organizations he doesn't like.Steyer wants viewers to call their members of Congress and tell them to bring articles of impeachment.
Trump administration disavows Puerto Rico power contract:::::The Trump administration scrambled Friday to distance itself from the decision to award a $300 million contract to help restore Puerto Rico's power grid to a tiny Montana company from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's hometown.Interested in Hurricanes?Add Hurricanes as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricanes news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The White House said federal officials played no role in the selection of Whitefish Energy Holdings by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.The administration disavowed the contract amid a growing number of investigations and a bipartisan chorus of criticism from Capitol Hill.Alvin Baez/Reuters Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Zinke had given the president his personal assurance that he had nothing to do with what she described as "a state and local decision made by the Puerto Rican authorities and not the federal government."The interior secretary also issued a fiery denial on Twitter, saying "Only in elitist Washington, D.C., would being from a small town be considered a crime."Whitefish Energy Holdings is headquartered in Whitefish, Montana, which has a population of about 7,200.Zinke, a former Montana congressman, knows Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski.Zinke's son also had a summer job at a Whitefish construction site."I had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish Energy receiving a contract in Puerto Rico," said Zinke in a statement linked to a tweet."Any attempts by the dishonest media or political operatives to tie me to awarding or influencing any contract involving Whitefish are completely baseless."Ricardo Arduengo/AFP/Getty Images Zinke acknowledged that after the company's initial contract was awarded, he was contacted by the company, though he did not give the name of the individual who reached out to him.Zinke said he took no action and that all relevant documents would be disclosed to "appropriate officials.""I welcome any and all investigations into these allegations," Zinke said.The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general, an agency watchdog, confirmed Friday that federal auditors will review the Whitefish contract."As part of their standard procedure, they will conduct vetting to look for the presence of any inappropriate relationships," said Arlen Morales, a spokeswoman for the inspector general's office.Alvin Baez/Reuters The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is part of Homeland Security, said it has not approved any reimbursement requests from the utility for money to cover ongoing repairs to the island's power grid following Hurricane Maria.FEMA said in a statement that any language in the controversial contract saying the agency approved of the deal with Whitefish is inaccurate.The contract said the utility would not pay costs unallowable under FEMA grants, but it also said, "The federal government is not a party to this contract."The agency said its initial review raised significant concerns about how Whitefish got the deal and whether the contracted prices were reasonable.The 2-year-old company had just two full-time employees when the storm hit Sept. 20.It has since hired more than 300 workers.A price list attached to the Whitefish contract reviewed by The Associated Press sets rates for both workers and equipment to be paid by the utility: $20,277 an hour for a heavy lift Chinook helicopter, $650 an hour for a large crane truck, $322 an hour for a foreman of a power line crew, $319 an hour for a journeyman lineman and $286 an hour for a mechanic.Each worker also gets a daily allowance of $80 for food, $332 for a hotel room and $1,000 for each flight to or from the mainland.Multiple congressional committees have opened investigations into the deal, the terms of which have triggered questions from both Republicans and Democrats.Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, senior Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the Whitefish contract "raises every red flag in the book."Democrats also raised questions about the role of HBC Investments, a key financial backer of Whitefish Energy.The Dallas-based company's founder and general partner, Joe Colonnetta, has contributed thousands of dollars to Trump and other Republicans, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry, a former Texas governor, and Texas Sens.John Cornyn and Ted Cruz.Colonnetta also gave to Trump's inauguration.Whitefish spokesman Chris Chiames called Colonnetta's political donations "irrelevant."The company said it would cooperate with any information requests from federal authorities."We are very proud of the work we are doing to restore power to the people of Puerto Rico under very difficult circumstances, and we respectfully ask that others await the facts before jumping to misinformed conclusions," the company said in a statement issued Friday."We have one simple goal to restore power to Puerto Rico as quickly and efficiently as possible."Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority director Ricardo Ramos has praised the work performed so far, saying the company's was the only offer the utility received that did not require a down payment.The power company is $9 billion in debt and was already struggling to provide service amid ongoing power outages before hurricanes Irma and Maria hit last month."There is nothing illegal going on here," Ramos said Thursday.A federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico's finances said this week it had appointed a former military officer to oversee the work.Retired Air Force Col. Noel Zamot will be responsible for speeding up reconstruction efforts and overseeing coordination with the board, Puerto Rico's government and the federal government.It was not immediately clear whether Zamot would have the authority to void Whitefish's contract, although under the contract the utility can suspend or terminate the contract "for any or no reason" after providing written notice to Whitefish and compensating the company for actual expenses.About 75 percent of the U.S. territory remains without power more than a month after the Category 4 storm made landfall.Puerto Rico Public Affairs Secretary Ramon Rosario told reporters on Friday he wasn't familiar with the contract's details when asked why it includes a clause that prohibits an audit or review of "the cost and profit elements of the labor rates."Rosario said only that Puerto Rico's governor already has requested an audit and that the government will turn over all pertinent documents."There obviously needs to be transparency," Rosario said."If anyone did anything illegal, let them fry in jail."Associated Press writers Danica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Ben Fox in Miami and Ken Thomas in Washington contributed to this report.Follow AP environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck
Trump dossier research triggered by website with GOP ties:::::A conservative website with strong ties to the Republican establishment triggered the investigation into Donald Trump's past that ultimately produced the dossier that alleged a compromised relationship between the president and the Kremlin.The Washington Free Beacon on Friday confirmed it originally retained the political research firm Fusion GPS to scour then-candidate Trump's background for negative information, a common practice known as "opposition research" in politics.Leaders from the Free Beacon, which is funded largely by Republican billionaire Paul Singer, insisted none of the early material it collected appeared in the dossier released later in the year detailing explosive allegations, many uncorroborated, about Trump compiled by a former British spy."During the 2016 election cycle we retained Fusion GPS to provide research on multiple candidates in the Republican presidential primary, just as we retained other firms to assist in our research into Hillary Clinton," wrote the site's editor-in-chief, Matthew Continetti, and chairman Michael Goldfarb.They continued: "The Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele."Earlier in the week, reports revealed that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee continued funding Fusion's work after the original GOP source lost interest.Trump this week called it a "disgrace" that Democrats had helped pay for research that produced the document.But the original source of the research remained a secret.The president himself hinted that he knew the Republican source earlier in the week, but he refused to share it.The White House had no immediate comment Friday night about the Free Beacon's involvement.The Washington Free Beacon was initially founded as a project of the conservative nonprofit group Center for American Freedom, as an alternative to liberal news sites run by progressive nonprofits.The Center for American Freedom was organized as a 501(c)4 and did not reveal its donors, but Singer was the sole funder of the site as recently as 2014, according to a Republican political veteran familiar with the site.The veteran spoke on condition of anonymity to detail the newspaper's financial background.The Free Beacon first retained Fusion to investigate Trump in the fall of 2015 and ended its relationship after Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in late spring of 2016, according to a person close to Goldfarb, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private discussions.The website and its leaders have strong ties throughout the Republican establishment.Goldfarb was deputy communications director on John McCain's presidential campaign.Singer was backing Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's presidential bid at the time of the Free Beacon's involvement.And one of Singer's closest associates, Republican operative Dan Senor, served as Speaker Ryan's chief adviser during the 2012 president campaign.A representative to Singer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Rubio denied any knowledge of the Fusion research or the dossier this week."As far as whether it was my campaign, it wasn't and I'll tell you why," he told CNN."I was running for president.I was trying to win.If I had anything against Donald Trump that was relevant and credible and politically damaging, I would've used it.I didn't have it."The document, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, emerged this year as a political flashpoint in the broader debate over Trump's ties to Russia.A person close to Singer said the billionaire was not aware of Steele's involvement or the dossier until earlier this year when it was published.The person was not authorized to share internal discussions.Law enforcement officials have worked to corroborate the dossier's claims.James Comey, FBI director at the time, advised Trump about the existence of the allegations, and Steele has been questioned as part of an ongoing probe into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump camp.The U.S. intelligence community has determined that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election.Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the Russian interference and whether it was tied to Trump's campaign.The House Intelligence Committee will help verify whether the Free Beacon had any involvement with Steele or his dossier, according to Jack Langer, a spokesman for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes."The Beacon has agreed to cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee to help the Committee verify this assertion," Langer said.In a statement Saturday, Langer said an agreement had been reached that will secure the committee's access to Fusion GPS bank records necessary for its investigation.The committee had sought the records through a subpoena.Miller reported from Washington.Associated Press writers Chad Day, Mary Clare Jalonick, Stephen Braun and Tom LoBianco in Washington contributed to this report.

Grand jury reportedly approves first criminal charges in Russia investigation Video:::::Transcript for Grand jury reportedly approves first criminal charges in Russia investigation Good to be here.A live shot of the white house and tart with the breaking news that is almost certainly causing reverberations right there in that building.Very little doubt about that.We are talking about that reported bombshell on the Russia investigation.CNN says a grand jury has approved the first criminal charges in the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.We've got team coverage and we start with ABC's senior justice correspondent Pierre Thomas in Washington leading us off.Pierre, good morning to you.Reporter: Dan, good morning.CNN is reporting that Mueller's special counsel team brought charges before a grand jury.We know attorneys from Mueller's office were at the federal courthouse here in D.C. Friday including one of his senior prosecutors who specializes in fraud cases.We've learned that there was a filing in court on Friday but we have no further reportable details.CNN's not reporting who might have been charged or what the charges could be.So this is a very unusual situation and it's unclear how significant these -- this potential action might be, Dan.What we know is Mueller's team has been investigating whether there was collusion between the trump campaign and Russian officials in connection with the 2016 presidential election and he's been investigating the financial dealings of a number of key trump associates including former campaign manager Paul manafort and Michael Flynn.Sources close to manafort say they have been given no indication any charges against him are imminent.We reached out to people tied to Flynn and got no comment but this is a reminder Mueller's investigation is sweeping, complicated and those who are being investigated are in legal jeopardy.Absolutely, Pierre.Thank you.Given the near daily drip on this Russia story it is easy to lose context of it all.Let's bring in ABC's Gloria Riviera with a look at what led up to these charges.Gloria, good morning.Reporter: Good morning.As you know president trump has long dismissed the Russia probe as a witch-hunt but new reports indicate the special counsel's investigation could be turning a new corner.Reportedly issuing the first charges that could implicate the president's own associates.President trump has long dismissed the Russia probe as nothing more than a political distraction.The whole Russia thing was an excuse for the Democrats losing the election and it turns out to be just one excuse.Reporter: And that message continues to the white house.Our position hasn't changed since day one.And I think we are seeing now that if there was any collusion with Russia it was between the DNC and the Clintons and certainly not our campaign.Reporter: Questions mounting over separate reports by CNN and "The Wall Street journal" saying the first criminal charges have been filed in independent counsel Bob corker's investigation into the alleged ties to the Russian government.The indictments are still sealed under orders from a federal judge.ABC news has not independently matched that reporting.The news comes at a time when we're also learning more about who was behind that infamous intelligence dossier alegging T tie S. The Washington beacon hired fusion gps to provide research on multiple the candidates but insists it did not pay for the dossier and did not have any dealings with the former British intelligence officer who ultimately produced the dossier citing Russian sources.Might have started with a Republicans early on in the primaries.I think I would know but let's find out who it is.I'm sure that will come out.Do you know who those Republicans are?I think I would have -- if I were to guess, I have one name in mind.Reporter: The house intelligence committee says it is working with the free beacon to verify its claims it had no involvement with the dossier and man who produced it.Thank you.Cecilia, I want to bring you in on this since you cover the white house every day.What do you think -- how are they reacting to this news about the first charges from Mueller.Certainly the public front is everything is calm, business as usual, one aide last night was tweeting it's quiet night at the white house.And certainly they're not going to back down from this claim that this is a witch-hunt that is the narrative.The president wag tweeting saying there is no collusion between the Russians and me.That is the public reaction.I can tell you from speaking to a lot of sources people are nervous in that they're lawyering up.The president has picked up the tab for some of those lawyers.This is an investigation certainly circling in and closing in on some aides close to the president and know these questions and know this investigation is not going away so privately people are definitely starting to feel this.Lots of lawyers involved.For more on all this let's bring in ABC news political commentator cokie Roberts in Washington.Cokie, let me ask you how nervous do you think the white house should be?Well, once these special prosecutors going it's very unsettling for white houses and grand juries leak and we start to learn lots of information and unfortunately though for the principles they don't leak enough.And so what you have is a lot of speculation and a lot of finger-pointing without a lot of facts and that goes on for months and months and months often and that can be very disspiriting to a white house because they're trying to get something done and they're constantly having to worry about this investigation and I think that's likely to go on for a long time.It 1er7b8 is on their mind if the president's tweets are any indication, cokie.But I want to ask you about something else that was in the news and has been at the top of all of our newscasts here.Those files that were just released in the JFK assassination.You have some personal experience with that.What do you think will come of all this?Well, my father was on the Warren commission an I do remember actually him being on the phone talking to Lyndon Johnson and saying, we need to name a blue ribbon commission, otherwise the American people will never feel like we've investigated this crime of the assassination.Now, of course, what happened was just the opposite, they were hoping to bring everything out and let the American people feel comfortable about the fact that they knew who the assassin was and now we've had these 40, 50 years of not knowing or of people feeling like there's something being hidden and by not having all -- every single one of the papers released on Thursday, what you have is the conspiracy starting right up again.Just stirring the pot of the Kennedy conspiracy people.Cokie, let me ask you about another story a little more current.A lot of people have been talking about this tiny company out of whitefish, Montana, that got hired to restore power in Puerto Rico.Some people are pointing out that the owner of the company has political ties to people in trump's orbit.How big a story do you think this is?I don't think this one goes terribly far.After a major disaster all kinds of funny things happen because there's a whole lot of money being thrown at a problem and people get rich off it.After the BP oil spill in Louisiana, the cynics were referring to spill yonaires and this one is likely toable off, not something we would have recommended on an ethical basis, but I don't think it's likely to rise to a major story.Not shady, our political guru cokie Roberts, thank you, cokie.Great to have you with us this This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Political analyst Mark Halperin faces new sexual harassment allegations Video:::::Transcript for Political analyst Mark Halperin faces new sexual harassment allegations In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal stories of sexual harassment and assault have spread from corporate world and journalism.A third woman came forward with groping allegations against former president George H.W.Bush.He's now apologized and mark Halperin is facing new public accusers and fallout.ABC's linsey Davis is here with the latest.Reporter: A one-two punch for Halperin.The book he was working on about the 2016 election, canceled.And not only the book publisher but HBO is pulling the plug on a project they were planning with him.MSNBC is announcing mark Halperin will no longer be appearing on the network after at least five women have come forward alleging sexual harassment when the "Game change" author was political director at ABC news in the late '90s, the women all in their 20s shared stories of Halperin propositioning them for sex, making unwanted sexual demands and pressing himself against them.More are coming forward saying they knew about it or experienced it about it themselves.Diana Goldberg told "The Washington post" she reached out to Halperin for help with a story but says he would only help her if she sat on his lap.ABC news says mark left ABC news over a decade ago and no complaints were filed during his tenure.But the women say his high position at the network stopped them from coming forward.CNN senior correspondent Clarissa ward called his behavior an open secret.When she was an international reporter at the network from 2007 to 2010 and tweeted out as if most of us at that age aren't just trying to be seen as competent equals with a bright future ahead and not a potential hr headache.Let's be very clear.The one responsible for any sexual misconduct that may have taken place is the man who instigated it.Halperin put out a statement saying he did pursue relationships with women during his time at ABC news and says I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain.For that I am deeply sorry and I apologize and, Amy, he says he's taking a step many back from his day-to-day operations and will focus on this situation.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
Trump discusses brother's addiction during opioid announcement Video:::::Transcript for Trump discusses brother's addiction during opioid announcement sitting there like this.Hunker down.The white house and president trump is taking on the opioid crisis invoking his own family's history with addiction.I had a brother, best-looking guy, best personality, much better than mine, but he had a problem.He had a problem with alcohol and he would tell me, don't drink.Don't drink.He would say it over and over and over again.And to this day I've never had a drink.Nour according to the CDC 91 deaths a day from overdoses and 21% who are prescribed them misuse them and the economic burden is $78.5 billion.Jon Karl, they're calling it a public health emergency facing criticism for not declaring the more sweeping national emergency he promised.Reporter: He is but this is a significant move, one that public health experts say can make a difference.It does allow for the reallocation of some federal funds towards treatment and prevention.It it also makes it easier to obtain anti-addiction medication and the president is promising to stem the flow of illegal fentanyl from China.This is something that he says that he will raise when he visits beijing, raise it with the Chinese in November.The big question, though, is will the president ask for -- ask congress for more funds to deal with all this.I expect that he will but there is no indication of how much.Yeah, he's already facing criticism over that because his current budgets cut funding for places like the national institute of health which fund opioid research and prevention programs.Reporter: Not to mention the changes he wanted in medicaid and he's faced some criticism from some of his allies during the campaign because he did make this a big issue in the campaign.Meantime, yesterday the house passed that budget which sets the framework for those big tax cuts that the president is promising.A lot of indications now that the Republican leadership in the white house pushed very hard to get this done as quickly as possible.Even though most members of congress, most of the public don't know the details of the plan yet.Reporter: Well, because the plan hasn't been released and they're talking about getting it done by Thanksgiving.George, in the past major tax bills have taken many month, if not years to get done, this would be record time.One Republican said speed kills.In other words, by doing this fast they hope to kill any opposition to the plan?Jon Karl, thanks very much.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
Trump blocks release of some JFK assassination files Video:::::Transcript for Trump blocks release of some JFK assassination files First new details revealed in the top secret JFK files, thousands about the Kennedy assassination becoming public but some blocked by president trump for national security reasons.Our chief national correspondent Tom llamas is at the national archives in Washington with all of those details.Good morning, Tom.Reporter: Amy, good morning to you.This is just a sample of some of those documents.Everything from FBI interrogation memos to receipts to the actual CIA plans to kill Fidel Castro with poison pills.There's so much information here and our team spent all night going through those 2,800 documents but as you mentioned some remain secret but still there is so much material in these documents for people who like conspiracy theories to cherry-pick and build their case.This morning, thousands of documents shedding new light on the investigation into the assassination of JFK but also adding to the mystery of what happened in dealey plaza on November 22nd, 1963.The newly released files show an effort by investigators to chase down every lead.This FBI memo from 1964 disputing claims assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was an FBI informant, finding he was never paid money or ever assigned an official symbol number like a code name..There is Lee Harvey Oswald.He's been shot.Reporter: On the day Oswald was shot and killed two days after Kennedy this memo from the head of the FBI apparently.J. Edgar Hoover demanding public doubt be dealt with saying he wants something issued so that we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin.Assassins need payroll, schedules, times, orders.This was a military-style ambush from start to finish.This was a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.Reporter: The film "JFK" and its fictional plot to kill Kennedy fueling more speculation and in part leading to the assassination records collection act of 1992 which required all federal assassination records be released before today.What experts want to know is if the documents, some still secret, will show Oswald was being tracked in Mexico City seven weeks before the assassination and mentioned his plan.Was the middle of the cold war and we could find out if they heard Oswald say something that was threatening against the president and if they did what did they do about it.Reporter: But the biggest secrets remain so far a mystery, the FBI and CIA appealing to the white house to not release documents with sensitive information.Why?A danger to national security.The CIA saying in part, they needed to protect information including the names of current and former CIA officers, and specific intelligence methods that remain viable to protecting the nation today.Now, as for those secret documents that still remain behind closed doors at the national archives president trump has ordered a review of those to see if at some point in the next 180 days they can be released to the public.Amy.And, Tom, as you mentioned you and your team have been poring over these documents throughout the night.Does anything stand out to you?Reporter: You know, Amy, reading through these hundreds of documents, thousand, there is a running theme that investigators really tried to chase down every lead.We saw one memo where the secret service chased down a dollar bill that had a threat written to the president on it in 1964.This was just a random dollar bill that was in circulation and then a memo from 1976 from the CIA outlining a new policy that they were no longer going to enter into paid contracts with American clergymen like priests but also, Amy, news correspondents.Oh, that is interesting.Tom, George here.Another thing, in six months we're likely to see several more thousand documents come out after the review, some will probably be held back but the conspiracy theories will never go away because so many other documents are missing or destroyed.Reporter: That's so true, George.Even with the ones they released, there's so many new nuggets and new names and so much information, now open widely to the public and really it's such an interesting read I invite all of our viewers to logon to the archives website.It is a fascinating read and reads like a spy thriller novel and, again, it was on one of the darkest days in American history, George.Incredible stuff.Tom, thank you very much.The mystery continues.And it will.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Trump declares opioid epidemic the worst drug crisis in American history Video:::::Transcript for Trump declares opioid epidemic the worst drug crisis in American history Meantime, president trump declaring war on the nation's open yoid crisis today, and offering a very personal story.But the president was careful with his words, calling it a, quote, public health emergency, and why the words he chose could determine how much money the government will spend to fight this.ABC's senior white house correspondent Cecilia Vega tonight.Reporter: With the stroke of a pen today, president trump declared the opioid epidemic the worst drug crisis in American history.I am directing all executive agencies to use every appropriate emergency authority to fight the opioid crisis.Reporter: The declaration means -- patients in rural areas can reach doctors and obtain prescriptions to treat addiction by phone or internet.Unemployed workers who lost their jobs because of addiction will receive job training and assistance.And it lifts bureaucratic red tape, allowing more funding for treatment centers in all 50 states.But the president stopped short of declaring a sweeping national emergency, something he has repeatedly promised.It's a national emergency.We're going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money.Reporter: Today, he said something slightly different, calling it a public health emergency.That means his action does not include emergency federal money to address the crisis that kills nearly 100 people a day.For more than a year, ABC news followed families battling the effects of addiction.In New Hampshire, David sat down with Rory Smith, who found his son, Aaron, in their basement, overdosed.He was gray.I yelled for the phone, to call 911, and I proceeded to give him mouth to mouth.He was not breathing, and I couldn't feel a heartbeat.Can you tell me what that's like?It's probably the worst thing I've ever had to do in my life, was giving him mouth to mouth.I just -- I said, is this how it's all going to end?Right here, in my basement?Reporter: That time, they were able to revive Aaron, but after another overdose, he died.At his funeral, Kerry Norton, a nurse and advocate who tried to help Aaron, made this promise to his grieving father.I'm so sorry.I will fight for him.I promise you.Reporter: Late today, Kerry told us, the problem in new Hampshire has only gotten worse.People desperate for treatment, often having to wait weeks.Now, from president trump, a familiar call to action targeting young people with a just say no style ad campaign.If we can teach young people, and people generally, not to start, it's really, really easy not to take them.Reporter: The president said his own wakeup call came from his older brother, Fred.Great guy, best looking guy, best personality, much better than mine, but he had a problem.He had a problem with alcohol, and he would tell me, "Don't drink.""Don't drink."He would say it over and over and over again.And to this day, I've never had a drink.And Cecilia Vega joining us from the white house.And Cecilia, it was deeply person, the president's story, but the white house is still facing tough questions tonight about whether the president's action today is an adequate response for a crisis of this magnitude.Reporter: David, this comes at a time when the health secretary here was fired for questions over his use of private jets.The drug czar recently resigned no replacement has been named.And tonight, Democrats are sounding the alarm about funding.Nancy Pelosi today said, show me the money.But David, as you know, the president, right there in that story, called this a winnable war.And of course, you checked back in with those families and we'll continue to do so on this crisis.Cecilia, thank you.We turn next here tonight to This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
President Trump declares opioid crisis a 'public health emergency' Video:::::Transcript for President Trump declares opioid crisis a 'public health emergency' President trump.Making it official there signing his name to an official order declaring the Oprah you would crisis to be a national public health emergency.The president joined there by families of people who have lost family members to the drug crisis.He has spoke of this as a national shame and a human tragedy.Invoking his brother Fred trump.Who died prematurely because of complications from alcoholism.He connected the OP oil crisis up to his favorite themes of immigration in the border saying that he will raise this issue.With China and next week on his Asian trip.And also saying that this is part and parcel of his effort to tighten the borders here at home he talked about new regulations.And he talked also about the need to help people who are hooked.And the need to help prevent people from getting hooked joining us to make sense of all of this are several ABC news contributors among them ABC's Mary Alice park she works for the politically unit.Also on the phone is doctor Jan asked in the chief medical correspondent.Mary Alice first to you this has been something that president trump has been talking about on the campaign trail for quite some time hasn't it.Absolutely you know I Charles a lot can change house while and I was struck out a fact that this issue came up.Every single place we went from Boston to Seattle next specially in rural parts of the country West Virginia.Rural remote.New Hampshire it's part of the reason you saw so many governors there in the room with the president this is an issue that came up.Nonstop.On the campaign trail and I think you saw the president really.Took to heart was incredibly.And pathetic but in that speech you said talking about his own Stanley and made a point of making sure that people understand how serious it was taken grades stand.I've witnessed for a moment Mary announcement I want to go to ABC's senior White House correspondent Cecilia Vega who joins us by telephone Cecilia he declare this to BN national.Public health emergency.What does that mean.Well that you know there's a little bit of controversy over this perhaps not surprising David the president had for months.They saying that he would declare this as national health emergency.And and it fact that it.Partly what his own commission on hope to its recommended that he's fallen short of going to.All the way bear out but but his commission also gave him the option of declaring that the public health emergency took.A big picture what did god will just talk about a couple of fake to freeze up some of the bureaucracy in terms of grant money to.The clinics and things like that it helps overcome.A number of bureaucratic delays and things like hiring specialists to treat addiction.Out are in very specific ways this is going to duke expand access to treatment for patients in and rural areas for example these patients will be allowed kept.Used to telemedicine the Internet in the fall to reach a doctor to help them with prescriptions for addiction.But what it doesn't deal with it doesn't increase funding.The White House eater telling us that they hope congress.Pick that up down the road it it you know in in the big picture it's unclear.Really elected will do on the ground what it will actually tree achieved on the experts many of them say that this is largely symbolic but nonetheless this is being widely applauded as a big move.Albeit symbolic by the White House because it creek that sense of urgency for a problem that you and I both know we've covered this issue is very much a national crisis we're talking about a 140.Two deaths a day this country an open letter to blame for that.As the president said there are more deaths from OP lords in this country than from.Motor vehicles and gun violence combined.And yet as you point out there's some question here about the commitment of money the public health emergency fund I read.Now stands at 57000.Dollars the current budget for the Health and Human Services Department would cut funding.To that department so there's some question here isn't there about the commitment of money.It's exactly those pointing deed and not just that lets not forget that there is no drug czar in his administration right now there is no director of the health and human services.Department not and and as you were saying a this comes.As this administration has pushed for unprecedented.Cuts.And federal aid to states for Medicaid programs and Medicaid has.Has proven to be what are the most effective tools in combating opium addiction.Those are the big questions that are out there right now but I do I do have to go back to what we have you heard universally.From doctors and from addiction specialist who say.If it is unclear how much people actually do in terms of can have in terms of tangible effects but really.Even if this is symbolic.People are very in this industry and and in this community very very happy to beat.Did this priority is patient.OP ladies and and the crisis in this country as as a top priority from Washington right now.ABC's Cecilia Vega thank you so much for joining us you gotta get under world news and we look forward to your report tonight.Let's move along now to doctor Jan Ashton who is joining us by telephone she's ABC's senior.Met our stories chief.Medical correspondent hi John.I gave it so it what is your sense of what's needed here.Well you know let me take you behind the scenes could I want to pick up on a couple of points that it's Jillian made about.You know what's going on on the federal level and what's going on in the trenches to its eco.I want to share it with our viewers that our listeners you know I'm a practicing physician I mean a private practice and every year.And three health care provider with a prescription pads that has.I DEA number and a controlled dangerous substance to coach CBS late and number has to be new dilute the latent in the court yet it's paid for that.But in many cases behalf do you I'd hate some new CME's continuing medical education and answer some questions that better.I just completed my literally yesterday up from my violations annual which is due to the end of this month.And I had to answer.Question about well you Lloyd than we have to register in the eight security.As a physician who describe who had prescribed.Class of medication.And it tell you how pervasive this approach in this attack it is.This is absolutely.Affecting change at the health care provider prescribe or level.Which I think is a good thing because let's face a lot of health care.Professional to prescribe these medications aren't doing it because they want someone to become an addict.They're doing it because.Twenty years ago in medical school or thirty years ago in medical school that was the only class of pain medication.That those providers knew about so we education.Needs to occur at pharmaceutical development I was happy here the president mention that.That apps.We need to occur but I also want to address something that often and at a forgotten voice in this.In this debate in this crisis which is the millions and millions of Americans who live and suffer from chronic pain.And they are so you're all.That there will be an over compensation of backlash.You know to an over extreme that will affect them getting some kind of pain relief whether it is from the proper use a populated.You know in some cases or with other things I think that is a very real here and we need to remember in the medical profession action.That that goal is treating pain pickle if not to withhold.Pain relief.From a patient but I will tell you as.Crap and I got a pharmacology award at my graduating medical school classic Columbia.We need a much.Better class of medications that will be like her pain it has never been and I deal and now of course being you know that not only is that not right Yelp of pain.In many cases but it does lead to addiction and dat so I was very very happy even at this with the formality Dijjer this.Coming from the top down as well as the bottom up.As you point out there that some of the new regulations.He propose there are.Making some supplies of pills seven day only supplies that really tricky.For somebody being prescribed pain medication we also talked about taking particular at least one specific drugs.Off the market.Is this something that he's gonna get much push back from the pharmaceutical industry or from the drug stores.Current I don't think from the drug stores I think that armistice or thirty weigh on work with this because.They've already been incredibly helpful with trying to limit.The amount of these medications that dedication can go home with an itch and I want to tell you that as for perform surgery as someone who had surgery at the patients.Often times.You know this isn't real problem patient having surgery are given 455060.Perreault.You know in the short term post operative period we have better medications to treat back katic pain then OP Lloyd so I think that the removal of fat now off the market.You know which only be used at a hospital setting what it is safe and effective and appropriate.You know outpatient setting I agree with that at as a as a medical professional and I think.That we definitely need better option for patients who were dealing with acute or chronic pain DO POA are not the answer.Thanks so much Jan let's bring in Geneva sans she works with the justice team.Geneva you have been neck covering some of the frontlines of the open your prices with Pierre Thomas.Tell us about the night when stories you did last summer.That's very epidemic it's something that reaches all corners of the United States across the nation so we partnered with time.And our ABC affiliates to attract and quantify that scope of the crisis that was heading.Across the United States and one thing only found is that it's really hard to track in real time.That data.Overdose deaths of overdoses.State health departments and hospital association and bring and that information in all different kinds of Lee is.And that's one thing that health experts say could really make a difference is real time data tracking.And so we looked at across the US and like the first lady of the same.The thing that really stood out even more than shocking numbers in their numbers are incredibly high.Was the individual stories that we found during that week this summer.Their legs.Woman and her young.Early twining is she had just gotten out of rehab in Kentucky her family thought she was on generate track.And she stayed over at a friend's house ended up in the hospital.Her mother got a phone call saying you need to get here immediately.But it was too late she had died of an overdose of the heroin overdose.And her family spoke out that leak Tass and others.To.Science prevent the next case from happening.There is little girl in New Hampshire really young girl was clutching the photo of her father that had also died about her an overdose.She was left without a father.And in Miami at ten year old boy accidentally came in contact with heroin and it's those stories that really touching.As you say the First Lady said this could happen to any of us she said no state has been spared no demographic.Untouched by this.Mary Alice parks going back to you briefly here.I wonder this is something that is near and dear to the hearts of trump voters and there's a sense out there.That in places where there's been middle class or working class that's been left behind factory closures jobs shipped overseas.That people have in some of these communities turn to drugs and often with tragic result.It was really amazing how the president was able in one speech in a way to I don't think we've seen.Can do before talk about such a wide range of solutions.From international commerce to very.Intimate conversations that people can have with there friends and family.I really encouraging community leaders to step up to the plate here and you said it maybe some of the hardest hit areas a rural parts of the country.He was really imploring people to take a personal.A personal stake in this as well to sent to find a way to reach out to those that are hurting the most even if they're not.Medical professionals themselves I think is part of the reasons to go back to politics for a Sackett.Part of the reason he sought Democrats in that room too you know Joseph Manchin from West Virginia was sitting right there.There are Democrats I was following on Twitter who were applauding the president for this move so I think that but he he will continue to get high praise.The president also worked in there his talk of a border wall with Mexico.And Geneva I know that you spent time in Arizona near the Mexico border.And to what extent is that connected here to this overall problem.Still in Arizona that's where a lot of the traffickers.Bring their drugs and through Mexico.Lot of it's coming up through Mexico and DA tells us that Arizona Elway and then Carrey in the column mine for the rest of the country they see.Thousands of pounds of heroin coming through.Doses of fat not and then.In the upcoming lands there overdoses in the northeast in California.When we rarely went on one raid at that we found pounds of black tar heroin inside someone's home.And that alone it is that few handfuls that it was pounds could've provided thousands of individual doses worth millions of dollars on the street.All right.President trump says today that we can be the generation that ends hope BO it eviction we will see he has certainly put this on the radar screen.And his administration.Will be judged on the basis of this major piece domestic policy.That he pushed forward today.I'm

Russia investigation seeks first charges, indictment announcement may come as soon as Monday, sources say:::::The special counsel team investigating Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election and possible links to the campaign of President Donald Trump has sought charges against at least one unidentified target, ABC News has learned.Interested in Russia?Add Russia as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Sources tell ABC News an indictment announcement and arrest could possibly come as early as Monday.A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment.CNN first reported a federal grand jury approved charges brought by Special Counsel Robert Muellers team.Attorneys from Mueller's office were at the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., on Friday, including one of his senior prosecutors who specializes in fraud cases.ABC News confirmed a filing was made at the court Friday.It's unclear at this point how significant this potential action might be.Mueller is investigating whether there was any collusion between members of the Trump presidential campaign and Russia in connection with the 2016 election.The special counsel has also been probing the financial dealings of some key Trump associates.Sources close to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort told ABC News that they have no indication that any charges against him may be imminent.ABC News also reached out to people associated with former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and have so far not received a comment in response.
Former Acting US Attorney General Dana Boente resigns:::::Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who temporarily took over as acting U.S. attorney general, has stepped down.Interested in Trump Administration?Add Trump Administration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Trump Administration news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Earlier this year, Boente briefly replaced Sally Yates as acting attorney general after President Donald Trump fired Yates for refusing to defend his first executive order restricting entry into the U.S. of people from seven Muslim-majority countries.When Yates was removed on January 30, Boente stepped in to direct Justice Department staff "to do our sworn duty and to defend the lawful orders of our president."Boente's tenure as acting attorney general ended when the Senate confirmed Jeff Sessions to be the next attorney general on Feb. 8.Boente, 63, began his career at the Department of Justice in 1984 as a part of the tax division, and went on to serve as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana in 2012, and for the Eastern District of Virginia in 2015.Between those positions, as the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia from 2013 to 2015, Boente supervised the prosecution of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell for public corruption.In a press conference after the governor was sentenced to prison in 2015, Boente told reporters that holding the powerful to account is necessary to maintain the people's trust in public institutions."No one is above the law," he said."Not a high public official; not even the highest public official in the state."The U.S. Supreme Court later vacated McDonnell's conviction, however, and the Department of Justice moved to dismiss the charges against him.

UK 'won't recognise' Catalan independence:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Theresa May and Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy in 2016 The UK will not recognise the Catalan parliament's declaration of independence, Downing Street says.Theresa May's official spokesman said the declaration was based on a vote that had been declared illegal.The Scottish government said it understood and respected Catalonia's position.The Catalan regional parliament has voted to declare independence from Spain, while the Spanish parliament has approved direct rule over the region.The UK prime minister's spokesman said in a statement: "The UK does not and will not recognise the unilateral declaration of independence made by the Catalan regional parliament."It is based on a vote that was declared illegal by the Spanish courts.We continue to want to see the rule of law upheld, the Spanish constitution respected, and Spanish unity preserved."Catalan MPs backed the independence motion 70-10 in a ballot boycotted by the opposition.Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had told senators direct rule was needed to return "law, democracy and stability" to Catalonia.Calls for dialogue 'refused' Scotland's Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, Fiona Hyslop, said: "We understand and respect the position of the Catalan government."While Spain has the right to oppose independence, the people of Catalonia must have the ability to determine their own future."Today's declaration of independence came about only after repeated calls for dialogue were refused."Ms Hyslop added that direct rule was not a solution and that Spain's decision to impose it "should be of concern to democrats everywhere".She called on the EU to resolve the crisis peacefully and democratically.Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said the dispute had been turned into a "binary choice" between independence and direct rule."It is not what the majority in Catalonia and Spain actually want," she said."They want a sensible, political dialogue about finding a resolution."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Boris Johnson spoke to reporters in Lisbon UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson earlier offered his support to the Spanish PM.After a meeting with Portugal's foreign minister in Lisbon, he said: "We don't think, as far as we understand the matter, that the referendum on independence was well-founded in law."Therefore we remain very clear in our view that we should uphold the constitutional integrity and sovereignty of our Spanish friends and that's really our commitment and our pledge."
Hurricane Irma: Aid rule change to be considered:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Caribbean islands were hit by Hurricane Irma last month British overseas territories damaged by hurricanes could access aid in future under new plans, the BBC has learned.Some small Caribbean islands that were hit by Hurricane Irma last month were deemed too wealthy to qualify for aid.But on Monday the body that sets international aid rules will consider allowing countries to return to the list of poorer, eligible recipients.Middle-income countries cannot currently re-register for aid if they suffer an unexpected economic decline.Another option that will be discussed is an "emergency waiver".This would allow a country to be included on the list of eligible official development assistance (ODA) recipients for a short period after a crisis.But this proposal is expected to face opposition from some members of the the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) development assistance committee when it meets on Monday in Paris.Last month, the British overseas territories of Anguilla, Turks and Caicos and the British Virgin Islands were badly damaged by Hurricane Irma.But there was controversy after the BBC revealed that Britain's 13bn aid budget could not be used to help repair the islands.All three had gross national incomes higher than the benchmark set by the World Bank for countries to be eligible for ODA.'High level meeting' International Development Secretary Priti Patel, who will attend Monday's meeting, has been pushing for the international rules to be changed to reflect the vulnerabilities of small island states.She has discussed the options with Angel Gurria, the secretary general of the OECD, and this week she told MPs that he had been "broadly supportive" of her ideas.The development assistance committee is made up of 30 countries, and changes to the rules have to be agreed by consensus.Image copyright PA Image caption British troops took part in hurricane clean-up operations OECD sources suggested there would be opposition from some countries who feared that a special case was being made for British overseas territories.Others fear that money going to small islands could divert ODA funds from tackling long term poverty in developing countries.So officials expect the most likely outcome from Monday's "high level meeting" of the committee is for the members to support in principle the idea of creating a new mechanism for countries to return to the ODA list, while also asking for more information about how any rule changes might work."I doubt it will be done in one day," said one source."The decision will probably be to dig a little deeper and look at the conditions and the research."Key questions would be: What criteria would be used to decide whether or not a country should be eligible for ODA again?How could they ensure that any rule change helps all countries and not just British overseas territories?And how could the rules ensure that ODA is not unduly diverted away from poverty reduction?The OECD is understood to be looking at the way other international organisations have made their rules more flexible to deal with emergencies.These include how the World Bank decides which countries are eligible for International Development Association assistance, and how the World Trade Organization waives intellectual property rights to allow poor countries access to medicine licences when there is a health need.Aid list At the moment countries eligible for ODA must have a gross national income of less than $12,235 per capita.That currently includes Antigua and Barbuda, Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba.But Anguilla and St Kitts & Nevis were taken off the ODA list in 2014, the British Virgin Islands in 2000, and the Turks and Caicos in 2008.Under the new proposal, there would now be a process whereby these countries could be restored to the ODA list.
Brexit: EU bank may not fully repay UK until 2054:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Alexander Stubb tells Today it will take more than 30 years for UK to get 3bn EIB investment back Billions of euros of British taxpayers' money could remain locked into an EU bank for more than thirty years after Brexit, the UK has been warned.Alexander Stubb, vice president of the European Investment Bank - in which the UK is a 16% shareholder - said it would not be fully repaid until 2054.He described Brexit as a "travesty" but denied the move was a punishment."The EIB has leveraged the economy of the UK many, many fold over the years," he told BBC Radio 4's Today.The UK has 3.5bn euros (3.1bn) of capital at the bank and a House of Lords report said the UK's investment could be worth 10.1bn (8.9bn) euros taking into account reserves and profits.Established in 1958, the EIB uses capital provided by EU countries to make loans at low rates, often for major infrastructure projects.All 28 EU nations are shareholders in the Luxembourg-based bank, with the UK being the largest alongside Germany, France and Italy.Mr Stubb, a former prime minister of Finland, told the BBC that the UK's money could be tied up for decades in after it leaves the EU in 2019."Everyone on both sides of the negotiating table agree that we have to pay back the 3.5 billion euro, basically in cash, and that will happen over a long period, up until 2054, because that's when the loans are amortised."'Travesty' He insisted that no-one in the bank wanted to "punish" the UK for leaving and actually wanted to "alleviate the pain" of Brexit."I have a British heart pumping, I am married to a Brit, my children have dual nationality and I think Brexit is one of the biggest travesties that we have seen in the modern era," he said."So I will do everything in my power to alleviate the pain, but the economic facts are just such that there are no winners in Brexit - apart from perhaps a few lawyers.Unfortunately, we will see this in the coming years."The BBC's Ross Hawkins said Today had heard how delays in authorising new loans while the UK remains part of the EU could see fewer social homes built.One housing association, Stonewater, said it may build around 300 fewer homes because its application for 100m to build new properties had ground to a halt.Its executive director John Bruton told the programme: "The Bank has been waiting for assurances from the UK government before the application can be progressed."
Brexit: Baroness Anelay quits role after helicopter injury:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Baroness Anelay has been in the House of Lords since 1996 Conservative peer Baroness Anelay has stood down as a Brexit minister, citing health reasons.She told Conservative Home she was "calling time" on her ministerial career due to an injury she sustained in 2015 getting out of a helicopter.The peer, who joined the Brexit department earlier this year, will be replaced by former MEP Lord Callanan.Brexit Secretary David Davis said she had made an "invaluable contribution" to the process of leaving the EU.In 2015, Baroness Anelay badly injured her ankle in an accident getting out of a Black Hawk helicopter during a diplomatic trip to Bosnia-Herzegovina.'Optimistic' Writing for Conservative home, she said her retirement from government was prompted by the injury but she would remain an active member of the House of Lords."It was the Black Hawk helicopter that did it," she wrote."As a Foreign Office minister, I was touring Bosnia and Herzegovina, meeting victims of war and terror for whom British overseas power had been a ladder out of oppression."Unfortunately for me, that particular ladder hadn't materialised when it came to getting out of the helicopter.Image caption Martin Callanan becomes the Brexit minister in the House of Lords "One ill-judged leap later, and I sustained an uncomfortable injury that has called time on my ministerial career after two decades on the front bench."Although she voted to remain in the EU, she said she was "optimistic" about the UK's future outside the bloc and was "certain" the negotiations and the UK's future relationship with the EU would be successful.The peer, who was a history teacher and magistrate before joining the Lords in 1996, has served in a series of frontbench positions for nearly 20 years.'Nightmare' Her departure means there is no woman in the ministerial team at either the Department for Exiting the European Union or the Foreign Office.Lady Fairhead, the recently ennobled former BBC chair, is the only female minister in a Brexit-related department, having become minister for trade and export promotion earlier this month.Lord Callanan was a Conservative MEP for the North-East of England for 15 years.He became a peer in 2014 and was previously a minister in the Department of Transport.Labour peer Lord Adonis, a vocal opponent of EU withdrawal, cast doubt on the Baroness Anelay's reasons for quitting given that she only accepted the Brexit ministerial job in July.He tweeted: "Lady Anelay's accident was 2 years ago.The 'accident' causing her departure was Brexit."He suggested that her successor was "inexperienced" and would have a "nightmare" getting Brexit-related legislation through the Lords, where the government does not have a majority.
UK 'wants to leave Common Agricultural Policy in March 2019':::::Image copyright Getty Images The UK is seeking to leave the EU Common Agricultural Policy in March 2019, Scotland Office minister Lord Duncan has said.Speaking at a National Farmers Union Scotland conference, he said the UK was pushing to split subsidy payments from any transitional Brexit deal.Lord Duncan said this would mean farmers being paid from a UK pot.Scottish Brexit minister Michael Russell said the move could restrict the sale of farm produce to the EU.UK ministers have said the level of funding to farmers after the UK formally leaves the EU would be guaranteed until 2022.Clarification sought Lord Duncan said: "The secretary of state (Michael Gove) has been very clear that he believes farming and fishing should not be part of any transitional deal."We need to be able to negotiate that.It's not in our gift solely to say it and get it.We need to negotiate."What we believe is the earlier we can give to farmers and the fishermen opportunities outside of these common policies which all concerned are restrictive, bureaucratic and indeed unhelpful to the wider industries."The sooner we can give that the better."The Scottish government said it was concerned that the March 2019 deadline would give Scotland only 18 months to create a new farm subsidy framework.Mr Russell said: "This seems to go completely counter to what the prime minister has been saying and absolutely counter to what the expectation appears to be in Brussels."I was very surprised to hear it and I think it will require urgent clarification, because as far as I know there's no intention in the negotiations of trying to pick and choose from a transitional deal."That rather defeats the purpose of it."
MPs to debate 'scrap first-past-the-post' call:::::Image caption The 2017 general election ended in a hung parliament - as was the case in 2010 Another bid to scrap the UK's first-past-the-post voting system will be debated by MPs on Monday.More than 100,000 people signed a petition to adopt proportional representation for general elections.Campaigners argue that the current system is meant to deliver decisive results but the 2010 and 2017 general elections resulted in hung parliaments.The government says the 2011 AV referendum shows the public do not want to change first- past-the-post.Under first-past-the-post (FPTP), the candidate who receives the most votes in a local constituency wins a seat in the House of Commons.Tactical voting This means the number of seats each political party wins does not reflect its share of the vote nationally - in 2015, UKIP picked up 3.9m votes but only won one seat.Under proportional representation (PR), parties' seats in parliament would be allocated in proportion to the number of votes cast for them.Image caption The government argues that the current voting system is easily understood and provides a clear link between MPs and their constituents The e-petition argues that the current system makes Parliament "unrepresentative".The Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for change, says the argument that FPTP brings decisive results has been undermined by recent elections and points out that proportional systems are used in the Welsh Assembly, Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly.History of voting system changes 1910: Royal Commission recommends the Alternative Vote system be adopted for elections to the Commons, although some argue for the Single Transferable Vote (STV) 1918: MPs reject STV in a free vote but back AV for rural, single member seats.The changes are blocked by the House of Lords 1931: Minority Labour government attempts to introduce AV in a third of constituencies but loses power before it can become law, after which electoral reform becomes a cause mostly associated with the Liberal Party 1998: The Jenkins Commission recommends a proportional system should replace FPTP in Westminster elections 1998: Northern Ireland Assembly formed - members elected under Single Transferable Vote system, a form of PR 1999: Britons switch to the "closed party list" PR system to elect members of the European Parliament, having previously used FPTP 1999: First elections to Holyrood and Welsh Assembly using "additional member" system - FPTP constituencies and seats filled proportionally from regional party lists 2007: STV introduced for Scottish local elections 2011: AV referendum - 19m voters - 68% of those who took part - reject bid to switch to new system Why not use proportional representation?The Electoral Reform Society says the 2011 referendum should not be seen as a rejection of proportional representation - as PR was not offered as an option.Instead the referendum offered voters a choice between keeping the current system or switching to the Alternative Vote - under which voters could rank candidates in order of preference, and these preferences could be used to decide the outcome in places where no candidate wins more than 50% of votes cast.But in its response, the government says it has "no plans" to change the voting system and the 2011 referendum produced a "clear result" in which "the public voted overwhelmingly in favour of keeping the FPTP system".The government argues that PR voting would "weaken the direct constituency link which is a key feature of our Parliamentary system" and that it would be "more complicated for the voter".Any petition on the UK Parliament's website with more than 100,000 signatures is automatically considered for a debate in Westminster Hall, an annexe to the main Commons chamber which does not have the power to make law.
Abuse allegations deeply concerning, says No 10 after Sun claims:::::Image copyright PA Any allegations of sexual harassment and abuse in Westminster are "deeply concerning", Downing Street has said.It comes after the Sun newspaper reported claims female researchers and aides were using a WhatsApp group to share information about alleged abuse.Prime Minister Theresa May would urge anyone with information to contact the authorities, a No 10 spokeswoman said.The WhatsApp group has allegedly shared stories of MPs groping staff in lifts and at drinks parties.According to the Sun story, a minister was branded "Not Safe In Taxis" because of his behaviour.Helpline Senior politicians from the Conservatives and Labour are said to be named in the WhatsApp group but names have been redacted in the Sun report.The prime minister's official spokeswoman said: "Any reports of sexual harassment were deeply concerning and that is true in any walk of life including politics."Any allegations will be taken seriously.Reports are concerning but we can't pre-empt allegations before they come to light."A House of Commons spokesman said the Parliamentary authorities have a limited ability to intervene because staff are employed directly by MPs.But he said there was a 24-hour helpline available to raise concerns."The House of Commons takes the welfare of everyone who works in Parliament very seriously," the spokesman said.'Serious' The spokesman added: "Where Members are alleged to have breached the MPs' code of conduct it is possible for the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to launch an investigation."Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said all employers had to have systems in place to enable female staff, including those working for MPs, to report allegations of abuse.Speaking on LBC radio, the Labour leader said the issue was "very serious" and that Labour had a process of its own for responding to complaints from elected representatives and party members in a "timely and proportionate" manner."The prime minister has announced this morning that she supports, which I agree with her on, a process that the staff of any MP, of any party, can and should report these matters to the House of Commons authority," he said."Where there is an unequal power relationship in the workplace and women become vulnerable as a result of it, they have to be supported, they have to be protected."

Nicola Sturgeon seeks clarity over Brexit transition:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Nicola Sturgeon said urgent clarity was needed on the UK's transition plans Nicola Sturgeon has called for "urgent clarity" from Theresa May on transition plans as the UK leaves the EU.In a letter to Theresa May, the first minister said that the prime minister's proposal for a two-year implementation period had been "seriously undermined".It followed comments from Mrs May that there would be no transition deal unless a trading relationship with the EU was settled next year.Number 10 said it was confident "general terms" would be agreed soon.While the first minister said she had welcomed comments from Mrs May made in Florence last month that she would be seeking urgent agreement on a two-year transition, Ms Sturgeon said that subsequent comments made in the Commons by the prime minister had "seriously undermined" clarity on the issue and also the confidence of business.Ms Sturgeon wrote: "This relates in particular to your comments suggesting no transition can be agreed, or formalised, until there is agreement on the future relationship."I am therefore urgently seeking your assurances that you are committed to rapidly putting in place transition arrangements that will meet the needs of business."Image copyright PA Image caption Nicola Sturgeon said Theresa May had undermined confidence with her comments Businesses have pressed the UK government to agree the terms of transition with the EU by Christmas.She said she wanted confirmation that the prime minister was urgently seeking agreement on a transition arrangement of at least two years, with the aim of securing that agreement by the end of this year.She also said that it should be based on the current structure of EU rules.Scotland's first minister wrote that such an agreement should not be conditional on a deal before the UK's leave date of March 2019.She also expressed concerns that UK government negotiations would result in a "no deal" scenario.She added: "The Scottish Parliament gave a clear view this week that a no deal situation would not be acceptable and I believe that if the UK finds itself in that position, that no Brexit would be preferable to no deal - or indeed a bad deal - and that each of the Parliaments in the UK must have the opportunity to take a view on that."A UK government spokeswoman said: "The prime minister was clear in her speech in Florence that we want a time-limited implementation period to carry out the practical changes necessary as we move to our new partnership with the EU."Our proposal for an implementation period is very similar to what the EU set out in their April guidelines so we are confident of agreeing the general terms of the implementation period soon."
Top civil servant Sir Jeremy Heywood treated for cancer:::::Image copyright PA The UK's top civil servant, Sir Jeremy Heywood, has been receiving treatment for cancer.The Cabinet Office said Sir Jeremy, who has been cabinet secretary since 2012, was diagnosed in June.In a statement, it said the 55-year old had received treatment over the summer and the early autumn which "went well".Sir Jeremy, it added, had continued his "normal duties" during this period with the full support of his doctors and remained "totally focused" on doing so.As cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, Sir Jeremy is responsible for advising the prime minister and cabinet on the business of government, including the UK's withdrawal from the EU.The Cabinet Office said it would be making no further comment on "this private matter".Sir Jeremy, who is sometimes characterised in the media as the most powerful figure in the British government, has worked closely with four prime ministers during a 25-year career in Whitehall.Under Tony Blair he was principal private secretary before becoming permanent secretary at Number 10 to both Gordon Brown and David Cameron.
Referee Tory MP Douglas Ross to miss World Cup:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Ross missed a House of Commons vote as he was officiating at a Barcelona match in the Champions League Scottish Tory MP Douglas Ross has told football authorities he will no longer accept refereeing appointments when Parliament is sitting.It means he will not be in the running to officiate at next summer's World Cup in Russia.Mr Ross was criticised for missing a debate on Universal Credit to run the line at a Champions League match.He defended that decision in a letter to constituents saying he knew he would not be able to speak in the debate.Mr Ross told BBC Scotland that he had made "difficult, personal decision" on his job in football, but said his "number one priority was standing up for the people of Moray".'Ticked off' The MP, who has been a referee for 15 years and was first elected a Moray councillor 10 years ago, said he had not been prepared for the level of criticism he received for missing the debate earlier this month.Mr Ross was in Spain for the Barcelona v Olympiakos game on the same day as the Universal Credit debate was held at Westminster.Prime Minister Theresa May was forced to defend him after SNP MP John McNally raised the issue by brandishing a red card across the chamber.Mr Ross said: "I don't need to be ticked off by anyone to know that you don't want to be on the prime minister's radar for reasons such as this."You want to be on the prime minister's, anyone's, radar for good reasons."Image copyright EPA Mr Ross said SNP campaign leaflets accusing him of putting football before parliamentary work had meant constituents were aware that refereeing was a big part of his life.But he added that before the election he gave a commitment not to allow his football job to impact on his parliamentary duties.He said: "I only have one priority which is to stand up for the people of Moray."I had given a commitment to the people of Moray and I hope this sends a signal that I was genuine about that."Mr Ross, a former MSP, was also criticised in November last year for missing a Scottish Parliament committee meeting to run the line in a Champions League match in Portugal.It led to calls for him to stand down from his frontbench role as the Scottish Conservatives' justice spokesman.Mr Ross later went on to defeat the SNP's Westminster leader Angus Robertson at the general election in June.Earlier, in a statement given to online community newspaper Inside Moray, the Moray MP said he recognised he could no longer balance his football job with his political one.
Unpaid internships likened to modern slavery in Lords debate:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Research suggests unpaid internships have grown massively since 2010 Unpaid internships have been likened to a form of modern slavery during a Lords debate on whether to ban them.Lord Holmes asked how a country which "slammed the door on slavery in the 19th Century" could allow people to work for no financial return.Interns were "not owned by anyone" and could quit, said Lord Mitchell, but getting "no payments for their labours" could be equated with slavery.Baroness Brady said work experience had value but must be more skills-driven.Lord Holmes' private members bill, being debated for the first time on Friday, would prohibit unpaid internships of more than four weeks.Without government backing, it is unlikely to succeed.Ministers have previously opposed attempts to ban unpaid internships, arguing it could "undermine existing employment laws".An attempt in Parliament to ban unpaid internships was blocked last November.but new research by the Social Mobility Commission suggests there is strong public support for the bill.Three quarters of the 5,000 people surveyed said they backed a ban on unpaid internships lasting four weeks or more.'Discriminatory' Many interns already fall under the legal definition of a "worker", a person who has a contract or arrangement to do work, and are entitled to the national minimum wage.But Lord Holmes of Richmond said existing laws were clearly not working, given that more and more professions and trades were requiring unpaid work experience when it comes to securing a job.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Entry into many professional careers often requires candidates to have completed internships "Wilberforce slammed the door on slavery in the 19th century," the Conservative peer, a former solicitor and member of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said."We had the national minimum wage legislation in the 20th century."How can it still be in the fifth richest economy on the planet that in the 21st century we're still asking people to give up their labour for no financial return?"The bill, he argued, would ensure young people had equal opportunities to get into the workplace.'Not a job' Businesswoman Baroness Brady said work experience had a role to play in informing young people about career choices and the world of work but was "very obviously not a job".The Apprentice TV star, a former small business adviser to David Cameron, said employers had to think very differently about what its purpose was."They are not doing something an employer needs to have done for no cost."I think we need a change of mindset from those who might think of work experience programmes as something they can exploit to get something done for nothing, to a community-based approach."Businesses, she said, should be asking what can we do to "give the young person the support they need to make that transition into the workplace and get on the road and to have a career?"Ahead of Friday's debate, Tanya De Grunwald, founder of careers blog Graduate Fog, who campaigns for fairer wages for interns, said: "The bill is well-meaning but I think it's the wrong solution."The message should be that most unpaid internships are already illegal, with certain exceptions such as working for charities ... Our focus should be on enforcing existing minimum wage law."She said she would like to see universities doing more to make young people aware of their rights and for it to be made easier to report advertisements for unpaid internships to HMRC.In April, a report from the Institute for Public Policy Research found the number of internships had risen by 50% since 2010.Research by the Sutton Trust, which works to improve social mobility, found nearly a third of graduate interns are unpaid.It estimated a six month unpaid internship in London would cost someone 5,556.
EU preparing for no deal Brexit, says Michel Barnier's adviser:::::The European Union is preparing for the UK to leave without a deal, a senior official has said.Stefaan De Rynck said Brussels did not want a "no deal" scenario but it was braced for one.Mr De Rynck is an adviser to EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.He dismissed claims by David Davis that the EU would push talks on a deal to the wire saying the bloc did not want to "add risk" to the exit process by "playing with time".Davis warned over Brexit vote promise "Brexit is a process we want to manage in a calm and rational way," Mr De Rynck told a seminar at the Institute for Government think tank in London, adding that failing to reach a deal would harm both sides.He said: "There is a clear negative impact from no deal, I think that that is clear, for both sides but especially for the UK economy.But it is not a scenario people want to work towards."We are preparing for it, that is for sure, at 27 [the other 27 EU states] but it is not a scenario that we in the negotiation room want to bring in that negotiation room."He added: "On going to the wire, we would certainly want to avoid that."'Very quickly' As it stands, the UK will leave the EU in March 2019 whether it agrees a deal on the terms of withdrawal or not.Prime Minister Theresa May has said she believes the two sides will reach a deal but the UK must prepare for all eventualities.The so-called divorce bill, the amount the UK will pay to settle its liabilities when it leaves the EU, remains a major sticking point in negotiations.Hopes that negotiations would move on to Britain's future relationship with the EU this month were dashed after EU chiefs said more work was needed first on the divorce talks.Mr De Rynck said "sufficient progress is not far away" but the UK must set out how it believes the divorce bill should be calculated to end the deadlock over money."In terms of the guidelines for the future relationship as well as the possible transition, all of that can come very quickly," he said.Earlier this month, European Council President Donald Tusk said the rest of the EU was not preparing for a no deal outcome."EU27 is not working on 'no-deal' scenario," he said."We negotiate in good faith and hope for sufficient progress by December."
Youth crime disclosure rules wholly inappropriate, say MPs:::::Image copyright Science Photo Library Rules on disclosing crimes committed in childhood in England and Wales should be "radically revised", say MPs.The Commons Justice Committee said the system was "wholly inappropriate", denied children a "second chance" and may breach human rights laws.People do not have to disclose "spent" past convictions and cautions after a period of time but sometimes employers can ask that they are disclosed.The government has listed 942 crimes that are not exempt from disclosure.The coalition government brought in changes in 2013 that allowed old convictions to be "filtered out" of record checks by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) after 11 years for adults and five-and-a-half years for young offenders.Sexting In the case of cautions, they are "filtered" after six years for adults, or two for those under 18 at the time.But there are 942 offences which cannot be filtered, ranging from sexual and violent crimes to offences such as failing to display a certificate of registration in a residential care home.The justice committee's report said that that system operated "in a mechanical fashion, with no right of appeal against disclosure decisions".It pointed to offences such as "sexting".While under recent changes sexting does not appear on a DBS certificate - unless it is at the discretion of police - others who committed an offence before new guidance came in were left in an "unresolved" position, the committee said.Image copyright Getty Images The committee said: "We do not think that the difficult problem of sexual offending by children is assisted by giving them a record of a non-filterable sexual offence."We note the inconsistency between the current police response to 'sexting' by children, designed to prevent them from entering the criminal justice system, and the previous policy of taking formal action."While we commend this change in policing approach, we are concerned about the implications for children whose "sexting" offences pre-date the policy change, acquiring non-filterable criminal records as a result."It suggests the current system may "fall short" of the UK's obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.It is illegal to possess, take or distribute sexual images of someone who is under 18, including of yourself - figures released in July showed thousands of children had been investigated by police for sexting in the last three years in England and Wales.The committee recommends: That a rule which means multiple childhood convictions can never be "filtered out" of DBS checks should be removed.That the single database of 942 offences which cannot be filtered be replaced with customised lists of offences applying to different employment areas That police chiefs should be given discretion to withhold disclosure, depending on age and circumstances of the offender That people should be given the right to have an independent review of any police decision to disclose convictions or cautions That the time allowed for convictions to become "spent" under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 be reduced Committee chairman Bob Neill said the government's main aim in youth justice was to stop people being drawn into crime "but these laudable aims are systematically undermined by the current disclosure regime"."Mistakes made as a teenager can follow someone around for decades and create a barrier to rehabilitation, as well as profound problems with access to employment and education."In 2014-15, the total number of standard DBS checks was 31,753 - 8,268 of which related to people who were under 18 years old at the time of their offence.A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: "We have noted the committee's report and will publish our response in due course."The government says it will consider the recommendations of two other reviews - by the Labour MP David Lammy and by child behavioural expert Charlie Taylor after the Supreme Court rules on cases challenging the current disclosure regime next year.

Voting opens in Scottish Labour leadership race:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Richard Leonard (left) and Anas Sarwar are the two candidates to replace Kezia Dugdale as Scottish Labour leader Voting has opened in the contest to elect a new leader for the Scottish Labour Party.Anas Sarwar and Richard Leonard are the two candidates to replace Kezia Dugdale, who quit the post in August.Ballot papers have now been sent out to party members, registered supporters and voters in affiliated organisations such as trade unions.Voting will run until midday on 17 November, with the winner announced the following day.The race was triggered by the sudden resignation of Ms Dugdale on 29 August.The Lothians MSP said it was time to "pass on the baton" to someone else - although she later hinted about "a lot of internal problems" in the party.After a succession of prominent MSPs ruled themselves out, Mr Leonard and Mr Sarwar were the only contenders to put their names forward.Both men have stressed their ambition to be the next first minister of Scotland, and each has set out a package of policies which they would look to implement.Policy pledges Mr Sarwar's plan for "a Scotland where nobody is left behind" includes: An overhaul of the tax system to cut income tax for lower earners and a 50p rate for the top 2% A new Scottish Child Tax Credit of 10 a week Backing for the UK's permanent membership of the EU single market A guaranteed job, training place or further education for every school leaver Mr Leonard has set out a list of 10 priorities, with number one and his "overriding mission" to end poverty in Scotland.He also wants to: Strengthen the powers of local government Embark on a "massive" housebuilding scheme Increase child benefit for all children Promote public ownership with a national energy company tasked with cutting bills and tackling fuel poverty Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The contest was triggered by the resignation of Kezia Dugdale in August Mr Sarwar said the party was "approaching the finishing line of this contest, but the start of our journey back to government".He said: "I am determined to lead the Scottish Labour Party back to where it belongs - in power."Mr Leonard also said the party was "at a turning point" and could "once again become a party of real change".He said: "It is clear now more than ever that Scotland needs a united Labour Party committed to real and bold change.We need to win power - not power for its own sake, but power for a purpose."A series of local hustings events have been held up and down Scotland as the candidates sought to sway voters to their side.Both men pledged a "comradely" contest, but the campaigns have each had controversial moments during the campaign.Mr Sarwar had to relinquish shares in his family's firm after a row over workers not being paid the living wage, while Mr Leonard had to deny claims he was involved in a "plot" against Ms Dugdale.
Emails reveal Foreign Office alarm at Trump travel ban:::::Image copyright PA The UK government wanted to set up an internal warning system to monitor and react to decisions made by President Donald Trump, emails show.The emails reveal concerns about the impact of Mr Trump's travel ban on UK citizens and national security.Officials did not want to be caught out by similar orders issued by the US president "just as London is going to sleep", one official said.The emails were released to the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act.The BBC's Diplomatic Correspondent James Landale said: "These emails show just how concerned the Foreign Office was about the flow of unexpected announcements emerging from the Trump White House and the potential impact on the UK.""But we have to remember that this concern was also shared by other parts of the US administration that were at times equally blindsided by the president's early morning tweets," added our correspondent."So the emails do not reflect any particular deterioration in UK-US relations.They illustrate the kind of steps foreign governments have had to consider to cope with Mr Trump's unpredictable style of government."Most of the emails released to the BBC were between the British Embassy in Washington and the Foreign Office around the time of Mr Trump's executive order halting all refugee admissions and temporarily barring people from seven Muslim-majority countries.The order, signed on 27 January, was one of string of decrees, proclamations and orders issued by Mr Trump during his first weeks in the White House.It was signed hours after Prime Minister Theresa May became the first foreign leader to meet Mr Trump at the White House.Foreign Office officials feared the ban would prevent thousands of UK citizens with dual nationality travelling to the United States and discussed the likely impact of that on relations between Mrs May and the new president."BE (British Embassy) Washington have been trying to get clarity from State (The State Department) without luck so far," officials said in an internal Foreign Office email dated 28 January - the day after Mr Trump signed the order."If true, this would obviously mean thousands of dual nationals with British passports being banned from travelling to the US.Not great after the PM visit."Another email, on the same day, said: "The dual nationals angle will of course be really difficult for us.I'll come back to you when I have more on our response."In the end, the new restrictions did not apply to British citizens with dual citizenship, but officials were keen not to be caught out again by the actions of President Trump.Image copyright Reuters On 30 January, Kara Owen, director of the Americas desk at the Foreign Office sent an email around the Foreign Office, including to the deputy British ambassador to the US Patrick Davies, asking for a new warning system to be set up to look at the impact of Mr Trump's executive orders on British interests."Many of these orders will no doubt be issued just as London is going to sleep," she said."I would like us to establish a system for assessing impact of the orders on U.K. interests (if any) and offering quick advice on what to do about it to the right readership (including senior readers in FCO and Whitehall, press and private offices)."She added: "I would welcome any other predictions about EOs (executive orders) foreshadowed during the campaign and likely to touch on our interests - he is doing a lot of what he said he would."The documents also reveal the EU contacted the Foreign Office to check whether Britain was attempting to get a special deal for its citizens in the aftermath of Mr Trump's travel ban - and concerns about the impact on national security.In one exchange, the Home Office's international director, Richard Clarke, discusses "potential UK activism/adverse reaction" in response to the travel ban, with officials at the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism.Also released was a heavily redacted analysis of the first three weeks of the Trump presidency, including a section entitled "Video killed the radio star".The documents reveal civil servants expected a change in Theresa May's friendly outlook towards the US President should British citizens be banned from entering the United States."You might have seen that the PM didn't engage on the question on Trump's immigration policy saying they were for the US," said one official, referring to Mrs May's press conference in Turkey on 28 January, when she was questioned about the policy."Presumably that changes if Brits (ie dual nationals) are blocked from entering the US?," replied another official.The document warned that questions on whether the government explicitly supported US immigration policy were a "bear trap".The emails also show Foreign Office also struggled with the weight of communications from MPs in the aftermath of the US President's executive order.One official complained of "yet another UQ (Urgent Question to be answered in Parliament)", in reference to a question put by former SNP MP Stuart Donaldson requesting a statement on the impact on the ban on British citizens.In addition, the emails revealed which journalists and public figures the FCO paid particular attention to.Tweets from The Guardian's Anushka Asthana and Alan Travis, Steve Hawkes of The Sun and Jack Blanchard, then of The Mirror, were circulated with Foreign Office updates.
Tory MP Davies leaves Brexit 'belly-aching' seminar:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davies says there is a "wider discussion" to be had about universities A Welsh Tory MP left a university seminar because he "wasn't going to be lectured on freedom of speech", having raised concerns about universities "belly-aching over Brexit."David Davies defended Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris, who asked universities for names of professors teaching Brexit courses and the content of lectures.Mr Davies said later Mr Heaton-Harris "should have gone a lot further".The Westminster seminar was on a survey on public views concerning Brexit.The event was organised by Cardiff University.On Tuesday, it emerged Mr Heaton-Harris wrote to universities asking for the names of professors "involved in the teaching of European affairs, with particular reference to Brexit" and for a "copy of the syllabus".Of the eight universities in Wales, Cardiff, Bangor and Glyndwr confirmed that they were sent the letters whilst Aberystwyth said they had no record of having receiving it.The remaining four universities have yet to respond.In a tweet, Mr Heaton-Harris, a Eurosceptic MP and Conservative government whip, said: "To be absolutely clear, I believe in free speech in our universities and in having an open and vigorous debate on Brexit."Downing Street said Mr Heaton-Harris had written to universities in his capacity as MP for Daventry and not as a representative of government.Image copyright Conservative Party Image caption Chris Heaton-Harris says he believes in "open" debate on Brexit The issue was raised with Cardiff University's Vice-Chancellor, Colin Riordan, at the breakfast seminar meeting on Thursday morning.Monmouth MP Mr Davies, sat at the front, intervened in what one described as a "pretty polite exchange of views" but others said was a "rant".The Conservative MP defended his colleague's actions and argued that universities "shouldn't be promoting anti-Brexit views because they're publicly funded".After a comment from former Labour Leader Lord Kinnock, David Davies left, saying he had "had enough of this".'Eating croissants' Talking to BBC Wales after the event, Mr Davies said he "wasn't going to spend my morning with Lord Kinnock or being lectured by him on freedom of speech.""Free speech is an issue that universities need to address and it's absolutely time that they realised that they are publicly-funded organisations that shouldn't waste their time belly-aching about Brexit."They haven't got the time to sit there drinking coffee and eating croissants and lecturing people in Parliament about anti-Brexit bias," he added.A Labour MP present at the event said Mr Davies' departure "felt very staged", whilst another accused the Monmouth MP of having "turned up deliberately to make a fuss".Speaking in the Senedd on Tuesday, First Minister Carwyn Jones said Chris Heaton-Harris' letter was "as authoritarian a request as could possibly be made.""I suspect this gentleman would have a lot to teach Stalin," he added.
Legal challenge to DUP-Tory deal fails in High Court:::::Image copyright Press Eye Image caption Ciaran McClean stood unsuccessfully for the Green Party in West Tyrone in the general election A legal challenge against the deal between the Democratic Unionist Party and the Conservatives has failed at the High Court in London.The DUP agreed to support Theresa May's government in return for 1bn for Northern Ireland over five years.Ciaran McClean, a Green Party member, argued the pact breached the Anti Bribery Act 2010.Lord Justice Sales said the grounds relied on by Mr McClean were not "properly arguable in a court of law".Mr McClean launched a crowdfunding campaign to finance the case, which he brought independently of political parties, in July.Lord Justice Sales and Mr Justice Lewis heard the application for a judicial review on Thursday.Dominic Chambers QC, acting for Mr McClean, told the court the confidence and supply agreement was unlawful as it "purchased" the political support of the DUP.He said it was "unlawful because it makes provision for the expenditure of public funds for party political advantage".The application was contested by both the First Secretary of State, Damian Green, and the Attorney General.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Under the deal, the DUP guarantees its 10 MPs will back the government on legislation relating to Brexit and national security In a written submission to the court, James Eadie QC for the government argued that the criminal law of bribery does not apply to a confidence and supply agreement between political parties."The allegation that the agreement entails public expenditure which is unlawful is misconceived because the expenditure contemplated by the agreement will have appropriate parliamentary authorisation," he wrote.After the verdict, Mr McClean told the BBC that he is considering an appeal."We put the most serious charges to any government in modern times and the consequences of that could have been the fall of the government and the government finding themselves in the dock," he said."I don't think that was ever going to happen.But I think it was still right to get this aired."His solicitor, David Greene, is a senior partner at London-based Edwin Coe solicitors, who represented hairdresser Deir Tozetti Dos Santos, one of the claimants in the successful Brexit challenge in the Supreme Court.Following the judgement, lawyers representing the government were awarded full costs.Lord Justice Scales said it was "not appropriate for the burden of costs to be borne by the taxpayer".Under the confidence and supply arrangement, the DUP guarantees that its 10 MPs will vote with the government on the Queen's Speech, the Budget, and legislation relating to Brexit and national security - while Northern Ireland will receive an extra 1bn over the next two years.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Tory-DUP deal came two weeks after June's election resulted in a hung Parliament While rival parties in Northern Ireland have largely welcomed the additional funding, concerns have been raised that the deal could undermine the peace process and devolution negotiations, with the UK government dependent on the support of the DUP.The deal was also widely criticised by opposition parties in the UK.Labour branded it "shabby and reckless", while the Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones called it a "straight bung" and said it "kills the idea of fair funding".
National Action charges: Man accused of MP murder threat:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Police said the charge against Mr Lythgoe was related to Labour MP Rosie Cooper A man arrested as part of an investigation into the far-right group, National Action, has been charged with encouragement to commit murder.The BBC understands the charge against Christopher Lythgoe, 31, from Cheshire, relates to Labour MP Rosie Cooper.He is one of six men charged with being members of the banned group.A 22-year-old man, from Lancashire, who cannot be named, has also been charged with the intention of committing acts of terrorism and "threats to kill".All six are to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.National Action became the first far-right organisation to be banned in the UK in December 2016.It means that being a member of or inviting support for the organisation is a criminal offence carrying a sentence of up to 10 years' imprisonment.Ms Cooper said: "I would like to thank everyone involved in this case, especially the counter-terrorism police, for keeping me, my staff and the public safe."There remains an ongoing criminal investigation so it would not be appropriate for me to comment further."Who are National Action?By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent National Action became the first British neo-Nazi group to be banned last December after Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was promoting violence and acts of terrorism.Members and supporters applauded the murder of Jo Cox MP by a white supremacist - and the group had carried out a series of small, but confrontational, demonstrations in towns and cities throughout England.One of its most notorious events saw masked members - many of them very young men - gathering outside York Minster to make Hitler salutes.Since it was banned, detectives have been carrying out more and more investigations into the group which, to all intents and purposes, has organised itself in a similar way to the banned al Muhajiroun network - the extremist Islamist youth movement.Both have used social media to target young people, attracting them with a simplistic us-and-them message designed to make them angry.The charges follow a number of raids across England and Wales by counter-terrorism officers as part of a national investigation into the group.The others charged with belonging to a proscribed organisation are: Garron Helm, 24, of Seaforth, Merseyside Matthew Hankinson, 23, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside Andrew Clarke, 33, of Warrington Michael Trubini, 35, of Warrington A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police said the men were charged following "co-ordinated activity" by police.
UK foreign policy 'should put values above economics':::::Image copyright HoC British values should be put above "raw economics" in foreign policy, the new chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee has said.Tory MP Tom Tugendhat said he was not opposed to selling arms to countries like Saudi Arabia but it must be done in "a rules-based system".He said Britain's reputation as a fair place to do business underpinned the UK economy and must be defended abroad.He added it would be "great" to be PM, foreign or defence secretary one day.But he told the House Magazine his focus for the next few years was to chair the foreign affairs committee.'Very blunt' Mr Tugendhat, who has served in the Territorial Army in the Middle East, said: "The fundamental underpinning of our economy is the value that people place on Britain as a fair place to do business, on British law and values being fair, whether that be accountancy, whether that be legal service, whether that be finance."Therefore, we've got to be careful when we make foreign policy that we recognise that we've got to defend those values abroad above simple raw economics in a very blunt system."Image copyright PA But he said foreign policy should not be conducted in a way "that damages our ability to promote economic growth in the UK".The interview, carried out earlier this week, was published the day after Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon suggested to MPs that criticism of Saudi Arabia in Parliament was "not helpful" as he attempted to secure a deal with the country for a second batch of Typhoon fighter jets.Asked about arms sales to Saudi Arabia in light of the country's role in the conflict in Yemen, Mr Tugendhat said, "I certainly don't think it's wrong to sell arms."But we must be realistic as to what we're doing when we do sell arms.And part of that has to be within a context of, as I say, a rules-based system."Saudi Arabia has caused some issues for us in that, and other nations have too.But it's certainly not wrong to enable countries to defend themselves."'Difficult to translate' Of Boris Johnson's performance as foreign secretary, he said: "He's certainly got a lot of passion for the United Kingdom and has a way of expressing himself which certainly carries a lot of noise."He added that "cross-cultural humour" was very hard to do as it was difficult to translate."I think there are ways of doing diplomacy.I've done it in Afghanistan, in Iraq and Saudi [Arabia] and across parts of Africa and most of the Middle East, and I just think that it's very, very hard to make humour work in international environments, which is why very few serious politicians try it."Seen as a rising star of the Conservative Party, Mr Tugendhat was elected as chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, two years after becoming MP for Tonbrige and Malling.
MP Bob Blackman defends Tapan Ghosh's appearance in Parliament:::::Image copyright Youtube Image caption Tapan Ghosh (centre) appeared at two events hosted by MP Bob Blackman (right) A Tory MP has defended his decision to host Parliamentary events attended by a controversial Hindu nationalist.Tapan Ghosh's appearance at the events has sparked criticism, with a Labour MP attacking his "abhorrent views" about Muslims and pointing to his appearance with EDL founder Tommy Robinson.Bob Blackman, who hosted the functions, told the BBC's Asian Network he had been unaware of Mr Ghosh's remarks.Mr Ghosh told Asian Network he was not Islamophobic.Mr Ghosh, the founder of Hindu Samhati, a nationalist group based in India, appeared at two Parliamentary functions last week that were hosted by Mr Blackman, who is chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group for British Hindus.'Abhorrent' Raising a point of order in House of Commons on Thursday, Labour MP Naz Shah said it was "incredible" that he had been invited to Parliament."Mr Ghosh holds abhorrent views, is on record for calling upon the United Nations to control the birth rate of Muslims, praising the genocide of Rohingya Muslims in Burma and also said Muslims should be forced to leave their religion if they come to a western country," she said."Only this Monday Mr Ghosh was pictured with UK far-right extremist leader Tommy Robinson."It seems incredible to me that any member would think it would be acceptable to host a meeting with this individual, let alone invite him to our House of Commons."Responding in the Commons, Mr Blackman said he had hosted a Diwali celebration and the launch of a report into Hindu minority rights in Bangladesh and Pakistan, which Mr Ghosh attended.He said it was only in order to present evidence to this meeting "that that individual was invited to this House" by the National Council of Hindu Temples.Pressed later on Mr Ghosh's past comments, Mr Blackman told Asian Network: "I've had a chance now to study these various tweets and they're not ones I agree with."He did not make anti-Islamic remarks at the event.I can assure you had he voiced some of these comments I would've challenged him."Free speech Mr Blackman said he did not regret sharing a platform with him, saying it was "relevant to what we were discussing".When contacted by the BBC Mr Ghosh said he was not Islamophobic.The Muslim Council of Britain said: "It is astounding that a Conservative MP seems to have welcomed to Parliament with open arms a man who trades in propagating hatred against Muslims in India."Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was at the Diwali event Mr Ghosh attended, said she "fundamentally disagrees with Mr Ghosh's views on Islam".Mr Blackman said he was a "passionate believer of free" speech.Asked whether he would share a platform with a hard-line Islamist or anti-Semite, he told Asian Network presenter Nomia Iqbal: "It's an individual choice.Extremism is never acceptable in any guise or form but the way you combat it is is to take it on directly."He added: "I represent a community where everyone is a minority and the reality is we have to bring people together and that at times means having challenging discussions."Mr Blackman said he was conscious of the fact his Harrow East constituency is made up of more than 10,000 Muslims, adding that he was working to promote a new Muslim school in the area.
UK population to pass 70m in 2029, ONS projections say:::::Image copyright Getty Images The UK's population is set to exceed 70 million before the end of the next decade, according to the Office for National Statistics.The UK population was estimated to stand at 65.6 million in 2016.The ONS projections are now for a 3.6 million, or 5.5%, increase over the 10 years to 2026, with the 70m mark being passed in the middle of 2029.This is two years later than the ONS's 2014 projection that the UK population would pass the 70m barrier in mid-2027.The reason for the change is that since the 2014 study the assumption of net migration of 185,000 a year has been cut to 165,000 a year, while the expected number of children per woman has been cut from 1.89 to 1.84 - with growth in life expectancy trimmed for men from 84.3 to 83.4 and for women from 87.1 to 86.2.Andrew Nash, of the ONS Population Projections Unit, said: "Over that period 54% of growth is projected to result directly from net international migration.The other 46% is because there will be more births than deaths."Over the decade from mid-2016 projected growth in England's population is put at 5.9%, for Northern Ireland the figure is 4.2% while for Scotland and Wales the percentages are 3.2% and 3.1% respectively.The figures, which do not take into account any Brexit impact, puts projected UK population growth between 2015 and 2040 at 16%, compared with 10% growth for France and 4% for Germany, while Italy's population is projected to see a slight decline.The study also says that the numbers of people aged 85 and over with have doubled to from 1.6m in 2016 to 3.2m in 2041.Analysis, by BBC Home Affairs Editor Mark Easton The Brexit vote has made calculating the growth of the UK's population much more difficult.The level of net migration and, indeed, the potential emigration of young, fertile residents are dependent on the kind of post-Brexit agreement that emerges.Nevertheless, the Office for National Statistics has had a stab at it and concluded that the UK population will not grow as fast as previously thought.In 25 years' time, it believes there will be close to 73m people in the UK - some 2m fewer than they had thought before the EU referendum.Net migration will be lower and so will the fertility rate with fewer young foreign-born women coming to live in the UK.They also expect a slower rate of increased life expectancy than previously assumed.The impact of Brexit is dependent on the kind of deal that emerges and what happens to the UK economy as a result.Those factors will affect the numbers who wish to come and wish to leave.The ONS thinks, annually over the next 25 years, net migration will fall by about 20,000 compared with previous forecasts.But the uncertain nature of our politics makes these kind of projections fraught - particularly for those who use the data to make decisions about building roads and houses and transport infrastructure.
MP Darren Jones sports painted nails in slavery awareness stunt:::::Image copyright HoC A Labour MP has spoken with painted nails in the Commons to raise awareness of modern slavery in nail bars.Darren Jones, MP for Bristol North West, defended Avon and Somerset police officers who had done the same.He said the force had faced a backlash from some newspapers.The force's #LetsNailIt hashtag on social media used a series of tweets of male and female officers with painted nails to highlight the issue of modern day slavery.Mr Jones said car washes and nail bars were a common location for modern slavery.Image copyright Avon and Somerset Police Image caption Avon and Somerset Police posted pictures of officers with painted nails on social media to highlight the issue of modern day slavery "I share other members' concerns that the papers have reported a backlash against Avon and Somerset Constabulary for wanting to raise this issue on social media in a way that communicates to people in their daily lives to keep an eye out for where they see these things happening," he said.In July this year the force raided a nail bar in Mr Jones's constituency and arrested four people for trafficking and slavery offences, he said.Mr Jones said he could be the first male MP to have sported painted nails in the Commons.He added: "It's not also an endorsement for Eddie Izzard for the Labour NEC."
David Davis warned over Brexit vote promise for MPs:::::The government is under pressure from rebel Tory MPs and Labour to guarantee a Commons vote on Brexit before the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.David Davis denied "fudging" the commitment by suggesting on Wednesday such a vote could happen after that date if talks go to the wire.He said he "fully expects" MPs to get a "meaningful" vote in time.But ex-minister Nicky Morgan told him Tory rebels were "deadly serious" about getting the promise into law.It comes as the government announced that MPs would begin detailed scrutiny of the EU Withdrawal Bill on 14 and 15 November.Former education secretary Ms Morgan said the government could put the issue of a vote "beyond doubt" by backing an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which was tabled by former attorney general Dominic Grieve.Citing reports that Mr Davis did not think rebel Tories were serious about the amendment, she said: "Can I tell him we are deadly serious, and it would be better for the government to adopt a concession strategy on having a withdrawal agreement secured by statute sooner rather than later for all concerned."In reply, the Brexit secretary said: "I won't pre-empt the discussions in the bill, but those reports are not true."'Cast-iron guarantee' For Labour, Keir Starmer said: "More than three months after the repeal bill was first published, the government has finally found the courage to bring it back to Parliament for line-by-line scrutiny and debate.Whether it will survive scrutiny remains to be seen."He added: "Ministers must listen to the sensible demands made by Labour and some of their own MPs about what changes need to be made to the bill."David Davis was summoned to the Commons on Thursday morning to explain comments to the Brexit committee on Wednesday, which suggested the vote could take place after March 2019.At PMQs later on the same day Theresa May had to reassure MPs there would be a vote.Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of saying "one thing one day, another thing the next", which he said was "not good enough".He called for a "cast-iron guarantee" that MPs would get a vote.Mr Davis denied any government commitments had been undermined by his comments, which he said had been misinterpreted.He said he expected a "proper and meaningful" vote on any Brexit deal "at the right time".'Take time' But he added: "Of course this vote cannot happen until there is a deal to vote upon, but we are working to reach an agreement on a final deal in good time before we leave the European Union in March 2019."Clearly we cannot say for certain at this stage when this will be agreed, but as (EU chief negotiator) Michel Barnier said, he hopes to get a draft deal agreed by October 2018 - and that's our aim as well."So we fully expect there will be a vote in the UK Parliament on this before the vote in the European Parliament, and before we leave the European Union."He also insisted the choice for MPs would be "meaningful - whether to accept that deal, or to move ahead without a deal".Referring to his appearance before the Commons Brexit Committee, Mr Davis said the government recognised the ratification of the Brexit agreement "will take time and could run into the implementation period".He denied claims he had "fudged" the government's commitment to a vote before Brexit but added that he was not in control of the timetable of Britain's exit from the EU because "it's a negotiation".

Brexit: Is a last-minute deal possible?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davis tells MPs Parliament's vote on a Brexit deal may come after March 2019.The Brexit Secretary, David Davis, has suggested that Parliament might not get a vote on a Brexit deal until after March 2019.It's prompted criticism from some MPs, who are worried their votes will be meaningless because by that point, the UK will have already left the EU.Also significant is Mr Davis' claim that the European Parliament might have to wait to have its say too.According to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which the UK triggered seven months ago, the withdrawal agreement must be passed by a majority of members of the European Parliament.Even if a deal was done at "the 11th hour" as Mr Davis suggested when giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee, it would be too late for MEPs to debate it and vote it through.So the upshot of a last-minute deal could be no deal at all.The Brexit department later clarified that Mr Davis was talking about "hypothetical scenarios" and ministers are working to reach an agreement in "good time" before March 2019.It's not entirely clear what "deal" Mr Davis was referring to.The European Union has broken down the negotiations into two parts.The first focuses on the issues associated with withdrawal, such as the rights of EU citizens, the Northern Irish border and the UK's financial obligations.The second covers what our future relationship might look like, including areas such as trade, scientific research and consumer rights.The British government says it's not possible to separate the two parts, because in many respects, they're intrinsically linked.If the "deal" that Mr Davis was talking about this morning encompasses both, it must be ratified on or before 29 March 2019, which means an agreement would need to be reached in time for that.The future relationship part could be ratified after the deadline, but only if part one is rubber-stamped before the deadline.The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is hopeful of reaching a withdrawal agreement by autumn 2018 and the Brexit department said that was their aim as well.Technically it is possible to extend the Article 50 period, currently fixed at two years, if there's unanimous agreement from the 27 remaining member states.But that option would be a hard sell.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
The Houses of Parliament - a building catastrophe?:::::Image copyright Getty Images This autumn, MPs are due to debate whether they will have to leave the Houses of Parliament while it undergoes essential repairs.But could they be forced out of their iconic building by a potentially messy blockage?Turn on a gas alarm as a precaution, open a substantial iron gate and head down into a basement.The hum of machinery grows louder - and the smell grows stronger.Impressive but distinctly old-fashioned cylinders and pumps appear.An engineer accompanying me explains that these are "sewage ejectors", dating from 1888.An enterprising Victorian technology museum, you might be assuming, with working exhibits?But this is in fact the basement of the Palace of Westminster.And these Victorian antiques are all that stand between Parliament and an almighty stink.The engineer is Andrew Piper, design director for Parliament's Restoration and Renewal programme, which is planning a project lasting several years and will cost billions of pounds.Image copyright CIBSE Heritage Group Collection Image caption The original steam engine, once used to power the sewage ejectors, is still in working order He explains that "everything from the toilets, the rainwater outlets - it all comes down to this point" - before being ejected out to the main London drain.The ejectors were installed to stop London's sewage invading the buildings after heavy rainfall.And there they still are, working away, almost 130 years later.But, adds Mr Piper "we can't rely on these sorts of systems for much longer".So what happens if they suddenly fail?"If you can't use the toilets any more a building quickly becomes unusable.The end result would be potentially shutting the building down."The sewage system is just one of several growing hazards.Mr Piper and his basement maintenance team struggle with constant fire dangers.There are modern electrical cables crammed next to older asbestos-covered steam pipes.And a system of vents that could carry smoke or flames swiftly through the building.Image copyright UK Parliament Image caption Flooding in the basement of the Palace of Westminster in June 2017 The building that's meant to represent the British constitution is a kind of national monument to make do and mend, with lots of bits from different eras bolted on to each other and much left unwritten - like where all these cables and vents end up, and what they actually do.The Palace of Westminster, one of the best known buildings in the world, is in a truly terrible state.Some have known this for years.A joint committee, including MPs and peers, published a report last year which warned that the palace "faces an impending crisis which we cannot responsibly ignore"."There is a substantial and growing risk of either a single, catastrophic event, such as a major fire, or a succession of incremental failures in essential systems."Home from home So how has this happened?And what does the state of Parliament say about the state of our politics?Firstly, there's the belief that the building represents political stability.Maintenance has long been limited by MPs' insistence that nothing must stop them from sitting there.So any repairs have been crammed into recess times.And there's another layer to this psychological attachment, says Dr Caroline Shenton, historian and former parliamentary archivist.The palace, with its bars and restaurants, gym and post offices, becomes a kind of home from home for MPs and peers, giving a "daily sense of continuity and security".Add to that anxiety - in this increasingly angry, anti-politics era - about what public opinion and headline writers will say as the multi-billion cost of renewal emerges.Sheffield University's Prof Matthew Flinders, chair of the Political Studies Association of the United Kingdom, who has closely followed the Restoration and Renewal programme, says this failure to take a decision is a classic example of what political scientists call "elite blockage".The palace, he says, "casts a spell" on many who use it.It represents a kind of politics with "low expectations of public engagement" which "locks in by its design not only a two-party system but also a very masculine, adversarial kind of politics".Those who benefit leave it to others to take tough unpopular decisions in the future.Meanwhile "the building can't take it any more - we've reached a crunch point."Image copyright uk parliament Image caption The Palace of Westminster's cast iron roofs are 160 years old He would like the current problems to be seen as an opportunity - to open up the building and change the way we do politics.Public access could be greatly improved, especially for disabled people who currently struggle to enter.Others say a renovated palace would prove a huge asset as Brexit Britain tries to reinforce its international reputation.MPs are due to debate the latest restoration and renewal plan at some point this autumn.But those who have watched years of delay and disagreement don't expect swift action.So will it take a catastrophe - like the 1834 fire which destroyed the palace's predecessor - to force a change?"It's starting to look like that," says Dr Shenton.It might be that "the whole place just grinds to a halt"."In terms of British pride," warns Prof Flinders, "if we wait for a catastrophe to close down Parliament, it's going to be an absolute disaster."And as for the failure of those sewage ejectors - that would create an "elite blockage" like no other.Chris Bowlby presents Parliament - A Building Catastrophe?on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 23 October 2017 at 20:30 BST.You will be able to listen via the Radio 4 programme website or download the programme podcast.
Brexit: Why a transition period may not buy more time for talks:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davis updates Parliament on Brexit talks So the focus of the Brexit talks has shifted slightly as a result of the EU leaders' summit in Brussels.There is still plenty of tough bargaining ahead in the next few weeks, especially on the question of money.But there is also going to be more and more talk about preparing for a transition period - for what happens immediately after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.Plenty of people see transition as a way to buy a little more time to sort things out - to finalise negotiations on a future trade deal.But the UK government prefers to calls the transition phase a "period of implementation".It is not entirely clear what would be implemented.But the Brexit Secretary David Davis warned this week that without a final deal on a future partnership with the EU - at least in principle - the government would not want to trigger any kind of transition at all.Does it mean the two sides view the prospects for transition very differently?The EU27 - the other member states without the UK - have now agreed to start working on new guidelines for their negotiators.And both the EU and Theresa May (in her Florence speech) have said that any transition/implementation period would take place under "the existing structure of EU rules and regulations".There will be plenty of technical challenges: what happens, for example, to the UK's role in EU trade agreements with third countries?Those third countries might have their own opinions about that.But there is also the question of what happens during a transition period itself?It could mean roughly two more years to continue negotiations on the details of a future partnership with the EU on trade, security and a host of other issues.The Confederation of British Industry, for example, argues that in order to avoid a "cliff-edge" Brexit, negotiations on a trading agreement should continue during a transition.But UK government policy is rather different.It still argues that a deal on our "final relationship" with the rest of the EU can be completed before the UK leaves the EU at the end of March 2019.Most observers are convinced that, for practical reasons, that will not be possible - there is simply too much to do.Upping the ante But Mr Davis insisted in the House of Commons this week that if the broad outlines of a permanent deal are not in place when the UK leaves, a transition period will not be triggered.Asked by Conservative MP Rishi Sunak for reassurance that "what is meant to be a transitory state of affairs does not become a permanent bridge to nowhere", Mr Davis said: "We will try to get the nature of the implementation phase agreed as soon as possible, so that businesses can take that into account."He added: "But he's right that such a transition phase would only be triggered once we've completed the deal itself, we cannot carry on negotiating through that - our negotiating position during the transition phase would not be very strong."In other words, Mr Davis is saying - in stronger language than the government appears to have used before - that if there is no final deal by March 2019, at least in principle, then the UK would not want to trigger a transition period.The words "at least in principle" contain a fair amount of wiggle room.And the EU itself would be delighted if the outlines of a future agreement could be agreed so quickly.It says only that a withdrawal agreement (as opposed to a future trade agreement) has to be finalised in order for there to be a transition.And Article 50 simply says the withdrawal agreement must "take account of the framework for a future relationship".But Mr Davis appears to be upping the ante."No final deal" equals "no transition" equals "hard Brexit".As a negotiating tactic, it may be designed to keep the pressure on.But it may not be what many business leaders want to hear.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: How are the talks really progressing?:::::Image copyright Press association So it's come down to money.Who would have thought it?After five rounds of negotiations on Brexit, the EU remains insistent: there will be no discussions with the UK on a transition period, or on future relations, until financial commitments have been clarified.So what exactly is it about the money that is proving so difficult to resolve?It comes down to the detail (or lack of it) contained in Theresa May's carefully crafted speech in Florence.Overall, the speech was greeted across the EU with a considerable sense of relief.It suggested that progress was at least possible at a time when some countries were beginning to fear the worst.The prime minister opened the door for the UK to contribute roughly 20bn (17.9bn) to the EU budget in 2019 and 2020, so that no-one else would be out of pocket.And - crucially - she went on to say that "the UK will honour commitments we have made during the period of our membership".But EU negotiators - under clear instructions from the member states - want to know exactly what that means in practice.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The prime minister said the UK would "honour commitments" Looming large in the background is something called the Reste Liquider (RAL) - EU money that has already been committed to projects in the long-term budget but has not yet been spent.The RAL is currently running at an eye-watering 239bn, which could mean a UK share of more than 30bn.Much of it is due to be spent on big infrastructure or development projects that have been delayed.There are also pensions and contingent liabilities, such as loans to other countries, to consider.The EU isn't asking for a figure to be agreed - but for a guarantee within the negotiating process, probably in writing, that "honouring commitments" means "all commitments."'Time pressure' The UK position, on the other hand, is that the prime minister made a substantial gesture in her Florence speech, and it is in no position to move further unless it gets something in return."They are using time pressure to get more money out of us," the Brexit Secretary David Davis told the House of Commons this week."Bluntly, that is what's going on."It sounds like deadlock, but that's not necessarily the case.Three more rounds of negotiation have been suggested between this week's summit and another one in December.The hope is that a way will be found to move forward, even if it takes a moment of crisis to get there."The EU27 don't believe the UK is too far off 'sufficient progress'," says Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at the political consultancy Eurasia Group."They want Mrs May to be able to leave Brussels with a win that will enable her to strike a deal by December."That's why both sides have said they want to accelerate the negotiating process, and prepare for discussions about the future.If the language of the current draft of the summit's conclusions doesn't change much, the EU27 will agree to begin internal discussions about a transition period and the nature of a future relationship.They won't talk directly to the UK about these issues until December at the earliest.And only then if "sufficient progress" has been made on all the "divorce" arrangements, including money.It doesn't sound like much.But it's a start, and it is seen in Brussels as a carrot for the UK negotiating team.So what might the EU be likely to decide in internal discussions over the coming weeks?For EU officials involved in the negotiating process one thing about transition is clear: the more you keep things the same, the easier it will be to agree.That's why the internal deliberations among the 27 on transition could be concluded very quickly.They will probably offer to prolong all existing EU rules and regulations (the body of law known as 'the acquis') - or, to put it another way - to extend the status quo.That means that after Brexit - for "about two years" (ie for the length of a transition period) - the UK would be outside the EU's political institutions, but inside its economic arrangements.It also means the UK would have to accept EU budget payments, EU regulations and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.To put it in the formal language of the European Council's Article 50 negotiating guidelines: "Should a time-limited prolongation of Union acquis be considered, this would require existing Union regulatory, budgetary, supervisory, judiciary and enforcement instruments and structures to apply."Difficult to stomach The details of what that means are difficult for some Brexit supporters in the UK to stomach.But the prime minister, in her Florence speech, has already accepted that the framework for any transition (she prefers to call it an implementation period) would be "the existing structure of EU rules and regulations".Problems would arise, however, if the UK tried to argue for exemptions or exceptions.Take, for example, one idea that has been floated (forgive the pun): leaving the Common Fisheries Policy at the same time as the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.That doesn't really tally with the kind of transition that EU officials have in mind.Once you start unpicking the offer, all sorts of complications begin to arise.So it's not quite take it or leave it.But it's not far off.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Unpicking the agreement, such as leaving the Common Fisheries Policy, could lead to further complications There are other potential problems with a transition period that will need to be resolved.What, for example, does it mean for trade agreements with third countries, when it makes a difference whether products (or parts of products) are manufactured in the single market or not?But agreeing upon the terms of a transition will be much easier for the EU27 than agreeing on the outline of a final deal - on everything from trade to security.The 27 member states are a little more nervous about those discussions because differences of opinion are bound to emerge between them.Many countries have obviously been thinking hard about this already.One internal German government paper has been reported here.Finding a compromise But there is another issue that overshadows debate about Brexit in capitals across the EU - what exactly is it that the UK wants?Every change of emphasis in London adds to the confusion.As Finland's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Samuli Virtanen, put it this week: "It seems that at the moment the EU 27 is more unanimous than the UK 1.And that is one of the main problems here."But it all rests on finding a compromise on money.And that really has to happen before the end of this year.Otherwise time is going to start running out.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: How do other EU countries see a 'no deal'?:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that "concrete progress" was being made in talks so far European Union leaders are meeting in Brussels and at the top of their agenda is a review of the Brexit negotiations.They are demanding better clarifications from the UK over its financial commitments, and the impasse has led to a lot of talk of a "no deal" Brexit.We ask journalists covering the summit how their countries view the possibility of no formal agreement between the UK and the EU.Germany: Daniel Brssler, Sddeutsche Zeitung Brussels correspondent The German thinking now is that a "no deal" scenario is not what you want - of course it would have an impact on British-German trade.But my impression is that the German government thinks that a bad deal, from the European perspective, would be even worse.They are saying we need a fair deal.But if there is no deal we will survive it, it will be tough but the EU will survive it - and Germany has a lot of trade with the rest of Europe.So far the talks are not seen in Germany as having broken down - people think there is still time to make a deal, that enough progress might be made in December.But people see that there is a risk.Politicians see responsibility for this on the British side - and Brexit has already estranged us to a certain degree.There is a feeling of them and us, you can see a pretty strict mood in Berlin.People say we need a fair deal, but there is no mood to have a deal just to please the British.Denmark: Lotte Mejlhede, TV2 News correspondent I don't think any country in Europe wants a "no deal" result.Business people and politicians in Denmark are very interested in having a good future trade deal with the UK.Denmark has quite a lot of trade with the UK, and we have an issue with the fishing quotas.Some Eurosceptic politicians want to join the UK outside the EU, but in general the attitude is that we're better off staying in, and that's also because of our size - our population is 5.5 million, and it's quite hard to do big trade deals alone.When the UK leaves, the axis of the EU will be France and Germany.Now I think everybody is hoping for a deal.But we know businesses are also preparing for the worst-case scenario.Poland: Maciej Sokolowski, TVN24 News correspondent People in Poland were just waiting for the announcement on Wednesday by the British Prime Minister [Theresa May] that everyone living in the UK can stay there with the same rights as today.That's the most important thing for Poles living in the UK, the guarantee that they can stay.The change of tone was really important.There were rumours like: "Do we have to go back to Poland?"and "Do we have to leave our jobs now?"Brexit isn't the main topic now in Poland.Of course there's about a million Polish people in the UK, but Poles are not talking much about the money, or the Ireland issue.On freedom of movement - the UK isn't in the Schengen area, so it shouldn't be much worse after Brexit.But no-one knows now what no deal really means.We still see the UK as our biggest friend in the EU, with Hungary.So after Brexit it will be a political problem for Poland, being without our main friend in the EU.Spain: Adolfo Lorente, El Correo correspondent Ordinary people don't understand what has happened with the UK.The situation is very complicated.We read that the UK is very angry with the EU, that it doesn't want to pay the bill.People don't understand the economic impact, but it's very important for Spain - we export fruit, wine.Many Spanish people go to Britain to learn English or work.Now there is a lot of doubt - people ask "What is happening with Brexit?"and "What about exports and passports?"It's like the situation with Catalonia - Spanish people feel that they don't want to be with us, they want to be separate.But we think that being together, united, is better.Gibraltar is also a big issue for us.Patriotism in Spain is very high now.Theresa May's support for Spain over Catalonia in exchange for [Spanish PM] Mariano Rajoy's support over Brexit is a real possibility.Some diplomats here in Brussels smile and say it's possible.
London's role in the Russian Revolution:::::Image caption The Islington pub where Bolsheviks and Mensheviks argued fiercely during the 1903 party congress In August 1903, a small band of dedicated but argumentative political activists held a fractious conference in London.It consisted of Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky and about 50 other committed agitators who wanted to overthrow the autocratic rule of the Russian Tsar.Their quarrels might have seemed minor at the time, but they have rippled out across history.This was when the Russian revolutionary movement divided into the two rival factions of Bolsheviks and Mensheviks.And a key vote happened in a pub in Islington.The Bolsheviks, described as the 'hards' and led by Lenin, wanted a tightly centralised and disciplined political party; the Mensheviks or 'softs' favoured a looser, broader-based alliance with sympathetic forces.Over the following years, as issues and affiliations shifted, their differences fluctuated but were to become deeper.Fourteen years later, in the second (October) revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks took power, sidelining and defeating the Mensheviks, and went on to form the Soviet Union.At the 1903 congress in London, where the split emerged, Lenin's faction narrowly lost the vote on the nature of party membership.But then seven anti-Lenin delegates walked out over other disagreements, and with his opponents depleted, his side then won a crucial vote on the editorial board for the party's journal.Pub venues This outcome enabled Lenin to call his group the Bolsheviks, meaning 'majority' in Russian, while his rivals became the Mensheviks or 'minority'.The bitter dispute prompted uproar in the meeting.According to Richard Mullin, a researcher into early Russian Marxism, Lenin's notes indicate that the tumultuous session took place in the Three Johns pub in Islington.Image caption The Whitechapel building where Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky and others arrived for the 1907 congress "The 1903 London congress is regarded as decisive in the development of Bolshevism - it's hugely significant", says Neil Faulkner, author of A People's History of the Russian Revolution.But of course its significance is seen differently according to different political viewpoints."Most people on the revolutionary left would say this is the decisive break between revolution and reform," explains Dr Faulkner."A lot of liberal commentators would see it as the tiny seed from which ultimately grows the gulags and the labour camps of the 1930s."To avoid being monitored during their conference, the Russians moved from venue to venue over a fortnight, often using meeting rooms in pubs recommended by friendly British trade unionists.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Leon Trotsky met Lenin for the first time in London The first session in London occurred in a club in Charlotte Street in central London.Otherwise most of these locations are unknown today.The 1903 congress had actually started in Brussels, but after harassment from the Belgian police it moved to London.The British authorities showed more acceptance of exiled Russian revolutionary activities than did many other European countries.This comparative tolerance meant that some other key events in the history of the Russian revolutionary movement also happened in Britain.The 1907 party congress moved to London after being banned in Denmark, Sweden and Norway.This was a much bigger affair of more than 300 delegates, following an outbreak of major social unrest against the Tsar in Russia in 1905.The congress took place in the Brotherhood Church in Hackney, which has since been knocked down and replaced by a housing development.Those present included almost all the future leaders of the Bolshevik revolution, including Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin (a minor figure at the time), Zinoviev, Kamenev and Litvinov, as well as the prominent Russian writer Maxim Gorky.This was the last full congress of the party until after the revolution.Image caption Lenin briefly lived in Tavistock Place in Bloomsbury, central London in 1908 The participants first registered for the conference at a building in Fulbourne Street, Whitechapel, which still stands today.At the time it was a Jewish socialist club.Stalin and Maxim Litvinov (who later became Soviet foreign minister) stayed in a doss house nearby in Fieldgate Street, which has since been converted into a somewhat more salubrious block of flats.The conference saw further disputes between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks.One issue for discussion was whether to approve the use of bank robberies to help fund revolutionary activities.Most delegates could only afford the trip back to Russia when the impoverished party secured a loan from an eccentric soap manufacturing London businessman who was inspired by watching conference proceedings.A few years earlier Lenin had spent 12 months in London, in 1902-3.He mainly divided his time between researching and writing at the British Museum reading room, and editing a revolutionary journal, Iskra ("The Spark").'Lenin room' In the reading room he studied works on economics and on the Russian peasantry.Lenin was able to obtain books which would have been confiscated in Russia, and was rather impressed by the British state's commitment to the library, telling a friend: "The British bourgeoisie do not spare any money as far as this institution is concerned, and that is as it should be."On his various visits to London, Lenin generally stayed around the Bloomsbury area, so that he had easy access to the museum.In 1902 Iskra was produced in London and smuggled across Europe into Russia.Lenin was provided with an office and printing facilities by a supportive left-wing publishing company.Image caption The 'Lenin room' in the Marx Memorial Library This building is now the Marx Memorial Library in Clerkenwell.They have preserved what they call 'the Lenin room' with busts of him, old editions of the journal, and copies of Lenin's voluminous collected works.A map on the wall outside shows the smuggling routes used.For Lenin, the journal was crucial both for building up a network of revolutionary activists and also for spreading the political analysis he favoured.It was in London, in October 1902, that Lenin and Trotsky met for the first time.The pair discussed the political circumstances of Russia, but Lenin also showed Trotsky the sights of London.When they went past the Houses of Parliament, Lenin said to his companion "that is their famous Westminster".Trotsky later wrote it was obvious that by "their", Lenin didn't mean it was the British parliament, he meant it was the ruling class's parliament.Yet it was that parliament, and the system it represented, which gave Lenin, Trotsky and their comrades the political freedom to pursue their goals.Martin Rosenbaum is the presenter of The British Road to Bolshevism on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 on Monday, 16 October 2017.You can follow Martin Rosenbaum on Twitter as @rosenbaum6
Fires, floods and mice: What it's like to work in a crumbling Parliament:::::Image copyright Houses of Parliament The Palace of Westminster's famous towers, gilt and gargoyles exude grandeur.But descending into the basement which runs underneath the Houses of Parliament inspires a different kind of awe - alarm and anxiety.To go on a tour of the cavernous corridors below the building is to enter a seemingly never-ending network of claustrophobic passageways lined with huge tangles of protruding wires and pipes, taped up here and there, leaking, hot to the touch.Faults go unmended because the pipes are so entwined they cannot be safely dismantled, and boiling steam rushes through ancient plumbing all day and night because engineers are afraid if they switched it off they would not be able to get it back on again.The overall impression is of a temporary fix ready to give way to flood or fire at any moment.The team charged with keeping the whole thing ticking over says the basement gives the clearest image of how precarious the situation is.But increasingly the sticking plasters fall off and the failing fabric of the building gives way, making it difficult for the people who work there to do their jobs.What's it like inside Parliament?One assistant to a Conservative MP told the BBC that all the staff in her office on the lower-ground floor of the Palace had to relocate twice while asbestos was removed, and again after a pipe burst in the corridor.On one occasion, she was working in her office when a light fitting fell from the ceiling on to her desk.Image copyright Anonymous Image caption Staff have had to move offices repeatedly due to asbestos "They've taken the approach of just putting plasters on problems rather than overhauling it," she says, "so overall it's just a bit dodgy.""The walkway to the car park is usually so flooded underneath that the floor panels bounce around and your shoes get soaked."A Labour researcher recalled an occasion a few years ago when the toilets above Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw's office "leaked through and dripped onto papers, leaving horrid smells".The sight of mice running around is so commonplace that several parliamentary workers only mentioned it in passing, saying, "oh yeah, we've got loads" or "the place is riddled with them".A parliamentary spokesman said: "Providing a physical working environment that is as safe as we can possibly make it is an absolute priority."Image copyright Houses of Parliament Image caption Overloaded and unsafe wiring carries the constant risk of fire The Labour MP Meg Hillier has investigated options for the restoration of Parliament as chair of the Public Accounts Committee, but also has personal experience of doing battle with the dilapidated surroundings.She told the BBC of the "hole in the carpet which you have to remember where it is otherwise your foot goes through it".She added: "The plugs in my office buzz and spark - I take extra care to switch them all off before I leave because I'm terrified of a fire starting in there."The head of engineering on the estate, Andy Piper, says that if a fire were to start everyone could be evacuated, but at present he is not confident the building could be saved as it would not be safe for firefighters to enter.Warnings from history It's estimated that 60 small fires have started on the estate over the past 10 years, and 24 fire inspectors patrol the grounds on rotation.Caroline Shenton, author of several books on the history of the building, points out that concerns raised by MPs and architects in the 1830s about the condition of the accommodation went unanswered.Image copyright Hulton Archive/Getty Images Image caption Historians see parallels with the warnings that preceded the 1834 fire In 1834, a massive fire destroyed both Houses of Parliament and other buildings on the site."I do see a parallel because there had been years of attempts to change the accommodation, and the squabbles were exactly the same - over symbolism and expense," she says.Alexandra Meakin, a former clerk in Parliament and research associate at the University of Sheffield, summarises the situation as "desperate".She points out that most of the electricity and plumbing was originally put in after World War II and went out of date in the 1960s and 70s.Why has nothing happened?It's now been over a year since a specially convened committee recommended a complete relocation of all staff from the Palace of Westminster to allow major restoration works to take place.Image copyright Houses of Parliament Image caption Buckets catch leaks in the peers' Not Content lobby "Major" does not do justice to the scale of the programme - the head engineer at Parliament told the BBC there wasn't any comparable project in the UK."People liken it to restoring a cathedral or a stately home, but that doesn't come close - and those places would not have hundreds of people working there, as well as being the seat of government."Even if the government were to give the green light tomorrow, it would take several years just to move people out and get reconstruction started.So why wait?There are some who believe it's essential for MPs to remain in place at all costs, and would prefer repairs to take place around them.As Conservative Sir Edward Leigh put it earlier this year: "This is not an office block.If it were I would agree we should move out, but it is not."It is the centre of the nation and the nation should keep its debating chamber in this building."Image copyright PA Image caption Can the government find time to restore Parliament while it debates Brexit?Others are of the view that there are better uses for 3.6bn - especially with the social housing shortage in the spotlight.Another Conservative MP, Shailesh Vara, summarised it thus: "When we are writing to our constituents and saying that they cannot have an additional few pounds for whatever they are seeking money for, do we really want to go to the public and say that, nevertheless, we want to spend billions of pounds on our place of work?"Meg Hillier doesn't buy this argument, reasoning: "The public aren't going to have much confidence in us if we can't keep our own house from falling down."What next?From a procedural perspective, a motion approving the restoration has to be brought forward and passed in government time.There has been speculation ministers are shying away from bringing it forward as they face the not-insignificant task of legislating for Brexit.Former Parliamentary clerk Alexandra Meakin says: "Given the cost of the programme, and the fear of media hostility - particularly in the wake of the Big Ben furore - there is very little incentive for the government to hold the debate."A spokesman for the leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom denied this, telling the BBC: "Discussions are ongoing within Parliament and efforts to arrive at a consensus continue."As Parliament resumes after recess, this could be the session in which MPs finally take action.But in the meantime, as one member of House services put it: "We are prisoners of the building's historic and iconic significance."
Brexit: What would 'no deal' look like?:::::Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption UK Brexit Secretary David Davis and Chief EU Negotiator Michel Barnier say they both want a deal There's a lot of discussion at the moment about a 'no deal' Brexit.What does that actually mean?It seems to mean slightly different things to different people.But in the current context it basically means that there would be no formal agreement reached during the negotiations between the UK and the EU, which are taking place under the terms of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.These are the negotiations that are led by David Davis for the UK and Michel Barnier for the EU - the fifth round of talks is being held in Brussels this week.Even if there is no deal under Article 50, there would still have to be some kind of formal relationship between the UK and the EU in the long term - for trade, security and every other aspect of bilateral ties.But if the Article 50 process fails there is very little time to work on alternative strategies before Brexit in March 2019.When would we know if there was going to be a 'no deal' Brexit?This is an important question because the timing is critical.One scenario, being pushed by some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs, is that if the current negotiations make no progress - and the EU refuses to move on to talk about a future trade deal - the UK should announce that it will pursue a 'no deal' Brexit instead.Leave supporters believe that would free the UK from all EU structures in one fell swoop.If such a decision were to be made in, say, March 2018 there would still be a year before the UK is due to leave the EU.That's very little time to prepare for such a massive change, but it would be better than nothing.A more worrying scenario for many business leaders, and millions of citizens who are caught up in the Brexit process, is that something could go wrong at the very last minute - perhaps a deal that has been tentatively agreed but is subsequently rejected by one side or the other.Then the UK could crash out of the EU with neither side fully prepared for the consequences.This is the 'cliff edge' that gives many people in business and politics sleepless nights - a chaotic Brexit that would benefit no one.Are preparations for 'no deal' already taking place?Yes they are - on both sides of the Channel.The UK government has been careful to say that it is not seeking a 'no deal' outcome, but that it has to be prepared for all eventualities.The Prime Minister has tried to move away from an emphasis on her initial message that "no deal is better than a bad deal" - but when pushed she continues to defend that stance.So there is a combination here of prudent planning behind the scenes, and public statements which aim to have an impact on the negotiations - trying to hurry things up by warning of possible alternatives.For the EU, the President of the European Council Donald Tusk has been very clear, arguing that no deal would be the worst deal of all."A no-deal scenario would be bad for everyone," he said earlier this year, "but above all for the UK."Contingency planning is also happening elsewhere in the EU, though - within both governments and the business community.The Federation of German Industries (BDI) said last week that it was setting up a task force of major companies to make provisions for the "serious case of a very hard exit."Anything else, it said, would be nave.What would 'no deal' mean in practice?If the two-year Article 50 process came to an end with no agreement, the UK would leave the EU on 29 March 2019 with no deal in place.Again, much would then depend on how long both sides have had to prepare for this.The consequences of 'no deal' would affect almost every aspect of life, and it is impossible to say exactly how events would unfold.But here are a few examples: Money: With no agreement in place, according to a House of Lords report there would be no legal obligation for the UK to make any payment as part of a financial settlement.That would leave a huge hole in the EU budget.It would save the UK money in this instance, but it would antagonise the rest of the EU and further sour relations.Legal action, possibly via the International Court of Justice in The Hague, could not be ruled out.Citizens: Without a deal or other residency rights, the entitlement of EU nationals to reside in the UK, or of UK nationals to reside elsewhere in the EU, could technically disappear overnight.In theory, they could become third country nationals, subject to domestic immigration rules.Given the fact that this would affect more than three million EU citizens in the UK, and nearly a million UK citizens in the EU, it could well be that individual EU countries would try to strike deals with the UK to guarantee citizens' rights.Common sense should prevail, but that cannot be guaranteed.Trade: With no new trade agreement with the EU, the rules of the World Trade Organisation would apply.Tariffs would be imposed on goods that the UK sends to the EU, and on goods the EU sends to the UK.It would not be the frictionless trade - certainly to begin with - that the government hopes to promote.Tariffs on many industrial products would be 2-3%, but on cars they would be 10% and on many agricultural products between 20% and 40%.The trade in services would also suffer if nothing was agreed in advance.Under a pure 'no deal' scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each individual country.The financial services industry would be particularly vulnerable, and it accounts for a significant slice of the UK economy.Again it is worth emphasising that all these restrictions would apply to EU businesses wanting to trade in the UK as well.'No deal' is not a one-way street.Without any deal, and with no transition period negotiated, the UK would be free to sign trade agreements around the world as soon as it could finalise them.How might it try to go about this?There are a few pointers here.Customs: A government White Paper on customs, published yesterday, sets out options for a 'no deal' scenario in more detail.A customs bill will make provision for the UK to establish a stand-alone customs regime from day one, applying the same duties to every country with which it has no special deal.Image copyright Getty Images Traders would need to present goods to HM Revenue and Customs "inland as much as possible" to avoid congestion at ports, and consignments would need to be pre-notified to customs authorities, to try to ensure that trade continues to flow as seamlessly as possible.The White Paper promises to minimise disruption for business and travellers - but to give some idea of the scale of the challenge, HMRC estimates that about 130,000 businesses that export to the EU would be dealing with customs for the first time.'No deal' is not the government's preferred option; and the detail in the customs paper hints at how disruptive it could be.The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would, in particular, be a huge concern, with serious ramifications for the Northern Ireland peace process.Regulations: With no deal of any kind in place, the UK would suddenly cease to be a member of dozens of regulatory agencies that govern many aspects of daily life.In time, it would need to replace all of them with agencies of its own.Thousands of new employees would need to be recruited and trained - a process which should have already started if there were to be any chance of it being completed before Brexit.EU bodies that regulate the aviation industry and the pharmaceutical industry are often cited as prime examples.One of the main concerns associated with a 'cliff edge' Brexit is that there would be no time to put new measures in place, even if plenty of contingency planning had been done.In theory - under a worst case scenario - that could mean that planes would be grounded temporarily, and drugs could not be imported.But again, the hope would be that common sense would prevail, and that some kind of interim arrangements would be made to keep things moving.It would be in the interests of neither the UK nor the EU for chaos to ensue.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
SNP conference: Is the childcare pledge 'unmatched'?:::::The claim: Nicola Sturgeon told her party conference that the Scottish government's commitment to early years education and childcare was "unmatched anywhere else in the UK" as she fleshed out plans to expand childcare provision.Reality Check verdict: Overall, Scotland's planned childcare provision would be the most generous in the UK, as it plans to offer 1,140 hours a year, regardless of whether parents are in work.However, a pilot scheme under way in Wales is better for working parents as it offers 1,440 hours a year.When Nicola Sturgeon took to the stage at the SNP conference, she said she was committed to giving children in Scotland "the best possible start in life".She confirmed that the Scottish government would increase its offer of free childcare from 16 hours a week to 30 hours for three- and four-year-olds, as well as vulnerable two-year-olds, by 2020.And she pledged to double investment in early years education and childcare, from 420m to 840m a year, by the end of the current parliament."This is a commitment unmatched anywhere else in the UK," she said."And it's the best investment we can make in Scotland's future."The first minister's office confirmed that what she meant was that the universality of care offered to children north of the border would be better than that provided in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.Reality Check has looked into the claims.Image copyright Getty Images Parents of three- and four-year-olds and vulnerable two-year-olds in Scotland are currently offered 600 hours of free childcare a year.It works out at roughly 16 hours a week over 38 weeks of the year but families can choose to spread the hours over a longer period.The Scottish government wants to increase annual childcare provision to 1,140 hours by 2020.Funded childcare is currently offered to all families in Scotland - regardless of the employment status of their parents.That is where Nicola Sturgeon's plans differ from those in practice across the rest of the UK.England All families in England are currently offered 570 free hours a year.However, where both parents (or one in single-parent families) work more than 16 hours a week, they are entitled to 1,140 hours a year.Wales In Wales, a pilot scheme is under way where working families in seven authorities are offered 1,440 hours of childcare a year.That works out at 30 hours a week over 48 weeks.As in England, it is available only to families where both parents (or one in a single-parent family) work more than 16 hours a week.Every child in Wales is eligible for 10 hours of early years education a week, from the term after their third birthday.That is incorporated into the 30 free hours in the pilot areas.Northern Ireland Families in Northern Ireland can access between 12.5 and 22.5 hours of funded pre-school education a week over 38 weeks for all three- and four-year-olds.One of the key actions of the NI executive's draft programme for government was to "extend responsive, high-quality provision in early childhood education and care" for families with young children.However, Northern Ireland has been without an executive for 10 months, following a row between the DUP and Sinn Fein.The parties are in discussions to restore the government.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Poll tracker: Concern rises over handling of Brexit talks:::::After a pause for the Labour and Conservative party conferences the next round of opinion polls is hotly anticipated.They will be closely scrutinised in an attempt to gauge whether the problems that beset Theresa May's speech have any impact on how the public perceives her.And whether any of the parties have been able to attract new supporters with their conference policy announcements.A first post-conference poll from YouGov suggests little has changed in terms of voting intention but May's personal ratings might have taken a hit.But there are several more to come over the next few days which should give us a clearer picture.Throughout the summer, the Westminster voting intention polls were remarkably stable.Labour did not quite retain the level of support they had immediately after the general election but on average they held on to a narrow lead over the Conservatives.There was no perceptible movement for the smaller parties either.On leader satisfaction, Theresa May's rating improved a little.She still has a negative rating, meaning more voters disapprove of her or think she's doing a bad job than the opposite, but it has become a bit less negative.Opinium, Ipsos MORI and BMG all show a small improvement.And on the question of who would make the best prime minister, Mrs May has restored her lead over Jeremy Corbyn.Polls from YouGov, Opinium and Ipsos Mori all put the Labour leader behind by a gap of about 7-10% - although this lead has shrunk in YouGov's post-conference poll.Brexit split Despite some over-excited headlines, there's no clear evidence of a major shift in opinion about Brexit - at least in terms of whether people think the 2016 vote to leave was right or wrong, or how they'd vote in the event of another referendum.Over a period of many months there may have been a very slight shift in favour of remain.But the overall picture is that the country is still pretty much split down the middle.Where there has been movement is in the public's perception of how the government is handling Brexit negotiations.After Theresa May's Lancaster House speech in January, YouGov and ORB reported a marked increase in the number of people who said the government was doing well.By the time the general election was called a majority of respondents approved of the government's performance on this issue.Since the election, that trend has undergone a sharp reverse.In their latest poll, YouGov found that 61% of respondents thought the government was doing badly compared to only 21% who thought it was doing well.With "don't knows" removed, ORB reported 36% of people approving and 64% disapproving.As Professor John Curtice has pointed out, May's Florence speech has not had the same effect as her earlier one.
Organ donation opt-out plan: What do people waiting for transplants think?:::::Image copyright Julie Bartlett Image caption Heart failure left Julie exhausted and grey-skinned - a pump has brought the colour back to her cheeks and given her a good quality of life At home, Julie Bartlett has her bags packed and people on standby to drive her to hospital, just in case she receives a phone call saying doctors have a heart that is a match for her.If the call comes, she'll have a couple of hours to get to Harefield Hospital in west London - she can even rely on a police escort if she gets stuck in traffic."That call could be this afternoon.It could be never," she says, but she's optimistic that government plans for a new organ donation system of presumed consent in England might boost her chances significantly.While the policy content of Theresa May's conference speech on Wednesday might have been overlooked, one of the prime minister's announcements could potentially save many lives - about three people a day in the UK die because of a lack of organ donors.The Conservatives are proposing a consultation on changing the organ donation system in England from opt-in to opt-out, meaning people's organs could be used in transplants when they died unless they expressly said otherwise.Currently, anyone who wants to donate their organs after death has to "opt in" through the donor card scheme.There are currently 6,500 people waiting for an organ donation and it is hoped the new system would see more organs becoming available.What do people waiting for an organ, and recent recipients of life-saving transplants, think of the proposed changes?Life in limbo Last Christmas, former midwife Julie Bartlett was fitted with an LVAD - a mechanical pump for the heart known as a "bridge to transplant" - but what she really needs is a new heart."I could kiss Theresa May - although she's got that bad cold," she said."It was something that I have been waiting for, for a long a time - the sooner they do it, the better."In 2009, Julie was diagnosed with heart failure and never expected to see her first grandchild or go to her daughter's wedding.After it became end-stage heart failure and she was in a hospice, the option of the LVAD was presented to her."My quality of life is good now, but I have good days and bad days," she says.The LVAD means Julie is permanently attached to two lines, has to recharge batteries overnight and can shower only weekly because of the wound."There are limits, but I'm very blessed to have one and it's better than being bedbound in a hospice," she says.However, a new heart would transform her life.It would even free her to travel abroad, as while on the waiting list she must stay in the UK.Freedom While she waits for that heart, Julie lives in limbo.She believes families should have the final decision over donation, as they do under the Welsh "soft opt-out" system - where if the individual's family objects, their organs are not removed."Families need to share what their wishes are, so they are less likely to go against the person's wishes.It's a gift," she said.Image caption Matthew's new kidneys allow him to "do what normal boys do" The Victoria Derbyshire programme spoke to 12-year old Matthew Pietrzyk, who spent eight years on dialysis after he was born with failing kidneys which had to be removed.He and his mum Nicola told the programme that the transplant has not only "given him his life back" but had also transformed those of his brothers and parents.The family can now go on holiday and make plans without the fear of emergency hospital visits.Nicola said she can finally "be a mum" instead of a nurse.Matthew believes that the new opt-out scheme will "save lives".But another patient in need of a kidney donor is not so impressed with the proposals.Kerigh Palmer, from Hertfordshire, whose first kidney transplant failed this summer, said the change would be "pointless" because, under the system the government is proposing, families could still stop donations."The majority of possible transplants are blocked by family members," she says."I don't think doctors should be saying 'these are your loved one's wishes, now what do you want to do?'""It takes away the individual's choice."Image copyright Kerigh Palmer Image caption Kerigh Palmer does not think the new opt-out scheme goes far enough Kerigh's transplant story has been long and full of hurt.After her kidneys failed in 2015, her wife, Julie, offered to donate hers.But they weren't compatible so Julie donated to another patient, and Kerigh, 40, received hers from someone else.Julie's recipient's transplant was a success.Kerigh's, though, was not - complications during surgery meant it failed at the last hurdle.As she drifted in and out of consciousness after the operation, she heard the words: "We are very sorry that it did not work.""Is it true?"she asked Julie, who was lying in a hospital bed nearby."It was devastating.That person is living with my kidney effectively.We feel pretty bitter."Image copyright Kerigh Palmer Image caption Julie, left, saved another kidney patient's life.But the kidney Kerigh received did not transplant successfully Straight after the gruelling failed operation, she was back on dialysis twice a week."I'm trying not to think about what's happened, because I will depress myself."I'm thinking ahead to Christmas, because I love Christmas.I'm not thinking 'where's my next kidney coming from?'"But she admits it would be life-changing to have a successful transplant."I wouldn't be tied to the hospital, I could work full-time without having to work from hospital, I could go abroad on holiday, eat what I like, not have to second-guess everything I do."
What does the future hold for the Greens?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Greens told to look on the bright side after disappointing election At a meat-free conference in the pretty surrounds of Harrogate, Green Party members have been digesting their disappointing election result in June, when they polled around 525,000 votes - half their previous tally - and ended up with a vote share of just 1.6%.But while the mood among the few hundred delegates gathered in Yorkshire is reflective - it's certainly not despondent.Yes, party members admit, the snap election caught them off guard and they were squeezed by Jeremy Corbyn's resurgent Labour party, whose agenda encroached on territory previously claimed by the Greens.And there has been considerable debate about whether the party was right to stand aside 22 candidates in marginal seats to give Labour or the Lib Dems a clear run at trying to beat the Tories.One of those candidates told me she thought Green voters should have been able to choose the party they wanted to, and that anyone prone to making tactical choices would have done so anyway.Another described the decision as "surrender" - seeing as there was no real payback from Labour or the Lib Dems by coming out strongly for electoral reform.There are others though (including the leadership) who believe the hung parliament was, in part, a consequence of the Greens not fielding candidates in certain seats - and that it demonstrated a spirit of co-operation among parties.But generally - across the conference, there is a sense of optimism that the Greens do still have a place and a role."Speaking truth to power" was the slogan of co-leader Jonathan Bartley's speech.He said that from opposing fracking to being anti-austerity, the Greens had consistently set the agenda and their ideas were now "common currency".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Green Party stood aside for other candidates in 22 constituencies at the general election On issues such as tackling climate change, he said the Greens' "voice of truth" had never been more important.And there was his commitment to a second Brexit referendum - on the final deal agreed with Brussels, a passionate defence of free movement of people and a claim that Britain's future was better in the EU.But the party also wanted to make a case for a new economy - a Green economy - with people and the environment at its heart.His speech on Monday was a morale-boosting address - to rally the troops and reassure them the Greens are still relevant.
David Guetta, Theresa May and the politics of the conference playlist:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption David Guetta's Titanium was often heard at the Tory conference There's not much to do while you're waiting for political leaders to start their party conference speeches - so attention often turns to their choice of warm-up music.But now the parties have packed up for another year, what can we glean from their choices - particularly the Tories' apparent fondness for French DJ David Guetta?Straight after Theresa May's eventful speech, two of pop's big names, Calvin Harris and Florence Welch, followed the time-honoured tradition of complaining about their songs being used.But it was Titanium, a 2012 chart-topper by Guetta and Australian singer Sia, that was by far the most-played track at this year's Conservative conference in Manchester.Earlier this year, Guetta told the Financial Times he was "never into politics" - and his mother was a communist who disapproved of her son "chasing materialistic dreams".But it's the track's lyrics, not its writer, that caught the pundits' attention.Coverage of Mrs May's speech was dominated by her struggle to finish it (she had a cough and was interrupted by a prankster) and the PM has been dogged by questions about her leadership throughout the conference.So when Sia sings "I'm criticised but all your bullets ricochet, you shoot me down, but I get up, I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose, fire away, fire away," it seemed pertinent to some in the auditorium."You can always find meaning in songs political parties decide to play but [Titanium] is particularly poignant," said New Statesman journalist Anoosh Chakelian, pointing to the chorus line: "You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium.""[That] is May's position after losing her majority but staying in her job."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Did 2012 chart-topper Titanium sum up Theresa May's tricky speech?A less sympathetic verdict was offered by 23-year-old party member Sophie Jarvis, who said the Guetta track was more relevant to "2012 Ibiza"."To me it sounded like the playlist was put together by a 40-year-old thinking they're down with the kids," she says.During her ill-fated general election campaign, Mrs May was accused of appearing "robotic" - a criticism she rejected, although she did admit the campaign - which was characterised by repetitions of its "strong and stable" slogan - was "too scripted"."Theresa May repeatedly asserts she is not robotic," said Eliza Easton, a policy researcher who was at the conference."But Titanium, a song about a metallic woman unaffected by her challengers, is playing on repeat at the conference."A party spokesman did not confirm how the playlist was selected or whether the prime minister was involved.For the record, when Mrs May was asked in 2014 to choose her eight favourite songs on the BBC Radio 4 programme Desert Island Discs, her choices were mainly classical and did not include anything by David Guetta.Just before the PM's big speech, Home Secretary Amber Rudd told BBC Radio 5 live the Tories had got their "mojo back" - and the playlist was certainly upbeat.Besides Titanium, the most popular tune on the conference floor in Manchester was Journey's rousing 1981 hit Don't Stop Believing.Titanium and Don't Stop Believing suggest a theme, according to Spectator journalist Katy Balls."I think [the Conservatives] are trying to suggest they are resilient in times of difficulty, like now."Image caption Australian electronic music duo Empire of the Sun were chosen by Labour for its conference playlist The Tories' conference followed Labour's version in Brighton and the Liberal Democrats' in Bournemouth."Endless repetition of the same song is a common feature of these conferences," says Anoosh Chakelian, adding that Killers hit All These Things That I've Done was a particular favourite with the Conservatives during the David Cameron years.Katy Balls was also at Labour's conference in Brighton last week, and found the mood more positive."Labour tried to suggest they were ready for power," she says."A song I remember most is Empire of the Sun - We Are the People (Who Rule the World)."Beatles classic Here Comes the Sun ("the smiles returning to the faces...I feel that ice is slowly melting") was played before Jeremy Corbyn took to the stage in a speech where he said his party was now united and ready for government.Choosing the conference playlist for Brighton was a "team effort", says Mr Corbyn's spokesman, who did not confirm whether there was an intentional theme.As it turned out it was the songs sung from the stage in Brighton - Tom Watson with Oh, Jeremy Corbyn and the leader himself with a rendition of Happy Birthday for Diane Abbott - that caught the attention.
Do Tories think Corbyn could be next PM?:::::They used to see Jeremy Corbyn as an unelectable throwback to the 1970s - but that was before the general election.Do Conservatives now think he could be the next prime minister?"I am afraid I have to say yes.That doesn't appeal to me but I can see it."Like many Conservatives who were in Manchester this week Ron Allcock is struggling to get his head round the idea of the Labour leader as a credible opponent."He is grabbing all the headlines and people are now thinking 'well, he isn't a bad guy after all'.It's astonishing.Really astonishing."Image caption Ron Allcock says the party needs to do something "dramatic" What worries the 80-year-old Chelmsford councillor is that Mr Corbyn appears to have grown in confidence since the general election and that young people still appear to be flocking to his side."We have to think of something really dramatic to get their attention," he says.Everyone you speak to here admits they underestimated the Labour leader - but opinions are divided over how to fight back.Image caption Jane Hunt and Hilary Fryers think the Corbyn bubble will burst Some, such as Jane Hunt, whose dreams of unseating Labour's Lilian Greenwood in Nottingham South crashed and burned in June, believe the Corbyn bubble will burst."We need to get through the stage where Jeremy Corbyn is sexy.He is going through a phase where people think he is a Messiah almost.That will soon die off.It's built on absolutely nothing as far as I can see."Like others you speak to, she claims Mr Corbyn "hoodwinked" young people by promising to abolish tuition fees and "sort" their debts."I am afraid I think the students were absolutely conned and I think they will switch off from politics once they realise they've been conned.They'll be switched off for a generation and that's really unfortunate."It certainly cost her her own chances, she says, as students queued up outside polling stations to cast a ballot for her opponent, who got 10,000 extra votes.Mrs Hunt's friend, Hilary Fryers, from Market Harborough, agrees that Corbynmania is "built on sand" and will eventually crumble.Image caption Anthony Clarke says the election campaign was too negative Some Tories - including Theresa May's Parliamentary aide George Hollingberry - believe it was a mistake to attack Mr Corbyn on his record at the general election."It's not good just harping back to the 1970s, talking about Hamas, trying to do Jeremy Corbyn down, there's a message out there that people are listening to and we've got to tell them why it's dangerous, why it's wrong for the country and why they shouldn't fall for it," he told BBC Radio 4.Anthony Clarke, the election agent for former Bath MP Ben Howlett, who lost his seat to Liberal Democrat Wera Hobhouse in June, says many Tory voters were turned off by the relentless attacks on Mr Corbyn's character."You could argue that we would have done much better if we ignored him, sidelined him," he says.Image caption Diana Beech says Corbyn's polices need to be 'unpicked' But he has his doubts about whether the Labour leader will ever walk through the doors of Number 10."He is potentially quite a difficult opponent, for one reason or another.I still don't rate him as somebody who is capable of ruling this country."When we have got Brexit out of the way and everything has settled down I don't think he will be in that position."One thing everyone does agree on is that the party urgently needs to do more to attract younger voters."I think there is such a momentum growing out there, to coin a phrase", says Diana Beech, director of policy and advocacy for the Higher Education Policy Institute, and a Conservative Party member, "People feel disillusioned.They want change.I just think there is a growing momentum from the grassroots, helped by social media."But she does not think the party should try to ape Jeremy Corbyn's policies."I think the only way to bring it down is to unpick the economic arguments."Josh Rendall, of Chelsea and Fulham, pictured above, agrees."The party didn't appeal to under-40s at the last general election.There was no overall vision."What the prime minister has done this week is a good step forward but having Labour-like policies, I don't think really works for anyone."As for Mr Corbyn, he says: "I personally underestimated him."Just look at his conference speech last week, compared to the one a year ago or even two years ago.He was a man who had confidence, he wasn't flailing about.He was confident in himself and I think the party underestimated that."The Conservatives need better policies on housing and student finance, not just watered-down versions of Jeremy Corbyn's policies, he argues, in what is becoming an increasingly familiar refrain at this conference, "but I don't know what they are".
PM vows to renew the 'British Dream':::::Image copyright Getty Images A white picket fence, a good job, a nice car and a prosperous future for our kids - most of us have heard of the American Dream.But what about this side of the Atlantic?Theresa May promised to bring back the "British Dream" during her Conservative Party Conference speech - or the idea that "each generation should do better than the one before it".She said her domestic servant grandmother, who has three professors and a prime minister as grandchildren, was proof the dream could be real, but admitted it felt "distant" and "out of reach" for many people today.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson insisted Mrs May had set out a vision of "how to renew" the British Dream - but others watching the speech questioned what it was in the first place."The British Dream?What on earth is that?Never heard of it.What's in it?Unicorns?"David Hendy tweeted.Others began offering their own interpretations of the dream.Skip Twitter post by @Becca_DP the #britishdream is when u think 'it is a coat day' so u wear a coat and it turns out it was indeed a coat day and u are a good temperature beccadook (@Becca_DP) October 4, 2017 Report Despite the confusion, Mrs May is not the first politician to use the phrase.Former UKIP MEP Steven Woolfe, who grew up on a council estate in Moss Side in Manchester, previously claimed he was "living proof" of the British Dream.He described it as the chance to "succeed in your life, no matter your postcode, your gender or the colour of your skin".It echoes the original idea behind the American Dream, which was coined by the writer James Truslow Adams in 1931.He described the ideal of a land where life was "better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement".Who dreamt it up?Mr Johnson himself said in 2005, while editor of The Spectator and a shadow minister, that the UK had been "hopeless" at communicating any sense of a British Dream - compared with the Americans."We've all got to be as British as Carry On films and scotch eggs, and falling over on the beach while trying to change into your swimming trunks with a towel on," he wrote in the Telegraph.Mr Johnson went on to say the first practical step was ensuring everyone in the UK speaks the same language."We should teach English, and we should teach in English.We should teach British history."But Michael Howard, writing in the Guardian shortly after the 7 July 2005 bombings in London, saw the dream differently.Image copyright Working Title/BBC Image caption The success of fictional ballet dancer Billy Elliot has been likened to the British dream The then-Conservative Party leader thought it embodied the values of "decency, tolerance and a sense of fair play"."We need to break down the barriers that exist in too many people's lives - and minds - that prevent or deter them from making a success of life," he said.He nevertheless agreed with Mr Johnson that "no one" talked about a British Dream as they do in America.Two years later, the academic Prof George Rodosthenous, a specialist in musical theatre, observed in a journal article that the British Dream was "a term which needs urgently a definition".He was writing about the story of Billy Elliot - the fictional son of a coal miner who defies the odds to go to the Royal Ballet School in London - and defined it as "the desire to do better than one's own parents, the forbidden desire to dream and the action of dreaming".'British drawbridge' Professor Pamela Cox, social historian at the University of Essex, said the British Dream has come to stand for home ownership, having a secure job and a living standard higher than your parents.However, she believes it is "not a phrase that rolls off the tongue like the American Dream".Prof Cox said the one thing that holds back the British Dream is what she calls the "British drawbridge"."Elites are very good at pulling up the drawbridge behind them - things such as private schools and an inflated housing market."The British elite don't have much interest in sharing spoils.It's very much about keeping it for themselves."The American Dream is much more 'anyone can make it'.The British Dream is a different version - there is not a willingness for everyone to make it."
PM speech: Are fewer black people being stopped and searched?:::::Image copyright Getty Images The claim: Prime Minister Theresa May said that following a speech at the Conservative Party conference in 2014, government action had meant "the number of black people being stopped and searched has fallen by over two-thirds".Reality Check verdict: The number of black people being stopped and searched by police has fallen by two-thirds since 2010-11 but not since the 2014 conference.Also, black people still form a disproportionately large percentage of those being stopped and searched and the percentage has actually risen since 2013-14.As she delivered her keynote speech to the Conservative Party conference, the prime minister reminded Tories of what she sees as a key achievement - a reduction in the number of black people being stopped and searched, but all is not what it seems.Theresa May spoke about a young black man called Alexander Paul who spoke at the conference in 2014 about his experience of police stop-and-search tactics.She said: "Inspired by his example, we took action.We shook up the system, and the number of black people being stopped and searched has fallen by over two-thirds."The overall number of stop-and-searches fell dramatically between 2010-11 and 2015-16, which is the most recent year for which data is available.So, the number of black people being stopped also fell.This graph shows that the number of black people being stopped fell by two-thirds over the total period, but not since Mr Paul spoke at the conference in 2014.Disproportionately stopped But even though far fewer black people are being stopped and searched, they are still more likely to be stopped than any other ethnic group.When you look at the percentage of those stopped and searched who define themselves as black, little has changed.It was 15.2% in 2010-11, and fell to about 11% in 2013-14.Then it rose, and in 2015-16 was back up to 15.1%.The 2011 census found that 3.3% of people in England and Wales defined themselves as black - meaning black people are being stopped and searched nearly five times as often as you would expect them to be.So, while the number of black people being stopped and searched fell, their proportion of the total rose since Mr Paul spoke at the 2014 Conservative party conference.Just to be clear - these figures don't include stop-and-searches related to terrorism or that are carried out because police are trying to manage an incident that affects public safety - those fall under different legislation and are recorded separately.They would not have significantly changed the data.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: The people who are negotiating:::::The nature of Brexit will ultimately be decided by the governments of the 27 remaining EU nations and the UK.But the figures who negotiate the detail of the deal will be hugely important.Many would argue that Germany's Angela Merkel and the UK's Theresa May are the two most important people in the Brexit negotiations.But here are eight figures who will also be crucial to what happens.Of the four from the UK, three are within the Exiting the EU department.On the EU side, the figures represent the Commission (the EU's executive cabinet), the Council (the leaders of each member state) and the parliament of elected MEPs, who will have to approve the final deal.The EU negotiators A seasoned master of French and EU diplomacy, chief negotiator Michel Barnier will go head-to-head with UK Brexit Secretary David Davis.They used to be sparring partners in the 1990s, when they were rival Europe ministers with contrasting visions of the EU.Like Mr Davis, Mr Barnier does not owe his current status to his country's elite club of politicians.He did not attend the prestigious Ecole Nationale d'Administration, incubator of French political high-flyers.He has already given a clear indication of the tough stance he will take in negotiations - from guaranteeing the rights of Polish students and Romanian nurses in the UK, and British pensioners living in Spain.He is also adamant that the "sequencing" of the talks is key - the UK won't get to negotiate a trade deal until separation terms are agreed that preserve the integrity of the EU single market, and the UK settles its outstanding bills.Michel Barnier made his mark in French politics by organising the 1992 Winter Olympic Games in the French Alps.And for a long time he was regarded as a provincial - some called him "the ski instructor".He served as France's Europe minister and was briefly foreign minister.He stems from the Gaullist tradition.It was Charles De Gaulle who famously said "Non" to the UK joining the Common Market.Since 2010, Mr Barnier has been big in Brussels.As internal market commissioner he had oversight of the City of London at a sensitive time - in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.That role caused jitters in UK business circles, as Mr Barnier pushed through financial reforms.While some in the City disapproved of new EU regulations on bank capital reserves and bankers' bonuses, other officials found him more accommodating to City interests later on.And his opposite numbers in the Brexit talks will hope for the same pragmatism.Who is Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier?Sabine Weyand - one of "the Commission's best and brightest", according to its president, Jean-Claude Juncker - was picked as Mr Barnier's deputy chief negotiator in September.She studied at Cambridge University in the 1980s, and knows well the country whose exit from the EU she will be helping to engineer.But this German national is best known as a veteran at representing the Commission and its interests.And that makes her a formidable opposite number.She has 23 years' experience in trade relations and more than a decade at the Commission itself.One Brussels lobby group predicted Ms Weyand was unlikely to give much ground in trade talks on any UK hopes of a la carte access to the EU, particularly any weakening of the EU single market ideal of free movement.Those who have seen Ms Weyand in action speak highly of her as being far from a faceless cog in the Brussels machinery.Cecile Toubeau, whose group campaigns for sustainable transport inside Europe, came into contact with her at the time the VW emissions scandal blew up in 2015."She was very straightforward, she got to the point quickly, she understood the issues that we were bringing," says Ms Toubeau."She was open to what we said but I felt she was able to say, 'That's politically not something we can consider'."She was no-nonsense and honest - she really knew her stuff.She didn't need to look to her assistants for guidance."In its list of the most influential women in Brussels, the politico.eu website put Ms Weyand at number eight, calling her a "Commission problem-solver".She served in the cabinet of French former EU trade chief Pascal Lamy from 1999 to 2004, and later helped steer the EU's climate policies.She also monitored national governments' economic and financial performance in the Commission's Secretariat-General.In the run-up to the Brexit vote, Donald Tusk did all he could to find a deal to keep the UK in the EU.He was apocalyptic when he warned that the UK leaving could end "in the destruction of not only the EU but also Western political civilisation in its entirety".His efforts came to nothing and as the result emerged he tried to calm the waters in Brussels, saying "what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger".But in the wake of PM Theresa May's re-election without a parliamentary majority, he warned the UK to make up for lost negotiating time, tweeting: "We don't know when Brexit talks start.We know when they must end.Do your best to avoid a 'no deal' as result of 'no negotiations'."As president of the European Council, his challenge is to keep Europe's leaders united as they negotiate Britain's exit.Mr Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, is loathed by Poland's nationalist government that tried and failed to unseat him.But he has the respect of other European leaders for his handling of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the migrant crisis and the Greek debt negotiations.He has warned the UK not to expect to cherry-pick its way out of the EU and he has rejected British threats to walk away without a deal.But he has spoken of his aspiration for a "smooth divorce" with the two sides breaking up as "good friends".Mr Tusk is from Poland's Kashubian minority and grew up in Gdansk, the Baltic port city where anti-communist demonstrations, led by the Solidarity trade union, erupted in the 1980s.He was active in Solidarity while studying history at the University of Gdansk.As prime minister, Mr Tusk led Civic Platform (PO), which espoused free market policies.His government cut jobs in the state sector, pursued privatisation, cut taxes to woo foreign investors and tried to persuade Poles abroad to come home.Didier Seeuws, a hard-working diplomat with an eye for detail, was quickly tapped by Donald Tusk to head the Council's task force for the Brexit negotiations.While the Barnier-Weyand Commission task force will do the "heavy lifting" in the negotiations - dealing with the technical detail of Britain's exit from the EU - the Council team will be tasked with keeping the remaining 27 national governments happy and shaping the EU's longer term strategic relationship with the UK.Mr Seeuws will also have to bear in mind the views of MEPs - the European Parliament will have to approve the final deal.Mr Seeuws's team is said to have been meeting twice a week in preparation for negotiations - prompting unhappy comparisons with the UK side's state of preparation in some of the media.Mr Seeuws is respected for his role in handling the Greek debt negotiations - working through the night until dawn and overcoming divisions between heads of state to achieve a deal.From 2007 to 2010, the 51-year-old technocrat from the Flemish city of Ghent was Belgium's deputy ambassador to the EU, where he is said to have negotiated a breakthrough on the European patent system - following a 30-year deadlock.The ambassador he served under, Jean De Ruyt, told the BBC his political instincts were "always spot on" and that he "trusted his judgement and recommendations completely"."Apparently modest and obliging, he is capable of mastering the most complex of technical issues and understanding immediately the political stakes, but at the same time able to explain in simple words what has been discussed or decided."I have no doubt that Didier will often be able to reach a fair compromise when, as expected, difficult negotiations will reach a stalemate."Prior to this, Mr Seeuws served for several years as spokesman for the Belgian prime minister, none other than Guy Verhofstadt, the man chosen as chief Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament.Eventually, Mr Seeuws took up a job as right-hand man to Donald Tusk's predecessor at the European Council, Herman van Rompuy.He has since worked at the Council as head of transport, telecommunication and energy.The UK negotiators A former SAS reservist, who grew up on a south London council estate, David Davis is a political maverick who had carved out a career as a champion of civil liberties before his unexpected return to front-line politics as secretary of state for exiting the EU.Initially seen as an ultra-Thatcherite, he was elected to parliament in 1987, at the age of 38, after a career in management with sugar giant Tate and Lyle.Despite his Eurosceptic views, he served as a government whip under pro-EU Prime Minister John Major in the early 1990s, attempting to get rebel Tory MPs to support the Maastricht Treaty, which paved the way for closer European integration.He later served as Major's Europe minister, helping to negotiate some of the agreements with Brussels he is now charged with unpicking.His "hard man" image, working-class background and staunch right-wing credentials made him the front runner to replace Michael Howard as Conservative leader in 2005.He lost out to David Cameron, who made him shadow home secretary, where he carved out a distinctive niche for himself as a defender of traditional British freedoms.In 2008, he dramatically resigned his Haltemprice and Howden seat, and his frontbench role, to fight a by-election in protest at Labour's plans for identity cards and 42-day detention without charge.He won easily but rejected a job in the coalition government in 2010 to continue his civil liberties crusade from the backbenches, often in conflict with then Home Secretary Theresa May.He was involved in legal action against the government over Mrs May's data retention plans - dubbed the "snoopers' charter" by critics - when he got the call to join her cabinet.It was the first time in his long and colourful career that he had been put in charge of his own government department.Olly Robbins is the top UK official at the Brexit talks.At the start of the process, he was the top civil servant in David Davis's Exiting the EU department.But he has now moved to the Cabinet Office to work more directly for the prime minister, following reports of tensions with Mr Davis.The move was seen as a sign of Theresa May taking more control of Brexit negotiations.He cut his teeth at Gordon Brown's Treasury, helping to co-ordinate public spending policy, before going on to serve in senior behind-the-scenes roles for both Tony Blair and Mr Brown in Downing Street.By civil service standards, his rise was meteoric - he was Mr Blair's principal private secretary by the age of 31.He gained a reputation for being a skilled mediator in the frequent disputes between No 10 and the Treasury."In all my dealings with him, he really embodied the essence of the impartial civil service, and he's very popular," former Olympics minister Lady Jowell, told website Politico.After a spell as director of the civil service and as David Cameron's deputy national security adviser, Robbins became the senior civil servant in charge of immigration policy at Theresa May's home office.When Mrs May became prime minister she drafted Robbins in as her senior EU adviser, prompting speculation the government wanted to put the free movement of people at the heart of Brexit negotiations.Robbins generated some headlines in 2016 when he was ejected from a Home Affairs select Committee hearing by then chairman Keith Vaz for failing to give information about the UK Border Force's budget on time.He was also caught on camera "grinning sheepishly" as Mrs May handed her handbag to him at an EU summit in Malta.A career diplomat, with a reputation as a low-key but solid operator, Sir Tim Barrow was drafted into the role of UK ambassador to the EU following the resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers, who had accused the government of "muddled thinking" over Brexit.Sir Tim was Britain's ambassador in Moscow between 2011 and 2015, a turbulent period in relations between the two nations, and previously served as Britain's ambassador to Ukraine.The diplomat started his foreign office career in 1986 at the UK embassy in Brussels before going on to serve as a private secretary to Labour foreign secretary Robin Cook, advising on the EU, Russia and Middle East."It's the toughest negotiation in our lifetimes and I think he is up to it," Britain's former ambassador to Lebanon Tom Fletcher told BBC Radio 4's Today programme."I have seen him in Brussels.He knows the corridors, he knows the characters.But actually more importantly I saw him in Moscow where he was incredibly resilient as ambassador there, dealing with Putin in a very testing time in our relationship and Tim had a reputation of being bulletproof out there."BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said Sir Tim was less likely to be criticised by Brexit supporters than some other potential candidates for the job, as it "would be very hard to say that Sir Tim Barrow is an out-and-out pro-European".A fluent Russian speaker, Sir Tim was educated at Arnold Lodge in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, and Oxford University.As director general of David Davis's department, Sarah Healey is, in effect, second-in-command of the civil service machine tasked with delivering Brexit.She comes fresh from a similar role at the culture department and also led cross-government efforts to promote more women into senior civil service roles through job-sharing arrangements.Her previous claim to fame was as a contestant on University Challenge - she won the BBC Two quiz in 1998 and twice competed in the Champions of Champions competition for Magdalen College, Oxford.Healey studied modern history and English at Oxford and gained a postgraduate degree in social policy from the London School of Economics before embarking on a career in the civil service.Her former boss at the culture department, Tory MP Ed Vaizey, told the Times she was "incredibly sharp and intelligent", adding "there are no flies on her at all".She worked briefly for Iain Duncan Smith, when he was work and pensions secretary, and, before that, was director of strategy and funding at the education department under Michael Gove.She recently told a think tank conference that, as a student of history, freedom of information was an issue "close to my heart"."One of the things I reflected on when I took this job was that my children, if they were to take history degrees, would write essays on what we were doing so it was terribly important that they do have access to the archives of the time," she said.Profiles by Becky Branford, Paul Kirby and Brian Wheeler.Illustrations by Gerry Fletcher.
'No point trying to be cool' - the Tories seeking young voters:::::Image caption Around 200 people attended the Conservative Ideas Festival The Conservatives have a problem.More young people are voting than at any time in the last quarter of a century, but largely not for them - so what can the party do to change that?It's been labelled - perhaps unfairly - the "Tory Glastonbury".Around 200 activists, MPs, sympathetic thinkers and business people meet in the low September sunshine to discuss how the party can attract young voters.Just two years ago, the split in support between Labour and the Conservatives among 18 to 29-year-olds was fairly even, 36% to 32%.Fast forward to this June's general election and that small gap had become a chasm - according to pollsters YouGov - with Labour now on 64% to the Tories' 21%.In fact, unless you were touching 50, you were in a minority if you voted Conservative.'Panic mode' Addressing worried-looking party figures at the Big Tent Ideas festival in Berkshire, Lord Cooper - one-time director of strategy for ex-Prime Minister David Cameron - puts it starkly.Older Conservative voters, he says, are dying.And younger, more "open" voters are not going to decide when they hit 50 that "feminism and the internet and the green movement are a bad thing after all".Unless the party responds, he adds, "it is going to die".So what should they do?Image caption Bim Afolami says the party "realises that there is a problem" in not attracting enough young voters "Somebody famous and clever said the Conservative Party only knows two modes - complacency or panic," says one of the Tories' youngest MPs."And we're definitely in panic mode."Bim Afolami, an old Etonian and former banker, is 31 and has only been an MP for a few months, but his thoughts have already turned to this question."The party generally, collectively, realises that this is a problem," he says.With the Budget less than two months away, he says Chancellor Philip Hammond recently told a meeting of Conservative backbenchers that the party must address two of the key issues for younger voters - housing and student debt.Victoria Borwick - who represented the safe seat of Kensington until she became one of the 33 Conservative MPs swept away by Labour's better-than-expected showing in June - echoes the message."Every single MP should go back to their own area and see how they can build more housing for the next generation."'Not Glastonbury' It might be only 100 miles away, but the Big Tent Ideas Festival couldn't be further from Glastonbury.The music is Bach - perfectly rendered by a violinist.The buffet is delicate and refined.And there are more MPs in attendance than the young voters whom the ideas are intended to reach."This is not Glastonbury," Mr Afolami points out."It's more akin to (literature festival) Hay-on-Wye."The comparison is clearly unfair, but does it matter?The story goes that the brains behind the event, Conservative MP George Freeman, saw Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn cheered by thousands at Glastonbury over the summer and asked, "Why is it just the left who have all the fun in politics?"Image caption MP James Cleverly says young people were offered an "electoral bribe" by Jeremy Corbyn Conservative MP James Cleverly is unimpressed."Wow, a left-wing leader getting a good reception at a rock festival," he says, ironically."What kind of crazy world is it we live in that that kind of thing happens?"It's a bunch of young people who've just been given a massive electoral bribe."Mr Corbyn - who said before the election he would "deal" with student debt - will be punished for taking "younger voters for fools", Cleverly says."Being hip, being popular, being cool, that's really easy," says Cleverly."Until you have to make tough decisions.And when you have to make tough decisions, that veneer of coolness comes off real quick."So the better thing to do is to be right and be doing the right things for the right reasons rather than trying to be cool and popular and saying whatever thing is going to get good headlines or a big cheer at Glastonbury."Diversity What, then, can the party learn?Labour's general election campaign was praised for its use of social media and for reaching young people previously unmoved by party politics.Tobi Alabi - a south Londoner who was invited to attend the ideas festival, and was courted by Conservatives there, but isn't a supporter - says the party was an irrelevance for most of his friends.Labour, he says, related and appealed to young people.Image caption Tobi Alabi says the Conservative Party did not display diversity "That's something the Conservative Party didn't do.They didn't display diversity.They didn't display an appeal to young people.You have to tap into young people's interests."So - if they do that - could those young people won over by Jeremy Corbyn's Labour one day support the Tories?"Those people can be won back," says a hopeful Bim Afolami."Those are not people who have decided forever to vote for one person or one party."I think if we show them that we've got the right policies - but, more importantly, the right values - those are people that we can at least compete for in the future."Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.
Who's that girl? GCSE student wows at conference:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Newly-reformed GCSEs are leaving teenagers 'spaced out and stressed out', Lauren Stocks tells Labour delegates It was a moment that caught the Labour party conference off-guard.Sixteen-year-old Lauren Stocks had just received her GCSE results and wanted to talk about the toll that changes to the exams had taken on her and her classmates.In a passionate speech, she articulated the scale of the mental health problems that blight her generation."There's a statistic we were shown when I was about 13 or 14 that told me three in 10 people in every classroom suffer with a mental illness.Using strong language, she denied that to be the case."It's a good half."I could've walked into any food tech, history, art, maths classroom and just watched seas of spaced-out, stressed-out, depressed kids, in a battlefield where they can't afford pens and paper," she said, gulping hard."It is a disgusting sight," she told delegates, and urged parents of teenagers with newly-reformed GCSEs ahead of them to make sure they know they are loved.In under three minutes, Lauren delivered a speech conveying the impatience of youth.("I didn't make notes before I came on stage and my thoughts will be fairly scattered, so please go easy on me.")Her audience were on their feet, cheering Lauren for a speech that's since been shared thousands of times on social media.Image copyright Lauren Stocks Image caption Lauren has been a Labour party member since the age of 14 "It felt pretty weird," she tells the BBC."I was kind of in my own little world."To see everyone stand up - I really appreciated it."And the plaudits didn't stop there."My Snapchat blew up," she says.About 30 people from her old school contacted her to say they were really glad she had spoken up for them."I have suffered with many a mental health issue.I was worried it was just me but the response was overwhelming."Skip Twitter post by @braveteaching Crying, partly with pride that our schools have made the articulate & amazing Lauren Stocks & partly cos she has to spend her energy on this https://t.co/entxGdER5q Lucy Rimmington (@braveteaching) September 27, 2017 Report Some social media users though, with characteristic brutality, were less than warm, criticising her choice of hair dye and appearance.The impact of these negative comments is something her mum, Sarah Hilton, worries about a lot but Lauren less so."They're saying: 'That's not a girl'."When I checked last night, I was definitely female," she says, laughing it off.She also diplomatically brushes off the inevitable parallels being drawn with a famous 1977 Conservative conference speech by another 16-year-old, which was watched by a smiling prime minister-in-waiting - Margaret Thatcher."I haven't seen the speech but I have studied William Hague," she says."I don't have the best opinion of him."Image copyright Lauren Stocks Image caption Lauren's mum, Sarah Hilton, says her daughter has been educating her about politics Despite her years, Lauren is no stranger to public speaking.Now under-19 representative for North West Young Labour, she has been an activist for two years.Her interest in politics was first piqued at 12 as she idly watched YouTube videos of people discussing left-wing ideas.After a brief dalliance with the Greens, she joined the Labour party on 3 August 2015."I remember if as if it were yesterday," she says, almost wistfully.A few weeks later, Lauren received an email asking people to attend a Manchester food bank that leader Jeremy Corbyn would be visiting."I asked mum if I could go.I'd never been into Manchester alone before."My mum dropped me off at the food bank and after that they kept me involved," she says.After her experience of sitting the new GCSEs, she says students should be empowered and told what they can achieve, not threatened that if they fail, they'll be left watching Jeremy Kyle all day.This year's GCSE students in England were the first to sit exams which were numerically graded and tougher than in the past.The changes, introduced by former education secretary Michael Gove, resulted in a dip in results, but schools minister Nick Gibb said pupils and teachers were rising to the challenge.Exam regulators said the new qualifications had allowed students to better demonstrate their abilities and had better prepared them for further study.A Department for Education spokesperson said: "We recognise there are challenges facing the profession including a more demanding curriculum and higher expectations for pupils.Where staff are struggling we trust head teachers to take action to tackle the causes of stress and ensure they have the support they need."The government has also taken steps to reduce the burden of exams on young people including removing multiple, pointless resits and investing 1.4 billion in children's mental health services".Image copyright Lauren Stocks Image caption Lauren met veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner at the party conference Conference was, Lauren admits, a fast-paced eye-opener but also a chance to meet her heroes, Dennis Skinner ("soon-to-be Sir"), writer and activist Owen Jones ("I love him so much") and Laura Smith ("a rising star who I hope to see in Cabinet").For all her enthusiasm for politics and its people - and despite lobbying from her mum - she is not certain that's where her future lies.Lauren is now studying history, sociology and politics at college, and plans to stand for council in 2019.But beyond that, she says she has no political ambitions."If it's meant to be, it's meant to be."

Election 2017: Which seats changed hands?:::::The Conservatives have lost seats in Parliament and no longer enjoy an overall majority, while Labour has exceeded the expectations of pollsters and increased its number of MPs.But this isn't the whole story... 1.The Conservatives won 20 seats Although it was a bad night for Theresa May's party overall, with 33 MPs ejected from Parliament, it actually won seats elsewhere.The majority of their gains were in Scotland, where the Conservatives performed well against the SNP, unseating the former SNP leader Alex Salmond in Gordon.The party also took six seats from Labour, and snatched Clacton from UKIP.2. Who lost seats to Labour?Labour's six losses were offset by 36 gains - 28 of which were from the Conservatives and two from the Lib Dems - including Nick Clegg's former seat of Sheffield Hallam.The party also took six Scottish seats from the SNP.3.Most of the changes were in Scotland and the north of England Although the political landscape of Northern Ireland has also shifted dramatically with the UUP and the SDLP losing all of their MPs.Changed seats All seats Please enable Javascript to view our results map Con Con Lab Lab SNP SNP LD LD PC PC UKIP UKIP Ind Ind DUP DUP SDLP SDLP UUP UUP SF SF Green More maps showing the changes from 2015 to 2017 are here.4.The SNP saw some huge majorities disappear The table below shows the largest majorities in the last general election in 2015 that have been overturned.Nine of the largest 10 previously belonged to the SNP - a 14,000-vote majority won by the party's former spokesperson on social justice, Eilidh Whiteford, in 2015 has been converted into a 4,000-vote majority for the Conservatives.Constituency (out of 650 so far) Result 2015 Majority 2017 Majority Banff & Buchan CON GAIN FROM SNP 14339 3693 Coatbridge, Chryston & Bellshill LAB GAIN FROM SNP 11501 1586 Ayr, Carrick & Cumnock CON GAIN FROM SNP 11265 2774 Angus CON GAIN FROM SNP 11230 2645 Stirling CON GAIN FROM SNP 10480 148 Ochil & South Perthshire CON GAIN FROM SNP 10168 3359 Rutherglen & Hamilton West LAB GAIN FROM SNP 9975 265 Kirkcaldy & Cowdenbeath LAB GAIN FROM SNP 9974 259 Midlothian LAB GAIN FROM SNP 9859 885 Canterbury LAB GAIN FROM CON 9798 187 Oxford West & Abingdon LD GAIN FROM CON 9582 816 Glasgow North East LAB GAIN FROM SNP 9222 242 Moray CON GAIN FROM SNP 9065 4159 Gordon CON GAIN FROM SNP 8687 2607 Battersea LAB GAIN FROM CON 7938 2416 Kensington LAB GAIN FROM CON 7361 20 Aberdeen South CON GAIN FROM SNP 7230 4752 Aberdeenshire West & Kincardine CON GAIN FROM SNP 7033 7949 East Lothian LAB GAIN FROM SNP 6803 3083 Warwick & Leamington LAB GAIN FROM CON 6606 1206 Reading East LAB GAIN FROM CON 6520 3749 Dumfries & Galloway CON GAIN FROM SNP 6514 5643 Foyle SF GAIN FROM SDLP 6046 169 South Down SF GAIN FROM SDLP 5891 2446 Colne Valley LAB GAIN FROM CON 5378 915 Mansfield CON GAIN FROM LAB 5315 1057 Portsmouth South LAB GAIN FROM CON 5241 1554 Stockton South LAB GAIN FROM CON 5046 888 Bristol North West LAB GAIN FROM CON 4944 4761 High Peak LAB GAIN FROM CON 4894 2322 Stroud LAB GAIN FROM CON 4866 687 Enfield Southgate LAB GAIN FROM CON 4753 4355 Caithness, Sutherland & Easter Ross LD GAIN FROM SNP 3844 2044 Bath LD GAIN FROM CON 3833 5694 Ipswich LAB GAIN FROM CON 3733 831 Renfrewshire East CON GAIN FROM SNP 3718 4712 Crewe & Nantwich LAB GAIN FROM CON 3620 48 Clacton CON GAIN FROM UKIP 3437 15828 Edinburgh West LD GAIN FROM SNP 3210 2988 Ceredigion PC GAIN FROM LD 3067 104 Keighley LAB GAIN FROM CON 3053 249 Leeds North West LAB GAIN FROM LD 2907 4224 Kingston & Surbiton LD GAIN FROM CON 2834 4124 Warrington South LAB GAIN FROM CON 2750 2549 Copeland CON WIN 2564 1695 Stoke-on-Trent South CON GAIN FROM LAB 2539 663 Sheffield Hallam LAB GAIN FROM LD 2353 2125 Middlesbrough South & Cleveland East CON GAIN FROM LAB 2268 1020 Dunbartonshire East LD GAIN FROM SNP 2167 5339 Cardiff North LAB GAIN FROM CON 2137 4174 Twickenham LD GAIN FROM CON 2017 9762 Walsall North CON GAIN FROM LAB 1937 2601 Peterborough LAB GAIN FROM CON 1925 607 Derbyshire North East CON GAIN FROM LAB 1883 2861 Lincoln LAB GAIN FROM CON 1443 1538 Southport CON GAIN FROM LD 1322 2914 Bedford LAB GAIN FROM CON 1097 789 South Antrim DUP GAIN FROM UUP 949 3208 Belfast South DUP GAIN FROM SDLP 906 1996 Weaver Vale LAB GAIN FROM CON 806 3928 Eastbourne LD GAIN FROM CON 733 1609 Brighton Kemptown LAB GAIN FROM CON 690 9868 Fermanagh & South Tyrone SF GAIN FROM UUP 530 875 Plymouth Sutton & Devonport LAB GAIN FROM CON 523 6807 Bury North LAB GAIN FROM CON 378 4375 Berwickshire, Roxburgh & Selkirk CON GAIN FROM SNP 328 11060 Vale of Clwyd LAB GAIN FROM CON 237 2379 Croydon Central LAB GAIN FROM CON 165 5652 Derby North LAB GAIN FROM CON 41 2015 Gower LAB GAIN FROM CON 27 3269
Theresa May: 10 reasons why the PM blew her majority:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Theresa May awaiting her constituency result in the early hours of Friday The post mortem on how Theresa May managed to lose her majority in Thursday's general election after expecting to secure a landslide victory is well under way.Here are 10 theories.First things first.Did she blow it?Yes.The Conservatives came first in this election with 318 seats, with Labour the next biggest party on 262 seats.The Conservatives got more votes that anyone else - 42.4% to Labour's 40% - and Theresa May's party got more votes than anyone since the record-breaking total John Major received in 1992.And yes, that means she got more votes than Tony Blair's New Labour landslide in 1997.So, you ask, in what sense did she blow it?Well, she had 331 MPs - more than the 326 needed to have a Commons majority - when she decided to call the election with the aim of increasing her majority.She also began the campaign with an undisputed opinion-poll lead in double figures and a landslide victory within her grasp.She ends it having to try to do a deal with the 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs to stay in power, and knowing that, the decision to call a snap election will go down as one of the biggest own goals in British political history.So how did it come to this?1) Deciding to call an election Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Reaction from Bristol: 'You're joking.Why does she need to do it?'Theresa May had been serenely racking up stunning approval ratings and huge opinion-poll leads.Her constant refrain was "Brexit meant Brexit" and it seemed a serious, tough, honest and non-flashy politician was what the British people wanted.Her honeymoon period felt like that of another self-consciously unshowy prime minister who came to power without an election - Gordon Brown.But unlike Mr Brown in 2007, she did not allow speculation about a snap election to run rife only to blow her reputation by deciding not to call one after all.She ruled out having an election.And then she changed her mind.She insisted she was acting in the national interest but others detected baser motives.Jeremy Corbyn said: "How can any voter trust what the prime minister says?".Nicola Sturgeon said it was a naked power grab and a bid to crush all opposition.The public, like Brenda in Bristol, seemed weary of politics and voting.2) The wrong type of campaign Image copyright Getty Images This was Theresa May's election - the Conservatives were some way off in the distance, if they were visible at all, at the start of the campaign.But was she the right kind of candidate to be placed front and centre like this?Katie Perrior, Mrs May's former director of communications thinks not.Writing in the Times, she said: "If you run a presidential-style campaign with a woman who doesn't like media interviews, then you have to accept that it's better to do them and run the risk that they go badly than look like you are running scared.Furthermore, if you want to brag that your candidate is a bloody difficult woman, then she has to show some empathy to remind people she is human after all."3) Dodging the TV debates Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Home Secretary Amber Rudd and senior politicians from six other parties took part in the debate.With huge poll leads at the start of the campaign it was quickly decided that Mrs May would not take part in anything as risky as a TV debate with her main challenger, Jeremy Corbyn, or risk meeting too many members of the public in big rallies.That decision backfired when Mr Corbyn decided to take part in a seven-way debate with other party leaders - he did not make a big deal of her absence, but everybody else on the stage did.The Green Party's Caroline Lucas said: "You don't say it's the most important election of our lifetime and not be bothered to show up."Mrs May might have performed badly in the debate, but she arguably took a far bigger reputational hit by not taking part, as it opened her up to accusations she was running scared, or that she was complacently assuming victory.4) Underestimating the opposition Image copyright Reuters Sporting history is littered with underdogs triumphing because they wanted to win more than their opponents, or put in more effort.The same sometimes goes for politics.In this election Mrs May seemed like she would be happy to say "strong and stable" from dawn until the sun set over the fields of wheat she "naughtily" ran through as a child.There was little in the way of a positive message to entice floating voters.Her campaign team did not seem able to conceive of the idea that anyone would take Mr Corbyn seriously.They underestimated how well his anti-austerity message would go over with voters worn out by years of frozen wages and public spending squeezes.Many commentators, on the left and right, who had written Jeremy Corbyn off as vote-losing liability have had to eat their words since the election.Just about everyone underestimated his appeal, once he was given a chance to air his views unmediated by a largely hostile press.5) Manifesto policies Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Anna Soubry has given a frank assessment of her party's campaign The turning point of the campaign, according to insiders, was Theresa May's U-turn on social care.Team May were apparently so confident of victory that they thought they could tackle the looming problem of social care costs - an issue parties scrapping to win elections have generally shied away from.But within hours the main thing many people knew about the Conservative programme for government was that it included a "dementia tax" that could lead to more people having to sell their homes to pay for care.The same went for means-testing the winter fuel allowance and ending the "triple lock" that guarantees a minimum 2.5% increase in the state pension.Mrs May might have got away with the rapid U-turn on social care - something that is almost unheard of the middle of an election campaign - if she had owned up to it but she continued to insist that nothing had changed.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May: This is the right way forward Anna Soubry, an anti-Brexit Tory MP said this was the moment that she lost her "strong and stable" reputation.Some Conservative MPs have suggested, off the record, that the 2017 manifesto was the worst the party has ever published.Ms Soubry said it was more a problem of "appalling" presentation - not properly explaining the social care changes, which would actually have benefited many less well-off people - and allowing people to think free school meals for poor children were being axed, when in fact the plan was to end the free lunches for all infants, which benefits the better-off.6) Not reacting to the Labour surge Image copyright Reuters Nick Timothy, pictured, who was forced out as Theresa May's policy adviser after the election result, suggests Team May were not even aware that there was a surge in Labour support as polling day approached.In his resignation statement, he said this was "because modern campaigning techniques require ever-narrower targeting of specific voters, and we were not talking to the people who decided to vote for Labour".Instead of pushing their message on the NHS and the energy price cap to get wavering Labour voters on side, they doubled down on what they thought was their strongest suit - Brexit and "strong and stable leadership" in contrast to a "coalition of chaos" under Mr Corbyn.7) May's personality Image copyright Getty Images People knew very little about Theresa May before the campaign started - she had been home secretary for a long time but had not courted publicity like some of her cabinet colleagues.An introvert, by Westminster standards, who does not like talking about her private feelings, she tended to come across as ill-at-ease on the TV sofa.Like Hillary Clinton in last year's US elections, she was not a natural on the campaign trail either.As Daily Mail sketch writer Quentin Letts pointed out at one event, she tended to look a bit miserable, or as he put it, a "glumbucket'.Mr Corbyn, on the other hand, looked like he was enjoying himself.At the end of the campaign, Mrs May had to rely on Boris Johnson, a natural political showman, to whip up the crowds.8) Negativity and the youth vote Image copyright Getty Images Theresa May spent a lot of time attacking Jeremy Corbyn's credibility and, as Nick Timothy has acknowledged, not enough time setting out her "positive plan for for the future".There are shades of Clinton here again, who focused heavily on attacking her opponent's fitness for office rather than explaining what she would do with power.Conservative attacks on Mr Corbyn's anti-terror record will have sounded alarm bells with older readers of Conservative-supporting newspapers.They may have meant less to anyone under 30, who were more interested in what the Labour leader had to say about their future rather than who he was holding meetings with decades ago.Labour countered Tory attack ads on Facebook with upbeat messages and celebrity endorsements.Labour's successful push to get out the youth vote was a decisive factor in some seats, although there is still some debate about the size of the surge in voting among 18 to 24-year-olds.The Tory campaign was widely criticised for being negative and uninspiring.9) Fox hunting and 'the same old Tories' Image copyright EPA Image caption Anti-hunting protesters marched on Downing Street It may simply have been a repetition of a longstanding Tory policy but Theresa May's vow to hold a free vote on bringing back fox hunting is thought by some to have harmed her efforts to seal the deal with Labour voters flirting with the Conservatives.It came up a lot on the doorstep, according to some reports, helping to "re-toxify" the Conservative brand among voters in traditional Labour areas, which Mrs May was banking on to win a big majority.Like the social care U-turn, or the pledge to bring back grammar schools, it may have given anyone flirting with backing the Tories for the first time in their lives a reason not to switch their vote.10) Events Theresa May wanted the election to be about Brexit but the terror attacks in Manchester and London changed the course of the campaign.Suddenly it was all about security and anti-terror policy.This should have put the former home secretary in a strong position, and her statements on the attacks struck a suitably prime ministerial tone.Labour's criticism of cuts to police numbers gave them a line of attack against Mrs May - but the pause in campaigning that followed the terrorist incidents resulted in a sombre and strangely off-kilter ending to the election.Here is a selection of your views: "Ignoring remain voters - too much focus on "no deal is better than a bad deal" and complaining that Remain voters were "citizens of nowhere" alienated the 48%.Playing so much to the UKIP vote backfired in many areas of the country.Evidence for this: the swing to Labour from Tories was much larger in Remain voting areas than Leave voting ones," Sue, York."Jeremy Corbyn was reckless and irresponsible in the promises he was making particularly to the youth voters.Promising to give 'free university' at a cost to the UK of 11.5 Billion a year, is an example of the 'money tree' that pays for all !Corbyn could afford to be reckless in his election promises because he didn't expect to win or be PM."Ron, Stoke-on-Trent."The Conservatives underestimated the collapse in the number of votes for the UKIP party.It must have been apparent that these votes would go somewhere and not necessarily all to the Conservative Party.Clearly some of these went to the Labour Party.The Labour Party will always have a strong backing in the cities and these extra votes from the UKIP party helped Labour get more seats.This should have been anticipated and calculated before Mrs May called the election so some of her advisers and backroom staff got it clearly wrong and miscalculated - or was it Mrs May just determined to call the election whatever?," Jeff "Definitely Fox Hunting swayed me.I left the Labour Party as a member when JC became leader.I didn't think he was electable (and he still might not be) and predicted a Labour wipe-out with him at the helm.But as the election went on I was slowly taken back into the fold by his positive campaign.I'd always agreed with his policies, just him as a leader I had doubts over.The more he engaged though the more I cheered, and once the manifestos where published it was game over for the Tories.But yes, the fox hunting was the initial game changer (as it was announced early on) - and then everything else just fell into place," Ian, Chester."I'm surprised that more hasn't been made of the proposed boundary changes, which would have reduced MPs from 650 to 600.If May had forced these through and then called the election she would have undoubtedly won a majority, as they massively favour the Conservatives.One report suggested that under the new boundaries Labour could be 10% ahead of the Tories and still not have a majority," Andrew, Loughborough."The Tories did not lose their majority over the stance favouring a hard Brexit.They lost seats because the majority accept that Brexit will happen and all the other issues of economic and social policy were more important issues in the election.Mrs May needs to ignore the pro Remain Major, Cameron and Clarke who are using the situation to try to reverse their defeat in the Referendum," Ian "You've laid out some good reasons but as you state, both the Conservative and Labour vote increased...... why?Because of a huge amount of tactical voting especially driven by social media.A lot of the "Remainers" had been horrified about the way that she'd embraced a Hard Brexit and even though Labour supported Brexit, they felt that not voting Tory would potentially hinder this outcome.Labour need to bear this in mind too.As a lot of people like me "lent" them their vote," Paul, Newcastle-under-Lyme "Was there any evidence to suggest that tactical voting also played a part in the demise of the Conservative majority?Were voters were more likely to vote for their second choice party if it meant stopping a Tory candidate from winning their constituency?Clearly this could have been a case in constituencies where non-contest agreements were forged e.g.Brighton Pavilion (Caroline Lucas), and in Twickenham where there was an absence of any campaign leaflets from any parties other than Lib Dems and Conservatives," John, London I am surprised by your list of reasons for the Conservative election results.For me this is very much about Brexit and Theresa May's stance.She was a remainer but since being elected has used a rhetoric which concerns much of the UK population.So this result is a protest against hard Brexit which will damage the UK economy beyond repair.It is also the young peoples's recognition that their vote matters.Had they voted in the referendum the result would have been remain, and they are angry and want their voices heard, Louise, Hampshire "The media, including the BBC, displayed an attitude of sneering contempt towards Jeremy Corbyn ever since he was elected Labour Party leader right up to the recent election campaign.Even the Guardian only endorsed Corbyn at the last minute, when it sensed which way the tide was running.This must raise serious questions about how 'free' our media really are, and who plots their editorial course.Time for another independent enquiry, perhaps?," John, Coventry "Another nail in the coffin of May's majority is her too-cosy relationship with Trump and particularly her failure to unreservedly condemn him for pulling the US out of the Paris Agreement.Saying that she was 'disappointed' was nowhere near strong enough," Ron, Cambridgeshire "It will be a rare day a Conservative calls another election without a 35 point lead in the polls.No wonder Labour is cambering for another election, Labour would rather enjoy another election in the next six months.Whereas, as a postman, I would not."Paul, Lincolnshire Everyone is tired of austerity, even those who are managing well.It's interesting how many of the affluent, metropolitan elite voted Labour, even though they were the ones who would be paying the bulk of the extra taxes.Whether they would have voted the same way if they'd thought he actually stood a chance of winning is a different question.Paul, London
Guide: 2017 political party conferences:::::Autumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.Conservatives - 1-4 October in Manchester Image copyright PA The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45."I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn," the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: "Building a country that works or everyon."The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to "let the British lion roar".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of "emerging plots" among some MPs.Labour - 24-27 September in Brighton Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In full: Jeremy Corbyn's 75 minute speech Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was "on the threshold of power".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the "political mainstream" because its polices were "what most people in our country actually want".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government "hanging by a thread".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting "Oh, Jeremy Corbyn" for a full two minutes before he had even begun.This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result.There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound.But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP - 8-10 October in Glasgow Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Opening her conference speech, Nicola Sturgeon says: "At the risk of tempting fate, I have come prepared" SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will "always make the case for independence" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The "essence of independence", she told activists, was being "in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at "close to cost price as possible".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to 840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be "truly transformational", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.Liberal Democrats -

7-10 October in Harrogate Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Greens told to look on the bright side after disappointing election Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the "hurt" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the "little guy" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change.He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in "community bonds".Plaid Cymru - 20-21 October in Caernarfon Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leanne Wood said Plaid Cymru had "the ambition to show a new way for Wales" Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference.She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a "rail revolution".The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat.Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting.
Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU:::::Here is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent.What's happening now?The UK has voted to leave the European Union.It is scheduled to depart on 29 March, 2019.Talks are currently taking place on three aspects of how Brexit will work - focusing on how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.The UK wants to talk about future trade relations - and a plan for a two year "transition" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.But the EU says they will not talk about the future until enough progress has been made on the other issues.What does Brexit mean?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.Why is Britain leaving the European Union?A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union.Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%.The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Find the result in your area What was the breakdown across the UK?England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%.Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%.Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU.Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave.See the results in more detail.What changed in government after the referendum?Image copyright PA Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May.The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum.Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU.She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out.Where does Theresa May stand on Brexit?Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want.Her key message has been that "Brexit means Brexit" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March.She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk.She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.How did the snap election change things?Image copyright Getty Images Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020).She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders.She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy.However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.What has happened to the UK economy since the Brexit vote?David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - and remains around 10% lower against the dollar and 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.The UK economy has continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017.Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3%, but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%.Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5% in the year to August 2017, according to official ONS figures.Brexit talks are under way They finally, officially, started on 19 June, 2017.Here's a picture from that first session: Image copyright Reuters The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month.Their first tasks are trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called "divorce bill", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border.You can find out more about the talks here.What is the European Union?The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list).It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other.It has since grown to become a "single market" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country.It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges.Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How does the European Union work?What is Article 50?Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU.It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009.Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure.What date will the UK will leave the EU?For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split.Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019.It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one.What's going to happen to all the EU laws in force in the UK?The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament.If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK.This "Great Repeal Bill" as it has been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny.Read a full guide to the bill.What is the Labour Party's position on Brexit?Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition.This is a considerably "softer" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.What do 'soft' and 'hard' Brexit mean?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, "hard" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if meant leaving the single market.At the other end of the scale, a "soft" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.What is the single market?The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place.Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market.In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country.It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it.The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices.But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a "level playing field".Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs.Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.Read more: A free trade area v EU single market What's the difference between the single market and the customs union?The customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU.It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area.In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods.It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Who is negotiating Britain's exit from the EU?Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit.Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary.These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it would be Mrs May, as prime minister, who would have the final say.Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.How long will it take for Britain to leave the EU?The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member.But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a "transition" period of up to three years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc.Why might Brexit take so long?Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task.It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along.The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.So why can't the UK just cut all ties in March 2019?The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a "cliff-edge" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight.They think it would harm the economy.What is the focus of negotiations between the UK and EU?The priority issues in negotiations are: 1) Agreeing what rights EU citizens already in the UK - and UK citizens living in the rest of the EU - will have after Brexit.2) Agreeing a figure for the amount of money the UK has to pay the rest of the EU "to settle its accounts", when it leaves.3) Working out what will happen on the border between Northern Ireland, when it is outside the EU, and the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU.The EU says it wants to make decent progress on these three issues before beginning talks about what the UK's relations with the EU will be like after Brexit.Mrs May set out her negotiating priorities in the letter officially triggering the process of leaving the EU on 29 March.Here's a guide to the key points.How are the talks going?There have been agreements on some technical points, but the chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said there had been no decisive progress on any of the main issues.The UK's Brexit Secretary, David Davis, insists progress has been made.The main sticking point at the moment is money - and the size of the bill the UK will pay to cover its outstanding obligations when it leaves.The UK wants this to be as low as possible.All the other countries in the EU want it to be as high as possible.Because when the UK leaves, there will be a hole in the EU budget and they will have to cover the shortfall.The UK government has published a series of papers setting out its position on issues such as future customs arrangements, and on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Government policy is now that the UK will leave the single market and the customs union on the day of Brexit, but that it will try to replicate existing customs arrangements during a time-limited transition period.What happens if there is no deal with the EU?Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care.Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could mean What happens to EU citizens living in the UK?It has yet to be agreed.All EU nationals lawfully resident in the UK for at least five years will be able to apply for "settled status" and be able to bring over spouses and children, under a 15-page proposal unveiled by Theresa May.Mrs May says she wants to give reassurance and certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland.But any deal on their future legal status and rights must be reciprocal and also give certainty to the 1.2 million British expats living on the continent after the UK leaves the EU - expected to be on 29 March 2019, she says.Michel Barnier, who is leading the Brexit negotiations for the EU, said the UK's proposals did not go far enough and he wanted the same level of protection citizens currently have under EU law.He has demanded more clarity and ambition from the UK government.The key points of the UK's proposals are: Those granted settled status will be able to live, work, study and claim benefits just as they can now The cut-off date for eligibility is undecided but will be between 29 March 2017 and 29 March 2019 Family members of EU citizens living abroad will be able to return and apply for settled status EU nationals in the UK for less than five years at the specified date will be able to continue living and working in the UK Once resident for five years, they can apply for settled status Those arriving after the cut-off point will be able to stay temporarily But there should be "no expectation" they will be granted permanent residence A period of "blanket residence permission" may apply to give officials time to process applications to stay in the UK The Home Office will no longer require evidence that EU citizens who weren't working held "comprehensive sickness insurance" Labour has said it would guarantee the rights of of EU citizens living in the UK to stay there on "day one" of a Labour government.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.What happens to UK citizens working in the EU?A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU.If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.What about EU nationals who want to work in the UK Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit.The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a "transition" phase of up to three years.However they will have to register.A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.What does the fall in the value of the pound mean for prices in the shops?Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shoppers will need to keep a close eye on how much they are spending People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened.This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen.The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.6%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Will immigration be cut?Image copyright PA Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a "sustainable" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year.The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote.This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries.There were still 246,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to March 2017, according to the latest estimates - some way above the government's target of 100,000.Could there be a second referendum?It seems highly unlikely.Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave.Will MPs get a vote on the Brexit deal?Yes.Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process.This vote is currently proposed as a "take it or leave it" one.Labour wants the vote to have the option of sending the UK team back to renegotiate.It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.Will I need a visa to travel to the EU?The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals.No agreement has been reached yet, however.If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Image copyright Reuters Will I still be able to use my passport?Yes.It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same.In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.Has any other member state ever left the EU?No nation state has ever left the EU.But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation.The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.What does this mean for Scotland?Image copyright Reuters Image caption Nicola Sturgeon says a new independence referendum in Scotland is likely Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was "democratically unacceptable" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain.Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held.She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021.Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.What does it mean for Northern Ireland?The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland is a key part of the Brexit talks.There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic.Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum.The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.The UK government has published a paper setting out its vision for a post-Brexit border.It wants to avoid returning to a "hard border" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts.There would be no CCTV cameras or number plate recognition technology at the border, or set back from it.Instead, the UK government is arguing for a wide-ranging exemption under which small and medium-sized businesses will not have to comply with any new customs tariffs.If the proposals are accepted, customs officials envisage using a mix of technology and physical checks to monitor the compliance of bigger businesses engaged in international trade.Critics say the proposals lack credible detail, with Labour deriding the plans for the border as "a fantasy frontier".Sinn Fein, which was part of the ruling coalition in the Northern Ireland Assembly before it was suspended, has called for a referendum on leaving the UK and joining the Republic of Ireland as soon as possible.The Conservatives have rejected Sinn Fein's call, saying there was no evidence opinion had shifted in favour of a united Ireland.How much has Brexit cost so far and how much will it cost by the end?There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.Various figures ranging from 50bn (44bn) to 100bn (88bn) euros have been bandied about but although the UK has agreed to meet its financial obligations, Brexit secretary David Davis has said: "We will not be paying 100bn."The UK could leave without any Brexit "divorce bill" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court.If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.How will pensions, savings, investments and mortgages be affected?During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called "triple lock" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit.This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low.There are few signs yet that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England enough to consider raising interest rates.But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Will duty-free sales on Europe journeys return?Image copyright Thinkstock Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an "upside" or "silver lining" of Brexit.As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the "customs union" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Will EHIC cards still be valid?Image copyright Thinkstock If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more here.Will cars need new number plates?Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could MPs block an EU exit?Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying?The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit.But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.Will leaving the EU mean we don't have to abide by the European Court of Human Rights?The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution.It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.There have been longstanding plans to repeal the act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights.What about the European Court of Justice?The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority.It is based in Luxembourg.It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects.The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade.It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the "direct" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit.But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided.There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The UK has set out some ideas in a position paper, which was criticised for being too "vague".The EU is insisting that its citizens in the UK should continue to enjoy the legal protection of the ECJ even after Brexit, guaranteeing their right to work and access to benefits among other things.This is a major sticking point in the negotiations, with the UK saying EU citizens living in the UK should be subject to British law only.Will the UK be able to rejoin the EU in the future?BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU.Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining.But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands.New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.Who wanted the UK to leave the EU?The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU.They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet.A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to leave?They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return.They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work.One of the main principles of EU membership is "free movement", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country.The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of "ever closer union" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a "United States of Europe".Who wanted the UK to stay in the EU?Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in.He said the deal would give Britain "special" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in.The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign.The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in.The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to stay?Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services.They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.What about businesses?Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world.Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU.Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound.Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Boris Johnson was one of the most prominent Leave campaigners Who led the rival sides in the campaign?Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU was headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose.It was backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who ran the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party.Who funded the campaign: Britain Stronger in Europe raised 6.88m, boosted by two donations totalling 2.3m from the supermarket magnate and Labour peer Lord Sainsbury.Other prominent Remain donors included hedge fund manager David Harding (750,000), businessman and Travelex founder Lloyd Dorfman (500,000) and the Tower Limited Partnership (500,000).Read a Who's Who guide.Who else campaigned to remain : The SNP ran its own remain campaign in Scotland as it did not want to share a platform with the Conservatives.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Britain Stronger

Lawson and SDP founder Lord Owen were also involved.It had a string of affiliated groups such as Farmers for Britain, Muslims for Britain and Out and Proud, a gay anti-EU group, aimed at building support in different communities.Who funded the campaign: Vote Leave raised 2.78m.Its largest supporter was businessman Patrick Barbour, who gave 500,000.Former Conservative Party treasurer Peter

party ran its own campaign.The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition also ran its own out campaign.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Will the EU still use English?Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler.There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - "much to France's chagrin", she says.Will Brexit harm product safety?Probably not, is the answer.It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards.Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this page Which MPs were for staying and which for leaving?The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list.Click here for the latest version.How much does the UK contribute to the EU and how much do we get in return?In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out.Only France and Germany contribute more.In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to 4.6bn in 2014/15.According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was 8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was 5.7bn.Read more number crunching from Reality Check.If I retire to Spain or another EU country will my healthcare costs still be covered?David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans.This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen.At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS.After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment.In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note.If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.What will happen to protected species?Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least.After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap.The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied.The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.How much money will the UK save through changes to migrant child benefits and welfare payments?Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels.We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out.HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about 30m.But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted.Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of 6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his "emergency brake" was applied.The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts would have been phased in.New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided.The plan will never be implemented now.Will we be barred from the Eurovision Song Contest?Image copyright BBC/Guy Levy Image caption To participate in the Eurovision Song Contest countries need to be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, which is independent of the EU Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry.We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: "All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union.The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe.Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC."What will happen to pet passports?The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws.It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU."Has Brexit made house prices fall?Image copyright PA So far, the answer is no.But there has been anecdotal evidence of house prices falling at the top of the market in Central London and the annual increase in the price of property has fallen from 9.4% at the time of the referendum to 4.9% a year later.What is the 'red tape' that opponents of the EU complain about?Ged, from Liverpool, suspects "red tape" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection.According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related.The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs 4.7bn a year, tops the list.The working time directive (4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019.Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them.Brexit may also generate "red tape" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Will Britain be party to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership?Ste, in Bolton, asked about this.The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of 10bn a year.But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights.US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the TTIP agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.What impact will leaving the EU have on the NHS?Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS.This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was 350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead.The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses.The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as "scaremongering" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned.EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).Sally Miller bought a house in Spain nine years ago and plans to retire there in the next five years.She asked how Brexit will affect this.Image copyright Getty Images The BBC's Kevin Connolly says: The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations.We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.Jonathan Eaton is a Briton living in the Netherlands with his wife, who is Dutch.He asks what rights to benefits and housing he will have if he has to return to the UK.Image copyright Getty Images BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says: The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits.As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens.The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months.For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months.And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away.After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK.It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning.But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work.That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit.The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad.And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain.Will I have to buy a new passport and driving licence, and will my rights to use them freely across Europe be taken away from me after Brexit, asks Francis Lee.Image copyright Getty Images Kevin Connolly says: At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU.That will presumably change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire.That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU.Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all.The right to use them freely is an interesting question.When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country.If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa.And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK.Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.It is very clear that the PM and the government want to leave the tyranny of the European Court of Justice.Why has leaving the European Court of Human Rights (an organisation far more hated than the ECJ) been ignored, asks Barry Fryer.Image copyright Getty Images Kevin Connolly says: Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics.Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law.So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Adrian Wallis runs a small electronics company and wants to know about export tariffs after Brexit, and what they'd mean for his business.Kevin Connolly says: As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs.That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free.On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own.That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.Image copyright Thinkstock One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example.Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades.They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.What impact will leaving the European Union have on the UK's long term political influence in Europe, asks Peter Hoare.Norman Smith says: There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners.For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Are other countries likely to leave the EU and if so could we start a new free trade area, asks David John.Kevin Connolly says: Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent.When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Image copyright Getty Images Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations.And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland.But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.What will happen to the borders in Gibraltar and Northern Ireland, asks Nigel May.Kevin Connolly says: I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back.Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was "a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.Image copyright Getty Images The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too.The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.How will access to healthcare change for expats living in the EU, asks Veronique Bradley, who lives in Italy.Kevin Connolly says: Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union.After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.What will happen to EU nationals who lived and worked in the UK and now receive a British state pension, asks Peter Barz, a German citizen living in the UK.Norman Smith says: If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Image copyright Getty Images Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, "I paid in there", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Is it possible to be both an EU citizen and not an EU citizen, asks Declan O'Neill, who holds an Irish passport.Kevin Connolly says: I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.Image copyright Getty Images The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Is there a get-out clause for Article 50, asks Gillian Coates.Norman Smith says: I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.Image copyright Thinkstock However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Eric Degerland asks when UK passports are going to change.Kevin Connolly says: This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about.It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words "European Union" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.Image copyright Getty Images But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire.So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would.The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK?Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights.The EU demands that it does.This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed?Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property.Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in.So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living

Theresa May's cabinet: Who's in and who's out?:::::Theresa May has formed her new government after the Conservatives lost their majority in the general election.The prime minister's room for manoeuvre in the reshuffle was limited when her party was left with 318 MPs and Labour had 262.Here's what we know so far.The list will be updated as new appointments are made.Prime Minister - Theresa May Image copyright Reuters Theresa May stays as prime minister despite not achieving the mandate for Brexit she had called the election for.The UK's second female PM took up the role after David Cameron resigned in the wake of the EU referendum result.She had previously been home secretary for six years.Theresa May: Full profile Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance First Secretary of State - Damian Green Image copyright AFP Damian Green has been promoted to a new role the prime minister did not have in her first cabinet - that of first secretary of state.As the same time he also replaces Ben Gummer as minister for the Cabinet Office after Mr Gummer lost his seat in the election.The move effectively makes the former work and pensions secretary, a friend and ally of Theresa May, her second in command.It could see Mr Green standing in for Mrs May at PMQs when she is not available.The role - which was previously held by George Osborne and, under Labour, Peter Mandelson - gives Mr Green seniority over other cabinet ministers.Chancellor of the Exchequer - Philip Hammond Image copyright PA Philip Hammond remains as chancellor of the exchequer.He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary.Mr Hammond, 61, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands steering Britain's economy through the post-Brexit period ahead.Sometimes mocked as "box office Phil" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending "axeman".Foreign Secretary - Boris Johnson Image copyright AFP No change at the Foreign Office as Boris Johnson keeps his job.Despite hints from some of the newspapers that Mr Johnson, 52, may turn his hand to trying to lead the party, he has categorically dismissed such claims.Mr Johnson said that while the public would be wondering about the future of the current government, Mrs May had got the biggest Conservative mandate anyone had achieved for decades."I'm going to be backing her, and absolutely everybody I'm talking to is going to be backing her as well."Home Secretary - Amber Rudd Image copyright Reuters Amber Rudd remains as home secretary despite only narrowly holding her seat as MP for Hastings and Rye.During the election campaign, she stood in for the PM in the BBC's televised debate in May.Ms Rudd was previously energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.The former investment banker, venture capitalist and financial journalist, aged 53, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get "a grip on her life".Secretary of State for Exiting the EU - David Davis Image copyright Reuters David Davis keeps his job of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or "Brexit secretary".The role was created in July to take the lead in negotiating the UK's exit from the EU.A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister.Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron.Mr Davis, 68, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest.Defence Secretary - Michael Fallon Image copyright AFP Michael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 65-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, Mr Fallon has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Secretary of State for International Trade - Liam Fox Image copyright AFP Liam Fox, 55, continues as the secretary of state for international trade.He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Mr Fox stood in the leadership race against Theresa May but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.He told reporters he was "delighted" to keep the job he has held since July last year."It's now time for the whole of the Conservative party to rally behind the prime minister and get a government in the national interest."Justice Secretary - David Lidington Image copyright PA Former Leader of the House of Commons David Lidington gets the job of justice secretary, replacing Liz Truss.He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moved across to aid the smooth running of the Commons in 2016.The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992.He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Leader of the House of Lords - Baroness Evans Image copyright PA Baroness Evans of Bowes Park keeps her job as the leader of the House of Lords.When appointed in 2016, it was her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Health Secretary - Jeremy Hunt Image copyright Reuters Jeremy Hunt remains in his post despite the problems within the NHS.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and at the time described the appointment as the "biggest privilege of my life".But in a tweet he admitted there were "challenges ahead, but also huge opportunities to make our NHS even better".Last year, Mr Hunt was locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which led to a series of strikes.Education Secretary - Justine Greening Image copyright PA Justine Greening has kept her roles as education secretary and minister for women and equalities.She is part of the most diverse Parliament yet as she openly defines herself as a lesbian.At London Pride in 2016, the 48-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying "I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!".Ms Greening replaced Nicky Morgan at education in 2016, leaving her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in 2011.She has been MP for Putney since 2005.Transport Secretary - Chris Grayling Image copyright Reuters Chris Grayling remains as transport secretary in Theresa May's cabinet.The former Leader of the House has been dealing with Southern Rail's disrupted services, the question of Heathrow's third runway and the high speed rail link, HS2.He also served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.Culture Secretary -

David Gauke Image copyright AFP A sideways step for David Gauke, with the PM appointing him as the new work and pensions secretary.He was previously the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who attends cabinet but does not have a ministerial role.Mr Gauke has been the MP for Hertfordshire South West since 2005.He is a qualified solicitor and worked for a leading City firm until he was elected.Communities Secretary - Sajid Javid Image copyright AFP Sajid Javid keeps his job as secretary of the department for communities and local government.He held this position in 2014 before being appointed to business secretary a year later.A former managing director of Deutsche Bank, Mr Javid has been MP for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire since 2010.He stood on a "joint ticket" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Northern Ireland Secretary -

David Mundell Image copyright Reuters David Mundell will continue as secretary of state for Scotland.He is one of 13 Scottish Conservatives to be in Parliament after this snap election.Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.In January 2015, Mr Mundell became the first openly-gay Conservative cabinet secretary.Conservative Party chairman and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster - Patrick McLoughlin Image copyright AFP Patrick McLoughlin remains as the Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.He left his role as transport secretary in 2016 but has been an MP since 1986.The former miner also served as chief whip after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.Business and Energy Secretary - Greg Clark Image copyright PA Greg Clark keeps his job as secretary of state of business, energy and industrial strategy.The role, when it was created by Labour's Gordon Brown, was originally called the Department of Energy and Climate Change.Last year, it was merged into the new department and lost the "climate change" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.International Development Secretary - Priti Patel Image copyright Reuters Priti Patel remains as International Development Secretary.She was promoted from her role as employment minister, which she held for a year, in 2016.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of "divide and rule politics" during the referendum campaign for claiming that "biased" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.In other appointments:

GOP tax bill shrouded in secrecy:::::Rank-and-file House Republicans are increasingly alarmed by the secrecy shrouding the massive tax bill their party leaders plan to ram through Congress next month.Just days ahead of the legislations release, GOP members of the House Ways and Means Committee are still in the dark on numerous details being ironed out by the powerful tax-writing committees chairman, Kevin Brady (R-Texas), and his staff.And theyre blaming the panels top-down approach for the uncertainty.Story Continued Below There are a lot of open issues, said Rep. Jim Renacci (R-Ohio), echoing comments made by several of his colleagues on the committee.Heading into the weekend, question marks remained on at least two high-profile proposals to offset the cost of slashing individual and business tax rates: curbing federal deductions for state and local taxes and business interest as well as potential changes to taxing retirement savings.The uneasy feeling among members extends to their tax aides, whove been excluded from a recent series of hours-long member meetings with Brady and his tax counsels.Several personal office tax staffers to committee Republicans indicated that theyre grappling with how to brace their bosses for the coming lobbyist wave.Well-funded special interests are ready to pounce on the tax bill when Brady brings it out Nov. 1; aides are worried about the onslaught, particularly over any surprises in the legislation.You could potentially see some bombs in there, one aide said.Morning Tax Sign up for our tax policy newsletter and stay informed weekday mornings, in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Part of the logic behind restricting access to the text stems from an eagerness to keep lobbyists at bay for as long as possible.Theres also precedent; former Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp introduced tax reform legislation in 2014 after keeping final language under tight wraps until soon before the now-retired Michigan Republican released it.(And when he did, the bill bombed.)But lawmakers, even those on the tax-writing committee, simply dont always have the same level of understanding of the issues in play as their professional staff, the same aide said on condition of anonymity because of sensitivities around the talks.Aides arent expected to join the next series of Ways and Means Republican meetings, which are scheduled for Monday afternoon and all day Tuesday.Brady has said he plans to introduce the tax bill on Wednesday, and begin considering it in committee the following week.Chairman Brady and Ways and Means members will meet next week to discuss final details before they introduce the tax reform text, said a spokeswoman.Aides have been told theyd receive a briefing before the bill emerges, but that huddle could come as late as Tuesday night, another Ways and Means staffer said.Even President Donald Trumps chief tax negotiators havent been fully briefed, though Treasury Department officials were supposed to get looped in a bit more over the weekend, a Ways and Means aide said.The approach by House Republicans stands in stark contrast to the other end of the Capitol, where top Senate Republicans want to ensure all GOP senators feel they have buy-in from the start a desire to avoid retracing the steps that led to their failed Obamacare repeal attempt.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has convened meetings with Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and a handful of key Republicans on the Senates tax-writing panel, as well as GOP senators not on the committee, to gauge their needs, aides said.Its so complex and there are so many moving parts, said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas).Weve tried to learn our experience on health care and do better on taxes.Republicans on the Finance Committee have paired up with other GOP senators in a buddy system of sorts to ensure all GOP senators are included in the process.For instance, South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No.3 Senate Republican who sits on the Finance Committee, has been in touch with Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), who in turn has been lobbying to include her paid leave tax credit proposal in the overall GOP blueprint.Sen. Bob Corker, the retiring Tennessee Republican who has repeatedly raised concerns about the potential deficit-busting impact of a GOP tax bill, has also met privately with McConnell and Finance Committee Republicans to lay out his priorities, a spokeswoman said.Corker has also spoken with Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).Senate GOP leaders will also ensure their tax proposal, expected to be released sometime after House Republicans unveil their legislation next week, gets considered by the Senate Finance Committee another marked difference from the botched health care process.Cornyn, the second-ranking Senate Republican, sketched out an ambitious goal of passing its tax legislation by Thanksgiving giving GOP senators just under four weeks to move legislation overhauling the tax code even though the actual bill has not been released.We can be up and running in a day.We know where we want to go, insisted Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the chairman of the Finance Committee.Still, Hatch added of the GOP conference-wide lobbying effort: Everybody wants something.Theyre all over us on what they want.House and Senate Democrats, meanwhile, have been almost completely shut out of the discussions.Republicans plan to use powerful budget reconciliation procedures that circumvent Democratic filibusters, so broad bipartisan support wont be required.
Feinstein sends Russia inquiries to White House, Facebook, Twitter:::::Sen. Dianne Feinstein is working on legislation that would make it illegal for Americans to take help from foreign nationals to influence an election.| Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Feinstein sends Russia inquiries to White House, Facebook, Twitter Feinstein sent five letters to key players, including one asking Facebook and Twitter for copies of advertising that Russian buyers aimed at the U.S.The Senate Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein of California, on Friday launched several new investigative queries about Russian electoral meddling without sign-on from the panel's GOP chairman.The solo step from Feinstein follows something of a split between her and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), as they have begun pursuing separate avenues of inquiry regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election.Feinstein is working on legislation that would make it illegal for Americans to take help from foreign nationals to influence an election, while Grassley is zeroing in on an inquiry of his own into a Russian uranium sale approved by Hillary Clinton's State Department.Story Continued Below Feinstein sent five letters to key players, including one asking Facebook and Twitter for copies of advertising that Russian buyers aimed at the U.S. Another expansive request from Feinstein asks the White House to produce documents regarding President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, as well as the firing of FBI Director James Comey.Feinstein's other letters seek information from Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and Cambridge Analytica, a data firm engaged by the Trump campaign that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has said reached out to him last year amid his website's public posting of hacked emails from the Clinton campaign.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.The California Democrat earlier this month suggested that partisan pressures could hurt Congress' ability to come to a final conclusion on whether Trump associates colluded with Russian entities during the election, describing special counsel Robert Mueller as best positioned to address the issue."What happens in a political body and I am finding this as the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee everything has to be negotiated with the party in power, and it's very difficult to do an investigation under those circumstances," Feinstein told CBS' "Face the Nation" on Oct. 8.
Grassley slams 'ridiculous' delay in JFK document rollout:::::"Thx for kennedy files release Ridiculous that CIA wants to review to redact," Sen. Chuck Grassley tweeted Friday.| Alex Brandon/AP Photo Grassley slams 'ridiculous' delay in JFK document rollout 'Ridiculous that CIA wants to review to redact,' the Iowa Republican tweets.Sen. Chuck Grassley called it "ridiculous" that files relating to the 1963 assassination of former President John F. Kennedy were not fully released by Thursday's congressional deadline, expressing frustration that even after more than 50 years, intelligence agencies were still seeking more time for review."Thx for kennedy files release Ridiculous that CIA wants to review to redact," the Iowa Republican tweeted Friday."YeGods u had fifty yrs NOW CIA WANTS FURTHER COVERUP/POTUS STOP."Story Continued Below Grassley later quipped on Twitter that now that the latest batch of documents was made accessible, educational programming would be able to report on "real history.""Now w Kennedy FileS being released the HISTORY CHANNEL has opportunity for real history instead of BEING NONHISTORY CHANNEL," he said.President Donald Trump on Thursday delayed the release of some documents still unreleased by the National Archives pertaining to the Kennedy's assassination in Dallas.The White House announced that while some 2,800 pages would be released by Thursday's deadline, set by a decades-old law, others would continue to be reviewed and made public on a "rolling basis."Trump cited security concerns over the sensitivity of the information in withholding the remaining documents, which were due to be released in accordance with a law signed by former President George H.W.Bush on Oct. 26, 1992."I have no choice today but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our Nation's security," the president wrote in a memo.On Friday, the president tweeted that the "JFK Files are being carefully released.In the end, there will be great transparency.It is my hope to get just about everything to public!"A White House official told POLITICO Trump was holding back the full release largely at the behest of the FBI and the CIA.The CIA said Thursday they "welcome" the president's decision to allow agencies to continue reviewing documents.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time."CIAs current redactions were undertaken with the intent to protect information in the collection whose disclosure would harm national security including the names of CIA assets and current and former CIA officers, as well as specific intelligence methods and partnerships that remain viable to protecting the nation today," a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement.The Iowa senator's comments on Friday served as one of his more forceful calls for the release of the Kennedy files.Grassley earlier this month vouched for a Senate resolution that called for the federal government to release all the remaining documents relating to Kennedy's death.Americans deserve a full picture of what happened that fateful day in November 1963, Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement.The assassination of President Kennedy occurred at a pivotal time for our nation, and, nearly 54 years later, we are still learning the details of how our government responded and what it may have known beforehand.

GOP eyes end of Russia probes with Trump collusion unanswered:::::Republican lawmakers say theyre approaching the end of their investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election even though the most politically explosive issue whether associates of President Donald Trump colluded with the Kremlin remains unresolved.That will present Democrats who have spent a year amplifying suspicions about Trumps own ties to Russia with a wrenching choice: to join Republicans and set aside the most momentous aspect of their probes or to break from the GOP and end any chance of presenting a united front against a continuing Russian threat.Story Continued Below Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) has suggested his panels investigation will end early next year, emphasizing that he wants to wrap up by February, ahead of the first 2018 primary elections.His panel still has a long list of witnesses to interview, but Burr described the timeline as a "mathematical equation," one pitting the ability of the committee to schedule meetings against the calendar.And hes hinted its possible the report will find no evidence of collusion between Trump allies and Moscow.If theres evidence that there was something there, that will be laid out.If theres no evidence, how could anybody object to it?Burr said.Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), whos leading the House Intelligence Committees Russia probe, told POLITICO this week that he hopes to finish before the Senate.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Conaway said he intends to seek a meeting with Burr, as well as the House and Senate committees top Democrats Rep. Adam Schiff of California and Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia to sketch out their panels conclusions and attempt to generally align their reports.Wildly divergent conclusions, he said, could embarrass the institution and could send mixed messages about the urgency of the Russian threat.Schiff said in an interview that he agrees with Conaway on the need for a meeting of the four committee leaders as well as his drive to come to a unified bipartisan conclusion.I think, frankly, it would be a good idea for the four of us to be collaborating as we go along rather than wait until the conclusion of our investigation, Schiff said.I second Mikes suggestion and actually think it would be worthwhile.But a kumbaya moment may be wishful thinking when it comes to questions about collusion.In the House, and possibly the Senate as well, bringing the Russia probes to a close is likely to trigger a partisan showdown.Some Republicans on the committees have publicly dismissed allegations that Trump allies might have helped Russias interference campaign.Theyve seen no conclusive evidence suggesting collusion occurred, and theyre weary after interviewing scores of witnesses who they say have shed little new light on the matter.Weve hit the point of diminishing returns long ago, said Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho.)Weve looked at lots of stuff.At some point in time, the jury needs to reach a verdict.Warner didn't rule out the possibility of a meeting with Burr, Conaway and Schiff, though he dismissed as "preliminary" an effort to stave off a partisan splintering."We're still operating in a very collaborative fashion," Warner said in an interview.Democrats, though, seem increasingly resigned to the fact that their probes may end without a conclusion on whether any Americans aided the Russian interference effort.Its quite possible that six months from now, there will be unanswered questions that we cant answer because the people we would need to answer those questions are in Russia, said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.).The probability that were going to produce a report that buttons down every question is pretty low.Warner has said hed readily accept it if the Senate investigation finds no evidence of collusion.[I]f theres not something there, Ill be the first to acknowledge that, the Virginia Democrat told The New York Times this week.The painful choice for Democrats is whether to attempt to forge a fragile compromise with Republicans that depicts what both parties generally agree on: that Russia orchestrated a massive interference campaign to undermine U.S. politics and stoke intense division.That would likely mean abandoning a definitive determination on collusion or punting to special counsel Robert Mueller, whos leading a criminal probe of possible crimes connected to the Russian plot.But even Democratic unity on those questions may be challenging."Im not signing on to any report unless its a bipartisan report," Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a member of the intelligence panel, said in an interview.Manchin also disputed the notion that "we're going to be that far apart" in the end."Its up to us to come together and say, 'OK, we agree,'" he added.Schiff and fellow California Rep. Eric Swalwell, two of the most outspoken House Intelligence Committee Democrats, say they too hope for unity but emphasized that despite the absence of a smoking gun, theyve seen compelling evidence of Trump allies intent to collude.We may not find the crime on videotape, but I believe we have already seen evidence of intent, Swalwell said.But our investigation is ongoing and we havent reached a conclusion.Swalwell pointed to a slew of storylines in which figures in Trumps orbit contacted Kremlin-associated Russians.Theres the secret meeting with Kremlin-connected Russians that the presidents son, Donald Trump Jr., organized in Trump Tower ostensibly to obtain documents unfavorable to Hillary Clinton, as well as attempts by two Trump business associates to seek Kremlin help for a Trump Tower development in Moscow just as the presidential campaign was beginning in earnest.There also are lingering questions about Trumps first pick for national security adviser, Mike Flynn, and allegations he secretly assured Russias ambassador that Trump would lift Obama-imposed sanctions on Russia.And theres the mysterious admission by a GOP operative, who claimed connections to the Trump campaign, that he sought help from Russians to expose thousands of emails deleted from Clintons private server.Weve certainly seen evidence of an intention by the Trump campaign to collude with the Russians, Schiff said.I would hope that, at the end of the day, well come to a common conclusion on that as well.I think its too early to say.Himes noted that new twists seem to emerge constantly, pointing to a Daily Beast report this week that a Trump campaign data firm, Cambridge Analytica, acknowledged approaching WikiLeaks to try to procure Clinton's deleted emails.Schiff, who complained in a recent Washington Post op-ed that the White House was pressuring Congress to conclude its Russia probes, may also find allies among Senate Democrats who say theres still a long way to go before theyll feel satisfied they turned over every rock in the investigation."I want to get actionable items in place that can secure our voting infrastructure by" the time that primaries begin next year, Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said in an interview."But I think we should follow the investigation where it takes us, irrespective of the timeframe."Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, also suggested he would have trouble signing on to any final report that left the collusion matter unresolved."The report has to be comprehensive," King said in a brief interview.How Republicans approach the issue of collusion, too, could determine whether Democrats join them.Barring any dramatic new evidence, Republicans like Rep. Peter King of New York would like to plainly state that lawmakers found no evidence of collusion.But they worry that might turn off some Democrats.Theyre too committed, King said.Theyre so dug in on this.
Capitol Hills sexual harassment policy toothless, a joke:::::Two female lawmakers and several congressional staffers are calling for an overhaul of Capitol Hills policies on sexual harassment, citing a culture of tolerance in a workplace long known as a boys club.The sexual harassment scandals involving major Hollywood and media figures are focusing new attention on Congress procedures, which critics say are woefully inadequate for deterring bad behavior in an institution filled with powerful men and young aides trying to advance their careers.Each congressional office operates as its own small, tightly controlled fiefdom with its own rules and procedures, which makes it that much harder to come forward.Story Continued Below Lawmakers and congressional aides are not required to undergo sexual harassment training a shortcoming even the office that handles complaints says should be changed.And victims must submit to as long as three months of mandated counseling" and mediation, as well as what one lawyer involved in such cases called a "cooling off period," before filing a complaint against an alleged perpetrator.That's assuming they're even aware of how to lodge a grievance.One former staffer who said she was sexually harassed by a colleague years ago told POLITICO she didnt know where to turn at the time.Shed never heard of the Office of Compliance, or OOC, the entity that exists to handle harassment complaints and enforce workplace protection laws for the legislative branch.When she called a congressional committee that deals with administrative issues to inquire about filing a complaint, she said, she was turned away without any guidance.I didnt even know it existed as a resource, the ex-staffer said of the compliance office.You dont have an HR Department on the Hill.Theres no one place that you go.Nobody on the Hill has any idea how you report and deal with sexual harassment.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Some officials are trying to change that.Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) next week will introduce legislation calling for an overhaul of the compliance office, which she said is constructed to protect the institution and to impede the victim from getting justice.On Friday, she will release a video recounting her experience years ago as a congressional staffer, when the office's chief of staff "held my face, kissed me and stuck his tongue in my mouth," she said.Many of us in Congress know what its like, because Congress has been a breeding ground for a hostile work environment for far too long, Speier continued.Its time to throw back the curtain on the repulsive behavior that has thrived in the dark without consequences.In an interview Thursday, Speier called the OOC toothless and a joke.She said it encumbers the victim in ways that are indefensible.Theres no accountability whatsoever, she said.Its rigged in favor of the institution and the members, and we cant tolerate that.The call to overhaul the OOC comes as 40 percent of female congressional staffers say theres a sexual harassment problem on Capitol Hill, according to a July survey conducted by Roll Call.The survey found that one in six female aides said theyd personally been sexually harassed in their offices, and only 10 percent were aware of structures that existed to report misconduct.OOC Deputy Executive Director Paula Sumberg defended her office."Any current staffer who has not heard of the Office of Compliance has somehow missed our emailed Annual Notification of Rights, our quarterly eNewsletters, and information about us on the House intranet, Sumberg said in an email.But even the OOC appears to acknowledge flaws in the system.In recent years, it has recommended that Congress make sexual harassment training mandatory.And the OOC recently urged Congress to raise its profile, noting that some training seminars for staffers don't mention the office as a resource for workplace disputes.Multiple staffers, including some whove worked on Capitol Hill for years, said there is a dearth of information about the OOC.So it's not readily apparent where to turn when a colleagues or even a boss actions become inappropriate.That was the case for former staffers in former Rep. Tim Murphys office.Aides who called POLITICO to detail a hostile work environment slammed doors, cursing, timed bathroom breaks and verbal abuse said they were either unaware of the OOC or told it was pointless to complain.Others feared retaliation.Even some lawmakers arent apparently aware of, or at least inclined to rely on, the OOC.In 2014, a group of female staffers accused Kenny West, the chief of staff to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), of making inappropriate comments toward them.But Meadows turned to his friend, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), for help.Meadows asked Gowdys chief of staff, a woman, to interview his aides to determine whether West had acted inappropriately, according to an Office of Congressional Ethics report.Gowdys staffer recommended Meadows fire the staffer, though Meadows kept him on payroll for months after that, the report said.A similar situation played out in the office of Rep. Eric Massa (D-N.Y.) in 2010, after he was accused of making unwanted advances toward a junior male staffer.A more senior aide in the office brought the matter to Rep. Steny Hoyers office, which instructed the aide to report the matter to the Ethics Committee.A House Administration Committee spokesman said Thursday that harassment on the Hill is "a serious issue" and that the panel is "currently evaluating what additional resources might be made available" to further help lawmakers and aides.She also argued that the Office of House Employment Counsel provides training, including sexual harassment awareness training, as does the Office of the House Chief Administrative Officer.President Donald Trumps former campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, painted a harsh picture of the reality facing women on Capitol Hill after a video emerged last year of Trump bragging about his sexual advances on women."I would talk to some of the members of Congress there when I was younger and prettier, them rubbing against girls, sticking their tongues down women's throats who were uninvited, didn't like it," Conway told MSNBC in October 2016.The comment was meant to defend Trump from lawmakers aghast by the Access Hollywood video.Conway's spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on which members she was talking about.Speier and Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) are looking to pre-empt such situations with legislation that would mandate sexual harassment training for every congressional office.Executive branch employees must undergo such training, but it is optional for congressional workers.Speier has introduced her bill every year since 2014, to no avail.One year, she came close to getting it passed when House appropriators agreed to tuck her bill into an appropriations measure only to see it stripped from a Senate spending package.Lawrence, who used to investigate harassment issues for the federal government, said she always checked whether training had been provided."This is a first step, and I know this is one that can make a difference," she said.When Speier introduces her bill again this year, the legislation will go beyond sexual harassment training and seek to overhaul the lengthy process Hill victims must go through before filing a complaint.As it stands now, after an incident but before filing a complaint, victims are required to go through 30 days of counseling with an OOC employee.Following that process, they have 15 days to decide whether they want to pursue the next step: 30 days of mandated mediation.After mediation, victims must wait another 30 days to file a complaint.The OOC allows anyone filing a complaint to ask to shorten the counseling period and doesnt require them to be in the same room as the accused during mediation, but Speier put little stock in those measures.Can you imagine a victim whos been sexually harassed who attempts to file a complaint and then is told theyve got to go through three months of biting their tongue and continuing to work in that kind of environment?she asked.Youve just been sexually harassed and youre told you have to be counseled for 30 days.Are you kidding me?Les Alderman, an attorney who has represented multiple congressional employees in harassment and discrimination cases, said that OOC officials do their best to do exactly what the law says they should.But he warned that the law that created the office has major downfalls.For one, Alderman said, the 30-day counseling period a harassment victim must undergo before pursuing a complaint is confidential.Alexis Ronickher, an employment rights lawyer at Katz, Marshall & Banks whos worked with sexual harassment victims in congressional offices, said that means victims can be sanctioned and their cases jeopardized if they say publicly that theyre filing a complaint against a lawmaker or fellow staffer.Its the strap of silence in my opinion that helps foster a broken system.The fact that you cant tell anyone that you filed a request for counseling or that youre in mediation, that everything that goes on there has to be confidential, she said.It creates an environment in which people dont talk about whats happening and women who are being sexually harassed cant come together and say, Im coming forward; you should come forward.Ronickher said it's not the Office of Compliance's fault as much as the 1995 Congressional Accountability Act, which governs how the office operates and the rules governing complaints.The GOP-controlled Congress created the OOC in 1995 amid the scandal involving then-Sen. Bob Packwood's rampant sexual harassment.Ten women told The Washington Post about the Oregon Republicans lewd behavior.The furor grew as Senate Republicans including then-Ethics Committee chairman and now-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) resisted holding hearings.Former Nevada Sen. Richard Bryan, then the ethics panel's top Democrat, recalled a drumbeat of complaints that eventually forced committee Republicans to join his call to act against Packwood.This wasnt just one woman there was a pattern, Bryan said in an interview.OOC fielded 49 requests for counseling during fiscal 2016, according to its most recent annual report, including six in the House and two in the Senate.Of those requests, 15 dealt with harassment or a hostile work environment.Despite the waiting periods, Sumberg said the OOCs process for dispute resolution is faster than that of other federal agencies.The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which polices harassment cases for those agencies, can take as long as 180 days to act on a discrimination charge, according to its website.We probably have the fastest administrative process for bringing a sexual harassment complaint in the entire federal government, Sumberg said by email.Alderman, the attorney who works with harassment and discrimination victims, noted another key difference between the OOCs process and the EEOCs work in other federal agencies.After an accuser has successfully navigated the system and won a complaint, the EEOC requires the posting of information about the perpetrators of discriminatory behavior, so that hopefully public notice and shame occurs.No such publicizing of a perpetrators past record is required in Congress.Its a system, Alderman said, that helps repeat offenders keep on repeating.POLITICO is taking a deeper look at Capitol Hill's sexual harassment policy.To share your stories confidentially with a reporter, please contact rbade@politico.com or eschor@politico.com.You can also anonymous share information with our reporting team using these tools.
Republicans spoil for a fight over Russia probe budget:::::Republicans trying to hobble Robert Muellers sprawling probe into President Donald Trump and Russia matters are about to get a new weapon: the special counsels budget.Lawmakers havent yet seen the Russia investigators first spending report, which must go through a Justice Department review before being made public.But theyre already setting up a fight over how much the probe is costing taxpayers and the fact that theres no end in sight.Story Continued Below For them to say to us, Vote for an open-ended appropriation into a Mueller witch hunt, I think youll see significant objection there, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) told POLITICO.Muellers public budget is expected to contain only top-line figures covering broad categories like staff salaries, travel, outside contracts, supplies and equipment.But money will become a recurring fight as the investigation drags on, because Mueller is required to produce public expense reports every six months giving opponents repeated opportunities to paint him in a negative light.Partisan complaining about the expenses that pile up during lengthy Washington investigations is a familiar ritual.As President Bill Clinton faced impeachment in the House in 1998, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) called Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr a federally paid sex policeman spending millions of dollars to trap an unfaithful spouse.Outcry over spending of taxpayers' money also cropped up during the Iran-Contra investigation, whose outlays ultimately exceeded $47 million.Taxpayers of this country should be absolutely up in arms about it, then-Sen. Steve Symms (R-Idaho) said during a CNN appearance in 1992, six years into that probe.Complaints about spending over the Russia probes date to before Muellers appointment in mid-May.Trump himself took to Twitter just one day before he fired FBI Director James Comey kick-starting the whole special counsel process to say: The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?He went after the cost issue again on Friday morning, tweeting, "It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump.Was collusion with HC!"Critics have only gained momentum as Muellers probe has advanced.King in a July interview called for legislation imposing both a deadline and budget constraints on Mueller; otherwise, the Republican congressman warned, Trump could face a never-ending investigation that could go on for two presidential terms.Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) tried in August to offer an amendment to the House budget resolution that would have halted Muellers funding just six months into the job.No fishing expeditions, he told Fox News as he tried to sell the measure.While DeSantis couldnt overcome a procedural technicality and never got a floor vote, conservatives say theyre just getting started.The right-leaning watchdog group Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit earlier this month seeking Muellers budget documents.Several Republicans said in interviews theyd be keeping tabs on the special counsels spending through their oversight capacity, and they will hold out the threat of attaching language to DOJs annual spending bill or other must-pass legislation that places clear restrictions or prohibitions on Muellers authority.We still have power over the Department of Justice, warned Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), another Judiciary Committee member.As a practical matter, Congress cant go after Muellers day-to-day spending directly.His budget is being drawn out of a permanent Treasury Department account that is not subject to the annual appropriations process, and the DOJ regulations used to appoint Mueller state he shall be provided all appropriate resources to do his work.Mueller is subject to some oversight.He had to produce a budget proposal to DOJ earlier this summer for the next fiscal year.And an internal DOJ audit office must review the first 4 months of his spending receipts.Mueller isnt under day-to-day DOJ supervision, but Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general overseeing the investigation after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself, does have final say on some of the major decisions related to the Mueller probe, including his budget.Peter Carr, a Mueller spokesman, said the internal DOJ review must be completed before the special counsels spending report is made public.He declined to comment when asked about a timeline for its release.While firm details on how much Mueller has spent to date remain under wraps, sources familiar with the special counsels budget process say they expect the report to count up the salaries of 11 government attorneys who have been detailed from across other parts of DOJ, as well as five more people hired from outside government who are being paid using the scale for senior staff serving in a U.S. attorneys office.Mueller himself is earning the same $161,900 salary as a U.S. attorney.The special counsels spending report also will likely count any rent for office space in a Southwest Washington, D.C., office building whose exact location remains a closely held secret that his team has been using since the summer, according to sources familiar with Muellers budget process.Politically, Mueller, a former FBI director appointed by President George W. Bush, can count on some degree of bipartisan support from lawmakers who say they expect hell lead a budget-savvy investigation.Id be inclined to approve it, said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a key member on both the Senate Appropriations and Judiciary committees.He seems to be a pretty frugal guy.Conyers, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee since before the Clinton impeachment hearings, said in an interview earlier this week that he had no concerns about Muellers spending unless its something totally outrageous.The special counsels Republican budget critics, Conyers added, represent the few people who are sensitive about it.Whatever figure he comes up with, they wont like it too much, he said.Given Muellers mandate lawmakers note hes examining the authenticity of the presidential election several Democrats said he should have some running room to spend what he needs to.In view of the amount of money that we spend as a nation in any given year, clarifying what happened under these very serious circumstances I think is important today and its important for historys sake, said Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee.Were talking about the believability of any election in this county and were talking about undue influence by a nation that has never been known to support the principles of liberty or justice and theres a lot at stake here.Hes going to do what he can to acquit himself well.Hes got no ulterior motives.No fish to fry.He doesnt have any aircraft carriers hes got to buy from some contractor friend, added Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), a senior House Judiciary Committee member.Nadler also said hes not expecting Mueller to be held too tightly to subsequent budget requests because of unexpected circumstances that might arise given his wide-ranging investigation into the Trump campaign and the election.Any Republican bid to meddle with Mueller via his budget will come with political risks, according to lawmakers, several longtime congressional observers and attorneys who have worked on special counsel investigations.Charlie Houy, the former Democratic staff director on the Senate Appropriations Committee, acknowledged ample precedent for Congress to try to gain some control over the spending on a special counsel probe.However, he added, it would be real tricky to not be charged with trying to impede the investigation.That in itself should cause cooler heads to urge caution.Lawmakers who try to micromanage the probe could also be accused of messing with the justice system itself, said Randall Samborn, a Chicago-based lawyer who served as spokesman for then-U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald during the George W. Bush-era special counsel probe into who leaked the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson.Could you only imagine what would happen, whether its this investigation or any criminal investigation conducted by DOJ or the FBI, if the Hill started getting involved in setting the budget on a per-investigation basis?Samborn said.You could not conduct a confidential secretive grand jury investigation and have the accountability while its under way being scrutinized by partisan politics.Itd be the death knell of such an investigation.Considering his reputation running the FBI, several sources who have worked for previous special counsels said they expect Mueller will get the leeway he needs to do his work.But Julie Myers Wood, a former lead prosecutor during Starrs investigation, predicted the good will wont last forever.If the inquiry starts to drag on, I would expect significant attacks on the cost, both in terms of direct cost to the taxpayer and also in terms of the cost of the time it is taking the executive branch to respond to his queries, she said.The Starr investigation as well as the work of three other independent counsels who ran the case remains the most expensive in U.S. history costing more than $73 million, according to audits done by the Government Accountability Office.That single Clinton probe, which started in 1994 with an examination of the Clintons real estate deals in Arkansas took several unexpected turns over seven-plus years and ended up covering the suicide of White House attorney Vincent Foster, irregularities in the White House travel office, allegations of misuse of confidential FBI files, false statements by a top White House attorney and finally the presidents sexual affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.The investigation drew harsh political criticism for many reasons, including its spending: Over the full course of the probe it had more than 225 employees from the Justice Department and other federal agencies, including at least 65 consultants and outside advisers, according to a final report released in 2002.While the bulk of Starrs spending was detailed in summary format, on at least one occasion some of the embarrassing budget specifics did go public.House Democrats in 1998 released to the Los Angeles Times internal documents showing spending of $370 a month for a parking space for the independent counsel, a $32,380 bill to survey an Arkansas community where potential jurors would be seated in a trial of the state's governor, and $30,517 for a psychological analysis of the evidence connected to Fosters suicide.Despite the criticism, Starr senior counsel Paul Rosenzweig said there was never a serious effort to strip the independent counsels spending.The politics of trying to do so would be terrible optics, he said.Six separate investigations during the Clinton administration ran up costs of more than $140 million.President Ronald Reagan faced eight different probes, including Iran-Contra, for a total of more than $84 million, according to a POLITICO review of government audits and reports on their spending.In all, there have been 21 completed independent counsel and special counsel investigations dating back to the Carter administration.Their total price tag: $231 million $339 million when adjusted for inflation.Twelve of those cases concluded with no indictments.Just two of the 21 cases ended with the successful prosecution of a federal official who was named as the primary initial target: Reagan White House aide Michael Deaver, who was sentenced to three years of probation and fined $100,000 in 1988 after being convicted on three counts of perjury stemming from a conflict-of-interest investigation; and Clintons secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Henry Cisneros, who pleaded guilty in 1999 to a misdemeanor charge for lying to the FBI about payments made to his former mistress.Clinton pardoned Cisneros in January 2001, on his final day in office.The dearth of successful convictions, King said, is one of the main reasons he said hes raising alarm about the Mueller probes spending.Not many people on either side of the political aisle would point to one [special counsel investigation] and say its a satisfactory result, King said.Theyre messy.Theyre ugly.Theyre not conclusive.And theres division over them that runs in perpetuity, as long as we remember them in our history.

Corker: Trump administration moving ahead on delayed Russia sanctions:::::"Congress will expect thorough and timely consultation until full implementation is complete," Sen. Bob Corker said in a statement.| Win McNamee/Getty Images Corker: Trump administration moving ahead on delayed Russia sanctions Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle began clamoring for action after the Trump administration missed the Oct. 1 deadline.The State Department is set to begin implementing new Russia sanctions after lawmakers in both parties raised questions about the weeks-long delay, according to a Thursday statement from Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.).At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline to identify entities in the Russian defense and intelligence sectors in line for new sanctions under a sweeping bipartisan bill that President Donald Trump signed in August.Story Continued Below Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle began clamoring for action after the Trump administration missed that deadline, urging Trump to use the powers they gave him to get tougher on Moscow, and Corker said on Thursday that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's department would release the information imminently.The Trump administration's sanctions move "is a good first step in responsibly implementing a very complex piece of legislation, and I appreciate Secretary Tillersons attention to this important issue," Corker said in a statement."Congress will expect thorough and timely consultation until full implementation is complete.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.The Tennessean said on Wednesday that he would get answers from the administration on sanctions within 24 hours, and spoke with Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan about the issue on Thursday afternoon.A State Department spokesperson did not commit to releasing the guidance Thursday but vowed that it would be made available "shortly.""Its important that we get all the details precisely correct in implementing this complex piece of legislation," the spokesperson said."We also need to fully inform Congress of the steps were taking.Key industry stakeholders as well as our allies and partners around the world also need to hear from us on this important matter."
McConnell preps judicial confirmation frenzy:::::Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell teed up votes to install four nominees to the powerful appellate courts.| J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo McConnell preps judicial confirmation frenzy The transformation of the federal judiciary has been one of the early successes of Donald Trumps presidency.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is launching a circuit court confirmation blitz.The top Senate Republican on Thursday teed up votes to install four nominees to the powerful appellate courts, which give the final word on the vast majority of cases that dont reach the Supreme Court.Story Continued Below The nominees are Allison Eid for the 10th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals; Stephanos Bibas for the 3rd Circuit; Joan Larsen for the 6th Circuit; and Amy Coney Barrett for the 7th Circuit.Eid and Larsen are among the names Donald Trump floated during the presidential campaign last year as potential Supreme Court picks, adding more significance to their confirmations to the appellate courts.By confirming these nominees we can take a big step toward restoring our nations courts to their proper role: interpreting and applying the law based on what it actually says, not what a judge wishes it might say, McConnell said on the Senate floor.Its quite a departure from the last administrations philosophy when it came to selecting judicial nominees.Eid and Bibas were reported to have advanced out of the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier Thursday.Nominees typically have to wait a day after a committee vote before they can be considered on the floor, but Democratic senators gave consent to speed up the process in exchange for not working on a Friday, a McConnell spokesman said.Nonetheless, Senate Democrats say the nominees are being rushed to the floor, leaving senators little time to vet the candidates."I think it's awful fast to move," said California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee."I think members have to read the writings, members have to take a look at their qualifications, members are leaving today.We found about it today, and it's on the floor next week."Feinstein used a committee meeting earlier Thursday to highlight the fact that two of the court vacancies the panel moved to fill Thursday were open for Trump only because Republicans used the "blue slip" process to block President Barack Obamas nominees for the same slots.The committee had advanced six judicial nominees other than Eid and Bibas, as well as three U.S. attorney candidates to the Senate floor.Last year, the Obama administration nominated different people to these same vacancies, Feinstein noted, referring to slots on the 3rd Circuit and the district court in South Carolina.Those nominees didnt get blue slips from their home state senators, so their nominations didnt proceed.... Not returning blue slips is the right of home-state senators.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley didnt address the blue slip issue directly, but said Democrats should be wary about blocking female nominees in particular.I was disheartened by colleagues who voted against the two female nominees last week, Grassley said.When the Republicans voted against female circuit court nominees in 2013, Democrats called it unjust.I wont do that here to my friends, but I also dont want to see a double standard for qualified female nominees from different presidents.While Republicans and Democrats split along party lines over four of the judicial nominees, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) singled out Bibas for unusually blunt criticism.The Senate minority whip said an article Bibas authored in 2009 promoting electric shock and other forms of corporal punishment for criminals should keep him from the bench.I believe what Prof. Bibas wrote ... disqualifies him from a lifetime appointment to the second-highest court in the land, Durbin said.This man is outside the mainstream of American legal thinking.I believe hes outside the mainstream of conservative political thinking.Who has stepped forward on the Republican side and called for what this professor has called for?Durbin continued: "Democrat or Republican, seriously, are we going to vote this man into this position?The panel ultimately split 11-9 on Bibas nomination, as well as Eids to the 10th Circuit, Liles Burke to a district court seat in Alabama, and Michael Juneau to a district court judgeship in Louisiana.The transformation of the federal judiciary has been one of the enduring early successes of Trumps presidency, particularly because he entered office with an unusually high number of vacancies in the district and circuit courts.Conservative advocacy groups have been pressuring McConnell to confirm judicial nominees more quickly, although Trump already has gotten more judges installed at this point in his presidency than his predecessor.

Five interesting revelations from the newly released JFK files:::::Thousands of previously withheld records surrounding the investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy were released to the public Thursday evening, shedding some light on what has been the subject of intrigue for more than 50 years.Thursday marked the federal government's deadline to release the 3,100 unseen files, a deadline that was set by Congress in 1992 under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act.The documents have been held in the National Archives, and the majority are already public.The array of documents released ranged from fuzzy images of photos snapped by U.S. intelligence and hand-written notes that are hardly legible to information on CIA-planned mob hits on former Cuban leader Fidel Castro and memos surrounding Kennedy's killer, Lee Harvey Oswald.ADVERTISEMENT By no means do the records offer any bombshell revelations, but several documents give the public a peek into what happened in Dallas in 1963 and surrounding events.Here are five interesting things from the newest release of JFK files.Former CIA director: LBJ thought Kennedy assassination was payback for assassination of Vietnam president A document released Thursday quotes Richard Helms, former CIA director under Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon, saying: "President Johnson used to go around saying that the reason President Kennedy was assassinated was that he had assassinated President Diem."The document was from the 1975 deposition at Langley.CIA considered using mafia to kill Castro Robert Kennedy once told the FBI that an "intermediary had been hired by CIA" to consult mobster Sam Giancana about hiring a gunman for $150,000 to kill Castro in Cuba.The account is detailed in an FBI memorandum from 1975.The memo is part of an 83-page report that also said the CIA considered delivering a poison pill to kill Castro."Attorney General Kennedy stated that the CIA should never undertake the use of Mafia people again without first checking with the Department of Justice because it would be difficult to prosecute such people in the future," the report says."Mr. Kennedy further advised that because of this matter it would be very difficult to initiate any prosecution against Giancana, as Giancana could immediately bring out the fact that the United States Government had approached him to arrange for the assassination of Castro."Memo from Hoover details Soviets' 'shock and consternation' after Kennedy death A memo from former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover quotes a source within the USSR saying the Soviets were shocked by the news of Kennedy's death.The source said the news sparked "great shock and consternation and church bells were tolled in the memory of President Kennedy.""According to our source, officials of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believed there was some well-organized conspiracy on the part of the 'ultraright' in the United States to effect a 'coup,'" the memo said.The source said Soviet leaders instructed agents to immediately gather information on President Johnson following news of Kennedy's death.The FBI received an Oswald death threat the day before his murder Hoover, in a Nov. 24, 1963, report, said a man called into the FBI's office in Dallas saying he would kill Oswald just a day before he was shot and killed.Hoover says in the report the call was "from a man talking in a calm voice," saying he was a member of a committee to kill Oswald.Hoover points to Jack Ruby as Oswald's killer."There is nothing further on the Oswald case except that he is dead," Hoover says in the report."Ruby says no one was associated with him and denies having made the telephone call to our Dallas office last night."Hoover also said in the memo he had evidence of Oswald's guilt and was concerned there would be doubt by the public that Oswald was behind Kennedy's assassination.Kennedy considered creating bounty system that valued Castro at 2 cents The Kennedy administration in 1962 proposed creating a bounty system that would pay Cubans for killing communists and that valued Castro's life at just 2 cents.The proposed system is detailed in a report from the White House, and would have offered rewards ranging from 2 cents to $1 million.Officials planned on dropping leaflets by air over Cuba that would have described the prizes for specific communist leaders."One final leaflet may be deemed advisable and that one announcing a 0.02 reward for the delivery of Castro," the memo said.
First charges filed in special counsel Mueller's Russia probe: report:::::A federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., has reportedly approved the first charges in special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.CNN reported Friday that the charges are sealed under a federal judges order, with sources telling the network that those charged could be taken into custody as soon as Monday.ADVERTISEMENT It is unclear what the charges are, according to the network.A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment to The Hill.Mueller is investigating alleged ties between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials, and several congressional committees are also probing the matter.The U.S. intelligence community concluded in a report made public in January that the Kremlin sought to disrupt the 2016 election and sway the race in Trump's favor.The White House did not immediately respond to The Hill's request for comment Friday night about reports of charges being filed in the special counsel probe.But soon after CNN reported the charges, Trump posted a video on Twitter quoting an opinion piece in the New York Post suggesting that his former Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonBlumenthal: Trump-tied data firm reaching out to WikiLeaks significant Tillerson eliminates key State Department sanctions office: report Intel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it MORE may have colluded with Russia and sought to frame Trump as a "traitor."The Trump administration has appeared eager in recent days to shift attention to congressional probes regarding Clinton, after months of news coverage focused on possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.After The Washington Post reported this week that the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee funded the research contained in a controversial dossier alleging ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, Trump and his allies have sought to cast Clinton as the one with connections to Moscow."It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump.Was collusion with HC!"Trump asserted in a tweet Friday morning.After reports emerged Friday night about charges in the special counsel's Russia probe, Fox News host Sean Hannity, one of Trump's most vocal supporters, called the development a "distraction" on Twitter and questioned when Clinton would face charges.Mueller's investigative mandate includes any matters that may arise from the probe into Russian interference, and he has appeared in recent months to expand the scope of the probe to include possible financial crimes.The special counsel has appeared to take increasingly aggressive steps in recent months as part of the investigation, most notably against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.In July, the FBI conducted an early morning raid at Manafort's northern Virginia home, and later subpoenaed his spokesman and one of his former lawyers.According to CNN, lawyers working on Mueller's probe were seen entering the courthouse where the grand jury is convened.But after some activity, no announcements were made.Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May to oversee the investigation.Because Rosenstein oversees the special counsel conducting the probe, he would have been notified of any charges before they were filed, sources told CNN.The Justice Department declined to comment to The Hill.Updated: 10:56 p.m.
White House: All the women who accused Trump of sexual harassment are lying:::::The White Houses official position on the women who accused President Trump of sexual harassment is that they are lying, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders affirmed Friday.Yeah, weve been clear on that from the beginning and the president has spoken on it, Sanders said.ADVERTISEMENT Trump said earlier this month that the allegations against him, many of which emerged during the campaign after the leak of a 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which he makes lewd comments about women, are made-up stuff.All I can say is its totally fake news just fake, he said at an impromptu press briefing last week.Its fake, its made-up stuff.And its disgraceful what happens.At least 11 women came forward to accuse Trump of unwanted touching and kissing last year.When those allegations emerged, Trump called them "total fiction.""These are stories that are made up, these are total fiction.You'll find out that, in the years to come, these women that stood up, it was all fiction," he said."They were made up.I don't know these women, it's not my thing to do what they say."Trump also said he was the victim of one of the "great political smear campaigns in the history of our country."Sexual harassment allegations against media figures have been piling up this year, including against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.
Conservative site funded project that led to Trump dossier:::::A conservative publication set in motion the research that led to a dossier that includes unverified claims regarding ties between President Trump and Russia, the publication revealed on Friday.The Washington Free Beacon originally funded the project through the firm Fusion GPS, a connection the publications lawyers revealed for the first time to the House Intelligence Committee on Friday.The Washington Examiner first reported the connection and the Free Beacon then confirmed it.The publication stopped funding the project in the spring of 2016.At that point, Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonBlumenthal: Trump-tied data firm reaching out to WikiLeaks significant Tillerson eliminates key State Department sanctions office: report Intel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it MOREs campaign and the Democratic National Committee picked up funding of the project.The project until that point had focused on researching multiple Republican presidential candidates and was not looking at collusion with Russia, according to the Free Beacon.The former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele also became involved after the publication stopped funding the project and went on to compile the dossier, which is sometimes known as the "Steele dossier.""Representatives of the Free Beacon approached the House Intelligence Committee today and offered to answer what questions we can in their ongoing probe of Fusion GPS and the Steele dossier," the publications Editor in Chief Matthew Continetti and Chairman Michael Goldfarb said in a statement."The Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele."The committee confirmed that the publication came forward."The Washington Free Beacon has issued a statement asserting that it had no involvement with Christopher Stele or the dossier he compiled from Russian sources," committee spokesman Jack Langer told Fox News Friday night."The Beacon has agreed to cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee to help the Committee verify this information."The dossier, which alleges ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow, circulated among news organizations in Washington throughout the fall of 2016, but was not reported on at the time because many of the allegations including the most salacious ones could not be verified.BuzzFeed News published the document in January.But the question of who paid for the dossier has long been a subject of speculation and curiosity.The Washington Post reported earlier this week that, after the then-unnamed conservative source stopped paying for the research, a lawyer for the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee retained Fusion GPS's services to continue the work.It was after that that Fusion hired Steele, a former Russia expert for MI6, to compile the dossier.Clinton and other high-level campaign and DNC officials have claimed that they were unaware of the dossier's existence during the presidential race.The Free Beacon said since their founding in February 2012 they have regularly "retained third party firms to conduct research on many individuals and institutions of interest."The First Amendment guarantees our right to engage in news-gathering as we see fit, and we intend to continue doing just that as we have since the day we launched this project, Continetti and Goldfarb continued in their statement.Max Greenwood contributed.Updated Oct. 28.
Fox's Wallace: More evidence of Dem collusion with Russia than GOP:::::Fox News anchor Chris Wallace said Friday that there is more evidence at this point of Democratic collusion with the Russians than there is of Republican collusion with the Russians in last years presidential election.Wallaces commentary comes as Republicans have seized on the revelation that Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonBlumenthal: Trump-tied data firm reaching out to WikiLeaks significant Tillerson eliminates key State Department sanctions office: report Intel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it MOREs presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee funded a controversial dossier on Donald Trump Donald John TrumpIntel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it Overnight Tech: Twitter bans ads from Russian media | Dem says she was targeted by Russian bot | House Judiciary to hold hearing on net neutrality Democrats dig for Russian connection and uncover environmentalists MORE to point the finger back at Democrats regarding Russias meddling in the election.The dossier, which offered evidence of links between Trumps campaign and Russia, was put together by former British spy Christopher Steele.The fact that Hillary Clinton, or at least her campaign and the DNC, was doing business with a foreign national, a British spy, to get information from the Russians for this dossier certainly blunts the idea, Well, it was the Trump campaign and it was outrageous the Trump campaign was having anything to do with the Russians to maybe affect at the election,' Wallace told America's Newsroom anchor Sandra Smith.This is far more evidence than weve ever seen involving President Trump and his campaign that the Democrats were directly involved in trying to get information from the Russians to affect the 2016 campaign, Wallace said.Having said that, we still dont know about Robert Mueller [and his] investigation.Both things could be true that both sides were trying to get aid from the Russians and it certainly seems true that Russians were playing both sides to try to disrupt the election," Wallace continued.We still have to wait and see, but there is more evidence at this point of Democratic collusion with the Russians than there is of Republican collusion with the Russians."Clinton, DNC Chairman Tom Perez Thomas Edward PerezClintons top five vice presidential picks Government social programs: Triumph of hope over evidence Labors 'wasteful spending and mismanagement at Workers Comp MORE and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who was head of the DNC during the presidential race, all deny knowing of the dossier's existence until after it was released.President Trump slammed what he characterized as the fake dossier and characterized it as the foundation of the whole Russia hoax in speaking with reporters on the South Lawn of the White House on Wednesday.
Scrutiny mounts for Trump digital operation:::::Scrutiny on the digital side of President Trumps 2016 campaign is mounting after revelations that the head of Cambridge Analytica, a data mining and analysis firm that worked for the campaign, contacted WikiLeaks Julian Assange about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonBlumenthal: Trump-tied data firm reaching out to WikiLeaks significant Tillerson eliminates key State Department sanctions office: report Intel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it MOREs emails.The Daily Beast reported Wednesday that Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analyticas CEO, told a third party that he reached out to the WikiLeaks founder last year about the emails that Clinton deleted from the server she used while secretary of State.The Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica millions during the 2016 presidential race.In the aftermath of the Assange revelations, aides have raced to distance the campaign from the firm.The company, which is partially owned by the family of billionaire Trump supporter Robert Mercer, mines online data in order to target potential voters with personalized political messaging.It reportedly also worked on the United Kingdom's referendum over leaving the European Union.The exchange between Nix and Assange, which occurred before Election Day, is likely to fuel the congressional and special counsel investigations into Russian election interference.Last year, WikiLeaks released troves of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.WikiLeaks obtained the emails from Russian-backed hackers, according to a U.S. intelligence assessment.The House Intelligence Committee has already requested information from Cambridge Analytica.ADVERTISEMENT The Trump campaign issued a statement late Wednesday afternoon crediting the Republican National Committee and its data team as its main source for data analytics in 2016, an apparent attempt to distance the campaign from Cambridge Analytica.We as a campaign made the choice to rely on the voter data of the Republican National Committee to help elect President Donald J.

Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said that the meeting fits a broader pattern of the Trump campaign seeking damaging information on Clinton, citing the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting during which Donald Trump Jr. and others met with a Russian lawyer.Cambridge Analytica may not have been a direct part of the Trump campaign, but it certainly was hired by it, and there were also other Trump associates who were reaching out as well, Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Wednesday.It should be a topic that is of interest to our committee, because the Russian investigation and obstruction of justice, which is at the core of our investigation, should include all available relevant information, the senator added.The top Democrats on the House Judiciary and Oversight committees have sent letters to Nix, Parscale and others demanding information on whether they exchanged information with a foreign actor or government during the campaign.In announcing he would meet with House investigators back in July, Parscale said that he had no knowledge of any Russian involvement in the digital and data operations of the Trump campaign.The only collaboration I am aware of in the Trump digital campaign was with staff provided to the campaign by Facebook, Google and Twitter, he said.Those experts in digital marketing worked side-by-side with our teams from Giles-Parscale, the Republican National Committee, and Cambridge Analytica to run a professional and winning campaign.Attempts to reach Parscale following his interview on Tuesday were unsuccessful.Meanwhile, the committees are also scrutinizing how Russia leveraged social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to influence the election.Representatives from technology companies are slated to testify publicly before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday.
Gillespie dismisses 'ugly character smear' comparing him to neo-Nazis:::::Virginia Republican gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie is denouncing as an "ugly character smear" comparisons between his campaign and the white nationalists who rallied in Charlottesville, Va., in August.On Friday, a tweet from CNN contributor and former Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonBlumenthal: Trump-tied data firm reaching out to WikiLeaks significant Tillerson eliminates key State Department sanctions office: report Intel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it MORE spokesman Brian Fallon captioned a picture of those neo-Nazis as a "live look at Ed Gillespie campaign strategy meeting.Lt. Gov.Ralph Northam, the Democratic nominee for governor, had defended a similar comparison two days earlier.Northam, the entire Democratic ticket and CNN should condemn this ugly character smear that has no place in our Commonwealths political discourse," Gillespie campaign spokesman David Abrams said in a statement to Fox News.ADVERTISEMENT Earlier this week, the Virginia Democratic Party funded a mailer featuring an edited image of Gillespie alongside President Trump above a photo of the neo-Nazi marchers in Charlottesville with tiki torches in hand.The "Unite the Right" demonstration, which was held around the site of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, has divided the campaigns on the issue of Confederate memorials, with Gillespie supporting leaving the statues up and Northam calling for their removal.Both Fallon and the Democratic campaign have doubled down on the issue, calling for Gillespie to take a firm stance against the alt-right and disavow Trump's unpopular handling of the violence at the rally that resulted in the death of a 32-year-old woman.The former Clinton communications director said Gillespie "should be ashamed" of his own campaign ads on gangs and felons' rights, calling them "vile and pathetic attempt to appeal to the [Stephen] Bannon wing of Donald Trump Donald John TrumpIntel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it Overnight Tech: Twitter bans ads from Russian media | Dem says she was targeted by Russian bot | House Judiciary to hold hearing on net neutrality Democrats dig for Russian connection and uncover environmentalists MORE's Republican Party."Northam spokesman David Turner said that Gillespie "failed" to aid the grieving Charlottesville community after the incident, and that he "should be willing to call out Donald Trump when he's wrong."Gillespie and Northam are currently in a tight race ahead of the Nov. 7 election, with the Democrat holding a small lead in the polls.
Trump's ObamaCare move may bolster law:::::President Trumps decision to cancel key ObamaCare payments could be backfiring.Trump has claimed the health-care law is imploding, and earlier this month he took an action seemingly aimed at that goal: cutting off subsidy payments to insurers known as cost-sharing reductions.Democrats cried foul, calling it the biggest example yet of what they say is Trumps sabotage of ObamaCare, efforts that include cutting enrollment staff and reducing advertising.ADVERTISEMENT But there are inadvertent benefits of Trumps action: Many ObamaCare enrollees are actually getting a better deal and the potential to get more generous insurance because Trump cut off the payments.It sounds very counterintuitive that premiums going up a lot could actually lead to many people paying less for health insurance, said Larry Levitt, a health policy expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation.But that is the way the math works.The reasons are complicated, in large part due to a quirk in the way ObamaCares subsidies to help people afford insurance are calculated and in the ways regulators and health plans prepared.Before the action, state regulators and insurers anticipated that Trump would cut off the subsidy payments, which reimburse insurers for discounts to low-income people, and planned ahead.Insurers raised premiums on one type of plan, known as silver plans, to compensate for the loss of the payments.Silver plans are the ones used to calculate how much of a subsidy consumers get.If the plans are more expensive, people get a bigger subsidy.So the higher premiums lead to bigger subsidies, which consumers can now use to buy another type of plan, even a more generous gold plan, at a lower cost than they otherwise would have.The result is that the majority of ObamaCare enrollees are either held harmless or actually able to buy coverage at a lower cost than if Trump had not cut off the payments.A minority of enrollees, those who earn too much to qualify for subsidies and live in a handful of states that did not plan ahead, are going to be hit with the brunt of the premium increases.The big loser is the federal budget, given that the government will have to pay out billions more in subsidies to compensate for the higher premiums.Democrats had also warned that insurers could simply drop out of the ObamaCare market, leaving some people without any options at all, if Trump canceled the payments.But that so far has not happened.Insurers largely planned ahead, and there have not been any major exits since Trump announced he would cancel the payments.The counterintuitive benefits of Trumps move were a key reason that a federal judge on Wednesday ruled against a collection of states suing to force Trump to keep the payments going.The judge, appointed by President Obama, pressed the states, led by California, to show what actual harm had occurred because Trump canceled the payments.It seems like California is actually doing a really good job of responding to the termination of these payments in a way that is not only avoiding harm for people, but actually benefitting people, Judge Vince Chhabria said at a hearing on the lawsuit this week.A separate legal question is whether the payments were constitutional to begin with, given that Congress did not appropriate them.The administration cited that as a reason to cancel them, but Trump has also pointed to broader anti-ObamaCare reasons.Some ObamaCare supporters warn that the benefits of the payments being canceled depend on consumers being knowledgeable and savvy enough to shop around and find a deal.In practice, many consumers are confused, given the debate over repeal of the law and the surrounding frenzy, and might be hit with a premium increase because they did not realize they could find a better deal on a different plan by shopping around on healthcare.gov.Even despite best efforts to educate consumers, it's going to be really hard to get out the word that there are better deals out there, said Topher Spiro, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress.In practice, in reality, there are going to be a lot of consumers who see increased costs because of this, he added.If people don't shop around and stick with the same plan, they could be missing out on a deal and still face a price hike.The Trump administration has cut back on outreach funding, which experts say could depress enrollment and lead to fewer ways for consumers to get their questions answered.David Anderson, a health policy researcher at Duke University, has argued that Democrats might actually be wise not to seek to reinstate the payments and simply let the higher subsidies give people better deals on insurance.The Congressional Budget Office projected in August that cutting off the payments would initially lead to slightly fewer people insured, but by 2020 would actually increase the number of people with coverage by 1 million, due to the higher subsidies.Anderson said that it could be a significant Democratic policy win to keep the cost-sharing reductions canceled.The counterargument, noted by Anderson and others, is that there is a psychological benefit to having both parties working to make the law better and that the stability of the law could be boosted by a bipartisan bill to reinstate the payments.Spiro echoed this argument, calling for Congress to pass a bill from Senate Health Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander Andrew (Lamar) Lamar AlexanderOvernight Health Care: Judge

law work, not trying to sabotage it, Spiro said.There is also the risk of confusion if the payments remain canceled and that consumers would not seek out the deals available to them.Its confusing to me and this is what I do for a living, Anderson said.Its going to be very confusing to anyone.

Trump listens during a Department of Veterans Affairs announcement of a new program using video and software technology to provide medical care to veterans at The White House August 3, 2017 in Washington, DC.Photo by Chris Kleponis-PoolGetty A new poll shows that the majority of Americans think U.S. politics has reached a "dangerous low point."Among the 71% respondents who said America's politics had reached a low point, 31% said they believe this state is temporary, while 39% said they think it is the "new normal," the Washington Post -University of Maryland poll found.A 70% majority also said American political divisions today are at least as big they were during the Vietnam War.The poll also found that six out of 10 people think the Trump administration, specifically, is dysfunctional, and another eight in 10 think Congress is as well.Money in politics was the most cited reason for the dysfunction, with 65% of people saying they blame money "a lot" for current political problems.
Barack Obama Just Got Called for Jury Duty:::::Barack Obama may no longer be in the White House, but that doesn't mean he's done serving his country.The former president was just called for jury duty.Chief Judge Tim Evans of Cook County, Ill., said Obama is scheduled to appear for jury duty next month, the Chicago Tribune reported.Adjustments will also be made to accommodate his security service, Evans said."Obviously we will make certain that he has all the accouterments that accompany a former president.His safety will be uppermost in our minds," Evans told the Tribune.Oprah Winfrey and Mr. T have also served jury duty in Cook County, where Chicago is located, according to the Tribune."Although its not a place where the public can earn a lot of money, it is highly appreciated.Its crucial that our society get the benefit of that kind of commitment," Evans said.Jurors in Cook County are paid $17.20 per day of service, according to the court.A date or location has not been released for Obama's expected jury duty.
Website With GOP Ties Funded Research on Trump Dossier:::::Christopher Steele, the former MI6 agent who compiled a dossier on Donald Trump, in London in March, 2017 Christopher Steele, the former MI6 agent who compiled a dossier on Donald Trump, in London in March, 2017 Victoria JonesPA Wire (NEW YORK) A conservative website with strong ties to the Republican establishment triggered the investigation into Donald Trump's past that ultimately produced the dossier that alleged a compromised relationship between the president and the Kremlin.The Washington Free Beacon on Friday confirmed it originally retained the political research firm Fusion GPS to scour then-candidate Trump's background for negative information, a common practice known as "opposition research" in politics.Leaders from the Free Beacon, which is funded largely by Republican billionaire Paul Singer, insisted none of the early material it collected appeared in the dossier released later in the year detailing explosive allegations, many uncorroborated, about Trump compiled by a former British spy."During the 2016 election cycle we retained Fusion GPS to provide research on multiple candidates in the Republican presidential primary, just as we retained other firms to assist in our research into Hillary Clinton," wrote the site's editor-in-chief, Matthew Continetti, and chairman Michael Goldfarb.They continued: "The Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele."Earlier in the week, reports revealed that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee continued funding Fusion's work after the original GOP source lost interest.Trump this week called it a "disgrace" that Democrats had helped pay for research that produced the document.But the original source of the research remained a secret.The president himself hinted that he knew the Republican source earlier in the week, but he refused to share it.The White House had no immediate comment Friday night about the Free Beacon's involvement.The Washington Free Beacon was initially founded as a project of the conservative nonprofit group Center for American Freedom, as an alternative to liberal news sites run by progressive nonprofits.The Center for American Freedom was organized as a 501(c)4 and did not reveal its donors, but Singer was the sole funder of the site as recently as 2014, according to a Republican political veteran familiar with the site.The veteran spoke on condition of anonymity to detail the newspaper's financial background.The Free Beacon first retained Fusion to investigate Trump in the fall of 2015 and ended its relationship after Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in late spring of 2016, according to a person close to Goldfarb, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private discussions.The website and its leaders have strong ties throughout the Republican establishment.Goldfarb was deputy communications director on John McCain's presidential campaign.Singer was backing Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's presidential bid at the time of the Free Beacon's involvement.And one of Singer's closest associates, Republican operative Dan Senor, served as Speaker Ryan's chief adviser during the 2012 president campaign.A representative to Singer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Rubio denied any knowledge of the Fusion research or the dossier this week."As far as whether it was my campaign, it wasn't and I'll tell you why," he told CNN."I was running for president.I was trying to win.If I had anything against Donald Trump that was relevant and credible and politically damaging, I would've used it.I didn't have it."The document, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, emerged this year as a political flashpoint in the broader debate over Trump's ties to Russia.A person close to Singer said the billionaire was not aware of Steele's involvement or the dossier until earlier this year when it was published.The person was not authorized to share internal discussions.Law enforcement officials have worked to corroborate the dossier's claims.James Comey, FBI director at the time, advised Trump about the existence of the allegations, and Steele has been questioned as part of an ongoing probe into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump camp.The U.S. intelligence community has determined that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election.Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the Russian interference and whether it was tied to Trump's campaign.The House Intelligence Committee will help verify whether the Free Beacon had any involvement with Steele or his dossier, according to Jack Langer, a spokesman for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes."The Beacon has agreed to cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee to help the Committee verify this assertion," Langer said.In a statement Saturday, Langer said an agreement had been reached that will secure the committee's access to Fusion GPS bank records necessary for its investigation.The committee had sought the records through a subpoena.
How Will Female Candidates Play the Woman Card in 2020?:::::How do you run as a woman during a feminist revolution?Speaking to the Women's Convention in Detroit on Friday, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, two popular Democrats and potential 2020 presidential contenders, offered a glimpse of two different strategies.Gillibrand's speech hit all the obvious feminist notes.She lingered on women's history, placing the current Women's March movement in the same lineage as Susan B. Anthony and the Suffragettes.She emphasized the importance of paid family leave and sexual assault policies, both causes she has championed in the Senate.And she stressed that more women in government would mean inevitable progress on issues like birth control, sexual harassment and family leave."Just imagine if Congress was 51% women," Gillibrand said to a standing ovation."Do you think wed be fighting for access to birth control now?Do you think wed still be fighting to end sexual assault in college campuses and in the military?Do you think our Dreamers would be political pawns?Do you think it would be so hard to change workplace rules that are stuck in the Mad Men era?"The speech contained echoes of Gillibrand's fellow New Yorker and former colleague Hillary Clinton, who ran a more explicitly female-focused campaign than any other woman presidential candidate .(Few women have ever run for President, and Clinton is still the only female candidate to win a nomination of a major party, or the popular vote.)Gillibrand ended her speech with a call to action for women and girls that mirrored Clinton's concession speech shout-out "to all of the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity."Gillibrand spun it forward: " Not until every American woman and girl can reach their potential will America reach hers."If Gillibrand's speech was one preview of how a female presidential campaign might campaign in 2020, Klobuchar presented herself as an capable contender who just happened to be a woman.Klobuchar referenced the recent spate of harassment allegations, but used the issue to discuss class distinctions."We make sure it isnt just famous people who are heard," she said."We protect the shift worker at the factory, the teacher at the school, the nurse at the hospital, all women deserve to be safe wherever they work and wherever they are."Klobuchar outlined a four-point agenda that focused more on broader economic prosperity than female representation.Speaking to an audience in Michigan, the Minnesotan anchored her pitch in the Midwest, where Clinton had trouble in 2016."The Midwest matters," she said, "and next time we cannot leave the middle of the country behind."She then outlined an economic to-do list that involved lowering costs for prescription drugs, air travel and student debt.She urged government to take on the pharmaceutical lobby and endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren's plan to refinance student loans.Both speeches embraced the economic spirit of Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign.Gillibrand condemned the "soft corruption of money in politics" and described health care as a "right, not a privilege."Klobuchar called for an "economic agenda for America" and a manufacturing economy that "leaves no people behind."They both called for tougher regulations on big corporations and more transparency about money in politics.How to approach the role of gender in politics is a critical choice facing many female politicians at a moment when women have emerged as the engine of the new left.The day after Trump's inauguration, nearly 5 million women flooded the streets for the Women's March, which became the largest demonstration in U.S. history.Stalwart progressive organizations like Planned Parenthood, upstart groups like Indivisible (whose base is 74% female) and self-organizing groups of concerned mothers helped stymie the Trump Administration's efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.A record 51 women ran in Virginia's Democratic primaries for the House of Delegates, nearly double the number in 2015.And the Women's Convention in Detroit is hosting workshops and panels to coach even more women to run for office.This momentum, coupled with the raw anguish felt by many women after Clinton's loss, suggests Democrats may decide to nominate another female presidential candidate in 2020.One likely contender is Warren, who has long captivated the left wing of the party.Gillibrand and Klobuchar are two other potential candidates.Both mentioned Warren in their speeches, endorsing both her legislation (to refinance student loans) and her rhetoric (the "rigged system").No matter how you do it, playing the "woman card" is risky.It can mobilize some women but alienate others, and it's not clear whether women's empowerment is a winning issue with anybody who doesn't already call themselves a feminist.According to an October Pew survey , 44% of American men and 33% of women say gender equality has been "about right," while 13% of men and 8% of women say it's gone "too far."A feminist campaign is also unlikely to win over many Trump voters: 22% of Republican men say they think gender equality has "gone too far."With more than three years to go and countless twists ahead, both Gillibrand and Klobuchar have plenty of time to perfect their messaging should they choose to run in 2020.But if they do make a bid, they'll have to figure out that impossible puzzle: how to make progress for women while transcending gender, how to be both female and human at the same time.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2017 In an interview with TIME on Friday afternoon, Steyer doubled down on claims that he makes in an ad that aired during Fox & Friends on Friday morning, which may have brought his campaign to Trump's attention."He really is an immediate danger to the health and safety of America," says Steyer from Los Angeles."This administration doesn't have a clue."In the ad, Steyer himself accuses Trump of bringing America to the brink of nuclear war with North Korea and undermining the First Amendment by "threatening" to "shut down" news organizations , as well as potentially violating the emoluments clause .He says the "big one" is obstruction of justice, which he believes Trump committed when he fired James Comey from his job at the FBI.Like other Trump critics , Steyer argues that the question of whether the President meets the standards for impeachment "is not a close call."A spokesperson for Steyer says that "well over" $10 million is being spent on airing the ad in all 50 states.When asked whether he was attempting to get Trump's attention by airing it on a news channel the President is known to watch, Steyer says his team is simply attempting to reach Americans "of different political groupings" in order to energize a grassroots campaign to oust Trump from office.Being the target of the President's ire may help boost awareness of the effort however far-fetched it may be, especially while Republicans control Congress as well as awareness of Steyer himself, who is a mulling a run for office in California.The 60-year-old made his fortune in hedge funds, then made a name for himself as an environmental crusader after retiring from the financial world in 2012.In the last two election cycles, he poured more than $165 million of his personal fortune into supporting progressive candidates and causes, leading some to hold him up as a counterweight to the conservative Koch brothers.With California Gov.Jerry Brown nearing the end of his fourth and final term, the race to replace him is heating up.There will also be a contest for Sen. Dianne Feinstein's seat in 2018.Steyer says that he hasn't ruled out jumping into either race, as he criticizes the tacks Trump has taken on healthcare, taxes and immigration."I'm willing to do just about anything to try and contribute to getting us back on a growth path that is just and good for America," Steyer says."I haven't ruled out any of those races because I'm trying to figure out the thing that will make the biggest impact."Right now, he says, that's his impeachment campaign, which could also prove helpful groundwork: Given that Democrats sometimes struggle to differentiate their positions in California, campaigning against the Trump agenda and promising to resist it will no doubt be a central part of many 2018 contests.Running or not, Steyer will be part of the mix in 2018 through NextGen America, an organization fueled by his money that works to get out the vote and support progressive candidates in California as well as other states.When asked specifically about the language Trump used in his tweet, Steyer gave a hearty five-second laugh."I am not going to let anything bother me or dissuade me," he says.The ad began airing a week ago.When asked how long it will be running, a spokesperson for Steyer says, "There's no end in sight."
Donald Trump Gives Halloween Candy to Kids at White House:::::'You Have No Weight Problems, That's the Good News.'President Trump Gives Candy to Children President Donald Trump on Friday doled out candy to the children of White House reporters ahead of Halloween on Tuesday.Well, you have no weight problems, thats the good news, right?, Trump said to the costumed trick-or-treaters as he handed out candy.So you take out whatever you need.If you want some for your friends, take them.We have plenty.As the children surrounded Trump by his desk in the Oval Office, the President couldn't help but make jabs at his contentious relationship with the press , saying the reporters did a "good job" with their children, though he does not feel they do a good job with him."I cannot believe the media produced such beautiful children," he said.Later, addressing the kids, he added: "I bet you get treated better by the press than anybody in the world."
Trump Official Denies Involvement With $300 Million Puerto Rico Energy Contract:::::Ryan Zinke, U.S. secretary of interior, speaks during an event at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Friday, Sept. 29, 2017.Ryan Zinke, U.S. secretary of interior, speaks during an event at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Friday, Sept. 29, 2017.Zach GibsonBloomberg/Getty Images (WASHINGTON) Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke says he "had absolutely nothing to do" with a $300 million contract awarded to a small company from his hometown to help restore Puerto Rico's power grid.In a statement Friday, Zinke labeled as "completely baseless" any "attempts by the dishonest media or political operatives to tie me to awarding or influencing any contract" involving Whitefish Energy Holdings.The contract for the tiny company based in Zinke's hometown of Whitefish, Montana, has drawn a bipartisan chorus of criticism from Capitol Hill.The internal watchdog at the Department of Homeland Security says it is investigating the contract and will look for any "inappropriate relationships" associated with it.I had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish Energy receiving a contract in Puerto Rico.I welcome all investigations into the allegations pic.twitter.com/JQgVFR7Fp6 - Secretary Ryan Zinke (@SecretaryZinke) October 27, 2017 Zinke said he welcomes "any and all investigations" and encouraged the Interior Department's inspector general to review the matter.
President Trump Blames Obama for North Korea, But He's Following Obama's Strategy:::::President Trump has blamed Obama for not doing enough to stop North Koreas nuclear advances.But aside from Trumps bellicose tweets , his approach to one of its biggest foreign policy challenges has so far resembled his predecessors.As the president prepares for a trip to Asia in early November, his Administrations actual policy toward North Korea has essentially escalated what his predecessor started.It is a coordinated pressure campaign that started in the last year of the Obama Administration and is continuing, and is now bearing more public fruit, says Scott Snyder, director of the program on U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.The Trump Administration has largely extended and made good on the policy the Obama administration had put into place, says former longtime diplomat Daniel Fried, who coordinated U.S. sanctions policy during Obamas second term.Trumps tweets get in the way of what otherwise was a good policy.The Obama Administration had come to the conclusion in its last six months that it had not done enough on sanctions, Fried adds.We were prepared to escalate.In September, Trump signed an executive order giving the U.S. more authority to sanction companies that finance trade with North Korea.Now, the administration must decide how much to use this new authority.To this administrations great credit, I think it has pursued what has appeared to be a very dogged and sequential strategy against North Korea, says Brian OToole, a sanctions expert who worked at the U.S. Treasury during both of Obamas terms.You have the carryover from the last administration going after coal exports, this administration helped tighten that even farther at the U.N., you have the restriction on banking networks, you have OFAC going after the actual banking representatives that North Korea sends abroad.The Trump Administration has also increased pressure on North Korea by pushing other countries to end or shrink their diplomatic relations the country.Since the start of the Trump administration, more than 20 countries have restricted North Korean diplomatic activities, Susan Thornton testified to the Senate in late September.Spain, Mexico, Kuwait, Peru, and Italy have all expelled North Korean ambassadors since the Pyongyangs latest nuclear test in early September.The effort began late in the Obama administration, but Trump has kicked it into high gear.In late 2016, the UN Security Council unanimously passed a resolution expressing concern on how North Korea was using its diplomatic missions.It called on member states to reduce the number of staff at North Korean diplomatic missions and consular posts, and to limit the number of bank accounts the diplomatic missions could hold.Restraining North Koreas diplomatic activity will cut off a flow of resources to the regime, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the U.N. National Security Council in April.Daniel Russel, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs during Obamas second term, says it was well established that North Korean diplomats, and North Koreans on fake passports who operated out of their embassies, were engaged in insurance scams, cigarette smuggling, and the sale of gold and expensive items smuggled in through the diplomatic pouch, a diplomatic container that is protected from search or customs by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.Last year, Russel says, the U.S. focused more on higher impact sanctions of North Korean companies.Now that those have started to kick in, he says, a logical next step has been to zero in on secondary and tertiary targets, and that includes restricting the ability of accredited North Korean diplomats to operate freely.It isnt a geographic march where all regions received the same degree of encouragement from the United States, we tried to tailor it, Russel says.The big frustration of course was that the lion share of North Korean activities has always taken place in China.Trumps visit Asia in early November is the next big test of how his administration plans to implement these policies.North Korea has embassies and consulates in many Asian countries, including in China, Vietnam, Singapore, and India.On Thursday, the Treasury Department named additional North Korean diplomats and institutions to the sanctions list.The names included two North Korean diplomats in China and Vietnam, both countries Trump will visit.The question is, Can Trump in Asia find the right balance between pressure on North Korea and indirect pressure on the Chinese without blowing it all up by being so bellicose that he loses the political credibility he needs to carry this out, Fried says.
President Trump Will Shrink 2 National Monuments in Utah:::::(WASHINGTON) President Donald Trump is shrinking two national monuments in Utah, following a recommendation by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.That's the word Friday from Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch.The Republican senator said in a statement that he is "incredibly grateful" Trump called him to say he is approving Zinke's recommendation on Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante national monuments.Hatch said he and Trump "believe in the importance of protecting these sacred antiquities," but said there is "a better way to do it" by working with local officials and tribes.Hatch's office said Trump called the senator Friday and said, "I'm approving the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase recommendation for you, Orrin."Zinke recommended in September that the two Utah monuments be shrunk, along with Nevada's Gold Butte and Oregon's Cascade-Siskiyou.
Whitefish Energy Tweeted Its Way Into More Trouble:::::This Energy Company Is In Hot Water After a Trump-Like Twitter Spat With a Puerto Rico Mayor Looking at President Trump, you might think the rules of politics have changed.After Hurricane Maria, he attacked the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, saying she had shown "poor leadership" and was only criticizing federal aid efforts because she'd been told to by Democrats....Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help.They.... - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017 The tweet did not go over well by one measure, it was the third least-popular tweet of his presidency.But Trump never backed down, continuing his attacks on the mayor and other "politically motivated ingrates" until the news cycle had moved on.One energy company has learned that the old rules still apply, however.After San Juan Mayor Cermen Yuln Cruz asked for more transparency on Whitefish Energy, a small company based in Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's hometown that received a $300 million contract to restore power to the island, it fought back on Twitter.First, the company said that it shared her frustrations with the slow pace of progress but felt her comments were "misplaced."Yuln Cruz then responded, tweeting that she is not the only person who has raised questions."What is it about women having an opinion that irritates some?"she wrote.The company fired back: "We've got 44 linemen rebuilding power lines in your city & 40 more men just arrived.Do you want us to send them back or keep working?"This exchange was so Trumpy the President himself could have drafted it.Facing criticism, the company doubled down, a common strategy for the commander in chief.When a question was raised about sexism, it responded by using variants on the word "men" twice.And that's where the comparison with Trump ends.After the company faced a barrage of criticism, the governor of Puerto Rico asked an inspector general to look into how it got the contract and said there would be "hell to pay."Congressional Democrats sent their own letter."Whitefish is primarily financed by a private equity firm that is run by a contributor to the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.We're concerned that Whitefish might have overstated its connections with the Trump administration to obtain the contract," eight Democratic lawmakers wrote in another letter to the Interior Department's inspector general.A copy of the company's contract leaked which appeared to show that the government cannot audit the company's labor costs or profits.Whitefish contract states, 'In no event shall [government bodies] have the right to audit or review the cost and profit elements.'Wow.pic.twitter.com/dIyQXb6AK0 - Ken Klippenstein (@kenklippenstein) October 27, 2017 The Federal Emergency Management Administration even weighed in , saying after an initial review it "has not confirmed whether the contract prices are reasonable."In short, following Trump's playbook has already landed Whitefish in a lot of hot water, and things are just getting started, which is why the company has already done the least Trumpy thing possible: It apologized .Trump may get away with attacking, tweeting, doubling down and never apologizing.But he's the President, and barring any unlikely scenarios, he's in office through January of 2021 at least.Everyone else in politics especially companies with contracts at stake is still bound by the old rules.
Puerto Rico Power Contract a Local Issue: White House:::::The Trump administration scrambled Friday to distance itself from the decision to award a $300 million contract to help restore Puerto Rico's power grid to a tiny Montana company from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's hometown.The White House said federal officials played no role in the selection of Whitefish Energy Holdings by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.The administration disavowed the contract amid a growing number of investigations and a bipartisan chorus of criticism from Capitol Hill.Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Zinke had given the president his personal assurance that he had nothing to do with what she described as "a state and local decision made by the Puerto Rican authorities and not the federal government."The interior secretary also issued a fiery denial on Twitter, saying "Only in elitist Washington, D.C., would being from a small town be considered a crime."Whitefish Energy Holdings is headquartered in Whitefish, Montana, which has a population of about 7,200.Zinke, a former Montana congressman, knows Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski.Zinke's son also had a summer job at a Whitefish construction site."I had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish Energy receiving a contract in Puerto Rico," said Zinke in a statement linked to a tweet."Any attempts by the dishonest media or political operatives to tie me to awarding or influencing any contract involving Whitefish are completely baseless."Zinke acknowledged that after the company's initial contract was awarded, he was contacted by the company, though he did not give the name of the individual who reached out to him.Zinke said he took no action and that all relevant documents would be disclosed to "appropriate officials.""I welcome any and all investigations into these allegations," Zinke said.The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general, an agency watchdog, confirmed Friday that federal auditors will review the Whitefish contract."As part of their standard procedure, they will conduct vetting to look for the presence of any inappropriate relationships," said Arlen Morales, a spokeswoman for the inspector general's office.The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is part of Homeland Security, said it has not approved any reimbursement requests from the utility for money to cover ongoing repairs to the island's power grid following Hurricane Maria.FEMA said in a statement that any language in the controversial contract saying the agency approved of the deal with Whitefish is inaccurate.The contract said the utility would not pay costs unallowable under FEMA grants, but it also said, "The federal government is not a party to this contract."The agency said its initial review raised significant concerns about how Whitefish got the deal and whether the contracted prices were reasonable.The 2-year-old company had just two full-time employees when the storm hit Sept. 20.It has since hired more than 300 workers.A price list attached to the Whitefish contract reviewed by The Associated Press sets rates for both workers and equipment to be paid by the utility: $20,277 an hour for a heavy lift Chinook helicopter, $650 an hour for a large crane truck, $322 an hour for a foreman of a power line crew, $319 an hour for a journeyman lineman and $286 an hour for a mechanic.Each worker also gets a daily allowance of $80 for food, $332 for a hotel room and $1,000 for each flight to or from the mainland.Multiple congressional committees have opened investigations into the deal, the terms of which have triggered questions from both Republicans and Democrats.Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, senior Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the Whitefish contract "raises every red flag in the book."Democrats also raised questions about the role of HBC Investments, a key financial backer of Whitefish Energy.The Dallas-based company's founder and general partner, Joe Colonnetta, has contributed thousands of dollars to Trump and other Republicans, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry, a former Texas governor, and Texas Sens.John Cornyn and Ted Cruz.Colonnetta also gave to Trump's inauguration.Whitefish spokesman Chris Chiames called Colonnetta's political donations "irrelevant."The company said it would cooperate with any information requests from federal authorities."We are very proud of the work we are doing to restore power to the people of Puerto Rico under very difficult circumstances, and we respectfully ask that others await the facts before jumping to misinformed conclusions," the company said in a statement issued Friday."We have one simple goal to restore power to Puerto Rico as quickly and efficiently as possible."Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority director Ricardo Ramos has praised the work performed so far, saying the company's was the only offer the utility received that did not require a down payment.The power company is $9 billion in debt and was already struggling to provide service amid ongoing power outages before hurricanes Irma and Maria hit last month."There is nothing illegal going on here," Ramos said Thursday.A federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico's finances said this week it had appointed a former military officer to oversee the work.Retired Air Force Col. Noel Zamot will be responsible for speeding up reconstruction efforts and overseeing coordination with the board, Puerto Rico's government and the federal government.It was not immediately clear whether Zamot would have the authority to void Whitefish's contract, although under the contract the utility can suspend or terminate the contract "for any or no reason" after providing written notice to Whitefish and compensating the company for actual expenses.About 75 percent of the U.S. territory remains without power more than a month after the Category 4 storm made landfall.Puerto Rico Public Affairs Secretary Ramon Rosario told reporters on Friday he wasn't familiar with the contract's details when asked why it includes a clause that prohibits an audit or review of "the cost and profit elements of the labor rates."Rosario said only that Puerto Rico's governor already has requested an audit and that the government will turn over all pertinent documents."There obviously needs to be transparency," Rosario said."If anyone did anything illegal, let them fry in jail."
AP: DeVos May Only Partly Wipe Away Some Student Loans:::::The Education Department is considering only partially forgiving federal loans for students defrauded by for-profit-colleges, The Associated Press has learned, abandoning the Obama administration's policy of fully erasing that debt.Under President Barack Obama, tens of thousands of students deceived by now-defunct for-profit schools had over $550 million in such loans canceled completely.But President Donald Trump's education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is working on a plan that could grant such students just partial relief, according to department officials who were not authorized to publicly comment on the issue and spoke on condition of anonymity.The department may look at the average earnings of students in similar programs and schools to determine how much debt to wipe away.If DeVos goes ahead, the change could leave many students scrambling after expecting full loan forgiveness, based on the previous administration's track record.It was not immediately clear how many students might be affected.A department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday.But the Trump team has given hints of a new approach.In August, the department extended its contract with a staffing agency to speed up the processing of a backlog of loan forgiveness claims.In the procurement notice, the department said that "policy changes may necessitate certain claims already processed be revisited to assess other attributes."The department would not further clarify the meaning of that notice.DeVos' review prompted an outcry from student loan advocates, who said the idea of giving defrauded students only partial loan relief was unjustified and unfair because many of their classmates had already gotten full loan cancellation.Critics say the Trump administration, which has ties to the for-profit sector, is looking out for industry interests.Earlier this year, Trump paid $25 million to settle charges his Trump University misled students."Anything other than full cancellation is not a valid outcome," said Eileen Connor, a litigator at Harvard University's Project on Predatory Student Lending, which has represented hundreds of defrauded students of the now-shuttered Corinthian Colleges."The nature of the wrong that was done to them, the harm is even bigger than the loans that they have.""Even more importantly, it is completely unfair that a happenstance of timing is going to mean that one student who's been defrauded is going to have full cancellation and the next is not," Connor said.A federal regulation known as borrower defense allows students at for-profit colleges and other vocational programs to have their loans forgiven if it is determined that the students were defrauded by the schools.That rule dates to the early 1990s.But it was little used until the demise of Corinthian and ITT for-profit chains in recent years caused tens of thousands of students to request that the government cancel their loans.In the last few months of the Obama administration, the Education Department updated the rule to add protections for students, shift more financial responsibility onto the schools and prevent schools from having students sign away their right to sue a school.That change was set to take effect in July, but DeVos has frozen it and is working on a new version.She argued that the Obama regulation was too broad and could cancel the loans of some students without a sound basis.DeVos has come under criticism for delaying consideration of over 65,000 applications for loan forgiveness under the borrower defense rule.The agency hasn't approved a single claim since DeVos took office in February.Jennifer Wang, an expert with the Institute of College Access and Success, said the Obama administration was providing full loan cancellations to students."It would be totally different from what was happening under the last administration," Wang said."It's not equitable; it's not fair for students.If she provides partial relief, it's that she only cares what's fair for schools and not students."Abby Shafroth, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, said the agency could be faced with lawsuits, especially from Corinthian students, whose classmates had received full forgiveness.
NBC News: Mueller's First Russia Indictment Will Be Served Monday:::::The first indictment from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election will be served on Monday, even though what charges are included and who will be served remains unknown, a source told NBC News on Saturday.The network, quoting an unnamed U.S. official with firsthand knowledge of the case, confirmed the news, and NBC reported the news with a second source.CNN was the first to report on Friday citing several sources, that the grand jury had approved initial charges, and that the charges are remaining sealed at this time through a federal judge's order.Saturday afternoon CNN reported that there could be "more than one person," and that the indictments themselves were handed up on Friday and that charges were filed.If someone is taken into custody or surrenders on Monday, that person would go before a judge in Washington D.C. to hear the charges, beginning the legal process."So far from all the attorneys that we've talked to who are associated with some of the people who are being investigated have either not called us back, and the few that we have talked to have said their clients have not been asked to surrender yet," said CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz."They have not been told if their clients are the ones that are facing the charges.All that is still a mystery.Right now it appears that Monday will be the big day.All of this is subject to change depending on what the special counsel decides to do."Keeping indictments sealed "is fairly common at the stage when you have an indictment that is issued or approved, as it may have been today," former U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade told MSNBC Friday."The reason is that law enforcement kind of wants its ducks in a row before they go out and arrest the defendant or even notify him," said McQuade."It may be that they dont arrest whoever this defendant is because they've worked out a relationship with his or her defense attorney to bring them in to appear on the case."Already, President Donald Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the president's first national security adviser, have long been central in Mueller's investigation, but neither man's representatives have responded for requests for comment.The news came one day after White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told Fox News the White House believes the Mueller investigation is coming to an end.She based her comment on reports concerning payments that the campaign team for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee had made toward research for a dossier showing Trump's contacts with Russians.The White House has refused comments on the news about the pending indictments.Trump himself has continued to deny that reports of collusion between his campaign and Russia are anything more than a "witch hunt."CNN reported on Saturday that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has oversight over the Russian investigation after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself, would have been told of charges before they were presented to the grand jury.The investigation is looking into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, as well as whether Trump himself obstructed justice by interfering with the case's investigation through his actions, including by firing FBI Director James Comey.Lobbying efforts done by Manafort, Flynn, and others have come under scrutiny, and Mueller's teams have subpoenaed documents and testimony from many sources, including people close to Manafort.
Poll: America Divided Like Vietnam Days:::::Nearly three-quarters of Americans said the United States is as divided as it was during the Vietnam War according to a new poll.Results from the survey released by The Washington Post and the University of Maryland: 70 percent said divisions within the U.S. are at least as big as they were during the Vietnam War.77 percent of U.S. adults aged 65 and older said the current divisions stateside are at least as big as they were during Vietnam, with 65 percent of adults aged 18-29 saying the same.36 percent said they are not proud with how democracy works in the U.S., a sharp increase from 1996 (16 percent), 2002 (9 percent), 2004 (10 percent), and 2014 (18 percent) in similar polls.64 percent said the political system in the U.S. is dysfunctional.71 percent said problems with American politics have reached a dangerous low point.Another recent poll found that political divide in the U.S. also exists within each of the main political parties.
Manafort's Real Estate Agent Testified Before Mueller Grand Jury:::::A real estate agent who helped Paul Manafort purchase his Virginia condo two years ago testified in front of the grand jury as part of the Department of Justice's Russia investigation.Politico reported that Wayne Holland of McEnearney Associates, based in Alexandria, Virginia, appeared in front of the grand jury sometime last week.Mueller's condo was the subject of a pre-dawn FBI raid over the summer as Mueller's team looks into whether Manafort broke any laws."I cannot talk about what happened in front of the grand jury," Holland told Politico."I [testified] and it is overI hope."Manafort and his wife bought the Alexandria condo, which overlooks the Potomac River, for $2.7 million.The FBI conducted a no-knock raid on July 26 and seized records as Mueller looks into Manafort's work as a political consultant and as the chairman of President Donald Trump's campaign last year.Manafort was also told to expect an indictment.There have been reports that Manafort may have violated IRS laws over the years.Mueller's team began investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, and the probe has reportedly spread to several people with ties to the campaign.CNN reported Friday night that the first indictments in the probe have been approved.
Trump: Media Not Reporting on 'GREAT' GDP Numbers:::::President Donald Trump complained on Twitter Saturday that there was little reporting done about GDP numbers that hit three percent.Very little reporting about the GREAT GDP numbers announced yesterday (3.0 despite the big hurricane hits).Best consecutive Q's in years!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 28, 2017 According to the first estimate of the third-quarter GDP, the three percent target was reached for two quarters in a row, despite devastating hurricanes and Congress' failure to approve healthcare reform measures.Proponents of tax reform legislation say their plans will produce growth of three to four percent.A tax bill is expected to be presented before Thanksgiving, with a goal of having it on Trump's desk by the end of the year.The third quarter growth numbers are higher than the estimated growth, set at 2.5 percent, and follow a 3.1 percent growth rate in the second quarter, marking the best consecutive quarters since 2014.
Trump Thanks Jimmy Carter For Calling Out Media:::::President Donald Trump heaped some praise on one of his Democratic predecessors Saturday morning, thanking former President Jimmy Carter for pointing out the media's intense scrutiny of him.Trump said this on Twitter: Just read the nice remarks by President Jimmy Carter about me and how badly I am treated by the press (Fake News).Thank you Mr. President!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 28, 2017 The remark came a week after Carter told The New York Times he feels the media gives Trump a harder time than other presidents."I think the media have been harder on Trump than any other president, certainly that I've known about," Carter said."I think they feel free to claim that Trump is mentally deranged and everything else without hesitation."Trump threw some playful jabs at the media Friday evening when some of the reporters in the White House press corps brought their kids, wearing their Halloween costumes, into the Oval Office to meet Trump."I cannot believe the media produced such beautiful children," Trump said."How the media did this, I don't know."
CNN Analyst Predicts: Russia Probe Could Last 'Well Into 2018':::::The Department of Justice's Russia probe will likely run deep into 2018 now that the first indictments have been approved, a legal analyst said Friday night.CNN's Jeffrey Toobin was asked what the charges in the investigation, led by former FBI director and special counsel Robert Mueller, mean in the big picture."If anybody thinks the Mueller investigation is going to be wrapping up in the next couple of months, this decision [Friday] pretty much guarantees that the Mueller office will be up and running well into 2018, if not through the whole year and beyond," Toobin said.Toobin noted that in investigations such as this one, which could be classified as a "white-collar" probe, the first indictments are generally filed against people who the investigators are trying to flip and work with them."In white-collar investigations, usually the first indictments are against individuals that you hope will plead guilty and cooperate against others," Toobin said."You don't indict the big fish first.You indict smaller fish in hopes of getting the big fish."There are also multiple congressional investigations looking at Russia's involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and if the Trump campaign colluded with it.
Carl Bernstein: Mueller May Be Focusing on Others in Probe:::::The indictments special counsel Robert Mueller obtained Friday in the Russia investigation may be targeting other defendants and not one specific individual, journalist Carl Bernstein said."There are others who may be subject to similar charges, who have further knowledge about dealings with Russia," Bernstein, whose reporting led to President Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974, told Anderson Cooper on CNN."So, it may be aimed at these prospective indictees as well, not simply this person or persons they want to flip."CNN disclosed Friday that Mueller's investigators had obtained the first federal grand jury indictments in its probe into Moscow's meddling in last year's presidential election.The charges remained sealed under a judge's order, according to the report.Bernstein also noted that potential witnesses in Mueller's probe faced "potential perjury traps" because investigators have obtained more than 21,000 emails written by Trump campaign staff or White House personnel."Those are potentially perjury traps for all the people that Mueller is interviewing, who have provided those e-mails," he told Cooper."All of those folks have got to tell the truth about what they observed, what they know, otherwise they are in danger of perjuring themselves."It's probably part of a strategy that we're seeing here."It's not just about the Manaforts of the world," Bernstein said, referring to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who reportedly is a focus of the investigation."It's about those who have been very close to Donald Trump, in his entourage for many years."
John Dean to Trump: Don't Overreact to Mueller Charges:::::Former White House counsel John Dean on Friday cautioned the Trump administration against overreacting now that special counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly obtained grand jury indictments in the Russia investigation."One of the things is to not overreact, or take actions that are going to jeopardize your case or your situation," Dean, who counseled President Richard Nixon and was implicated in the Watergate scandal, told Anderson Cooper on CNN.The cable network reported Friday that Mueller's investigators had obtained the first federal grand jury indictments in its inquiry into Moscow's meddling in last year's presidential election.The charges remained sealed under the order of a federal judge, according to the report.In light of what has not yet been made public, Dean cautioned: "An unknown, or unexpected indictment, could be more of a problem than an expected indictment."Manafort is sort of expected," he said, referring to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.The FBI, armed with a search warrant obtained by Mueller's investigators, raided Manafort's home before dawn in July, seizing financial records and other information."Something that they're not anticipating, they may well overreact to," Dean told Cooper."So, I think it's a good time to look at the history book, in how they handle this politically."Dean said the Nixon White House made many mistakes during Watergate, which led to the president's resignation in 1974."I would advise them to look at what we did wrong, and not repeat that action," he told Cooper."I would say not to overreact to this."That's where you can get into trouble."This White House has a tendency to overreact," Dean added, saying that President Trump should turn the matter over to his private counsel, Ty Cobb."That would be a good place to start," he said."Let Cobb handle it, rather than the press office or president."
Lindsey Graham If GOP Fails on Tax Reform: 'We'll Lose the House':::::Sen. Lindsey Graham said Friday that if Republicans fail on tax reform, "that's the end of the Republican Party's governing majority in 2018.""We'll lose the House, probably lose ground in the Senate," the South Carolina Republican told Fox Radio host Brian Kilmeade."President Trump has got a profile different from the party."There's kinda two or three different Republican Parties now, I guess, but we're all in it together."The White House said Friday that cutting the nation's corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent could expand the economy by as much as $1.2 trillion over a decade, while causing average household income to eventually rise by $4,000 a year.Graham also told Kilmeade that if Democrats gained a majority in the lower chamber next year, they would move to impeach Trump."I can't imagine how he could be successful with Nancy Pelosi running the House," Graham said, referring to the California Democrat and House minority leader."They'd try to impeach him pretty quick and it would be just one constant investigation after another."So, it's important that we pass tax reform in a meaningful way," he added."If we don't, that's probably the end of the Republican Party as we know it."Politico reported Tuesday that Pelosi told party leaders that Republicans would lose their House majority if they failed to enact tax reform.
Trump to Name 'Somebody Very Specific' for Fed Chair:::::President Donald Trump said Friday that he will announce his choice to head the Federal Reserve next week and "it will be a person who, hopefully, will do a fantastic job."Trump disclosed his intentions in a video on Instagram: Big announcement next week!Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!#USA A post shared by President Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Oct 27, 2017 at 1:42pm PDT "I have somebody very specific in mind," Trump said."I think everybody will be very impressed."Trump apparently is leaning toward naming Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to be the Fed's next chairman, according to news reports Friday citing "three people familiar with the matter."While Trump's decision is not yet final, the individuals cautioned, the preference could deny current Fed Chair Janet Yellen a second term at the central bank.Yellen, 71, who was appointed chair in 2014 by President Barack Obama, is to end her term in February.Obama named Yellen Fed vice chair in 2010, and she had spent six years as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.Former President Bill Clinton appointed her chair of the Council of Economic Advisers in 1997.Yellen had served more than two years.Trump had been working from a list of five candidates for chairman that included Yellen and Powell.The others include Stanford University economist John Taylor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn.Trump ruled out Gary Cohn, 57, who is director of the National Economic Council, earlier this week, according to news reports.The president has privately told advisers that Cohn was serving well in his current role and that he wanted to keep him at the White House as his tax-overhaul plan works its way through Congress.Powell, 64, a Republican whom Obama selected to the Fed in 2012, has backed Yellen's gradual approach to raising interest rates.He also is considered a non-ideological pragmatist.Powell also has served at the Treasury Department under former President George H.W.Bush, eventually as undersecretary for domestic finance.In his video, President Trump also touted the economy's growth since taking office in January."Most importantly, at the end of eight years, you really will be impressed because things are looking good," he said."They're looking good for our country, and they're looking good for our country's economy."So, work hard," Trump advised."We have a lot of jobs coming into our country.Go out and get a good one."Wages are going up.The economy is strong.Have fun."
Bill Kristol on Uranium One Deal: 'Big Mistake':::::Conservative journalist Bill Kristol said Friday that the Uranium One deal approved in 2010 by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's State Department "was a big mistake.""I think it was a big mistake," Kristol, editor-at-large of The Weekly Standard, told Jake Tapper on CNN."A lot of us said it was at the time and we're paying some price for that now."The Canada-based Uranium One was sold to Moscow's Atomic Energy Agency, Rosatom, after it was approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The panel included representatives from several U.S. government agencies, including the State Department, which was led by Clinton at the time.The sale gave Rosatom control of more than 20 percent of the uranium supply in the United States.Kristol said that he was not sure whether the deal was bad for the U.S., but that it reflected negatively on Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, because of ties to the Clinton Foundation."I have no knowledge, no opinion, whether it's been good or bad for U.S. national security."We're talking about that they did have this Clinton Foundation, kind of unusual, which employed Clinton."I guess Clinton family members were associated with it while she was secretary of state."And President Clinton was getting paid money to give speeches and they assured the ethics people they would have a real arm's length and wall between it, and the wall seems to have been somewhat porous."Was the deal itself was in any way corrupt?"Kristol asked."Honestly, I don't know."
Chris Christie: Supporting Trump Hurt Me Politically:::::New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie admitted Friday that endorsing Donald Trump for president has hurt his image in the blue state he runs and calls home.Christie was on NBC's "Today" talking about the five-year anniversary of Hurricane Sandy, which devastated parts of the Jersey shore.He was also asked about his unpopularity numbers as he prepares to leave office in a few months."I ran for president.People don't like when you have a job and you are looking for another one right in front of them," Christie said."I endorsed Donald Trump, and that was incredibly unpopular in my state as a blue state."And, third, Bridge-gate happened.I think the combination of those three things, all three of which had really nothing to do with the execution of my job, impacted people and the way they felt about me."Christie's presidential aspirations ended when he exited the race in February 2016 after the New Hampshire primary.Regarding Bridge-gate, members of Christie's inner circle ordered the closure of several lanes on the George Washington Bridge that connects Fort Lee, N.J. and New York City, which led to massive traffic delays in September 2013.It was alleged that the closures came in response to Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich's refusal to support Christie's re-election as governor in 2013.Christie said in August he regrets hiring the people who were behind the Bridge-gate scandal.He has long denied playing any role in the scandal.
Report: Hatch Will Retire, His Office Says No Decision Made:::::The office of Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is pushing back on a report that claims the lawmaker will retire at the end of next year to make way for Mitt Romney to run in his place.The Atlantic reported Friday that the 83-year-old Hatch will step aside at the end of his current term, a move that's been rumored for months.Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, would run for Hatch's seat.Hatch's office, however, said nothing has been decided."Nothing has changed since The Atlantic published a carbon copy of this same story in April, likely with the same anonymous sources who were no more informed on the senator's thinking than they seem to be now," Hatch spokesman Dave Hansen told The Atlantic."Senator Hatch is focused on leading the Senate's efforts to pass historic tax reform, confirming strong judges to courts around the country, and continuing to fight through the gridlock to deliver results for Utah.He has not made a final decision about whether or not to seek reelection, but plans to by the end of the year."The Atlantic claimed Hatch has privately told people that he will not run.Reports have swirled for months that Hatch will retire and make way for Romney to launch a Senate bid.Hatch began serving in the Senate in 1977.
Corker Drops in Polls During Feud With Trump:::::Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., is falling out of favor with his constituents amid his ongoing feud with President Donald Trump, The Washington Post reports.Corker, who announced recently that he will retire at the end of his term, saw his approval rating drop seven points in the latest poll from Middle Tennessee State University.Among Republicans, his position is even lower.Here are the results: 52 percent approved of Corker in February, 27 percent disapproved.45 approve of Corker in October, 41 percent disapprove.61 percent of GOP approved in February, 21 percent disapproved.37 percent of GOP approve in October; 49 percent disapprove.Trump's disapproval rating in the state has also increased, though his approval rating has remained the same.32 percent disapproved in February.40 percent disapprove today.50 percent approve both in February and today."Essentially, Corker's negatives have increased markedly, but he has ended up only a bit behind Trump in terms of approval, and possibly on par with him," Dr. Ken Blake, Middle Tennessee State University poll director, said in a statement."Meanwhile, some undecideds have switched to disapproval of President Trump, but Trump's base is sticking with him and keeping his approval rate relatively high in the state overall."The Post notes that Sens.Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., John McCain, R-Ariz., and Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., all saw a drop in polls after clashes with Trump.
More Twists Revealed in Russian Lawyer, Trump Jr. Meeting:::::The mysterious Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr., who thought she had dirt on Hillary Clinton, actually claimed to have damaging information about two billionaire donors to the Democratic Party, The New York Times reported Friday.In a meeting at Trump Tower in New York last year, Natalia Veselnitskaya produced a memo that she had shared with one of Russia's most powerful officials, prosecutor general Yury Chaika, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, the Times reported.Putin repeated the charges contained in the memo last week when he addressed a conference of Western scholars.Russia's state-run television has also reported on the issue in interviews with Veselnitskaya and Chaika.The Times report is the latest development in the long-running narrative that President Donald Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to defeat Clinton in last year's presidential election.It comes as new reports show that the Democratic Party was behind a largely discredited dossier that claimed Trump was compromised by Russia.In her memo, Veselnitskaya accused an American firm, Ziff Brothers Investments, of illegally buying shares of a Russian firm and avoiding tens of millions of dollars in Russian taxes."The company was the financial vehicle of three billionaire brothers, two of them major donors to Democratic candidates including Mrs. Clinton.By implication, Ms. Veselnitskaya, said, those political contributions were tainted by 'stolen' money,'" the Times reported.Trump Jr. has said he was unimpressed by the Russian lawyer's charges and considered the 20-minute meeting with her in June 2016 a waste of time."Some DNC donors may have done something in Russia and they didn't pay taxes, I was, like, 'What does this have to do with anything?'"the Times quoted Trump Jr.
Steyer Fights Back After Trump Called Him 'Totally Unhinged':::::Tom Steyer, a Democratic mega-donor, returned fire on Friday at President Donald Trump after the president called Steyer "totally unhinged."Steyer funded an ad campaign at NeedtoImpeach.com, calling for Trump to be impeached, saying that a Republican Congress impeached Bill Clinton for less serious behavior than Trump has exhibited.The donor posted a series of tweets on Friday, including one in which he said he was fighting against Trump's "racism and corporate groveling."You're right about one thing, Mr. Trump.https://t.co/REe9Mtb1WQ Tom Steyer (@TomSteyer) October 27, 2017 I have been fighting your racism and corporate groveling from the beginningand always will.Tom Steyer (@TomSteyer) October 27, 2017 "Americans deserve much better" than Trump as president, Steyer wrote in another tweet.Americans deserve much better.Tom Steyer (@TomSteyer) October 27, 2017 He then called on Democratic leaders to "take a stand."
Conway: Trump's Opioid Fight Includes Funding Plans:::::White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway insisted Friday that President Donald Trump's plans for fighting the nation's opioid addiction crisis also includes means to finance help for Americans."First, the commission led by Gov.Chris Christie, that I work closely with here, they made two recommendations in their interim report," Conway told Fox News' "America's Newsroom" program."If the president was going to declare a national emergency, which he did, he would have two mechanisms.One is the Stafford Act.That's used for instances like hurricanes.The other is this Public Health Emergency Act, the vehicle the president has chosen."The emergency status calls on Congress to appropriate funding, but it also allows funds to be moved around immediately toward the opioid crisis and for reducing drug demands overall."It allows the Department of Labor to help the opioid displacement money for workers displaced because of the drug demand crisis," said Conway.Also on Friday, Conway said President Donald Trump has said he feels a sense of vindication with the growing reports that the Democratic National Committee and former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign had been behind the funding for research leading to a salacious dossier linking him with Russia."We know it was Hillary Clinton who was secretary of state while Russians were trying to infiltrate the United States to get an advantage, on what ended up being 20 percent of the uranium going to a Russian interest," said Conway."It is her husband who gave a speech in Russia for half a million dollars.I don't think it's difficult for Americans to connect the dots and that's what people don't like about people in power abusing that power.Let's let the investigators do their job."
Kinzinger on NKorea: 'Diplomacy is What We Want to Do':::::President Donald Trump "has been very smart" in his treatment of North Korea, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., said Friday."Diplomacy is what we want to do," he said on Fox News' "America's Newsroom.""Ultimately the best way to get the situation done.The problem, and I think where the president has been very smart in this: for 25 years we've tried diplomacy, but diplomacy's never been backed by a credible military option."He added later, "President Trump saying, 'Man, we were three steps behind when we took over.We've got to catch up.'The hope here is that diplomacy compels the Chinese, the Russians, the people utilizing North Korean slave labor and also allowing commerce to transition across their borders to actually get on board with stopping this."Kinzinger, a member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said that there's "some method" to Trump saying less about North Korea in recent weeks, saying that on some issues "there is a benefit in unpredictability."The congressman said that North Korean officials "want to know what President Trump is made of, what it shows is unpredictability actually makes them nervous and a little on edge, and so I think what you saw is the president with that rhetoric for a purpose ...giving diplomacy a chance to work."He ended the interview with a comment on the soldiers killed in Niger earlier this month, saying he is "concerned about the spread of ISIS throughout Africa," and that "we're in basically World War III here.""A low-grade version and not as intense in World War II and I, but we're fighting an enemy all over the world and it will be in places where ISIS is going to go and taking root," Kinzinger said."In Niger we're using Green Beret and special ops to build indigenous forces to resist it.That's what they're supposed to do.And so I think had there been an ISIS presence in Niger and we had no troops there, you would have people screaming, 'How come we didn't see this coming and why aren't we doing anything?'We're leveraging the best and brightest of America to use folks in an indigenous region to defend their own country."
