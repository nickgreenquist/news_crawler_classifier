Redick returns to LA as Clippers host 76ers:::::LOS ANGELES -- JJ Redick, exactly the kind of scorer the Los Angeles Clippers could use right about now, will set foot back into Staples Center on Monday night.A member of the 76ers, though, Redick now is in position to continue his former team's recent misery as Philadelphia clashes with the Clippers in Los Angeles.The Clippers have won 12 of the last 15 in the matchup.Inconsistencies, as well as injuries at the guard position, have the Clippers on a five-game losing streak, including three consecutive on a just-completed road trip to San Antonio, Oklahoma City and New Orleans.The Sixers are having their own road issues, having lost two straight on their current West Coast swing, although the general sense is they let one slip away against the NBA champion Golden State Warriors on Saturday.Somebody will be able to get back on track Monday, and the Sixers are confident they will be headed in the right direction again.Philadelphia had won five consecutive games before losing last week first to the Sacramento Kings and then to the Warriors."We will be better prepared," Sixers forward Robert Covington said, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer."We have an idea how they are going to play.And we are (going to make) it be a different outcome."Redick, the Clippers' record-holder for most 3-pointers in a season at 201, is primed to do his part for the Sixers (6-6).He led Philadelphia in scoring against Golden State with 17 points, and at 15.6 points per game, he is one of four Philadelphia players averaging 15 or more.Under normal circumstances, the Clippers would attempt to neutralize Redick by using the defense of Patrick Beverley, but Beverley is dealing with a sore right knee and his stats for Monday's game is uncertain.Clippers point guard Milos Teodosic is also dealing with a plantar fasciitis injury, suffered in the home opener on Oct. 21.In addition to those injuries, the Clippers were also without Danilo Gallinari (strained left gluteal muscle) when they were defeated by the Pelicans on Saturday.Sixers guard Nik Stauskas is day-to-day with an ankle injury, while guards Jerryd Bayless (wrist) and Markelle Fultz (shoulder) are out indefinitely.In addition to their injuries, frustrations also are starting to mount for the Clippers.They received three technical fouls at New Orleans, including one to head coach Doc Rivers in the fourth quarter.Assistant coach Sam Cassell also received a fourth-quarter technical.Guard Austin Rivers had the other technical."As far as techs go, I don't know," Austin Rivers said, according to the Los Angeles Times."Some tough calls didn't go our way.We felt a certain way about the way we were getting touched out there.Some games you get the whistle, some games you don't.The past couple of games we felt like it has been rough.It's just that we're human.I'm not going to put it on the refs."The bright side among the injuries in the backcourt for the Clippers is that rookies Sindarius Thornwell and Jawun Evans are getting valuable experience.Thornwell started the last two games for the Clippers, with Beverly out of action.Evans was drafted by the Sixers this year before his rights were traded to the Clippers.For the Sixers, they can take solace in the fact that they were tied with the Warriors in the second half Saturday, before the defending champions flipped the switch on them.But keeping games close isn't what they are looking for."There are parts of (the Warriors game) that I think you will find positives in, but we feel like we're past that," Sixers coach Brett Brown said, according to the Philadephia Inquirer.

Patriots win 12th straight road game, beat Broncos 41-16:::::DENVER (AP) -- Denver is no longer Tom Brady's House of Horrors and the Broncos sure don't scare anybody anymore.Brady threw three touchdown passes and the New England Patriots matched their own AFC record with their 12th consecutive road victory, pummeling the Broncos 41-16 on Sunday night.Brady's 86th regular-season road win broke a tie with Peyton Manning for most all-time."It's always hard to win in the NFL, certainly on the road," Brady said."We found a way to do it last year and we're off to a good start this year."Not so the Broncos.These teams have represented the AFC in the last four Super Bowls, and the Broncos (3-6) were hoping a visit from their rivals would help shake them from their funk.Beat Brady, suggested Aqib Talib, and "the swag, the energy in this locker room, it'll skyrocket."Instead, the Broncos fizzled.They lost their fifth straight game, their worst skid in seven seasons, and they dropped back-to-back games to the Patriots (7-2) in Denver for the first time since 1966.Avoiding Von Miller all night and throwing for 266 yards on 25-of-34 passing, Brady improved to 8-9 against the Broncos, the only team he has a losing record against, and he won for just the fourth time in 11 trips to Denver.The Patriots also won a dozen consecutive road games from 2006-08.The NFL record is 18 set by the Joe Montana-led San Francisco 49ers from 1988-90.Speaking of historic, the Patriots for the first time since 1979 had a special teams takeaway , a blocked punt and a kickoff return for a touchdown , a trifecta that fueled a comfortable 27-9 halftime lead.The Patriots went three-and-out to start the game but rookie Isaiah McKenzie's muffed punt led to Brady's 14-yard TD toss to running back Rex Burkhead."That's not the first punt McKenzie has muffed this year," Patriots coach Bill Belichick said.Indeed, it was his fifth fumble, including four muffs."It puts us in a big hole," McKenzie said."I put the blame all on me.If I would've caught that first punt, did anything with it, besides turn it over, then probably things would've changed for us."The Patriots had five touchdowns and a pair of field goals before they'd punt again."We knew McKenzie had muffed a couple so we told our gunners to get down there and make it tough on him," Patriots DB Devin McCourty said."Then we get the blocked punt return."He's getting ahead of himself, but who could blame him?After kicking a 39-yard field goal, Brandon McManus failed on the ensuing kickoff to get in front of returner Dion Lewis, whose 103-yard return down Denver's demoralized sideline made it 14-3."How are you supposed to win against Tom Brady and Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots when you're starting off" like that?wondered Broncos defensive end Derek Wolfe."You can't."Then, Burkhead sliced through the line to block Riley Dixon's punt at the Broncos' 30-yard line, leading to Stephen Gostkowski's second field goal and a 20-6 lead."I have not," Broncos coach Vance Joseph replied when asked if he'd ever seen a worse special teams performance."That wasn't the only issue we had.We were 1 for 4 in the red zone.We moved the ball better tonight but we didn't score touchdowns.And defensively they scored on seven straight possessions."When the Broncos finally forced another punt in the fourth quarter, they were whistled for 12 men on the field, giving the Patriots a fresh set of downs.Brady took advantage of that gaffe by throwing a 6-yard touchdown pass to James White, capping both the blowout and a 16-play, 94-yard drive that ate up more than seven minutes."Besides that first series, we couldn't stop them," Miller said.BROCK ON: Brock Osweiler hooked up with Emmanuel Sanders five times for 114 yards in the first half but Denver stalled twice in the red zone and also at the Patriots 21, settling for field goals while the Patriots were scoring touchdowns.Sanders finished with six catches for 137 yards.Joseph refused to say if Osweiler (18 of 33, 221 yards) would stay the starter."We're going to watch the tape tomorrow as a staff and determine who the quarterback is next week," Joseph said.BENNETT'S BACK : Tight end Martellus Bennett was active -- and productive -- for New England just a few days after he accused the Green Bay Packers of pressuring him to play through a shoulder injury.Green Bay waived Bennett with the designation that he "failed to disclose a physical condition," but Bennett said the Packers were aware of his balky shoulder when they signed him.He said it got worse during the season and he elected to have surgery.When the Packers waived him, the Patriots grabbed him.His first catch covered 27 yards and he finished with three catches for 38 yards."He did a great job to have come in on Friday," Brady said."I love having Martellus on our team.He adds a lot, he's a great player, and he was for us last year."MILESTONE WIN: Belichick moved into a third-place tie with Tom Landry on the all-time head-coaching list for wins, with 270.He trails only Don Shula (347) and George Halas (324).INJURIES: Patriots special teams ace Matthew Slater went out in the first half with a pulled hamstring.Broncos tight end A.J.Derby was knocked out with a shoulder injury.Umpire Jeff Rice was carted off in the third quarter after hitting his head on the ground when Patriots linebacker Trevor Reilly bowled him over on during a Denver punt.UP NEXT Patriots: At Raiders at Mexico City's Estadio Azteca (elevation 7,280 feet).The Patriots are staying in Colorado all week, practicing at the Air Force Academy (elevation 6,621) feet to acclimate to the altitude.Broncos: Host the Cincinnati Bengals.
Ducks drop late to Lightning 2-1:::::ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Lightning have rolled over a lot of teams on the way to the NHL's best record.Their latest win came against an Anaheim Ducks team that had handed them one of their two regulation losses this season..T.Brown scored the tiebreaking goal in the third period, leading the Lightning to a 2-1 victory Sunday night for their fourth straight win.Vladislav Namestnikov also scored for Tampa Bay and Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 28 shots."It was definitely a goaltending duel tonight," Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said.Anaheim goalie John Gibson had 35 saves and was put under almost constant pressure, particularly in the first two periods when the Lightning outshot the Ducks 29-14."We didn't have a very good start obviously," Ducks coach Randy Carlyle said."They managed the puck, had control of the puck much more than we did early in the hockey game.We were standing around watching.We were playing in awe of them."Jakob Silfverberg scored Anaheim's lone goal.Tampa Bay finally got through against Gibson at 9:12 of the second period.The Lightning were on a power play when forward Nikita Kucherov's shot from eight feet out was deflected by Gibson but right to Namestnikov, who flicked in the rebound for his ninth goal of the season."I thought Gibson played outstanding tonight," Cooper said."We just couldn't get that extra one to pull away from them."The Ducks finally broke through against Vasilevskiy 3:48 into the third period when Silfverberg knocked in a rebound off Chris Wagner's shot.It was Silfverberg's fifth goal of the season, but third in two games.Brown put the Lightning ahead at 7:18 of the third with his first of the season.The Ducks thought they tied the game nearly two minutes later on their only power play of the night on a shot by Brandon Montour.The puck was trapped and hidden under the left-leg pad of Vasilevskiy.His leg may have slid over the line with the puck, but after a lengthy review officials ruled there was no clear evidence."I thought that was in," Vasilevskiy said."I did not really see what happened.Guys just started screaming, `Hold it.Hold it.'I thought it was in the net already, but stuff like that happens.Got lucky on that."Not for the Ducks."I think everybody in the building would say it appeared to be in, but you have to have definitive proof the puck was in the net," Carlyle said."That's the rules.It's unfortunate that didn't go in our favor, but truthfully could you tell if the puck was into the net?Everybody thought it was, but it was under the pad."The Lightning pushed their league-leading points total to 30 and completed a 3-0 trip through California."It's been a long trip," said Tampa Bay forward Chris Kunitz."But I think we came out and started the first period really well.We outshot them and outchanced them by pushing the pace."NOTES: The Lightning outshot the Ducks 17-7 in a scoreless first period.Anaheim had defeated the Lightning 4-1 in Tampa on Oct. 28.The Lightning have won five of their last six, are now 7-1-1 away from home and have won six consecutive on the road.Kunitz on the lengthy replay review on Montour's shot in the third period: "I was just hoping they didn't have a different view than we did."UP NEXT Lightning: Host Dallas on Thursday night..Ducks: Host Boston on Wednesday night in the fourth of five consecutive home games.
Preview: Expect 3-pointers to fly as Magic visit Warriors:::::TV: FOX Sports Florida Time: Pregame coverage begins at 10 p.m. CAN'T GET TO A TV?WATCH IT LIVE ON FOX SPORTS GO The Golden State Warriors' 3-point-shooting prowess will be tested by one of the big guns from the East when they host the Orlando Magic on Monday night in Oakland, Calif.The Warriors bombed in 14 of their 27 3-point attempts while dispatching of the Philadelphia 76ers 135-114 on Saturday night for their sixth straight win.Golden State, which leads the NBA in 3-point field goal percentage (41.6), has made at least 10 3s in all 13 of their games.They rank second to Houston in average made 3-pointers per game at 13.8.The Warriors didn't skip a beat in their perimeter shooting when Kevin Durant sat out Wednesday's 125-101 home romp over Minnesota with a bruised quad.Orlando Magic on FOX Sports Florida Now they find themselves dealing with a similar injury issue as they attempt to complete a perfect four-game homestand.Stephen Curry helped keep the Timberwolves at bay with two 3-pointers and 22 points, but he left Saturday's win limping and is questionable for Monday's game."It was a bruised quad, same thing that KD had two games ago, just a knee to the thigh," Warriors coach Steve Kerr reported."Pretty painful."With or without Curry, the Warriors will see a Magic team that's one of the most dramatically changed offensive clubs in NBA history.Orlando ranked among the worst teams in the NBA in 3-point shooting last season, both in terms of made 3s (8.5 per game, 25th in the league) and percentage (32.8, 29th in the league).But getting significant improvement from multiple sources, the Magic will enter Monday's game second to Golden State in 3-point shooting percentage (40.6) and third to Houston and the Warriors in 3s made per game (11.9).On the second stop in a four-game trip, Orlando got outgunned from beyond the arc for one of the few times this season when it made only 11 of 31 in a 125-107 loss at Denver on Saturday night.The Magic had won its previous two games, including a trip-opening, 128-112 victory at Phoenix on Friday in which it buried 13 3-pointers.The biggest weapon in Orlando's offensive transformation has been forward Aaron Gordon, who returns to his native San Francisco Bay Area no longer known as just a slam-dunk standout.Never having made even 30 percent of his 3-pointers in each of his first three NBA seasons, Gordon currently leads the NBA with a 55.3 percentage from behind the arc."People never saw me as a shooter," Gordon said."It's going to take some time to shift the paradigm, but I don't really care about that, man.I'm just playing a game.I feel comfortable out there.I feel capable of scoring from anywhere.It feels good."Orlando's most productive perimeter shooter in Saturday's loss was Marreese Speights, who honed his 3-point-shooting skills as a three-year member of the Warriors.After having attempted just 30 3-pointers in five seasons to begin his career, Speights became a fan favorite with Golden State by making 37 of 111 from beyond the arc in his three seasons in Oakland, one of which culminated in the Warriors' first of two recent championships in 2015.Speights had a season-best 19 points, making three 3-pointers, in Saturday's loss at Denver.
Tate runs for 206 yards, 2 TDs; Arizona beats Oregon State (Nov 11, 2017):::::TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) The Arizona Wildcats ran, ran and ran some more in averaging 9.7 yards per rush Saturday night.And there was little Oregon State could do to stop it.Arizona quarterback Khalil Tate ran his streak of 100-yard rushing games to six, finishing with 206 yards and two touchdowns on 16 carries in the Wildcats' 49-28 win over Oregon State.The Wildcats ran for a school-record 534 yards, with three players going over 100 yards.Tate had a 19-yard second-quarter touchdown run in which he bowled over a would-be tackler in the open field on his way to the end zone.He also sprinted 71 yards for a touchdown early in the third quarter."The defender got in the way," Tate said of his first score."I tried to move around and then I just used my determination to get in the end zone."The sophomore has a rushing touchdown in each of the last six games and a team-high 11 this season.He also has four of the five longest touchdown runs for Arizona this season, and twice has run 71 yards for a score.Arizona (7-3 overall, 5-2 Pac-12) and Tate hardly needed to throw the ball, as the ground game racked up 384 yards by halftime with Nick Wilson, Zach Green and receiver Tony Ellison running for touchdowns in the first half."The first half seemed like it went fast, the second half not so much," Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez said."The first half I thought was exceedingly fast and our guys were executing pretty well."I thought the first half was the best half we played all year," Rodriguez added.Green ran for a pair of scores, one in each half.J.J. Taylor rushed for 129 yards and Wilson, a senior playing in the final home game of his career, added 101.The Wildcats have won five of six."I've got nothing but respect for that player," said Oregon State safety Jalen Moore, who led his team with nine solo tackles, of Tate."At the end of the day, it's on us.We kind of shot ourselves in the foot."Oregon State (1-9, 0-7) has lost eight straight.The Beavers were held scoreless until the opening drive of the second half, which ended on Darell Garretson's 15-yard touchdown pass to Noah Togiai."We've got to put our players in better situations," Oregon State interim coach Cory Hall said."Better positions to be successful, period and point blank."Garretson threw two of his four touchdown passes in the third quarter and Ryan Nall led the Beavers with 95 yards rushing on 22 carries, adding a 44-yard touchdown catch in the fourth.Isaiah Hodgins and Timmy Hernandez caught scoring passes from Garretson, who had 209 passing yards.Tate completed 5 of 7 passes for 68 yards and threw his sixth interception of the season.He completed his only pass attempt of the second half and was replaced by junior Brandon Dawkins, who began the season as the starter, early in the fourth quarter.Dawkins ran for a four-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter.Trailing 35-14 late in the third quarter, Oregon State got the ball on offense but couldn't move it, and a 23-yard punt set up the Wildcats at the Beavers' 34-yard line.Green ran for a three-yard touchdown on that drive to give Arizona a 42-14 lead with 32 seconds left in the third.WHAT A RUSH Rodriguez credited the Wildcats' offensive line for paving the way to an historic night running the football."It starts with the big guys up front," he said."We try to do some different things that can create big plays for us.The big guys and the tight ends take the most pride out of it."Senior lineman Jacob Alsadek said there is a mentality to running the ball successfully."We don't look pretty but we beat you up," he said.HANGING TOGETHER Hall said his team is still one unit and won't let anything divide the Beavers despite the losses.Nall said he was encouraged how the team bounced back from a 28-0 halftime deficit, and Moore said the players need to be more disciplined and execute, and that the coaches aren't to blame for mistakes.TAKEAWAY Oregon State: The Beavers have two more shots at a second win -- next Saturday at home against Arizona State and at Oregon in the Civil War rivalry on Nov. 25.Hall said he needs to be more hands-on working with his defense and that he has faith over the final two weeks that his players won't quit."As a staff I expect us to show up and work," Hall said."Our job is to ensure that our players have a fighting chance."Arizona: The Wildcats did what they had to do stay in second place in the Pac-12 South, and did so with a representative from the Valero Alamo Bowl on hand at Arizona Stadium.While a bowl game looks certain with seven wins, Arizona has two tough road games to finish the regular season, at Oregon next Saturday and at archrival Arizona State on Nov. 25.Holding onto second place in the South won't be easy, as both the Ducks and Sun Devils are vying for bowl berths.UP NEXT Oregon State: The Beavers host Arizona State next Saturday.Arizona: The Wildcats play at Oregon next Saturday.-- More AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-Top25
Rosen throws for 381 yards, UCLA beats Arizona State 44-37 (Nov 11, 2017):::::LOS ANGELES (AP) After missing more than five quarters with a concussion, UCLA quarterback Josh Rosen needed some time to settle in.When Rosen finally got comfortable, the junior was nearly perfect in guiding the Bruins to what could be a season-saving win.Rosen threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Lasley on the first play of the fourth quarter and UCLA pulled away from Arizona State for a 44-37 win Saturday night."It felt good to be back.It took a second to get into the groove in the first half, but once we started moving, it worked well," said Rosen, who passed Drew Olson for third place in school history in career yards passing, total offense and completions.Rosen finished with 381 yards passing with one touchdown and one interception and also scored on a 1-yard run as the Bruins (5-5, 3-4 Pac-12) outscored the Sun Devils 10-3 in the fourth quarter."Rosen is a great player," Arizona State head coach Todd Graham said."We didn't sack him one time.We should have had him four or five times, but you've got to give him credit there.He's going to get his yards."Bolu Olorunfunmi ran for 79 yards and one touchdown, Soso Jamabo had a 21-yard touchdown run, and Nate Meadors returned an interception for a touchdown to help UCLA remain undefeated at the Rose Bowl this season.Manny Wilkins threw for 290 yards with one touchdown and one interception and also ran for a touchdown for the Sun Devils (5-5, 4-3), who had won two straight in the series.Demario Richard had 125 of Arizona State's 294 yards rushing and a touchdown."Man, there's no reason why we shouldn't win this game," Arizona State defensive lineman Tashon Smallwood said."The truth right now is we've said that too often this year, but the season isn't over yet.We still have two games left, and they're two games we plan on winning."Eno Benjamin returned a blocked punt 9 yards for an Arizona State touchdown to tie the game at 34 with 2:13 left in the third quarter, but UCLA responded with a seven-play, 75-yard drive that ended with Lasley's touchdown.Lasley missed the previous three games for disciplinary reasons.Rosen started the game 3-for-10 for 18 yards and UCLA's only turnover and was 10-for-25 at the half.In the final two quarters, however, Rosen was 15-of-20 for 225 yards including the go-ahead score to Lasley."It probably took a little bit of time there," UCLA offensive coordinator Jedd Fisch said."You're talking about a huge jump."J.J. Molson kicked his third field goal, a 20-yarder, with 9:38 remaining to give UCLA a 44-34 lead.Arizona State got a 23-yard field goal from Brandon Ruiz with 1:20 to go, but the ensuing onside kick was recovered by UCLA wide receiver Christian Pabico.After falling behind 14-0 in the first quarter, UCLA started its rally when Marcus Moore tipped Wilkins' pass into the air and Meadors took it 27 yards for a touchdown."I really thought that was the key play of the game," UCLA defensive coordinator Tom Bradley said."It looked like they had total control.When that happened, we got back in it really quick."THE TAKEAWAY Arizona State: The Sun Devils' midseason defensive turnaround was a mirage.Arizona State seemed to have figured things out after holding Washington and Utah to 17 points combined, but has now allowed 122 points in its last three games.UCLA became the eighth team to score at least 30 points against Arizona State, and did it with a barrage of big plays despite an injury-depleted receiving corps.UCLA: The Bruins took a big step toward bowl eligibility.Just as important, they built momentum heading into next week's rivalry game against No.15 Southern California.USC has locked up the Pac-12 South and a place in the conference title game, but UCLA can salvage its season by pulling off the upset at the Coliseum.UNWANTED BANNERS Two planes carrying banners criticizing UCLA head coach Jim Mora and athletic director Dan Guerrero flew over the Rose Bowl before the game started."Of course I saw them.We all saw them.It's great to have passionate fans," Mora said.But Rosen was less diplomatic, making a pointed criticism about the cost of hiring the two planes."I thought it was absurd.Some parents of kids on our teams don't make $30,000 a year.To put that in a banner is absurd.I mean, Coach Mora went and climbed Kilimanjaro to raise money to dig wells for people in Africa for clean water, and I think one well might have been $20,000 or something like that.It's just absurd.It's disrespectful.It's disgusting.If you don't think Coach Mora should be our coach, go talk to our AD yourself," Rosen said.RED-ZONE REGRET Arizona State finished with a season-high 584 yards, one more than it had in last week's win over Colorado, but couldn't turn that production into points.In six trips inside the UCLA 20-yard line, Arizona State scored three touchdowns and kicked three field goals."We should have run the ball to the end zone every time we got in the red zone," Graham said.Arizona State dropped to 35-4 after leading at halftime under Graham.UP NEXT Arizona State: The Sun Devils close out their road schedule at Oregon State next Saturday.UCLA: The Bruins travel across town to play USC for the Victory Bell next Saturday.-- More AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-Top25
Preview: Chris Chiozza a game-time decision for Florida in season opener:::::TV: ESPNU Time: 7 p.m. No.8 Florida kicks off its season on Monday, but the Gators don't know whether senior point guard Chris Chiozza will be on the floor.Florida coach Mike White said Chiozza, who has a shoulder injury, will be a game-time decision when the Gators host Gardner-Webb at Exactech Arena in Gainsville, Fla. "I'm hopeful, but it'll be a pain-tolerance deal, of course," White said, according to Gatorsports.com."But he's progressing.He's such a tough kid, you guys know that, physically and mentally.If he can play, he'll play."Chiozza hit a game-winning 3-pointer to beat Wisconsin in the NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 in March, as Florida advanced to the Elite Eight.More Florida Gators news "He's ridden a little wave of momentum," White said of his point guard, who averaged 7.2 points and 3.8 assists last season."He's playing with a lot of confidence.He's always really led by example but I think it's increased.He's in a good place and I think he's going to have an ability to show people how good he is this year.He's going to have more opportunity.And we need him, we need him to lead these guys.He's as important to this team as anyone on the roster."If Chiozza can't play on Monday, the Gators will use KeVaughn Allen and freshman Mike Okauru at the point."Most players in the SEC and the whole country are more people persons as you would say," Chiozza told the Gainesville Sun."But KeVaughn, if he doesn't know you, he's not going to talk to you.And he's not very expressive.I mean, I don't really express that much emotion either.I think we are probably two of the most calmest guys you are going to see on the court.No matter what we do we're going to have a straight face and just look like we're out there handling business."Allen is Florida's leading returning scorer.He averaged 14 points per game last season and had a career-high 35 in the win over Wisconsin."In his short career here, he's made timely shots, big shots," White said."I think what's underrated a little bit, and maybe some see as we're seeing it more and more, is the durability and improvement on the defensive end, and hopefully a continued improvement on the glass, as he's helping us more and more there.He's become more and more confident too.He's maturing himself and I'm really pleased where he is right now."Gardner-Webb (0-1) is facing its second straight ranked team from the state of Florida.The Bulldogs trailed No.13 Miami by just 27-23 in their season opener on Friday.But the Hurricanes opened the second half with a 24-2 run and ran away to a 77-45 win."The second half was a rough one," Gardner-Webb coach Tim Craft said."I don't know if I've gone through a second half where we've just been blitzed like that.Miami is really impressive, talented, athletic, with a lot of shooting at a lot of spots."DJ Laster had a team-high 10 points for Gardner-Webb, which shot just 31.7 percent from the field and was 4 of 16 from 3-point range.The Bulldogs play at Central Florida on Wednesday.The Gators host North Florida on Thursday.
Braves to name Alex Anthopoulos as next general manager:::::The Atlanta Braves are set to name Alex Anthopoulos as their new general manager a masterstroke hire for an organization looking to climb out of offseason turmoil and rejoin Major League Baseball's first class.Landing theformer Toronto Blue Jays general manager and current Dodgers vice president of baseball operations endsthe search for John Coppolella's replacement and installs long-term leadership in Atlanta, answering waves of offseason question marks surroundingthe front office.The Braves are expected toannounce the hire on Monday afternoon.The news was first reported by New York Post columnist Joel Sherman and later confirmed by MLB.com's Mark Bowman.Anthopoulos, 40, is expected to take over baseball operations with final say on personnel decisions, though John Hart will reportedly remain in his current role as president of baseball operations (albeit in title alone) for the time being.Confirmed Alex Anthopoulos will be named Braves GM.Though he wont have the title, Anthopoulos will also likely handle the president of baseball ops duties Mark Bowman (@mlbbowman) November 13, 2017 Heard John Hart will stay as #Braves pres of basbeall operations for now, but as much as counsel/figurehead and that Anthopoulos will have final decision making powers in baseball.Joel Sherman (@Joelsherman1) November 13, 2017 After working his way up through the Expos and Blue Jays' front offices literally climbing the ranks from the mail room to the board room Anthopoulos, a Montreal native, served as Toronto's general managerfrom 2009 to 2015,piecing together a roster that posted a489-483 record in the competitive American League East.Anthopoulos was instrumental inacquiring the likes of 2015 American League MVP Josh Donaldson, David Price and Troy Tulowitzki; the franchise also brought in Jos Bautista and Edwin Encarnacin during his time as assistant GM to mentor J.P. Ricciardi.A panel of 47 major-league executives tabbed him as Sporting News' Executive of the Year in 2015.In October 2015, he declined the Blue Jays' five-year contract extension and eventually landed in Los Angeles, where he helped build the 2017 National League champions while working under Andrew Friedman.Though Kansas City Royals general manager Dayton Moore, a John Schuerholz protg, was linked to the GM vacancy from the very beginning, Atlanta was never granted a formal interview and Moore elected to not sever ties with the organization he led to the 2015 World Series title.Anthopoulos steps into the position vacated by Coppolella, who resigned in early October amid MLB's investigation in player acquisition practices both domestic and international.Hart and Coppolella built arguably the top farm system in baseball a deep well of young talent, including consensus superstar outfield prospect Ronald Acua, that made the job opening appealing for a wide range of candidates.Even with possiblesanctionsstemming from the MLB investigation pending, it's unlikely a well-established name likeAnthopoulos leaves his high-level position inLos Angeles without inheriting a wealth of talent (and front-office control).Trading away Noah Syndergaard in the R.A. Dickey deal stands ashishigh-profile misstep on the trading block, butAnthopoulos has demonstrated the ability to identify amateur talent and build through the minors.During his time in Toronto, Baseball America tabbed the Blue Jays with a top-10 farm system four times highlighting the likes of top prospects Syndergaard, Marcus Stroman, Aaron Sanchez, Kevin Pillar, Roberto Osuna, Daniel Norris and current minor-league standoutVladimir Guerrero Jr., among others.(Fun fact: Anthopoulos'Blue Jays also drafted Kris Bryant and Aaron Nola out of high school, though the future big-leaguersdid not sign with the organization.)Jonah Keri described Anthopoulos' approach for Grantland back in 2013: "His approach to collecting young talent is pragmatic, targeting the best talent regardless of whether theyre from the international, college, or high school pools.He trusts his scouts to make the best decisions on all those fronts, making one of his first moves as GM the expansion of the amateur scouting ranks, from 28 to 54.He routinely goes over slot for premium talent in the draft.Hell re-sign some veteran stars (Jose Bautista for five years, $65 million) and trade others (Halladay for Travis DArnaud, Kyle Drabek, and Michael Taylor).Any chance he gets, he tacks on club option years to long-term deals, giving the Jays potential bargain seasons for players who retain their effectiveness all the way through."Notable #Jays draft picks under Alex Anthopoulos: 2010: Noah Syndergaard, Aaron Sanchez, Kris Bryant (did not sign) 2011: Kevin Pillar, Aaron Nola (did not sign) 2012: Marcus Stroman FOX Sports: Braves (@FOXSportsBraves) November 13, 2017 Atlanta owns a 207-278 record since hitting the reset button following the 2014 campaign.The franchise opened its new ballpark, SunTrust Park, last season and features a burgeoning major-league core centered around star first baseman Freddie Freeman and two-time Gold Glove center fielder Ender Inciarte.Still, the franchise continues to search forits first playoff series win since 2001, a far cry from the organization's mid-1990s heyday.With top prospects Ozzie Albies, Dansby Swanson, Mike Foltynewicz, Luiz Gohara, Sean Newcomb and Max Fried already joining the parent club andmore top-100 names right around the corner with Acua, Kolby Allard, Mike Soroka, Kyle Wright and Austin Riley rapid improvement is the ground-floor expectation as AlexAnthopoulos steps in.
49ers' Marquise Goodwin reveals his baby died just hours before game:::::A San Francisco 49ers wide receiver who looked up to the sky and then buried his head into the field after scoring a touchdown Sunday revealed that his prematurely-born son died just hours before kickoff.Marquise Goodwin ran the ball 83 yards into the end zone, fell to his knees in prayer and was consoled by his teammates during the emotional celebration.The 49ers went on to defeat the Giants 31-21 to earn their first win of the season.Unfortunately, we lost our baby boy due to some complications, and had to prematurely deliver him early this morning around 4 a.m., Goodwin wrote on his Instagram after the game next to a picture of the tiny infants hand wrapping around a fingertip.Although we are hurt, I am grateful for the experience and grateful that God blessed me with a wife as courageous and resilient as Morgan.The pain (physically, mentally & emotionally) that she has endured is unbelievable.Please pray for the Goodwin family, he added.Goodwin left the teams locker room quickly after the game to return to his family, NBC Sports reported.He also posted a video on Instagram of the touchdown and captioned it with two emojis: a prayer gesture and a boy with a halo ring over his head.Im glad that we were able to get him the ball, especially on a day like today for him, 49ers safety Eric Reid told SFGate.I have so much respect for him, to come out here and still play, with the hurt that he had in his heart, and to ball out.Morgan Goodwin also posted on Instagram that she had to deliver her precious baby boy early this morning due to pre-term labor.Despite our loss, my hubby kept grinding, scored his son a touchdown & got our first W of the season, she added.He had a wonderful game today.I appreciate everyone who kept us in their prayers and constantly checked in on us.Reid and Goodwin both kneeled during the national anthem before the game started, along with Giants defensive end Olivier Vernon.If I need to say it every time yall ask me, this is not about the military, this is not about the flag, this is not about the anthem, Reid said earlier this year, according to the Washington Post.I have the utmost respect for the military, for the anthem, for the flag.So I will say that every time yall interview me.This is about systemic oppression that has been rampant in this country for decades on top of decades."

NASCAR star Jimmie Johnson's title chase ends with wreck in Phoenix:::::Jimmie Johnson's bid for a record eighth NASCAR championship is over.Needing a win at Phoenix to make the final four in next weekend's championship finale, Johnson saw his hopes crumple with a blown tire that sent his No.48 Chevrolet into the wall with one lap remaining in the second stage Sunday.The crash eliminated the reigning and seven-time NASCAR champion from title contention."I'm disappointed for sure," Johnson said."The last couple of months we've been staying alive and at this stage with the Round of 8 and then the Round of 4, you can't just stay alive.You've got to be hitting on all cylinders and we just haven't been there, unfortunately."It's been a rough ride for Johnson since matching Hall of Famers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt with his seventh title a year ago.Johnson won three races this year, but those came during the first third of the season.He hasn't won since Dover in June and has one top-five finish the last 21 races.Johnson came to Phoenix last among the eight title contenders, 51 points out of mathematically qualifying.Martin Truex Jr, Kyle Busch and Kevin Harvick already locked into next weekend's championship finale next weekend at Homestead-Miami Speedway, leaving Johnson among five drivers fighting for one spot.A four-time winner at Phoenix, Johnson started 12th and earned a point by finishing eighth in the first stage.He was running 11th when his right front tired blew right before the caution at the end of the race's second stage.Johnson drove the car straight to the garage, his day and championship hopes over."I didn't know it was coming," Johnson said."Clearly just got the brakes too hot and popped that tire with like a lap to go or two laps to go before the stage was up.We weren't leading, we were having a decent day, but we were going to need a great day today.I wish we were still out on track to still have a shot for it."Now Johnson is left with trying to win at Homestead next week and spend the offseason trying to figure out what went wrong during his title defense.
Roger Goodell reportedly requests $50 million salary, lifetime private jet in contract talks:::::NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell reportedly has requested nearly $50 million per year in addition to the lifetime use of a private jet amid contract negotiations with the league.Goodell, whose proposed contract with the NFL currently is undergoing an approval process, asked the leagues compensation committee in August to raise his salary from $30 million to $49.5 million per year, ESPN reported Sunday.Goodell also reportedly asked to use a private jet for life, and also requested lifetime health insurance for his family.NFL COMMISSIONER ROGER GOODELL: ALL PLAYERS SHOULD STAND FOR NATIONAL ANTHEM The commissioner currently is embattled with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who has threatened to sue the NFL if negotiations regarding Goodells contract extension are finalized without approval from all NFL team owners.An unnamed NFL owner told ESPN that there are several owners in this league who dont make $40 million a year.The owner added: That number for Roger just seems too much.Its offensive.Its unseemly.Goodell has made headlines in recent months for his handling of league players protesting during the national anthem ahead of NFL games.He said last month that we want our players to stand during the anthem, but stopped short of imposing a rule for players to do so.NFL COMMISSIONER CONTRACT DISPUTE WITH JERRY JONES, EXPLAINED One team owner, regarding the possibility Goodell possibly would leave his position, said the problem with the NFL is no one is talking about games anymore.Its about concussions, Jones vs. Goodell, [Ezekiel Elliotts suspension], the anthem.No one is talking about football.Its just killing the game, the owner told ESPN.Another owner told the sports network that Roger is defiant, and they dont believe hell take a pay cut or resign as commissioner of the NFL.
Bears botch replay challenge, lose to the Packers:::::CHICAGO (AP) -- Bears coach John Fox thought it was a touchdown.At worst, it was going to be first-and-goal.Not so much.Fox won his challenge all right, and lost the ball.A strange replay reversal cost Chicago a potential scoring opportunity, and the Bears were unable to stop Green Bay's rushing attack in the second half of a 23-16 loss to Brett Hundley and the Packers on Sunday.Mitchell Trubisky threw for a career-high 297 yards in his fifth NFL start, including a gorgeous 46-yard touchdown pass to Josh Bellamy in the fourth quarter.It was an encouraging performance by the No.2 overall pick in this year's draft, but one that likely will be remembered for the one that got away from the rookie and the Bears.Chicago was down 10-3 when it drove to the Green Bay 22 midway through the second quarter.On third-and-13 from the 25, Trubisky passed to Bennie Cunningham on a screen play, and the fifth-year running back cut outside before making a lunging try for the end zone on a cold, rainy day at Soldier Field.Cunningham was ruled out at the 2 and the Bears challenged the call."Every indication that we had was that he scored and if anything he would be at the 1 or inside the 1 instead of I think they spotted the ball originally at the 3," Fox said.Instead, the replay showed the ball coming out of Cunningham's hands before it hit the pylon, and the fumble into the end zone resulted in a touchback for Green Bay.Fox screamed at line judge Bart Longson after the ruling, and the crowd booed through the ensuing offensive series for the Packers."As he was lunging toward the goal line, he lost the ball in his right hand first, probably, I'm going to guess, 2 feet maybe short of the pylon," referee Tony Corrente told a pool reporter."As he got even closer, the left hand came off.We had to put together two different angles in order to see both hands losing the football.After he lost it the second time, it went right into the pylon."Cunningham said he thought it was a TD at first, but he agreed with the call after watching the replay."Coaches go over it every week.Unless it's fourth down, you don't reach the ball out at the goal line, in the red zone," he said."They talk about it.I go down at the 1, next play it's first-and-goal and we hand the ball to Jordan (Howard).It's a touchdown.So it was a bad decision."Chicago (3-6) also was hurt by a video review in its previous game, losing a potential touchdown reception by Zach Miller during a 20-12 loss at New Orleans on Oct. 29.Miller also seriously injured his left leg on the play, ending his season.The Bears were off last weekend and the Packers (5-4) had dropped three in a row since star quarterback Aaron Rodgers got hurt against Minnesota.But Hundley directed Green Bay to its eighth win in its last nine games against Chicago, passing for 212 yards and a touchdown.The Packers also rushed for 160 yards despite losing their top two running backs to injuries."A lot of the stuff was self-inflicted on ourselves," cornerback Prince Amukamara said."That's been the theme this year.When we've had enough, it'll stop.But we have to make a decision."The 62-year-old Fox dropped to 12-29 in his three seasons with Chicago.He is 1-5 against Green Bay since taking over the Bears, but he said he isn't worried about his job status."I've been doing this too long," he said."I've never worried about my job security, and I won't start any minute going forward."
Ingram, Saints run up 47-10 win over porous Bills:::::ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara are so in sync, the New Orleans Saints running back duo is now finishing sentences for one another."Listen, it's fun whenever we're scoring at will," Ingram said, before sounding like Oprah on a giveaway episode following a 47-10 win over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday."Drew (Brees) got a touchdown.AK (Kamara) got a touchdown.Trey (Edmunds) got a touchdown.Man, that's what we work for, so everybody eats."That's when Kamara interjected by noting to Ingram, "You don't want to say you got three touchdowns," before the two broke into a fit of laughter.Ingram had 131 yards rushing and scored three times, and the Saints won their seventh straight in producing one of the most prolific running performances in franchise history.The six touchdowns rushing set a franchise record, and New Orleans' 298 yards rushing were the third highest in team history."We came out and wanted to impose our will," said Kamara, who scored once and added 106 yards rushing."We were in the locker room and said, `We've got to put pressure on them to break their neck.'"Ingram set a career high by scoring twice from 3 yards and another from 1 yard.Kamara scored on a 5-yard run, while Brees scrambled in from 7 yards.Edmunds capped the run of rushing touchdowns with a 41-yard scamper.The Saints never punted by scoring on eight of their nine possessions, not including two mean-nothing drives to close both halves in a game they finished with 482 yards and 32 first downs.The Saints (7-2) became the second team in the Super Bowl era to win seven straight after starting the season 0-2, joining the 1993 Cowboys, who went on to beat Buffalo in winning the Super Bowl.The Bills (5-4) so completely unraveled on defense, linebacker Preston Brown didn't know what hit them."That felt like the longest game of my life," Brown told The Associated Press."Every time they ran the ball: 8 yards.Every time they passed the ball: 15, 20 yards.Nothing worked today."It marked the second straight game the Bills defense has caved after allowing 194 yards rushing in a 34-21 loss to the New York Jets on Nov. 2."It's two straight times where you get embarrassed," Brown said."And it has to change or we'll be five and what, 5-11, if we don't make a change."Buffalo fell to 4-1 at home and squandered an opportunity to win six of its first nine games for the first time since 1999.The offense was hardly better.Buffalo managed 198 yards, and 10 first downs.And five of those first downs came on Buffalo's meaningless final drive that ended with backup quarterback Nathan Peterman hitting Nick O'Leary on a 7-yard touchdown pass.After Stephen Hauschka capped a nine-play, 57-yard opening drive with a 37-yard field goal, the Bills never crossed midfield over their next eight possessions.The most notable cheer came with 4:53 remaining when Peterman replaced Tyrod Taylor and then immediately hit Deonte Thompson for a 10-yard reception along the right sideline.INJURIES Saints: Coach Sean Payton said "all the signs are positive" in updating the status of backup running back Daniel Lasco, who had feelings in his extremities after sustaining a spine injury while tackling Brandon Tate on a kickoff return six minutes into the second quarter.Lasco was loaded into an ambulance and transported to a Buffalo-area hospital.The Saints were awaiting the results of a final test before learning whether Lasco could join them on their flight home.Bills: DE Jerry Hughes did not return after hurting his shin late in the second quarter.THEY SAID IT Saints: "Don't under-estimate Drew," Ingram said of Brees, who finished 18 of 25 for 184 yards."When we have success running the ball, he's 8,000 times better."Bills: "Horrible game," Taylor said, who finished 9 of 18 for 56 yards and an interception.BENJAMIN DEBUT Kelvin Benjamin, like much of the rest of the Bills offense, was rendered invisible in making his debut after being acquired in a trade with Carolina on Oct. 31.He finished with three catches for a team-best 42 yards.INACTIVES/ACTIVES Saints: Starting offensive linemen Terron Armstead (chest) and Larry Warford (abdomen) are active despite being listed as questionable on the Saints final injury report.Bills: TE Charles Clay returned after missing three games with a left knee injury.LT Cordy Glenn (left ankle/foot) and WR Zay Jones (left ankle/knee) did not play after both were hurt in a 34-21 loss at the Jets on Nov. 2.

Late turnovers cost Chargers in overtime loss to Jaguars:::::JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) Josh Lambo kicked a 30-yard field goal with 3:12 remaining in overtime, lifting the Jacksonville Jaguars to a 20-17 victory against the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.Lambos kick got tipped at the line of scrimmage and still cleared the crossbar.The former soccer player ran the other way and slid on both knees near midfield before getting mobbed by teammates.It gave Jacksonville its first three-game winning streak since 2013.The game ended up in overtime after a wild and wacky final two minutes of regulation that included a fumble, two interceptions, a taunting penalty and a costly flag for roughing the passer.At times, it looked as if neither team wanted to win.After all the chaos, Lambo drilled a 34-yard field goal to send it to the extra period.After Jacksonville punted, A.J.Bouye intercepted a pass from Philip Rivers on third down and returned it to the 2-yard line.But a taunting call on cornerback Aaron Colvin pushed the Jaguars (6-3) back 15 yards.Lambo hit the winner a few plays later.Colvins penalty was just the last in a crazy series of poor decisions for both teams.Jaguars receiver Marqise Lee was called for taunting in regulation, and Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa was flagged for unnecessary roughness that set up the game-tying kick in regulation.On top of those, Chargers rookie Austin Ekeler fumbled while trying to run out the clock with a three-point lead, and Blake Bortles threw two interceptions while trying to rally the Jaguars in the final two minutes.Bortles completed 28 of 51 passes for 273 yards, with a touchdown and the two picks.Leonard Fournette ran for 33 yards on 17 carries and failed to score for the first time in his rookie season.Rivers threw for 235 yards and two scores, both to Ekeler, but his interception proved to be the most costly of all the late-game mistakes.The Chargers (3-6) lost for the first time in seven games in the series.The Jaguars scored on a fake punt and on a drive that included 11 consecutive passes from Bortles.Corey Grant took a direct snap on a fourth-and-7 play, juked one defender, made another miss and then zigzagged his way for a 56-yard touchdown in the first quarter.It was the second straight week Jacksonville got a huge play from special teams.Jaydon Mickens returned a punt 63 yards for a touchdown in a victory against Cincinnati last week.With the NFLs top running game stalled, the Jags turned to Bortles.He threw a perfect pass to Marqise Lee for a 6-yard score in the third and then found his top receiver for a 2-point conversation that tied the game at 14.After the two interceptions late, Bortles directed the game-tying drive at the end of regulation.
Aaron Judge and Cody Bellinger Win Rookie of the Year Awards:::::In a year of unprecedented power for Major League Baseball, it was only fitting that the rookies of the year would be record-setting sluggers.The Yankees Aaron Judge, who bashed 52 homers, and the Los Angeles Dodgers Cody Bellinger, who hit 39, were named unanimous winners of their leagues awards on Monday.Major leaguers combined for 6,105 home runs in 2017, the most for any season in history, and Judge and Bellinger helped lead the way.Judge set a home run record for American League rookies, and Bellinger did the same in the National League.Each player received all 30 first-place votes for his league from members of the Baseball Writers Association of America, which has given the awards since 1947.Twenty-three players have won unanimously, including five Hall of Famers Jackie Robinson, Orlando Cepeda, Willie McCovey, Carlton Fisk and Mike Piazza and more recent stars like Derek Jeter, Albert Pujols and Mike Trout.Judge, a 25-year-old right fielder, started the season batting eighth and ended it as the A.L.leader in homers, runs scored (128), walks (127) and strikeouts (208), with a combined on-base and slugging percentage of 1.049, trailing only Trout in the A.L.He hit .284, drove in 114 runs and became the first Yankee to be rookie of the year since Jeter in 1996.Photo Jeter led the Yankees to a championship that season, and Judge came close this year, helping the Yankees reach Game 7 of the A.L.Championship Series, which they lost to Houston.Along the way, he won the All-Star Home Run Derby and inspired a wood-paneled cheering section at Yankee Stadium the Judges Chambers, with fans wearing robes and waving foam gavels.A Supreme Court justice, Sonia Sotomayor, even saw a game there in August.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Since the end of the season, Judges profile has continued to rise.Last week, Sony revealed him as the new cover star of its popular video game, MLB The Show.On Monday, Pepsi announced an endorsement deal with him.
Everyone Is Worried About the Cavs. Except the Cavs.:::::Although some opposing coaches would nominate Houstons James Harden, Rick Carlisle of the Mavericks contends that Clevelands James, at nearly 33 years old, remains the hardest singular force to game-plan against and is still in his prime.And hes playing virtually every position on the floor for them right now, which is pretty unprecedented if you really think about it, Carlisle said.The cynic, however, would undoubtedly retort that James, four times the leagues most valuable player, has to do that much for the Cavaliers as theyre currently constituted because they have so many holes.Even if you buy Jamess contention that his clubs focus isnt nearly as shoddy as outsiders suggest, theres no counter to the fact that the Cavaliers will wake up Monday in Manhattan for their maiden visit of the season to Madison Square Garden ranked last in the league in defensive efficiency (112 points allowed per 100 possessions).The Cavs have foot-speed issues.They have continuity issues, in the wake of trading Kyrie Irving, with more new faces on the roster than returnees.They have injury issues, with the recent setbacks that have sidelined Tristan Thompson (calf) and Derrick Rose (ankle) on top of the lingering hip trouble that has prevented Isaiah Thomas from logging a single second as Jamess new All-Star sidekick.Photo Its real we are having struggles on both ends of the floor, Thomas said.But I think it has a lot to do with, theyve had a guy for the last three or four years that guys been Kyrie able to create off the dribble, get in the paint, get to the foul line.Its hard to adjust to not having that, with me being injured as well and then having seven or eight new guys.All those little things, on top of little things, are whats making us struggle right now.But its a process.Its going to take time for everybody.We know, at the end of the day, everything will be all right.Advertisement Continue reading the main story You can understand why Thomas is so presumptuous after watching Jamess teams represent the Eastern Conference in seven successive N.B.A.finals.Even with the newcomers Jae Crowder and Dwyane Wade struggling to have an influence and the absence of a trusty rim protector, one nagging question in the East hasnt changed: Who can actually exploit Clevelands frailties four times in a seven-game series?The Irving-led Celtics have been the surprise of the season to date, reeling off 12 consecutive victories and surging to the top of the defensive charts in the wake of an 0-2 start and Gordon Haywards horrific leg injury.But who else is truly worthy of pre-Thanksgiving fawning?Would you really have the gumption to pick the Hayward-less Celtics over the Cavaliers in the East finals?Its worth remembering that Cleveland sported the same 5-7 record after 12 games in 2014-15 Jamess first season back in northern Ohio, with Irving and Kevin Love as his wingmen that it took onto the Mavericks floor on Saturday.That team wound up pushing mighty Golden State to six games in the 2015 championship round despite the absence of the injured Love and the loss of Irving in the series opener.Photo There has been a lot of turnover, Cavaliers guard Kyle Korver said.There has been a lot of lineup changes.There has been a lot of 'new.LeBron was hurt for the whole preseason, so the new guys didnt really have a chance to play with him.Theres a lot of excuses if you want to go that route.But were still a confident team.We know what were capable of.We know pieces are going to keep coming in.Our team is going to evolve two or three more times over the course of the season I think everyone here knows that.Scary thought.Maybe not as frightening as the way the Warriors are rolling six wins in a row by at least 17 points to tie a league record but sufficiently haunting for everyone else on Clevelands side of the conference divide.For Dallas, meanwhile, its rare treat of two full practice days before LeBrons annual visit to town did come with a downside.All that extra prep time forced Carlisle to field questions from pesky reporters about the Cavaliers bumpy launch on no fewer than four occasions.Preoccupied with his own teams 2-11 start, Carlisle made it clear through his words that he was ready to steer the conversation elsewhere by the third such interrogation.A lot of people would like to have their struggles, he said of the Cavs.Lets safely assume that includes Clevelands Monday night opponents, even as Kristaps Porzingis Fever justifiably spreads throughout Gotham.
Group of N.F.L. Owners Warns Jerry Jones and Threatens Penalties:::::Joness efforts to derail the five-year extension for the commissioner, which has been in the works for months and is nearly complete, has annoyed a growing number of owners, who are angry that Jones has tried to hold Goodells compensation hostage as a way to punish the commissioner for his decision to suspend Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott.Jones also has been accused of pushing the chief executive of Papa Johns, a pizza chain and a league sponsor, to discredit the commissioner and of leaking false information about the details of Goodells contract negotiations.Two weeks ago, John Schnatter, the Papa Johns chief executive, claimed that player protests during the national anthem had hurt his companys sales.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Jones has denied that he is seeking revenge for Goodells decision to suspend Elliott for six games for violating the leagues personal conduct policy.Rather, Jones has said that he is trying to make Goodells contract talks more transparent in light of what he calls recent missteps by the league office, including how it has handled the protests by players.Jones wants all owners to be able to sign off on the details of Goodells new contract, which would begin in 2019, even though the owners voted unanimously in May to allow the compensation committee to negotiate the specifics of the deal.The six people on the committee the owners of the Chiefs, Falcons, Giants, Patriots, Steelers and Texans have spoken regularly with other owners about the status of the negotiations, and Blank briefed all owners on the contract talks at leaguewide meeting in mid-October.Suspending an owner for conduct detrimental to the league is an extraordinary step, but it has happened.Major League Baseball forced Marge Schott and George Steinbrenner to give up control of their clubs for periods of time.More recently, the N.B.A.forced Donald Sterling to sell the Los Angeles Clippers after he was heard making racist remarks on an audiotape.The commissioner would have to impose the penalties, and is reluctant to do so without a groundswell of owners pushing him to take action, according to several people with knowledge of the situation.Punishing Jones might prompt lawsuits and an even messier public fight.
Debilitated Players Accuse N.F.L. of Stalling on Settlement Payments:::::When the league agreed to the settlement several years ago, retired players were told that they could expect speedy payouts, assuming the diagnoses for Alzheimers, Parkinsons and other ailments covered in the settlement were in order.But the N.F.L.installed so many safeguards and trapdoors into the deal, lawyers for the players said, that in the eight months since the court-approved administrator of the settlement began accepting claims, many players have been forced to spend months scrounging for paperwork they did not think they had to keep, finding new doctors to confirm established diagnoses and lodging time-consuming appeals.The requests, the league said, are part of its efforts to deter potential fraud and do not represent foot-dragging or a lack of will to help the sick men.But as a result, the players now accuse the nations richest league, with $14 billion in revenue, of trying to wear them down so they accept smaller payouts, or none at all.Players will be shorted what they earned, said Andrew Stewart, a retired defensive lineman with Parkinsons disease who expected to receive nearly $3 million but, after a series of delays and requests, has been offered less than a third of that amount and is appealing.This is not a settlement.This is about paying sick men as little as possible.Mr. Stewart, who was in the league from 1989 to 1993 and now lives in Canada, received a Parkinsons diagnosis nearly a decade ago and has been receiving aid from two N.F.L.benefit plans.But to receive money from the settlement, he was required to get a diagnosis from an American doctor.Alerted to some of the delays and accusations of unfairness leveled by lawyers for the players, Anita B. Brody, the federal judge overseeing the case, met with the N.F.L., the plaintiffs chief lawyer and a court-appointed administrator on Monday in Philadelphia to look at ways handle claims more efficiently and more transparently.Like an insurance company, they deny everything, and they go through a series of denials until people give up, said Sheilla Dingus, who runs Advocacy for Fairness in Sports, an unaffiliated nonprofit group that monitors the leagues legal cases.Unfortunately, the N.F.L.has the capital to keep this going a lot longer than some of these players will live.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Orrin Brown, the court-approved administrator of the settlement, said it was common for the parties to settlements to fine-tune their agreements to account for issues that arise.He said that players were now, for instance, being asked to turn in the raw scores from their neurocognitive exams even though that was not explicit in the original agreement.Photo He said the bulk of the claims that had been sent back to players were for missing paperwork.But another group of claims has been reviewed because many players were receiving identical diagnoses from the same physician, leading to questions of whether the players had been properly examined.Mr. Brown said he understood that players and their lawyers might view these additional requirements with suspicion.But he said they were part of an effort to prevent fraud, not block real claims.It does seem people feel they are being nickeled and dimed on paperwork, Mr. Brown said.But theres nothing nefarious or conspiratorial in this.The goal is to make sure everyone gets paid for legitimate claims.The former players who have filed claims are seeking up to $5 million each though most will probably receive far less for severe neurological diseases tied to years of head hits on the field.A total of 20,000 retired players registered so they could submit claims now or in the future from the settlement, which offers one-time cash awards for those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinsons, Alzheimers, dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head hits that is diagnosed posthumously.Chris Seeger, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said that the administration of such class-action settlements often had growing pains because of unanticipated problems.In this case, some former players have pushed the envelope, he said, by, among other things, obtaining diagnoses from psychologists, not neurologists; having doctors affirm diagnoses without examining patients; or submitting claims without the necessary medical records.By bouncing claims back to players, the administrator is trying to address some funny things that didnt look right, and to ensure that when claims are finally evaluated, they have a better chance of being approved, Mr. Seeger said.Mr. Seeger disputes claims by lawyers who accuse the N.F.L.of foot-dragging and trying to reduce payments to players.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Is this working perfectly?No, Mr. Seeger said.But if there arent sufficient records to support a diagnosis, then we have a problem, he said.The procedures are laid out, but there is early on typically confusion.Some of it is legitimate stuff that is getting worked out.Many lawyers for the players do not agree with that explanation.The high number of claims that have been questioned, they said, is evidence that fraud prevention is being used as a way to keep down payouts.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I worked at State Farm for 10 years, so I understand all the tactics, said Patrick Tighe, a lawyer in Florida who represents 90 players.There are all sorts of ways to slow down the claims.Basically, theyre saying you need to start all over again, even if you have a pre-existing diagnosis recognized by an N.F.L.benefit plan.All 35 claims Mr. Tighe has filed have been audited or sent back because of deficiencies, he said.Jim Acho, a lawyer in Michigan who represents former players, including Gale Sayers, said that just four of the nearly three dozen claims he had filed were approved, and that two of those were audited.Jason Luckasevic, who represents dozens of former N.F.L.players, has filed more than 100 claims, and more than 85 percent of them have been flagged for deficiencies.The settlement was sold by the N.F.L.and Seeger as quick pay, Mr. Luckasevic said.This was something everyone feared.This is the N.F.L.disability plan version 2.0.The N.F.L., which insisted on much of the fraud prevention language in the settlement, denies that it has pushed the administrator to deliberately delay the payment of genuine claims, and it denies that stricter requirements were added after the deal was made final.Photo There have been no changes in the terms of the settlement agreement or the criteria for claims approval since the settlement was finalized, Brian McCarthy, a spokesman for the N.F.L., said in a statement, adding that neither the league nor Mr. Seeger had taken any steps to delay the payment of legitimate claims.The frustration among players is particularly acute for those whose neurological diseases were diagnosed years before the settlement was approved, and who are receiving benefits for those ailments from the N.F.L.under one of it regular disability plans.The delays are making it harder for them to cover escalating medical costs and, in some cases, to repay high-interest loans they took out using their settlement as collateral.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yet many players are afraid to speak publicly about their cases because they fear the N.F.L.will deny their claims or strip them of other benefits.Mr. Stewart, one of the few who would talk, said the league must be held accountable.He was found to have Parkinsons disease in 2009, when he was 43.Mr. Stewart expected to receive a gross award of $2.8 million from the concussions settlement.But after he filed a claim, he was told that another doctor had to confirm his diagnosis.The new diagnosis, though, would have applied to his current age, 51, which would have reduced his award by $1.2 million because in the settlement, older players are paid less than younger players on the presumption that their disease is related to age, not football.After Mr. Stewart submitted much additional paperwork, the administrator recognized the earlier diagnosis.But the award was reduced to $750,000 because the administrator calculated he had played only one season, not four.In the settlement, the more eligible seasons a player has, the higher the exposure and the higher the award.But the number of seasons is reduced if players spent time on the injured reserved list because they presumably were not exposed to head hits then.Mr. Stewart does not dispute being injured for parts of his career.But in his day, coaches forced him to keep practicing often with the aid of painkillers so he was exposed to head hits even if he did not play on game day.In many ways, the N.F.L.case is different from many settlements, experts said.Most settlements describe the kinds of documents to support claims, like a credit card number or a receipt.In the N.F.L.settlement, many retirees are applying for benefits for dementia, which can be complicated to diagnose because it is more subjective than, say, A.L.S.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Because awards can reach millions of dollars, the players lawyers many of whom receive a percentage any settlement have an incentive to make their clients look worse than they may be, a reason for the N.F.L.to be alert to fraud, experts said.Indeed, when the deal was first announced in 2013, the N.F.L.agreed to pay $765 million.But players feared the money would run out before every claim was filed, so the league agreed to uncap payments.In return for unlimited liability, the N.F.L.insisted on stronger rules to block fraudulent claims.But the slow pace of approved claims has raised questions about whether those rules were meant to do more than fight fraud.Kenneth Feinberg, who has administered large class-action settlements, including those related to the BP oil spill and the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, said that in the cases he had handled, defendants had a right to try to prevent fraud.But the delays that have come from questioning a large number of claims can erode trust in the settlement.Its not just how many claims have been found eligible, but how quickly the money goes out the door, said Mr. Feinberg, who is not involved in the N.F.L.case.All the words in the world are no substitute for visible evidence of generosity, and checks flowing to families in need.
Carlos Beltran Retires as World Series Champion:::::Cashman is moving at a deliberate pace to fill the opening that was created nearly three weeks ago, when Joe Girardi was dismissed.Rob Thomson, the Yankees bench coach, and Eric Wedge, the former Cleveland Indians and Seattle Mariners manager, have been interviewed.San Francisco Giants hitting coach Hensley Meulens and broadcaster Aaron Boone each of whom played for the Yankees are expected to be interviewed this week.While Beltran has expressed an interest in managing, he has also taken an active role in recovery efforts in his native Puerto Rico and is planning a visit there soon.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Beltran played for seven teams and finished with 2,725 hits, a .279 batting average and an .837 on-base-plus-slugging percentage.He retires as undoubtedly one of the best switch-hitters in baseball, and while he did not reach the milestones of 3,000 hits or 500 home runs (he leaves with 435), some believe he has a solid case for membership in the Baseball Hall of Fame.In his prime, Beltran was a stunning combination of contact, power, speed and fielding.Only five players have recorded 400 home runs and 300 stolen bases in a career: Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez, Willie Mays, Andre Dawson and Beltran.Beltran also hit .307 in 65 career playoff games.In addition to his play on the field, though, Beltran was widely regarded as one of the best teammates in baseball.He was given the Roberto Clemente Award, baseballs highest philanthropic honor, in 2013 in recognition of his efforts to promote baseball and education in Puerto Rico.He was a fierce advocate for players, particularly Latinos, and campaigned for the introduction of the interpreters who are now required in clubhouses.Beltran was a nine-time All-Star, including at age 39 in 2016 with the Yankees, and won three Gold Gloves for his play in center field.The American League rookie of the year with the Kansas City Royals in 1999, he was traded to the Astros in 2004 and hit eight home runs in 12 playoff games, nearly carrying them to the World Series.Beltran played six and a half seasons for the Mets, and then had stints with the Giants, the Rangers, the Cardinals and the Yankees before returning to Houston this season on a one-year deal.While his skills were diminished Beltran hit .231, mostly as a designated hitter and part-time outfielder he played a more important role as an unofficial mentor to everyone.Many Astros officials and players credited Beltrans leadership and tutelage as critical to Houstons World Series title.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I am blessed to be a champion, Beltran wrote in his essay.But now, my time as a player has come to an end.
The A.F.C. Doesnt Have 6 Playoff-Worthy Teams:::::The N.F.L.likes to brag about the competitiveness across the league, how in every year since 2000 at least one team with a winning percentage of .500 or lower midway through its season has gone on to make the playoffs.Seeing that the top 10 in the N.F.C.have winning records, if the streak continues this season it will likely be because of an A.F.C.team: Oakland (4-5), Baltimore (4-5) and Miami (4-4), which plays at Carolina on Monday night, remain very much alive.In the event the N.F.L.decides to keep the current playoff format (sigh), six teams will nonetheless qualify from the A.F.C.Barring a collapse, New England, Pittsburgh and Kansas City are well positioned.As for the other three?Heres a look at the leading candidates: Photo JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS (6-3): By no means was Louis Riddick comparing Jacksonvilles quarterback, Blake Bortles, to Peyton Manning.But, he said, the Jaguars formula for success this season run a lot, throw a little, lean on a ferocious defense resembles that of the Denver Broncos during their Super Bowl season two years ago.Right now theyre more than right to take the ball out of his hands as much as possible, Riddick, an ESPN analyst, said of Bortles in an interview last week.Bortless fourth quarter against the Chargers 7 of 20 passing with two dreadful interceptions corroborated the wisdom of that strategy.But in spite of those interceptions, the Jaguars still won, and they won because of a stingy defense that could propel them to their first playoff berth since the 2007 season.They forced a fumble and a three-and-out immediately after those interceptions and then set up the winning field goal with an A.J.Bouye interception in overtime.All I know, we are the best two corners in the league, cornerback Jalen Ramsey told reporters afterward.What do you all expect?Photo BALTIMORE RAVENS (4-5): If the Ravens defense (18 takeaways) and special teams played every snap, they might win the division.Alas, they do still have to line up under center.Baltimore must hope that quarterback Joe Flacco can summon his late-season wizardry of years past to resuscitate an offense that has averaged 4.4 yards per play, tied for worst in the N.F.L.Any boost could help the Ravens capitalize on a favorable schedule, which concludes with a trip to winless Cleveland and home games against Indianapolis and Cincinnati.Photo TENNESSEE TITANS (6-3): Despite scoring fewer total points than their opponents (205 to 213), the Titans are 6-3.With a few exceptions Miami (-17) and Houston (-49) last season, Indianapolis (-30) in 2012 teams with negative point differentials do not make the playoffs because teams with negative point differentials do not usually win a lot.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its tough to have faith in the Titans, said the former receiver Nate Burleson, now an analyst for NFL Network, in an interview last week.Theyll give you one thing one week, like this is a great product and theyve got weapons, and another week they just look like a shell of themselves.What bodes well for Tennessee, at least on offense, is the improved health of two crucial players: Marcus Mariota, who has seemed to regain his mobility after a hamstring injury, and the rookie receiver Corey Davis, who was targeted 10 times Sunday in his second game back after missing five with a strained hamstring.Photo BUFFALO BILLS (5-4): Buffalos promising start has been erased by two debacles Jets/Saints 81, Bills 31 and unless they fix their rampant defensive issues, they will spend an 18th straight playoffs on the outside.Across their last five games (three losses), the Bills have allowed an average of 28.4 points and 403 yards.With a run-heavy offense and a passing game that is more opportunistic than potent, Buffalo is not built to overcome weekly defensive implosions.Photo OAKLAND RAIDERS (4-5): Heres an unbelievable statistic: Of the 288 passes thrown against the Raiders, none have been intercepted.They have yielded the highest completion rate, 71.2 percent, and a 110.5 rating to quarterbacks.In a pass-oriented league, Oaklands potency on offense, highlighted by quarterback Derek Carr and receivers Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree, is negated by its ineffectiveness on defense.Among the quarterbacks Oakland must still face: Tom Brady, Alex Smith, Carson Wentz and Dak Prescott.Photo MIAMI DOLPHINS (4-4): The Dolphins, the lowest-scoring team in the N.F.L., are here more in deference to their record than for any tangible reason.But Jay Cutler just might provide one.He went from the Fox broadcast booth to the football field when the incumbent quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, hurt his knee.It has taken two months for Cutler to mesh with the team, and across his last two games he has thrown for five touchdowns against one interception with a 120.5 passer rating.
Hockeys Concussion Conversation Goes Quiet at the Hall of Fame:::::He does not plan to mention head injuries in his speech, either.A quiet and private person, Kariya has made it clear he does not want to be the public face of the sports concussion problems.In recent years, the discourse on head injuries in sports like football and hockey has become more public, sometimes laid bare in Hall of Fame ceremonies.N.F.L.players like linebacker Junior Seau and quarterback Ken Stabler were inducted posthumously into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.After their deaths, they were found to have had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease believed to be caused by repeated hits to the head.The N.H.L.has not had to deal with a similar situation, and Lanny McDonald, the chairman of the Hockey Hall of Fame, said, I dont know if it will ever happen, but you can never say never.McDonald said the ceremony was not the right time for the inductees to talk about concussions.The Pro Football Hall of Fame initially did not allow Seaus daughter to speak at his induction ceremony in 2015; his 2012 death a suicide and a subsequent lawsuit against the N.F.L.loomed over the proceedings.Everyone has equal opportunity to speak at the podium for their five minutes and say whatever they would like, McDonald said.We dont coach them on it.But I think this is more of a celebration.Though hockey players brains have not been studied as much as football players, several hockey players have been found to have had C.T.E.after their deaths.More than 200 former N.H.L.players have sued the league, saying it should have done more to protect them from the dangers of head trauma.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Unlike the N.F.L., which reached a settlement in a lawsuit by former players, the N.H.L.has not acknowledged a link between concussions and C.T.E.Photo Kariya, 43, said his thoughts on concussions did not need to be reiterated in his Hall of Fame speech.Ive spoken about it since my first concussion back in 1997, he said Friday after receiving his Hall of Fame ring.Kariyas position is that targeted head shots should have no part in the game and that punishment should be harsher.The N.H.L.introduced a rule dealing with illegal checks to the head in 2010, but that has not eliminated them.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.For my taste, its going a little bit slower than the way it should, said Kariya, who starred for the Ducks from 1995 to 2003, scoring 300 of his 402 career goals with them.But 10 years from now, Im confident, were going to be in a better place than we are now.He said he was bitter for a long time.When you wake up in a hospital bed and you dont know who you are, where you are, or what got you there, youre not in a happy spot, Kariya said.Theres a lot of anger.With time, you learn to have a different perspective on it.When I look back at my career, thats the last thing I think about.A concussion from a crosscheck to the head caused Kariya to miss much of the 1997-98 season and the Winter Olympics.Another notable hit came in Game 6 of the 2003 Stanley Cup finals when he was blindsided by Devils defenseman Scott Stevens.Kariya remembers nothing from that hit and did not even remember coming back later that period and scoring a goal.His former Ducks teammate Teemu Selanne, who is also in the Hall of Fame class of 2017, cringes when he looks back at that mid-ice collision.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I have seen that hit now so many times, Selanne said.How late it was.It makes me sick.Kariya, who also played for Colorado, Nashville and St. Louis, is able to surf a few times a week in California and snowboard in his native British Columbia.After officially retiring in 2011, he took up ballroom dancing on a doctors suggestion to keep his brain sharp.The doctor said this is a great thing for you to do for your brain, Kariya said.As a male, to be able to lead and remember the steps, its very engaging with the mind.There are, of course, other hockey greats whose careers were ended by concussions, including Pat LaFontaine, who entered the Hall of Fame in 2003.Dave Andreychuk, another inductee this year, played with LaFontaine.I went through it with him, Andreychuk said.I know what its like.I went to his house while he was off.We just talked the other day about it.Mark Recchi, another 2017 inductee, who is currently an assistant coach with the Pittsburgh Penguins, said he was confident that young players today were more aware of concussions and of how to handle them.He said he had talked about the dangers with his 16-year-old son, Cameron, a forward at Cushing Academy, a prep school near Boston.He had a little one when he was 14, Recchi said.He got hit and had a little headache.So he didnt play for a week.We went through the protocol with the team.That wouldnt have happened in my day.
Antidoping Officials Obtain Trove of Russian Lab Data:::::This confirms the schemes and provides more definitive evidence about disappearing positives at the Moscow lab, said Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer whose independent investigation conducted last year illuminated the breadth and depth of the doping program.If the information provides what we think it will provide, it should confirm doping rule violations.There are already a series of cases that have been closed with the approval of WADA, and now those cases may well be reopened.The antidoping agency said in a news release that its investigators were finalizing the forensic analysis of the enormous backup file and assessing what information is relevant, asserting that they were confident in the authenticity of the information.Photo Russian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment submitted to the governments sports ministry.The antidoping regulator seized the opportunity on Friday to restate another request: that Russia accept the findings of Mr. McLarens inquiry, which confirmed that top government officials and Russias Federal Security Service had helped with coordinated cheating.This new intelligence serves to reinforce our requirement of Russian authorities that they too publicly accept the outcomes, of last years investigation, the global antidoping agencys president, Craig Reedie, said in a statement.Through Mr. McLarens inquiry, the antidoping watchdog deconstructed Russias cheating schemes and determined that some 1,000 athletes had been tied up in them over three and a half years.Still, officials determined that many individual cases would be hard or impossible to prosecute, in part because of Russias lack of cooperation in providing certain evidence, including stored urine samples and the electronic lab records on past tests.Antidoping officials from several countries who have urged Olympic leaders to take a harder stance against Russia in the wake of Mr. McLarens investigation even calling for the nation to be barred from the Pyeongchang Games have pointed to Russias refusal to turn over the electronic data.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The World Anti-Doping Agency had ordered Russia to share the database before the watchdog would agree to restore Russia to good standing and certify its compliance with the global antidoping code.The agency is due to evaluate Russias cooperation and decide whether to recertify the nation at a meeting next week in Seoul.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Investigators who have studied how Russia corrupted several Olympics most notably the 2014 Sochi Games, where the country controlled the antidoping laboratory and dominated the medal standings have coveted the electronic files from Moscow.Known as laboratory information management system data, the records reflect the results of lab tests run on the machines in Russias national antidoping lab, a nondescript five-story building a few miles from the Kremlin.They also reveal the identity of the athlete to whom each lab analysis corresponded.Photo Outside of international competitions, nations are responsible for drug-testing their own athletes and for reporting the results of those tests to a global database.In Russia, however, the national antidoping laboratory alerted the nations sports ministry when athletes tested positive, and they often followed a deputy sports ministers directive to falsely report positive drug tests as clean results to international authorities, according to both Mr. McLaren and the former longtime director of Russias lab, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov.In an inquiry report published last December, Mr. McLaren said that he had uncovered records that more than 500 such incriminating tests were falsely recorded from 2011 to 2015.Well-known and elite level athletes had their initial results automatically falsified, he wrote, noting that, without access to Russias lab data and forensic analysis of it, the extent of similar discrepancies and the full scope of cheating could not possibly be known.But if the database now in the regulators possession reveals new inconsistencies in the testing histories of Russian athletes, sports officials could mount strong disciplinary cases.Without a positive drug test, it can be challenging to build a case against an athlete that will withstand a legal challenge.To date, Olympic officials have issued penalties against six Russian Olympians who competed in Sochi and have exonerated another; investigations into scores of others are continuing.Global officials from each sport have separately been asked to review allegations against hundreds of athletes.The antidoping regulator itself has agreed to close at least 95 such suspicious cases identified by Mr. McLaren based on a lack of evidence.Olympic officials are currently deliberating how to punish Russia for its state-sponsored schemes, for which no Russian government official was allowed to attend the 2016 Rio Games.The International Olympic Committee is expected to announced its decision regarding Russias participation in the 2018 Winter Games in early December.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The issue has escalated far beyond the sports world, stirring geopolitical rhetoric.President Vladimir V. Putin this week criticized the recent disciplinary decisions against Russian Olympians as an American attempt to undermine Russia and affect his nations presidential election in March.
Can the Browns Win a Game This Season?:::::Two weeks later, the Browns rallied from 17 points down against a bad Colts team, only to lose by 3 again to fall to 0-3.Down by 3 late against the Jets two weeks later, the Browns went for it on fourth-and-2 at the 4, but came up short.0-5.Two weeks later, the Browns took a game against the Titans into overtime after kicker Zane Gonzalez made a 54-yard field goal.Then they lost on a field goal in overtime.0-7.The Browns decades-long struggle to settle on a quarterback is well known.This season Kizer was benched for Kevin Hogan, then reinstated, then benched for Cody Kessler, then reinstated again.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But focusing on this years 0-9 start can lead to missing the broader picture.The Browns have been terrible for a long time.Last seasons team scared 0-16 as well: It started 0-14 before scraping out its only win against the Chargers.The season before, the Browns were 3-13.Cleveland has not had a winning record since 2007, and has not made the playoffs since 2002.The Browns last championship?It was in 1964.So where could a win come this season?Unfortunately, no teams as bad as the Giants are on the Browns schedule.Winning on the road is hard, and three away games on the Cleveland schedule look tough: at the Chargers, Bears and Bengals.None of those teams are outstanding, but all are clearly better than the Browns.Sometimes the last game of the season is an opportunity for a surprising result.The Browns finish up at Pittsburgh, and the Steelers may well be locked into a playoff position by that point.On the other hand, the Steelers are also one of the leagues best teams, and their backups would probably be favored at home over the Browns.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That leaves the three home games.Two are against solid teams, the Jaguars and the Ravens, and the Browns look likely to be at least a touchdown underdog in each of those games.But there is hope: the Packers visit Cleveland on Dec. 10.Under ordinary circumstances, the Packers would be a solid favorite, but Aaron Rodgers is out, and his replacement Brett Hundley is 1-2 and putting up anemic numbers.Hundleys adjusted yards per attempt figure of 4.6 is among the leagues worst.(Of course, it is still better than Kizers 3.66.)The other thing the Browns have going for them is that they have seven games left.Thats a lot of chances for something strange to happen.Even if one gives Cleveland only a 10 percent chance to win each game, they would have better than even odds of succeeding at least once.
An Unlikely Yale Reunion on the U.S. Mens Hockey Team:::::Getting the chance to play for the Olympic team was something I never even thought about because there were always N.H.L.superstars going to the Olympics, not players like us, said Backman, 31, a forward for Eisbren Berlin.So to even be here right now is special, but to do it with these guys, and Keith, makes it even that much more special.They flew to Augsburg, then, to chase a dream they didnt know they had.The roster for the Olympics will be announced on Jan. 1.For the 29 players on the Deutschland Cup roster, the tournament was a final opportunity to make an up-close impression on the coaching staff.(The American team lost all three of its games at the tournament.)Photo Theres complete excitement in their eyes about what this opportunity is, said Jim Johannson, the assistant executive director of hockey operations for U.S.A. Hockey.Its not necessarily a new lease on life, but its a really unique opportunity in this stage of all their careers.Johannson made countless phone calls to prospective players this summer to bring them up to speed on the special situation.The player pool was suddenly wide open.He told them that nothing was guaranteed but that if they wanted a shot to make the squad, the opportunity would be there.For the players, raising their hands was easy.This generation has watched hockey superstars suit up for their respective countries and go to battle every four years a competition far more intriguing than, say, an N.H.L.All-Star Game.The players in Augsburg were too young to have witnessed the 1980 Miracle on Ice, the single greatest cultural touchstone of American hockey, but they knew all about it, of course.Little, for instance, grew up with a picture frame in his room with a built-in speaker that played the final 10 seconds of Al Michaelss famous call from that game.I heard that thousands of times, and I can repeat it to this day, said Little, 29, a forward for HC Davos in the top Swiss league.Obviously, the Olympics are a dream as a kid.Ive never played in the N.H.L., so the dream starts to fade as you get older.But once this popped up, it was like, Wow, this may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The players were part of a close-knit group at Yale.Allain became the teams head coach before the 2006-7 season, when Arcobello and Backman were freshmen.Little entered school the following year, ONeill the year after that.The program required recharging after three decades under Coach Tim Taylor.Allain quickly fostered an environment that balanced intense discipline the players laughed about his habit of kicking the back of the bench with open creativity.The results followed.In 2010, they won their first N.C.A.A.tournament game since 1952.Even amid their success at Yale, the players never viewed professional hockey careers as a sure thing.ONeill said his main ambition as a teenager was simply to make it to a good college program, and once at Yale, he spent his time wondering what job he could secure after graduation.He sought out internships and odd jobs, working construction and manning a funnel cake station at a minor-league baseball stadium.Photo Hockey was on the back burner: if it happens, it happens; if it doesnt, it doesnt, said ONeill, 29, who played 22 games for the Devils a couple of seasons ago and now plays in Finland.I think all of us had that mentality.ONeill has been trying to manage his own expectations during the national team selection process.But he admitted he had at times imagined what it would be like to attend the opening ceremony and walk alongside the other athletes, all dressed up in Ralph Lauren stuff.As much as the Yale players peeked toward the future, the week in Augsburg felt like a throwback.They made jokes and mercilessly ribbed each other in the locker room, like they had at Yale.They tried to revive their old synergy on the ice.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Backman and Arcobello were roommates as sophomores, sharing a room that Arcobello decorated with haphazard drawings on loose-leaf paper.(Arcobello was also in charge of capturing the mice at the hockey house.)The two were groomsmen at each others weddings, which took place within a span of two weeks two summers ago.These days, Arcobello, Backman and ONeill often train together at the same gym in Fairfield, Conn.

Rafael Nadal Withdraws From the ATP Finals With a Knee Injury:::::Photo LONDON Rafael Nadal will have to wait another year to win the ATP Finals.The top-ranked Nadal withdrew from the elite, season-ending tournament after losing his opening match to David Goffin, 7-6 (5), 6-7 (4), 6-4, on Monday at the O2 Arena.Nadal pulled out of the Paris Masters at the quarterfinal stage 10 days ago and admitted ahead of the ATP Finals, which is played on indoor hardcourts, that his knees were still not perfect.Despite having qualified 13 consecutive times for the ATP Finals, only eight of which he has been fit enough to compete in, Nadal has never won the event.He will be replaced his Spanish compatriot Pablo Carreo Busta, a United States Open semifinalist this year.My season is finished, Nadal said.Yeah, I had the commitment with the event, with the city, with myself.I tried hard.I did the thing that I had to do to try to be ready to play.I tried, but seriously was miracle to be very close in the score during the match.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After two breaks of serve each, Goffin claimed an ugly opening set via a tiebreaker and was on the verge of victory in the second, but Nadals fighting spirit saved four match points to force another tiebreaker and draw even.
FIFA Trial Opens With References to Cash Drops and Bag Men:::::Of the more than 40 defendants charged by American authorities in the far-reaching case, Mr. Burga, Mr. Napout and Mr. Marin are the only ones who have been extradited to the United States and who continue to maintain their innocence.The first defendant to be sentenced in the case, a former Guatemalan judge, received eight months in prison last month.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.According to prosecutors, Mr. Napout accepted bribes in cash; Mr. Marin received them in a New York bank account; and Mr. Burga wary of accepting money while under criminal investigation in Peru accepted promises of future payments.But lawyers for the defendants contended Monday that the government, while effective at uncovering corruption, had wrongly implicated their clients.What this case is about is a government concluding that everyone involved at high levels of soccer is dirty, said Silvia B. Piera-Vazquez, a lawyer for Mr. Napout.The F.B.I.and the I.R.S.did a wonderful job, she added, referencing what she called at least tens of millions of dollars spent on the federal investigation.But they didnt find one wire transfer of dirty money into Juans accounts.Bruce L. Udolf, a lawyer for Mr. Burga, similarly credited the government for its efforts.But they got too ambitious, used too broad a brush, he said, distancing Mr. Burga from the scores of defendants who have entered guilty pleas in the case and the witnesses poised to testify against the three defendants in coming weeks.In introducing the case to the anonymous jury chosen last week after documented attempts at intimidation Mr. Edelman, who was among the prosecutors who worked on the latest charges announced against the Bonanno organized crime family earlier this year, opened with an anecdote closer to home for the jury of New Yorkers.He described a party at the St. Regis Hotel in Miami, celebrating a South American tournament brought to the United States through coordinated bribe payments.The defense lawyers emphasizing the sprawling web of relationships in international soccer and the long arm of American justice urged the jury not to jump to conclusions about their clients simply because of their associations with convicted criminals.If youve ever watched kids playing soccer, there are always one or two, theyre standing there but theyre not really playing, Charles Stillman, Mr. Marins lawyer, said, likening his 85-year-old client to a clueless bystander.He is like the youngster on the side picking up daisies.
Giants Owners Say Ben McAdoo Will Remain for Rest of Season:::::Our plan is to do what we have always done, which is to not offer a running commentary on the season, the statement continued.It is our responsibility to determine the reasons for our poor performance and at the end of the year, we will evaluate the 2017 season in its entirety and make a determination on how we move forward.McAdoo was not sure how things would change with the owners statement, a move seemingly made to stop weekly speculation.Well have to see how everybody responds, McAdoo said late Monday afternoon.Again, my focus is as it always is, on the week of preparation, to try to put a good plan together, help these coaches and players any way I can putting a good product on the field, and finding a way to get better.The Giants have not done that much this season, and the product had been very ugly the past two weeks.MetLife Stadium was more than half empty in the second half of the 51-17 loss to the Rams, and Sundays loss had to be rock bottom.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I am disappointed, but I am determined to find a way to get it fixed, McAdoo said Thats where my focus is.No one expected our record to be what it is at this point, or us to be playing the type of football we are playing at this point.But we are, and we are what our record says we are, and the film reflects it.We need to find a way to improve.The situation got even tougher for McAdoo last week when two anonymous players were quoted by ESPN as saying that he had lost the team, that some players had quit, and that players were angry about an inordinate amount of fines.McAdoo also caught some flak for suspending cornerbacks Janoris Jenkins and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie in the last month for violations of team rules.They are both popular with teammates.McAdoo replaced Tom Coughlin as head coach last year and led the Giants to an 11-5 record.They were blown out by the Green Bay Packers in the wild-card playoff game.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Much was expected this season with a good defense almost entirely returning and the offense bolstered by the signing of the free-agent receiver Brandon Marshall and the addition of tight end Evan Engram, the first-round draft pick.General Manager Jerry Reese made a calculated risk to keep a weak offensive line together in hopes that the blockers would blossom.Almost everything went wrong.Marshall was a bust, then he and Odell Beckham Jr. sustained season-ending ankle injuries against the Chargers on Oct. 8 in the teams fifth straight loss.The line has been horrible and banged-up for most of the season.While the defense has played well at times, it has failed to hold fourth-quarter leads early in the season and given up way too many big plays lately.
Italy Misses World Cup as Sweden Wins Playoff:::::Photo MILAN Italy failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in six decades after a scoreless tie on Monday meant it lost its two-leg playoff to Sweden, 1-0, on aggregate.Italy, a four-time champion, dominated possession but struggled to create clear-cut scoring chances as Sweden secured a first appearance at World Cup since 2006 on the strength of Jakob Johanssons first-leg strike in Stockholm.Despite the support of 74,000 fans in a white-hot atmosphere at the San Siro, Italy could not find a way through.It is the third time that the Italians will not compete at the World Cup, after skipping the first edition in 1930 in Uruguay and not qualifying for the 1958 finals in Sweden.It also marked the end of an era for Italys iconic goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who failed in his effort to compete in a record sixth World Cup.Buffon, 39, had announced that the World Cup in Russia would be his last as a player for the national side.Photo Im sorry, sorry, sorry, a tearful Buffon told Rai television after Mondays game as he confirmed he was ending his international career.Im not sorry for myself but all of Italian football, because we failed at something which also means something on a social level.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its the only regret I have.Not stopping, because time passes and its normal.I regret just that my final match with the national side coincides with an elimination.
Croatia and Switzerland Clinch World Cup Berths:::::Croatia Coach Zlatko Lakic, who took over the team on Oct. 7, played down his own role in qualification.We have many quality players, Lakic said.I did not have to make much of an effort.I should remind you there was a coach before me, and what is happening now is the result of a joint effort.Lakic replaced Ante Cacic, who was fired the day after a draw at home with Finland and two days before the last group-stage qualifier, at Ukraine, which Croatia won in Lakics debut.Greece Coach Michael Skibbe said the first leg had done the damage.We had 12 good games at the qualifiers, Skibbe said.He added, referring to Greeces poor performance in Croatia: On this level of football, it is not allowed to make mistakes like these.He said Greece had had the bad luck to lose defender Costas Manolas to a suspension and other players to injury.This is the third time, after 1998 and 2014, Croatia has qualified for the World Cup finals through playoffs.Croatia has never lost in playoffs, including two qualifications for the European Championship.SWITZERLAND ADVANCES Switzerland will go to the World Cup with a 1-0 aggregate victory after left-back Ricardo Rodrguez sank Northern Irelands hopes in each game of their playoff, at each end of the field.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In each leg, the crucial incident involved one of Northern Irelands Evans brothers.Switzerland needed only a draw on Sunday to advance to Russia, and a tense 0-0 result in rain-soaked Basel was preserved by Rodrguez with a goal-line clearance in stoppage time of Jonny Evanss header.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In the right moment, he was in the right place, Switzerland Coach Vladimir Petkovic said of Rodrguez.The draw meant that Switzerlands disputed penalty for handball in the first-leg victory in Belfast on Thursday made all the difference.Rodrguez scored that spot kick, when Corey Evans was penalized on a call that few agreed with.Northern Ireland Coach Michael ONeill said his teams departure after a spirited second half on Sunday was a devastating moment.It was decided by a really poor decision and a penalty that should never have been, ONeill said.We should still be playing extra time now.Northern Ireland arrived in Basel with aggression that had been strangely lacking in the home leg.Still, Switzerland dominated much of the first half and should have sealed its place at a fourth straight World Cup much earlier.Center forward Haris Seferovic was most at fault, failing to hit the target with two first-half headed chances and a late shot that was lofted high over the goal.Though Petkovic declined to criticize Seferovic, who was booed by some fans when he was taken out, he acknowledged a regular weakness of his 11th-ranked team.We have to be more clinical in front of goal, Petkovic said through an interpreter.We had to suffer to the end, especially with this chance Northern Ireland had.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the first of four stoppage-time minutes, Jonny Evans rose at the far post to meet a cross that goalkeeper Yann Sommer misjudged, leaving himself stranded.Rodrguez moved across the goal mouth toward the post and hooked the ball clear as he fell backward into the goal.The Swiss will enter the pot of second-seeded teams for the World Cup draw on Dec. 1 in Moscow.We dont really set limits for us it could be even to the final, said Petkovic, who should have his best players at their peak in Russia.
Ryan Fitzpatrick Leads Buccaneers Past the Jets:::::Fitzpatrick, who completed 17 of 34 passes for 187 yards with one touchdown and one interception, guided the Buccaneers on two lengthy scoring drives.In the first quarter, Fitzpatrick, a 13th-year pro from Harvard, led a nearly eight-minute drive that ended with the first of Patrick Murrays four field goals to give the Buccaneers a 3-0 lead.More impressive, he finished a 15-play, 81-yard drive with his fourth-quarter scoring pass to Sims that ultimately was the difference in the game.Fitzpatrick is one of only four players in N.F.L.history to throw touchdown passes for seven teams.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Gritty thats what Ryan is, Buccaneers Coach Dirk Koetter said.Hes a get-it-done kind of guy.Hes going to make some plays that you dont expect him to, and he might miss a couple plays youd like him to make.Hes a tough guy.Hes a competitor, and you cant have enough of those kinds of guys on your team.McCown, who has played for 10 franchises in 15 seasons, and was 1-10 as starter with the Buccaneers in 2014, completed 23 of 39 passes for 263 yards for the Jets, with one touchdown and one interception.Robby Anderson caught a 38-yard touchdown pass in the final minute, scoring for the fourth straight game to give the Jets one last chance.But Tampa Bays Chris Godwin recovered the ensuing onside kick to end any hope of a Jets comeback.The loss was especially disappointing for the Jets, given how well they played in beating Buffalo by 34-21 the previous week, their only victory in the last five games.On Sunday, the Jets outgained the Buccaneers, 275 yards to 271, but more than 100 yards came on their final two possessions as they were trying to cut into a 12-point deficit.Very frustrating, McCown said, adding: We understand this is the National Football League.Youve got to bring your A-game every week.We just didnt come out and play at the level were capable of.As for the Buccaneers, Winston injured his shoulder on Oct. 15 but made three more starts before the team decided to shut him down for at least two weeks.Tampa Bay also played without Mike Evans, its leading receiver.He served a one-game league suspension for his role in a sideline skirmish the previous week at New Orleans.Todd Bowles, the Jets coach, was unable to explain how his team could play so well against the Bills, then struggle against an opponent that had lost five games in a row.Advertisement Continue reading the main story You dont explain it.Its week by week, Bowles said of the Jets, who turned the ball over twice and allowed sacks by six Buccaneers.Youve got to show up every week in this league or youll get it handed to you.We didnt show up today.
With Season Already Sunk, the Giants Droop a Little Lower:::::The Giants have not fired a coach during the season since 1976, when Bill Arnsparger was let go after a 0-7 start and replaced by John McVay, who had more success as an executive who helped build the 49ers dynasty in the 1980s.That doesnt have anything to do with anything, McAdoo said of his job security.We have to find a way to win a game.We have to address what happened out here on the field today, take a look at the tape and be honest with each other.There wont be a lot of good to see on this tape.The defense was gashed by big plays through the air and on the ground, and the Giants were barely able to touch the rookie quarterback C. J. Beathard, who had been sacked 14 times in three starts.Eli Manning, in a milestone start, failed to lead the Giants to a score in the second half until a touchdown long after the game had been decided.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Even the special teams had issues, with Aldrick Rosas setting up a San Francisco field goal by sending the opening kick out of bounds and then missing a 34-yard field goal on the opening drive of the second half.We got schooled, cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie said.I did not see enough relentless play, attitude.You name it, I did not see it.Everything we should have done, I felt we did not do it.The Giants allowed Beathard to throw scoring passes of 83 yards to Marquise Goodwin and 47 yards to Garrett Celek in the second quarter, then gave up a 33-yard touchdown run by the rookie Matt Breida in the fourth quarter.Manning committed a key fumble with the Giants driving in the first half of his 208th consecutive start, tying his brother Peyton for the second-longest streak by a quarterback in N.F.L.history, trailing only Brett Favres 297.Mannings numbers looked good, as he completed 28 of 37 passes for 273 yards and two touchdowns, but the offense generated only one first down on three drives in the second half, when San Francisco (1-9) expanded its lead from 17-13 to 31-13.Were in this situation; were the reason were in it, Manning said.So we just have to keep working, compete every week and expect to win every week.

Giants Owners Say Ben McAdoo Will Remain for Rest of Season:::::Our plan is to do what we have always done, which is to not offer a running commentary on the season, the statement continued.It is our responsibility to determine the reasons for our poor performance and at the end of the year, we will evaluate the 2017 season in its entirety and make a determination on how we move forward.McAdoo was not sure how things would change with the owners statement, a move seemingly made to stop weekly speculation.Well have to see how everybody responds, McAdoo said late Monday afternoon.Again, my focus is as it always is, on the week of preparation, to try to put a good plan together, help these coaches and players any way I can putting a good product on the field, and finding a way to get better.The Giants have not done that much this season, and the product had been very ugly the past two weeks.MetLife Stadium was more than half empty in the second half of the 51-17 loss to the Rams, and Sundays loss had to be rock bottom.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I am disappointed, but I am determined to find a way to get it fixed, McAdoo said Thats where my focus is.No one expected our record to be what it is at this point, or us to be playing the type of football we are playing at this point.But we are, and we are what our record says we are, and the film reflects it.We need to find a way to improve.The situation got even tougher for McAdoo last week when two anonymous players were quoted by ESPN as saying that he had lost the team, that some players had quit, and that players were angry about an inordinate amount of fines.McAdoo also caught some flak for suspending cornerbacks Janoris Jenkins and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie in the last month for violations of team rules.They are both popular with teammates.McAdoo replaced Tom Coughlin as head coach last year and led the Giants to an 11-5 record.They were blown out by the Green Bay Packers in the wild-card playoff game.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Much was expected this season with a good defense almost entirely returning and the offense bolstered by the signing of the free-agent receiver Brandon Marshall and the addition of tight end Evan Engram, the first-round draft pick.General Manager Jerry Reese made a calculated risk to keep a weak offensive line together in hopes that the blockers would blossom.Almost everything went wrong.Marshall was a bust, then he and Odell Beckham Jr. sustained season-ending ankle injuries against the Chargers on Oct. 8 in the teams fifth straight loss.The line has been horrible and banged-up for most of the season.While the defense has played well at times, it has failed to hold fourth-quarter leads early in the season and given up way too many big plays lately.
Group of N.F.L. Owners Warns Jerry Jones and Threatens Penalties:::::Joness efforts to derail the five-year extension for the commissioner, which has been in the works for months and is nearly complete, has annoyed a growing number of owners, who are angry that Jones has tried to hold Goodells compensation hostage as a way to punish the commissioner for his decision to suspend Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott.Jones also has been accused of pushing the chief executive of Papa Johns, a pizza chain and a league sponsor, to discredit the commissioner and of leaking false information about the details of Goodells contract negotiations.Two weeks ago, John Schnatter, the Papa Johns chief executive, claimed that player protests during the national anthem had hurt his companys sales.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Jones has denied that he is seeking revenge for Goodells decision to suspend Elliott for six games for violating the leagues personal conduct policy.Rather, Jones has said that he is trying to make Goodells contract talks more transparent in light of what he calls recent missteps by the league office, including how it has handled the protests by players.Jones wants all owners to be able to sign off on the details of Goodells new contract, which would begin in 2019, even though the owners voted unanimously in May to allow the compensation committee to negotiate the specifics of the deal.The six people on the committee the owners of the Chiefs, Falcons, Giants, Patriots, Steelers and Texans have spoken regularly with other owners about the status of the negotiations, and Blank briefed all owners on the contract talks at leaguewide meeting in mid-October.Suspending an owner for conduct detrimental to the league is an extraordinary step, but it has happened.Major League Baseball forced Marge Schott and George Steinbrenner to give up control of their clubs for periods of time.More recently, the N.B.A.forced Donald Sterling to sell the Los Angeles Clippers after he was heard making racist remarks on an audiotape.The commissioner would have to impose the penalties, and is reluctant to do so without a groundswell of owners pushing him to take action, according to several people with knowledge of the situation.Punishing Jones might prompt lawsuits and an even messier public fight.
Can the Browns Win a Game This Season?:::::Two weeks later, the Browns rallied from 17 points down against a bad Colts team, only to lose by 3 again to fall to 0-3.Down by 3 late against the Jets two weeks later, the Browns went for it on fourth-and-2 at the 4, but came up short.0-5.Two weeks later, the Browns took a game against the Titans into overtime after kicker Zane Gonzalez made a 54-yard field goal.Then they lost on a field goal in overtime.0-7.The Browns decades-long struggle to settle on a quarterback is well known.This season Kizer was benched for Kevin Hogan, then reinstated, then benched for Cody Kessler, then reinstated again.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But focusing on this years 0-9 start can lead to missing the broader picture.The Browns have been terrible for a long time.Last seasons team scared 0-16 as well: It started 0-14 before scraping out its only win against the Chargers.The season before, the Browns were 3-13.Cleveland has not had a winning record since 2007, and has not made the playoffs since 2002.The Browns last championship?It was in 1964.So where could a win come this season?Unfortunately, no teams as bad as the Giants are on the Browns schedule.Winning on the road is hard, and three away games on the Cleveland schedule look tough: at the Chargers, Bears and Bengals.None of those teams are outstanding, but all are clearly better than the Browns.Sometimes the last game of the season is an opportunity for a surprising result.The Browns finish up at Pittsburgh, and the Steelers may well be locked into a playoff position by that point.On the other hand, the Steelers are also one of the leagues best teams, and their backups would probably be favored at home over the Browns.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That leaves the three home games.Two are against solid teams, the Jaguars and the Ravens, and the Browns look likely to be at least a touchdown underdog in each of those games.But there is hope: the Packers visit Cleveland on Dec. 10.Under ordinary circumstances, the Packers would be a solid favorite, but Aaron Rodgers is out, and his replacement Brett Hundley is 1-2 and putting up anemic numbers.Hundleys adjusted yards per attempt figure of 4.6 is among the leagues worst.(Of course, it is still better than Kizers 3.66.)The other thing the Browns have going for them is that they have seven games left.Thats a lot of chances for something strange to happen.Even if one gives Cleveland only a 10 percent chance to win each game, they would have better than even odds of succeeding at least once.
Debilitated Players Accuse N.F.L. of Stalling on Settlement Payments:::::When the league agreed to the settlement several years ago, retired players were told that they could expect speedy payouts, assuming the diagnoses for Alzheimers, Parkinsons and other ailments covered in the settlement were in order.But the N.F.L.installed so many safeguards and trapdoors into the deal, lawyers for the players said, that in the eight months since the court-approved administrator of the settlement began accepting claims, many players have been forced to spend months scrounging for paperwork they did not think they had to keep, finding new doctors to confirm established diagnoses and lodging time-consuming appeals.The requests, the league said, are part of its efforts to deter potential fraud and do not represent foot-dragging or a lack of will to help the sick men.But as a result, the players now accuse the nations richest league, with $14 billion in revenue, of trying to wear them down so they accept smaller payouts, or none at all.Players will be shorted what they earned, said Andrew Stewart, a retired defensive lineman with Parkinsons disease who expected to receive nearly $3 million but, after a series of delays and requests, has been offered less than a third of that amount and is appealing.This is not a settlement.This is about paying sick men as little as possible.Mr. Stewart, who was in the league from 1989 to 1993 and now lives in Canada, received a Parkinsons diagnosis nearly a decade ago and has been receiving aid from two N.F.L.benefit plans.But to receive money from the settlement, he was required to get a diagnosis from an American doctor.Alerted to some of the delays and accusations of unfairness leveled by lawyers for the players, Anita B. Brody, the federal judge overseeing the case, met with the N.F.L., the plaintiffs chief lawyer and a court-appointed administrator on Monday in Philadelphia to look at ways handle claims more efficiently and more transparently.Like an insurance company, they deny everything, and they go through a series of denials until people give up, said Sheilla Dingus, who runs Advocacy for Fairness in Sports, an unaffiliated nonprofit group that monitors the leagues legal cases.Unfortunately, the N.F.L.has the capital to keep this going a lot longer than some of these players will live.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Orrin Brown, the court-approved administrator of the settlement, said it was common for the parties to settlements to fine-tune their agreements to account for issues that arise.He said that players were now, for instance, being asked to turn in the raw scores from their neurocognitive exams even though that was not explicit in the original agreement.Photo He said the bulk of the claims that had been sent back to players were for missing paperwork.But another group of claims has been reviewed because many players were receiving identical diagnoses from the same physician, leading to questions of whether the players had been properly examined.Mr. Brown said he understood that players and their lawyers might view these additional requirements with suspicion.But he said they were part of an effort to prevent fraud, not block real claims.It does seem people feel they are being nickeled and dimed on paperwork, Mr. Brown said.But theres nothing nefarious or conspiratorial in this.The goal is to make sure everyone gets paid for legitimate claims.The former players who have filed claims are seeking up to $5 million each though most will probably receive far less for severe neurological diseases tied to years of head hits on the field.A total of 20,000 retired players registered so they could submit claims now or in the future from the settlement, which offers one-time cash awards for those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinsons, Alzheimers, dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head hits that is diagnosed posthumously.Chris Seeger, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said that the administration of such class-action settlements often had growing pains because of unanticipated problems.In this case, some former players have pushed the envelope, he said, by, among other things, obtaining diagnoses from psychologists, not neurologists; having doctors affirm diagnoses without examining patients; or submitting claims without the necessary medical records.By bouncing claims back to players, the administrator is trying to address some funny things that didnt look right, and to ensure that when claims are finally evaluated, they have a better chance of being approved, Mr. Seeger said.Mr. Seeger disputes claims by lawyers who accuse the N.F.L.of foot-dragging and trying to reduce payments to players.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Is this working perfectly?No, Mr. Seeger said.But if there arent sufficient records to support a diagnosis, then we have a problem, he said.The procedures are laid out, but there is early on typically confusion.Some of it is legitimate stuff that is getting worked out.Many lawyers for the players do not agree with that explanation.The high number of claims that have been questioned, they said, is evidence that fraud prevention is being used as a way to keep down payouts.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I worked at State Farm for 10 years, so I understand all the tactics, said Patrick Tighe, a lawyer in Florida who represents 90 players.There are all sorts of ways to slow down the claims.Basically, theyre saying you need to start all over again, even if you have a pre-existing diagnosis recognized by an N.F.L.benefit plan.All 35 claims Mr. Tighe has filed have been audited or sent back because of deficiencies, he said.Jim Acho, a lawyer in Michigan who represents former players, including Gale Sayers, said that just four of the nearly three dozen claims he had filed were approved, and that two of those were audited.Jason Luckasevic, who represents dozens of former N.F.L.players, has filed more than 100 claims, and more than 85 percent of them have been flagged for deficiencies.The settlement was sold by the N.F.L.and Seeger as quick pay, Mr. Luckasevic said.This was something everyone feared.This is the N.F.L.disability plan version 2.0.The N.F.L., which insisted on much of the fraud prevention language in the settlement, denies that it has pushed the administrator to deliberately delay the payment of genuine claims, and it denies that stricter requirements were added after the deal was made final.Photo There have been no changes in the terms of the settlement agreement or the criteria for claims approval since the settlement was finalized, Brian McCarthy, a spokesman for the N.F.L., said in a statement, adding that neither the league nor Mr. Seeger had taken any steps to delay the payment of legitimate claims.The frustration among players is particularly acute for those whose neurological diseases were diagnosed years before the settlement was approved, and who are receiving benefits for those ailments from the N.F.L.under one of it regular disability plans.The delays are making it harder for them to cover escalating medical costs and, in some cases, to repay high-interest loans they took out using their settlement as collateral.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yet many players are afraid to speak publicly about their cases because they fear the N.F.L.will deny their claims or strip them of other benefits.Mr. Stewart, one of the few who would talk, said the league must be held accountable.He was found to have Parkinsons disease in 2009, when he was 43.Mr. Stewart expected to receive a gross award of $2.8 million from the concussions settlement.But after he filed a claim, he was told that another doctor had to confirm his diagnosis.The new diagnosis, though, would have applied to his current age, 51, which would have reduced his award by $1.2 million because in the settlement, older players are paid less than younger players on the presumption that their disease is related to age, not football.After Mr. Stewart submitted much additional paperwork, the administrator recognized the earlier diagnosis.But the award was reduced to $750,000 because the administrator calculated he had played only one season, not four.In the settlement, the more eligible seasons a player has, the higher the exposure and the higher the award.But the number of seasons is reduced if players spent time on the injured reserved list because they presumably were not exposed to head hits then.Mr. Stewart does not dispute being injured for parts of his career.But in his day, coaches forced him to keep practicing often with the aid of painkillers so he was exposed to head hits even if he did not play on game day.In many ways, the N.F.L.case is different from many settlements, experts said.Most settlements describe the kinds of documents to support claims, like a credit card number or a receipt.In the N.F.L.settlement, many retirees are applying for benefits for dementia, which can be complicated to diagnose because it is more subjective than, say, A.L.S.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Because awards can reach millions of dollars, the players lawyers many of whom receive a percentage any settlement have an incentive to make their clients look worse than they may be, a reason for the N.F.L.to be alert to fraud, experts said.Indeed, when the deal was first announced in 2013, the N.F.L.agreed to pay $765 million.But players feared the money would run out before every claim was filed, so the league agreed to uncap payments.In return for unlimited liability, the N.F.L.insisted on stronger rules to block fraudulent claims.But the slow pace of approved claims has raised questions about whether those rules were meant to do more than fight fraud.Kenneth Feinberg, who has administered large class-action settlements, including those related to the BP oil spill and the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, said that in the cases he had handled, defendants had a right to try to prevent fraud.But the delays that have come from questioning a large number of claims can erode trust in the settlement.Its not just how many claims have been found eligible, but how quickly the money goes out the door, said Mr. Feinberg, who is not involved in the N.F.L.case.All the words in the world are no substitute for visible evidence of generosity, and checks flowing to families in need.
The A.F.C. Doesnt Have 6 Playoff-Worthy Teams:::::The N.F.L.likes to brag about the competitiveness across the league, how in every year since 2000 at least one team with a winning percentage of .500 or lower midway through its season has gone on to make the playoffs.Seeing that the top 10 in the N.F.C.have winning records, if the streak continues this season it will likely be because of an A.F.C.team: Oakland (4-5), Baltimore (4-5) and Miami (4-4), which plays at Carolina on Monday night, remain very much alive.In the event the N.F.L.decides to keep the current playoff format (sigh), six teams will nonetheless qualify from the A.F.C.Barring a collapse, New England, Pittsburgh and Kansas City are well positioned.As for the other three?Heres a look at the leading candidates: Photo JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS (6-3): By no means was Louis Riddick comparing Jacksonvilles quarterback, Blake Bortles, to Peyton Manning.But, he said, the Jaguars formula for success this season run a lot, throw a little, lean on a ferocious defense resembles that of the Denver Broncos during their Super Bowl season two years ago.Right now theyre more than right to take the ball out of his hands as much as possible, Riddick, an ESPN analyst, said of Bortles in an interview last week.Bortless fourth quarter against the Chargers 7 of 20 passing with two dreadful interceptions corroborated the wisdom of that strategy.But in spite of those interceptions, the Jaguars still won, and they won because of a stingy defense that could propel them to their first playoff berth since the 2007 season.They forced a fumble and a three-and-out immediately after those interceptions and then set up the winning field goal with an A.J.Bouye interception in overtime.All I know, we are the best two corners in the league, cornerback Jalen Ramsey told reporters afterward.What do you all expect?Photo BALTIMORE RAVENS (4-5): If the Ravens defense (18 takeaways) and special teams played every snap, they might win the division.Alas, they do still have to line up under center.Baltimore must hope that quarterback Joe Flacco can summon his late-season wizardry of years past to resuscitate an offense that has averaged 4.4 yards per play, tied for worst in the N.F.L.Any boost could help the Ravens capitalize on a favorable schedule, which concludes with a trip to winless Cleveland and home games against Indianapolis and Cincinnati.Photo TENNESSEE TITANS (6-3): Despite scoring fewer total points than their opponents (205 to 213), the Titans are 6-3.With a few exceptions Miami (-17) and Houston (-49) last season, Indianapolis (-30) in 2012 teams with negative point differentials do not make the playoffs because teams with negative point differentials do not usually win a lot.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its tough to have faith in the Titans, said the former receiver Nate Burleson, now an analyst for NFL Network, in an interview last week.Theyll give you one thing one week, like this is a great product and theyve got weapons, and another week they just look like a shell of themselves.What bodes well for Tennessee, at least on offense, is the improved health of two crucial players: Marcus Mariota, who has seemed to regain his mobility after a hamstring injury, and the rookie receiver Corey Davis, who was targeted 10 times Sunday in his second game back after missing five with a strained hamstring.Photo BUFFALO BILLS (5-4): Buffalos promising start has been erased by two debacles Jets/Saints 81, Bills 31 and unless they fix their rampant defensive issues, they will spend an 18th straight playoffs on the outside.Across their last five games (three losses), the Bills have allowed an average of 28.4 points and 403 yards.With a run-heavy offense and a passing game that is more opportunistic than potent, Buffalo is not built to overcome weekly defensive implosions.Photo OAKLAND RAIDERS (4-5): Heres an unbelievable statistic: Of the 288 passes thrown against the Raiders, none have been intercepted.They have yielded the highest completion rate, 71.2 percent, and a 110.5 rating to quarterbacks.In a pass-oriented league, Oaklands potency on offense, highlighted by quarterback Derek Carr and receivers Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree, is negated by its ineffectiveness on defense.Among the quarterbacks Oakland must still face: Tom Brady, Alex Smith, Carson Wentz and Dak Prescott.Photo MIAMI DOLPHINS (4-4): The Dolphins, the lowest-scoring team in the N.F.L., are here more in deference to their record than for any tangible reason.But Jay Cutler just might provide one.He went from the Fox broadcast booth to the football field when the incumbent quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, hurt his knee.It has taken two months for Cutler to mesh with the team, and across his last two games he has thrown for five touchdowns against one interception with a 120.5 passer rating.
Ryan Fitzpatrick Leads Buccaneers Past the Jets:::::Fitzpatrick, who completed 17 of 34 passes for 187 yards with one touchdown and one interception, guided the Buccaneers on two lengthy scoring drives.In the first quarter, Fitzpatrick, a 13th-year pro from Harvard, led a nearly eight-minute drive that ended with the first of Patrick Murrays four field goals to give the Buccaneers a 3-0 lead.More impressive, he finished a 15-play, 81-yard drive with his fourth-quarter scoring pass to Sims that ultimately was the difference in the game.Fitzpatrick is one of only four players in N.F.L.history to throw touchdown passes for seven teams.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Gritty thats what Ryan is, Buccaneers Coach Dirk Koetter said.Hes a get-it-done kind of guy.Hes going to make some plays that you dont expect him to, and he might miss a couple plays youd like him to make.Hes a tough guy.Hes a competitor, and you cant have enough of those kinds of guys on your team.McCown, who has played for 10 franchises in 15 seasons, and was 1-10 as starter with the Buccaneers in 2014, completed 23 of 39 passes for 263 yards for the Jets, with one touchdown and one interception.Robby Anderson caught a 38-yard touchdown pass in the final minute, scoring for the fourth straight game to give the Jets one last chance.But Tampa Bays Chris Godwin recovered the ensuing onside kick to end any hope of a Jets comeback.The loss was especially disappointing for the Jets, given how well they played in beating Buffalo by 34-21 the previous week, their only victory in the last five games.On Sunday, the Jets outgained the Buccaneers, 275 yards to 271, but more than 100 yards came on their final two possessions as they were trying to cut into a 12-point deficit.Very frustrating, McCown said, adding: We understand this is the National Football League.Youve got to bring your A-game every week.We just didnt come out and play at the level were capable of.As for the Buccaneers, Winston injured his shoulder on Oct. 15 but made three more starts before the team decided to shut him down for at least two weeks.Tampa Bay also played without Mike Evans, its leading receiver.He served a one-game league suspension for his role in a sideline skirmish the previous week at New Orleans.Todd Bowles, the Jets coach, was unable to explain how his team could play so well against the Bills, then struggle against an opponent that had lost five games in a row.Advertisement Continue reading the main story You dont explain it.Its week by week, Bowles said of the Jets, who turned the ball over twice and allowed sacks by six Buccaneers.Youve got to show up every week in this league or youll get it handed to you.We didnt show up today.
With Season Already Sunk, the Giants Droop a Little Lower:::::The Giants have not fired a coach during the season since 1976, when Bill Arnsparger was let go after a 0-7 start and replaced by John McVay, who had more success as an executive who helped build the 49ers dynasty in the 1980s.That doesnt have anything to do with anything, McAdoo said of his job security.We have to find a way to win a game.We have to address what happened out here on the field today, take a look at the tape and be honest with each other.There wont be a lot of good to see on this tape.The defense was gashed by big plays through the air and on the ground, and the Giants were barely able to touch the rookie quarterback C. J. Beathard, who had been sacked 14 times in three starts.Eli Manning, in a milestone start, failed to lead the Giants to a score in the second half until a touchdown long after the game had been decided.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Even the special teams had issues, with Aldrick Rosas setting up a San Francisco field goal by sending the opening kick out of bounds and then missing a 34-yard field goal on the opening drive of the second half.We got schooled, cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie said.I did not see enough relentless play, attitude.You name it, I did not see it.Everything we should have done, I felt we did not do it.The Giants allowed Beathard to throw scoring passes of 83 yards to Marquise Goodwin and 47 yards to Garrett Celek in the second quarter, then gave up a 33-yard touchdown run by the rookie Matt Breida in the fourth quarter.Manning committed a key fumble with the Giants driving in the first half of his 208th consecutive start, tying his brother Peyton for the second-longest streak by a quarterback in N.F.L.history, trailing only Brett Favres 297.Mannings numbers looked good, as he completed 28 of 37 passes for 273 yards and two touchdowns, but the offense generated only one first down on three drives in the second half, when San Francisco (1-9) expanded its lead from 17-13 to 31-13.Were in this situation; were the reason were in it, Manning said.So we just have to keep working, compete every week and expect to win every week.
To Dodge Jerry Jones, Other Owners Speed Up Roger Goodells Contract:::::People familiar with the contract negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they involve internal league matters, said the package was 80 percent to 90 percent completed, with only a handful of minor details yet to be finished.As a nonvoting member of the compensation committee, Jones, though, continued to lobby the committee working on the pay package.Last week, The New York Times reported that he told the six owners on the committee that he had hired the lawyer David Boies and was prepared to take legal action against them and the league if they did not change Goodells deal.Jones has insisted that Goodells deal needs to be restructured to account for the poor way he has navigated the league through recent turmoil, and that more of his pay should be performance-based bonuses.After Jones threatened to sue the members of the committee which includes the owners of the Chiefs, the Falcons, the Giants, the Patriots, the Steelers and the Texans he was removed as a nonvoting member.Photo Jones was fully aware of, and in agreement with, the committees efforts to restructure the contract, according to people familiar with the committees work.On Aug. 9, Goodell traveled from his summer home in Maine to New York to meet with the compensation committee at Patroon, a restaurant a few blocks from the leagues headquarters in Midtown Manhattan.The mood was comfortable.Two of the owners, Robert K. Kraft of the New England Patriots and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons, joked about how, when they walked to the restaurant together, fans had stopped them to say they were surprised that they were together after their teams faced off in the Super Bowl in February.In a private room, the owners discussed the structure of Goodells new deal and some of the finer points the commissioner wanted added.Jones was not in New York, but was listening on a speaker phone.We got to a good place that night, one person involved in the dinner said.Jerry was on board with all of it.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Two days later, everything changed when Goodell suspended the Cowboys star running back, Ezekiel Elliott, for six games based on an accusation of domestic violence by his former girlfriend.In addition to railing against the decision and questioning the way the commissioner and his staff handled the investigation, Jones began to lobby the compensation committee and other owners to pause and alter Goodells new pay deal.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On his radio show on Friday, Jones denied that his effort to block the contract extension had anything to do with Elliott, saying it was all about Goodells performance lately.In October, when all 32 owners met in New York, Blank, the chairman of the committee, briefed them on the structure of the deal.There was little opposition.But several weeks ago, Jones held a conference call with more than a dozen owners not on the compensation committee to discuss Goodells extension.When that failed to turn the tide against the extension, Jones spoke on a conference call last week with the compensation committee and threatened to take legal action.Stunned, the committee took the extraordinary step of removing Jones from the committee, and lawyers have since handled communication between the committee and Jones.Joness threat now appears to have galvanized the committee and Goodell to conclude the last few items in the new contract.Goodell is currently paid around $30 million a year, including a set of rolling bonuses that in effect make most of his compensation guaranteed.In his new package, Goodell would receive roughly the same amount, but only if certain performance targets were met.After the owners voted unanimously in May to extend Goodells contract for five more years, the compensation committee created a new structure in which 88 percent of the commissioners compensation would be based on an array of metrics tied to the leagues financial performance.Many of those metrics would be overseen by other owners on other committees, broadening the number of people who would decide how much the commissioner would make.Goodell, who has sought to defuse the controversy over players protesting racism by kneeling during the national anthem, has devoted more time in recent days to working out the final details so this controversy, too, might subside.
Jerry Jones Doubles Down on Threats Over Goodells Compensation:::::In the letter, which repeatedly criticized the committee chairman, the Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, Jones demanded that all owners, not just the committee members, vote on the pay package.The Cowboys lawyer, Jason Cohen, wrote that Jones did not want to resort to legal action, but said it might be necessary to stop the committees work.Accordingly, Jerry Jones will continue to exercise his right to protect himself and the owners from the Committee Chairmans undertaking of a substantial financial commitment on behalf of the NFL without the owners vote, Cohen wrote.A letter written on behalf of the compensation committee, which includes Blank as well as the owners of the Chiefs, Giants, Patriots, Steelers and Texans, brushed aside Joness claims and said his call for a full vote on the details of the contract was contrary to the Leagues operation practices.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Indeed, your description of the proposed extension is so at odds with the actual facts that we can only conclude that you are either uninformed or seek deliberately to mislead the other owners, stated the letter, which was sent Thursday.Goodells contract extension, which has been in the works for about six months, has turned into an embarrassing proxy in the dispute between Jones and Goodell.Many other owners agree with Jones that Goodell has an inordinate amount of sway on league matters.Typically, issues like the commissioners contract are finalized quietly.But Joness increasingly strident opposition to Elliotts suspension, as well as Goodells handling of the protests by players who have refused to stand for the national anthem, has spilled into an open battle at a time when the league is grappling with even larger problems, including a decline in television ratings and growing concerns over the safety of the game.Goodell has tried to sidestep questions about his extension, mostly saying that he will continue to work at the behest of the owners and in the interest of the league.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Joe Lockhart, a league spokesman, told reporters on Thursday that all 32 owners voted in May to extend Goodells contract and that he expected discussions on the extension to be wrapped up soon.He denied reports that Goodell was furious about how the contract talks have become the focus of the dispute.He said was unaware of any lawsuit being filed by Jones against the league.Asked if he expected a lawsuit to be filed, Lockhart said: Thats a question that should be put to Mr. Jones.
The Cowboys Ezekiel Elliott May Have Run Out of Options:::::Photo Yet another court hearing resulted in yet another change in Ezekiel Elliotts status, and he now appears to be suspended after a ruling against his request for an emergency injunction.If this sounds familiar, it is.Similar developments have already played out several times this season with Elliott, the Dallas Cowboys star running back.Barring further action, the N.F.L.said Thursday that Elliotts six-game suspension which came as a result of domestic violence allegations was in effect.That meant he was banned from team facilities and would not be allowed to play in the Cowboys game against the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday.The latest ruling came on Thursday from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where the N.F.L.Players Association had argued on Elliotts behalf that the suspension should be delayed until the court could hear his appeal.The courts decision said an appeal hearing should be expedited, but it terminated what had been a temporary administrative stay of the suspension and denied a request for an emergency injunction.No date was given for when an appeal would be heard.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The N.F.L.originally suspended Elliott this summer after a yearlong investigation into allegations made by a former girlfriend of his.Elliott was not arrested or charged with any crimes, but the N.F.L.built its case on statements made by the woman, along with photographs of the injuries he was accused of inflicting on her.
Fantasy Football: Who to Start in N.F.L. Week 10:::::Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, lets break down Week 10 from a fantasy perspective.Quarterback Jared Goff (LAR vs. Texans) It may be time to accept that the Rams have a high-powered offense, which was on full display in Week 9 against the Giants.Goff led the charge with four touchdown passes as the Rams routed the Giants, 51-17.Goff has more to prove before he can be a locked-in fantasy starter each week, but consider him one against the Texans, who have allowed the fourth most fantasy points per game to quarterbacks (19.3) this season.Tyrod Taylor (BUF vs. Saints) Taylor has been a top 10 fantasy quarterback in each of the past three weeks, averaging 21.2 F.P.P.G.during that span.What makes Taylor a safer bet than most fantasy quarterbacks is his running ability.His 210 rushing yards are the fifth most among quarterbacks and he has added two touchdowns as a runner.With the former Panthers receiver Kelvin Benjamin set to debut with the team, joining Jordan Matthews, Zay Jones and Charles Clay in the Bills receiving corps, Taylor could have an even stronger second half of the season.Also consider: Josh McCown (NYJ at Buccaneers) Running Back Jordan Howard (CHI vs. Packers) Howard had at least 20 carries in four games this season.These days, that makes him a workhorse, as he is one of seven players to do so.He has been productive with those carries, too, topping 12 fantasy points in five of his eight games.The last time he played the Packers, he ran for only 53 yards but scored a touchdown.The Packers yield the fourth most F.P.P.G.(20.9) to the position and have allowed eight backs to top at least 10 fantasy points in eight games played.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Carlos Hyde (SF vs. Giants) With the help of having the second most targets among all backs, and the third most receptions, Hyde has been a consistent fantasy performer this season.He has five games as either a top-15 back or at least a 12-point scorer, and has been held to under 7 fantasy points once.Expect more success against an imploding Giants defense that got mauled by the Rams Todd Gurley for over 22 fantasy points.Also consider: Lamar Miller (HOU at Rams) Wide Receiver Robby Anderson (NYJ at Buccaneers) Its time to take Anderson seriously in terms of fantasy production.I know, it feels weird talking up any Jets offensive player given the last few years of production, but quarterback Josh McCown has found a nice rhythm throwing to Anderson, Jermaine Kearse and tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins.Anderson has averaged over 12 fantasy points per game over the last three weeks.On the season, he has the 14th most fantasy points among wide receivers.Up next is a matchup with the team that has given up the third most fantasy points to the wide receiver position (25.3 F.P.P.G.).JuJu Smith-Schuster (PIT at Colts) After flashing signs that he could be a productive N.F.L.receiver for most of the first half, he exploded in Week 8 with 193 yards on seven receptions and a touchdown.Coming off a bye week, theres no reason to think that Smith-Schuster is not the teams second receiving option behind Antonio Brown, no matter what the team says about getting Martavis Bryant more involved.A matchup with the Colts should lead to more fantasy success, as they have allowed the second most receiving yards (293.1 per game) and the seventh most fantasy points (23.7 F.P.P.G.)to the position.Also consider: Sammy Watkins (LAR vs. Texans) Tight End Cameron Brate (TB vs.Jets) Theres not a lot of good fantasy news coming out of Tampa Bay of late, with quarterback Jameis Winston expected to miss three games and receiver Mike Evans suspended for Week 10.But even with Ryan Fitzpatrick behind center, Brate should be considered a decent fantasy asset at the thin tight end position, especially in a favorable matchup with the Jets (9.5 F.P.P.G., fifth most).Defense/Special Teams LAR vs. Texans; DET vs. Browns Kicker Kai Forbath (MIN at Redskins); Ryan Succop (TEN vs. Bengals).
N.F.L. Picks: Redskins Over Vikings; Patriots Over Broncos:::::Heres the tricky thing about picking this game: 12 points is an enormous spread, even at home, and Jared Goff, while vastly improved from last season, is still inconsistent.There is not much concern that the Rams could lose, but a few garbage-time touchdowns are likely to swing the spread in favor of Houston.Pick: Texans Cowboys at Falcons, 4:25 p.m., Fox Line: Falcons by 3 Atlantas season can be summed up in one play from last week: Matt Ryan throwing a perfect 40-yard pass to a wide-open Julio Jones in the end zone, and Jones simply dropping the ball.It was such a painful and shocking turn of events the play came on fourth down with the Falcons (4-4) trailing by 10 points that Kurt Coleman, a defensive back for the Panthers, walked over to console Jones.Such is life for Atlanta a year after a magical run to the Super Bowl ended with a brutal collapse.There is some intrigue in this game still, as neither team knows if Ezekiel Elliott will be allowed to play, but with the recent improvement the Cowboys (5-3) have shown on both sides of the ball, Dallas should be in line for a road win regardless of what happens in Thursdays court hearing.Pick: Cowboys Patriots at Broncos, 8:30 p.m., NBC Line: Patriots by 7.5 Before anyone gets too excited about the Patriots (6-2) drastically cutting down the number of passing yards the team allowed in its last two games, it is worth noting that they gave up an average of 138.5 rushing yards a game in the two wins.New Englands defense might just not have that higher gear, but it is not as if the Broncos (3-5) and Brock Osweiler present much of a challenge.Add in C. J. Anderson working his way through an ankle injury and Denver does not seem to have the personnel to keep up with New England, no matter how bad the Patriots defense is.Pick: Patriots Vikings at Redskins, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Vikings by 1 The error margin for Case Keenum has been reduced to zero.If Keenum, a career backup, wants to remain at starting quarterback for the Vikings (6-2), he will need to keep winning.Teddy Bridgewater has been cleared to play, and unless his knee injury has turned him into an entirely different quarterback, he represents an enormous upgrade for Minnesota.With that in mind, the Redskins (4-4) could be a problem for Keenum because they are far more talented than their 4-4 record indicates.Their four losses have come against the Eagles (twice), the Chiefs (when that team looked unbeatable) and the Cowboys.Last weeks win over Seattle showed that they are resilient and that Kirk Cousins continues to be fearless.Taking too many chances against Minnesotas secondary could be dangerous, but a Redskins win, and Bridgewaters return to the field a week later, seem well within the realm of possibilities.Pick: Redskins Second-Tier Games Photo Saints at Bills, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Saints by 2.5 The Saints (6-2) are a passing team that loves playing indoors, so a trip to Buffalo on a chilly Sunday afternoon should present an interesting test.A huge factor in how they fare, though, will come in which version of the Bills (5-3) shows up.Two weeks ago, Buffalo looked great and easily beat the Raiders, but last week, they were hardly competitive against the Jets, allowing 194 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns.It is that rushing success by the Jets that the Saints may want to pay attention to: In Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara, they have the running backs to exploit the same weakness.Another win would be seven in a row for New Orleans.More important, it would improve the teams road record to 4-1.Pick: Saints Steelers at Colts, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Steelers by 10.5 The Steelers (6-2) have settled into a groove.Their defense shuts things down, keeping the score nice and low, and their offense, despite the presence of three of the N.F.L.s biggest stars, does just enough to win.Whether it is the aging of Ben Roethlisberger, tension among players or their opponents adjusting to a unit that has been together for several seasons, they just dont run up the score the way they used to.Going on the road against the Colts (3-6) does not present a true upset opportunity: The Steelers are extremely likely to win, but a spread of 10.5 points seems high considering Pittsburghs track record.Pick: Colts Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Seahawks at Cardinals, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday), NBC Line: Seahawks by 6 The Seahawks (5-3) are one game removed from a four-game winning streak, but the defense has taken a huge step back in the last few weeks: Both the Texans and the Redskins showed no fear in throwing directly into Seattles secondary.Injuries are a factor, with Earl Thomas out and Richard Sherman playing through injuries, but it is still shocking to see teams have so much success throwing the ball against them.Drew Stanton of the Cardinals (4-4) is not an aggressive passer like Deshaun Watson or Kirk Cousins, so the same level of exploitation should not be expected.Arizona will probably try to make up for that by running early and often with the veteran back Adrian Peterson, and while he has performed well since coming over from New Orleans, he may not find as much room to run this week.Thursday games are messy, but Seattle has had success in Arizona, and if it wants to avoid falling way behind the Rams in the N.F.C.West, this game needs to be something of a statement.Pick: Seahawks Chargers at Jaguars, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Jaguars by 4 The Jaguars (5-3) had a nearly perfect defense with one glaring flaw: It could not stop the run.A trade for Marcell Dareus, a run-stopping defensive tackle who was a known quantity to Coach Doug Marrone, may not deserve all the credit for last weeks effort (29 rushing yards allowed), but if he has whipped the unit into shape, Jacksonville will be hard to score upon.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Chargers (3-5) are an interesting test for that theory, as Melvin Gordon, their star running back, is the type of player who would have torched the Jaguars in previous weeks.If Dareus stops him, then Jacksonvilles run of losing in even-numbered weeks of the season may finally end.On offense, the Jaguars should get a nice boost from Leonard Fournette, who showed up to practice on time during the week, which will get him back on the field after he was held out for a violation of team rules.Pick: Jaguars Browns at Lions, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Lions by 12.5 The Lions (4-4) may not look like a playoff contender, with a .500 record and several frustrating losses, but they have been considerably better than their record, and last weeks win at Green Bay opened the door for them to go on a winning streak ahead of their Week 12 showdown with division-leading Minnesota.The Browns (0-8) are a speed bump on that path.Detroit will probably not cover the 12.5-point spread, but if it cares about its playoff hopes it will win the game.Pick: Browns Bottom-Tier Games Photo Jets at Buccaneers, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Jets by 2.5 With Jameis Winston having been shut down for at least two weeks, the Buccaneers (2-6) will turn to Ryan Fitzpatrick at quarterback.It is a downgrade from Winston at full strength, but probably an upgrade from the way Winston had played since injuring his shoulder.Add the revenge factor of Fitzpatricks playing against the Jets (4-5), who discarded him a season after he set the franchise single-season record for passing touchdowns, and this could turn into a mild upset.Pick: Buccaneers Packers at Bears, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Bears by 5 The statistics for Mitchell Trubisky are not that much better than those for Brett Hundley, but the difference between them is that Trubisky, the rookie quarterback for the Bears (3-5), is trying to overcome his subpar wide receivers, while Hundley, a third-year backup for the Packers (4-4), has teammates on offense that made Green Bay a Super Bowl contender until Hundley replaced the injured Aaron Rodgers.Hundleys lack of production has partially been a result of an ultraconservative game plan, but an opportunistic Bears defense may make him pay if he tries to be aggressive in his third career start.Pick: Bears Bengals at Titans, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Titans by 4.5 The Bengals (3-5) got a huge boost for this matchup when the N.F.L.chose not to suspend A. J.Green over his fight during a loss to Jacksonville last week.His presence gives Cincinnati enough offense to compete, and while the Titans (5-3) have won back-to-back games, they have put little distance between themselves and their lowly opponents (Baltimore and Cleveland).This will probably be another close game.Pick: Bengals Giants at 49ers, 4:25 p.m., Fox Line: Giants by 1 With how poorly the 49ers (0-9) have played in almost every facet of the game, having a reason for optimism is a welcome change.Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, acquired in a recent trade with New England, represents that optimism, but San Francisco has yet to make any commitment about when, or if, he will play.If the young and talent-deprived team insists on sticking with C. J. Beathard for another week, the Giants (1-7) are destined for their second win.Pick: Giants Mondays Matchup Dolphins at Panthers, 8:30 p.m., ESPN Line: Panthers by 9 For a second consecutive week, a prime-time audience will be forced to endure the atrocious offense of the Dolphins (4-4).It was supposed to be a breakout season for Miami, with quarterback Ryan Tannehill leading several star-level wide receivers and a young Pro Bowler at running back in Jay Ajayi.Instead, Tannehill is out for the season, Ajayi was traded to Philadelphia and the Dolphins wide receivers are left shuffling along for a team that often struggles to score in double digits.The Panthers (6-3) are inconsistent and frustrating, but their defense may look to prove a point by making this game a laugher.Pick: Panthers.
Jerry Jones Threatens to Sue N.F.L. to Block Roger Goodells Contract:::::The dispute between Jones and Goodell stems from Joness anger over the commissioners suspending of Ezekiel Elliott, the Cowboys star running back, who was accused of domestic violence by his former girlfriend.Goodell gave Elliott a six-game suspension, though no charges were filed in the case.The suspension, announced in August, has since undergone a dizzying array of rulings and court appeals that has, for now, kept Elliott on the field.Jones has called the suspension an overcorrection, a gibe at Goodell, who has been criticized for his handling of player discipline.Jones appears intent on holding up Goodells contract extension and potentially pushing him out.He is in the minority among owners.While some are unhappy with how the commissioner has handled issues related to player conduct and the national anthem controversy, only a few owners are prepared to replace Goodell, who has been commissioner for more than a decade and has worked at the league since the early 1980s.The battle within the league is unusual for an organization that prides itself on order and unanimity and oversees the most popular sport in the country.But the N.F.L.is in the middle of one of its most tumultuous seasons because of players kneeling during the national anthem to protest social injustice, a wave of injuries to star players, and a television ratings dip that has fed debate over whether football is declining.Jones said in a conference call last Thursday with the six owners those of the Chiefs, Falcons, Giants, Patriots, Steelers and Texans that legal papers were drawn up and would be served this Friday if the committee did not scrap or delay its current plans to extend Goodells contract.As of Wednesday, the owners and the league had not been sued.Jones, who has owned the Cowboys since 1989, has been a nonvoting member of the committee that is considering Goodells contract, which expires at the end of the 2018 season.He has fought to have a say.After Joness conference call last week, the six owners revoked his status as an ad hoc member of the compensation committee, which decides on pay packages for the top league officials.Photo Over the past several days, the six owners have been speaking to the other 25 owners who are not on the committee to notify them of what Jones had said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story At a meeting in May, all 32 owners including Jones voted to extend Goodells contract and authorized the compensation committee to work out the details.But after Elliott was suspended, Jones began lobbying the committee to undermine the deal.Jones, known for brassy talk and bold moves, may be making his most audacious maneuver yet in taking on fellow owners, with whom he normally holds considerable sway in matters like the relocation of teams and how the league spends its money.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Joness threat is reminiscent of steps taken by Raiders owner Al Davis, who successfully sued to the league in the 1980s to win the right to move his team from Oakland to Los Angeles.Jones has also sued the league, in the 1990s, over sponsorships.But his latest move is potentially more volatile because he has not only threatened to sue the league, but also is trying to prevent the commissioner from getting a new contract.Boies is a prominent lawyer who has argued before the Supreme Court and represented corporations and executives in high-profile cases.He drew widespread criticism this week after The New Yorker reported on the legal work Boies did for Weinstein, the movie mogul facing allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault.The article reported that Boies helped Weinsteins effort to use private investigators to help block a negative article about him in The New York Times while Boiess firm was providing outside legal counsel for The Times.Boies denied there was any conflict of interest with his work for the newspaper.In a statement, he said he believed the investigators had been hired solely to determine the facts related to the accusations against Weinstein, which Boies believed would be to The Timess benefit.The Times said it was ending its relationship with his firm.We never contemplated that the law firm would contract with an intelligence firm to conduct a secret spying operation aimed at our reporting and our reporters, The Times said in a statement.Such an operation is reprehensible.Advertisement

several owners, some of whom now feel blindsided that he agreed to help Jones potentially sue the league.Jones has publicly questioned Elliotts suspension as well as the commissioners role in handing down player penalties.Zeke is a victim of an overcorrection, Jones said in a radio interview in October, a day after Elliott lost his bid for a preliminary injunction that would have stayed the six-game ban for violating the leagues personal conduct policy.Even this judge said it shows that very reasonable people could possibly come down on both sides of this, Jones added.Well, under our legal system it has to be stronger than that for someone to have done it.Jones has also been the most vocal owner to urge players to stand for the national anthem.Jones and other owners are upset that Goodell has not done more to stop players from kneeling or sitting during the anthem.The issue exploded into a national debate when President Trump took aim at the owners for not forcing the players to stand.
College Football Playoff Rankings: Top Four Remain Intact:::::Georgia, Alabama, Notre Dame and Clemson held their spots in the top four of the College Football Playoff rankings, and unbeaten Miami moved up three spots to No.7 before its showdown with the Fighting Irish.Oklahoma remained fifth and Texas Christian moved up to sixth in the rankings released Tuesday.The Sooners and Horned Frogs play a key Big 12 game on Saturday, with the winner taking sole possession of first place in the conference.After Miami, unbeaten Wisconsin was No.8, the highest-ranked Big Ten team.Washington, the highest-ranked Pac-12 team, is ninth and Auburn is 10th.Notre Dame visits the Hurricanes on Saturday night, and Georgia is at Auburn.No.14 Penn State and No.15 Ohio State fell out of the top 10 after losses last week.University of Central Florida was 18th, the highest-ranked team from outside the Power Five conferences.The highest-ranked conference champion from the Group of Five leagues is guaranteed a spot in one of the New Years Six Bowls, and the American Athletic Conference is in prime position to grab that bid this year.U.C.F.is unbeaten and leading the Americans East Division, and Memphis, ranked 22nd, is in first in the A.A.C.West.No other Group of Five conferences are represented in the selection committees rankings this week.
After Beating Packers, Lions Set Their Sights on the Vikings:::::With every short pass from Brett Hundley, every drive that ended in a field goal or a punt and every lingering shot of Aaron Rodgers standing on the sideline, it seemed like the Green Bay Packers were falling farther from anything resembling contention.The N.F.C.North is far from having been decided, but after Green Bays 30-17 loss at home to the Detroit Lions on Monday night, the Lions certainly seem to have the better chance of challenging the Minnesota Vikings for division supremacy.And if the Packers continue to tumble and slip out of playoff contention, they might not even feel the need to bring Rodgers back once he is eligible to return in Week 15 from the injured reserve, where he landed after breaking his collarbone on Oct. 15.For now, the North is Minnesotas division to lose.At 6-2 and riding a four-game winning streak, the Vikings are two games ahead of both Detroit and Green Bay.The Upshots Playoff Simulator gives the Vikings a 65 percent chance of winning the division.But last season showed that a hot start by the Vikings does not guarantee much, as their 5-0 start to the season was undercut by a 3-8 finish, leaving the Packers and Lions to fight for the division crown on the final day of the regular season (the Packers won out).When breaking down the three contenders, the biggest argument for the Lions is their quarterback stability.Matthew Stafford, who has not missed a game since 2010, is a true franchise quarterback (with a salary commensurate of such a distinction) who has a knack for late-game heroics.On Monday he did not need another of his signature comebacks, as he completed 26 of 33 passes for 361 yards and two touchdowns in his teams blowout win.The win was just Detroits second victory in Green Bay since the start of the 1992 season (a span of 27 games).Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Packers are in dire straits with Hundley, who was rarely asked to throw the ball more than five yards on Monday night, but they at least have the benefit of having a long-term plan at quarterback (hint: Its Rodgers).The same cannot be said of the Vikings, who have a complicated quarterback controversy on their hands.Photo Case Keenum has performed well in Sam Bradfords absence, but he will soon be challenged for the starting role not just by Bradford, who is working his way back from a knee injury, but also by Teddy Bridgewater, the Vikings former starter who has missed the last 24 regular season games after a devastating knee injury in the 2016 preseason.
Aaron Judge and Cody Bellinger Win Rookie of the Year Awards:::::In a year of unprecedented power for Major League Baseball, it was only fitting that the rookies of the year would be record-setting sluggers.The Yankees Aaron Judge, who bashed 52 homers, and the Los Angeles Dodgers Cody Bellinger, who hit 39, were named unanimous winners of their leagues awards on Monday.Major leaguers combined for 6,105 home runs in 2017, the most for any season in history, and Judge and Bellinger helped lead the way.Judge set a home run record for American League rookies, and Bellinger did the same in the National League.Each player received all 30 first-place votes for his league from members of the Baseball Writers Association of America, which has given the awards since 1947.Twenty-three players have won unanimously, including five Hall of Famers Jackie Robinson, Orlando Cepeda, Willie McCovey, Carlton Fisk and Mike Piazza and more recent stars like Derek Jeter, Albert Pujols and Mike Trout.Judge, a 25-year-old right fielder, started the season batting eighth and ended it as the A.L.leader in homers, runs scored (128), walks (127) and strikeouts (208), with a combined on-base and slugging percentage of 1.049, trailing only Trout in the A.L.He hit .284, drove in 114 runs and became the first Yankee to be rookie of the year since Jeter in 1996.Photo Jeter led the Yankees to a championship that season, and Judge came close this year, helping the Yankees reach Game 7 of the A.L.Championship Series, which they lost to Houston.Along the way, he won the All-Star Home Run Derby and inspired a wood-paneled cheering section at Yankee Stadium the Judges Chambers, with fans wearing robes and waving foam gavels.A Supreme Court justice, Sonia Sotomayor, even saw a game there in August.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Since the end of the season, Judges profile has continued to rise.Last week, Sony revealed him as the new cover star of its popular video game, MLB The Show.On Monday, Pepsi announced an endorsement deal with him.
Carlos Beltran Retires as World Series Champion:::::Cashman is moving at a deliberate pace to fill the opening that was created nearly three weeks ago, when Joe Girardi was dismissed.Rob Thomson, the Yankees bench coach, and Eric Wedge, the former Cleveland Indians and Seattle Mariners manager, have been interviewed.San Francisco Giants hitting coach Hensley Meulens and broadcaster Aaron Boone each of whom played for the Yankees are expected to be interviewed this week.While Beltran has expressed an interest in managing, he has also taken an active role in recovery efforts in his native Puerto Rico and is planning a visit there soon.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Beltran played for seven teams and finished with 2,725 hits, a .279 batting average and an .837 on-base-plus-slugging percentage.He retires as undoubtedly one of the best switch-hitters in baseball, and while he did not reach the milestones of 3,000 hits or 500 home runs (he leaves with 435), some believe he has a solid case for membership in the Baseball Hall of Fame.In his prime, Beltran was a stunning combination of contact, power, speed and fielding.Only five players have recorded 400 home runs and 300 stolen bases in a career: Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez, Willie Mays, Andre Dawson and Beltran.Beltran also hit .307 in 65 career playoff games.In addition to his play on the field, though, Beltran was widely regarded as one of the best teammates in baseball.He was given the Roberto Clemente Award, baseballs highest philanthropic honor, in 2013 in recognition of his efforts to promote baseball and education in Puerto Rico.He was a fierce advocate for players, particularly Latinos, and campaigned for the introduction of the interpreters who are now required in clubhouses.Beltran was a nine-time All-Star, including at age 39 in 2016 with the Yankees, and won three Gold Gloves for his play in center field.The American League rookie of the year with the Kansas City Royals in 1999, he was traded to the Astros in 2004 and hit eight home runs in 12 playoff games, nearly carrying them to the World Series.Beltran played six and a half seasons for the Mets, and then had stints with the Giants, the Rangers, the Cardinals and the Yankees before returning to Houston this season on a one-year deal.While his skills were diminished Beltran hit .231, mostly as a designated hitter and part-time outfielder he played a more important role as an unofficial mentor to everyone.Many Astros officials and players credited Beltrans leadership and tutelage as critical to Houstons World Series title.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I am blessed to be a champion, Beltran wrote in his essay.But now, my time as a player has come to an end.
Shohei Otani, a Two-Way Player, Says He Is Ready to Leave Japan for M.L.B.:::::Because Otani has less than nine years of service time, Nippon Ham retains his rights, and he must go through the posting system to leave.If M.L.B., the MLB Players Association and Nippon Professional Baseball agree to a deal that would extend the expired posting agreement through this off-season, the team that signs Otani would pay the Fighters $20 million.Under M.L.B.s labor contract, his signing bonus would be restricted, with the remaining pool money limited to $3,535,000.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Under baseballs new collective bargaining agreement, the 23-year-old Otani can agree only to a minor league contract that is subject to signing bonus pools.If added to a big league roster, he would have a salary of about the minimum $545,000 next season and would not be eligible for salary arbitration until 2020 at the earliest.If Otani waited until he turned 25 to enter M.L.B., there would be no restrictions and he could expect a better deal.But Otani said he wanted to go now rather than wait.I am not a complete player yet, and I want to go to an environment where I can continue to get better, he said.I felt the same way when I graduated from high school.And it is my strongest reason for wanting to go now.Otani considered going straight to M.L.B.out of high school but was persuaded to sign with the Fighters, who assured him that he could play the outfield as well as pitch.He said in the news conference that he hoped to continue batting and pitching.Just before I turned professional, I didnt imagine I would be able to do both, Otani said.But since then, the fans have encouraged it.He added that Manager Hideki Kuriyama and his coaches had helped make the dual role possible.That has left me with a strong desire to keep doing it, he said, not only for me, but for them.I dont know if it will be possible, he continued, but I want to hear what teams over there say and what kind of situations might be available.Until that process has started, I cant say how it might work out.
Yankees Interviews for Their New Manager Begin With a Familiar Face:::::Because Ive been here so long, I dont think you get a free pass to interview for this job, he said.I think you have to have certain skills and certain things about you that pertain to the job.Thomson, who has not been a manager since running the Yankees rookie-ball club in Oneonta, N.Y., in 1995, said he believed his knowledge of the organization was an asset.But he also had to distance himself from Girardi, whom Cashman let go in large part because he saw communication shortcomings.I really dont want to compare myself to Joe, Thomson said.I love Joe.But I do know this: My strengths are my communications and my trust with the players, and because of that trust, we can implement more things into our game, whether it be analytics or sports science.Whatever we want to do, I think can get through to the players.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.As the bench coach the last three seasons, Thomson had a variety of duties, including working with the outfielders and distributing scouting reports to players.Another of his duties was using the dugout telephone to serve as the go-between for Girardi and Brett Weber, who monitors replays for the Yankees.Thomson accepted some of the responsibility for a replay snafu in Game 2 of the Yankees American League division series against the Cleveland Indians, when Girardi neglected to challenge a call that the Indians Lonnie Chisenhall had been hit on the hand by a pitch.Thomson said he had turned to use the phone immediately and had not seen the reaction of Chisenhall or catcher Gary Sanchez.One thing that I learned is just to take your time to the phone and always keep your eyes on the field, because Sanchy had a reaction to the play, the hitter had a reaction to the play, Thomson said.He added: Maybe if I had kept my head on the field, and kind of watched the reaction, I maybe would have been able to help Joe out in that way.A lot of things to learn just on that one play for me.INSIDE PITCH The Yankees announced Thursday that they were moving up start times by 30 minutes for Monday-to-Thursday home games in April.Seven games will begin at 6:35 p.m.
Ray Robinson, Who Wrote of Gehrig the Man, Dies at 96:::::He could be trusted not to exaggerate a story or a fact; it was what it was, and you could trust Rays memory, Marty Appel, the author of Pinstripe Empire: The New York Yankees From Before the Babe to After the Boss (2012) and other baseball books, said in an interview on Tuesday.One of Mr. Robinsons favorite players, and subjects, was Gehrig, the Hall of Fame Yankee first baseman who long held the record for consecutive games played, with 2,130, and who died at 37 from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a degenerative ailment now widely known as Lou Gehrigs disease.In many articles and in the book Iron Horse: Lou Gehrig in His Time (1990), Mr. Robinson portrayed the famously humble and hard-working Gehrig as a human being instead of the mythical hero many see him as, without hiding his own reverence.Photo Suited up, Gehrig looked bovine, unathletic, Mr. Robinson wrote.His appearance earned him the uncomely nickname of Biscuit Pants.But shouldnt one win points for modesty, decency and determination?I thought so, and of all the Yankees, it was Lou I cherished the most.One undeniably superhuman moment of Gehrigs career was his farewell speech at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939.Mr. Robinson, who was there and called the speech baseballs Gettysburg Address, told The Daily News in 2014 that the sound system made it hard to make out all of Gehrigs words, but that an almost religious solemnity descended over the stadium as Gehrig spoke.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I have no way of knowing if 60,000 people were crying, he said, but I had tears in my eyes.Raymond Kenneth Robinson was born in Manhattan on Dec. 4, 1920, to Louis Robinson, a lawyer, and the former Lillian Hoffman, a homemaker.While growing up he watched the dominant Yankee teams of the 1920s and 30s, whose stars included Gehrig, Babe Ruth and, later, Joe DiMaggio, as well as the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers.Mr. Robinson first encountered Gehrig after writing him to ask for an interview for his school newspaper.The interview did not work out, but Gehrig gave him free tickets to a game.After graduating from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, Mr. Robinson went to Columbia University, which Gehrig also attended.He graduated in 1941, the day after Gehrig died, and studied at Columbias law school before serving in the Army during World War II.Photo He began writing for local newspapers while stationed at military bases in the Southern United States.After he was discharged, he worked as an editor at various magazines.He edited more than a dozen editions of Baseball Stars, annual collections of short biographical essays by burgeoning writers including Jimmy Breslin, Dick Schaap and George Vecsey.In recent years he was a regular at a monthly lunch with New York City sportswriters like Lawrence Ritter, Robert Creamer and Mr. Appel and broadcasters like Bob Costas.In 1949 he married Phyllis Cumins, with whom he lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.She died in March.In addition to his daughter he is survived by two sons, Steve and Tad, and four grandchildren.Mr. Robinsons other books include American Original: A Life of Will Rogers (1996) and Famous Last Words (2003), a collection of memorable deathbed statements.He also wrote articles for The New York Times about baseball players like Willie Mays, Jackie Robinson and Cal Ripken Jr., the Baltimore Orioles shortstop who finally broke Gehrigs consecutive game record, ending his own streak at 2,632.Mr. Robinson said that he sent Ripken a copy of his Gehrig biography, but that Ripken refused to read it until after he broke the record in 1995.When he did, he returned the book with a singular inscription.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its safe to finally read, he scrawled in the front of my book, Mr. Robinson wrote in 2007.I cherish the autograph and understand his superstition.
Mourning Roy Halladay, a Master Who Craved the Big Moments:::::He left behind a wife and two sons.He coached youth teams and seemed to be enjoying a blissful retirement in the air or on the water as he wrote on his Twitter page, where he posted this right under his handle: Courage is not being fearless but rather acting in spite of the existence of fear!That playoff debut, the one he had wondered so much about, will stand as Halladays signature performance.He threw a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds, the first in the postseason since Don Larsens perfect game in the 1956 World Series.And that was as good as it got.In Halladays final playoff game, the next fall, he lost by 1-0 to the St. Louis Cardinals and Chris Carpenter, an old teammate who had taught Halladay his curveball while playing catch in the minors.Somebody had to win that day, and it was his friend, not him.Halladay had given his best, and lost.It happens, and he was rational enough to understand that.I was in the Phillies clubhouse after that loss, when Halladay expressed a version of the comment above.It has struck me ever since as the essence of the competitor: All you really want is a chance to test yourself, to see how it all turns out with everything at stake.Halladay had gotten his opportunities.He was proud of how he had handled them.We spoke this spring as part of my research for a book I am writing on pitching.I had chased Halladay for two years, through his agency and his former teams, with no luck.On my visit to Clearwater, Greg Casterioto, the Phillies director of baseball communications, told me Halladay was there, working with prospects on the minor league side.He met me at the picnic tables while the major leaguers played on the main field.Halladay was a little bigger than I remembered, as many players are when their training stops.He had been a fitness fanatic when he played, and said the work the way it flowed into the competition was what he missed most since retiring in 2013, at age 36.Durability was Halladays hallmark.He pitched 63 complete games from 2002 through 2011, 30 more than any other pitcher in that decade.His back gave out, but he said his arm always felt strong.The workload never caught up to him because he measured it precisely.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If I threw 120 pitches in a game, I would throw a 20-pitch bullpen, Halladay explained.If I threw 100 pitches in a game, I would throw a 40-pitch bullpen.If I only threw 80, Id throw a 60-pitch bullpen.So I was always getting the same amount of pitches in a five-day period.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We talked a bit about the modern state of pitching.Halladay had eight seasons of at least 220 innings, a total no pitcher reached in 2017.He said todays pitchers, with their turbo fastballs, tried too hard to strike hitters out.I felt like with two strikes 0-2, 1-2 if they didnt swing at it, it was going to be strike three, he said.I wanted something that they had either had to swing at and put in play, or was going to be a strike on 0-2.Now its two extra pitches, and were getting back to 2-2 and the count goes on.So I think its just changed a lot in the way people think about pitching.They want to stay just off the plate to where theyre avoiding contact.Halladay induced weak contact and so many awkward swings using the Greg Maddux model of moving the ball in or away on either side of the plate.Hitters knew that Halladay could carve an X in the air, down by their hands or out by their handle, with his sinkers and cutters.He could also lock them up with a curve in the zone, or a split-change a pitch he learned from Rich Dubee, a Phillies coach in the dirt.I wanted them to swing at every pitch, he said.And with an arsenal like that, why not?Halladays success was hard-earned.After parts of three seasons in the majors, the Blue Jays sent him to Class A to rebuild his psyche and master a lower arm slot.He appreciated how fleeting success could be, and approached his work with a serious demeanor that evoked Steve Carlton, an earlier Phillies ace.Carlton was my baseball hero when I was young.My son now roots for the Phillies his grandparents have tickets and Halladay was his favorite.When I took him to the Hall of Fame two years ago, he took a picture with the cap Halladay wore for his perfect game in 2010.After our tour, he asked for a framed Halladay photo collage from a store on Main Street.On Tuesday, my son took inventory of the shrine to Halladay in his bedroom: two framed wall-hangings, two bobbleheads, a pennant and a baseball card.He didnt cry at the news of the crash; he is 15, too busy for that.He asked if he could go to the Y to practice jump shots.Basketball tryouts are coming up.I told him Id have to pick him up in the middle of writing this column, and he said not to bother; he wanted me to write a good story.I insisted he go, because Halladay would have wanted that.He laughed its a trite thing to say, and I barely knew the man.But I meant it.I learned a lot from Halladay in our interview this spring how he mastered each of his pitches, how he held them, how he used them to very likely earn a plaque in the Hall.But mostly I learned again that what truly drove him was not the achievement, but earning the opportunity to have it.If he could do that perfectly, he could live with the rest.Halladay did not live long enough.But his legacy, to me, is powerful and instructive in any field: The purity of the effort matters most.
For Clues in Yankees Manager Search, Look to the Dodgers:::::Still, the next Yankees manager seems unlikely to resemble Francona and Maddon, with their extensive track records; a likelier model would be one of the 2017 World Series managers: Roberts and the Houston Astros A. J. Hinch.Hinch, 43, who has a psychology degree from Stanford, used humor and humility to build bonds with his players, quickly overcoming skepticism based on a failed, brief first attempt at managing the Arizona Diamondbacks, a job he landed at age 34.As well as Hinch has done in three years with the Astros, the Dodgers hiring of Roberts might be the most instructive in looking at the Yankees, who like their long-ago crosstown rivals are trying to build a perpetual contender around a strong farm system, an adherence to analytics and one of baseballs biggest payrolls.Cashman said the Yankees, like the Dodgers, would be methodical in their search they have not yet completed a list of candidates, even as five other openings have been filled.The Dodgers dismissed Don Mattingly as manager after they lost to the Mets in a 2015 division series, but it took a month and interviews with nine candidates to fill the job.Photo The Dodgers interviewed internal candidates, former managers, novices, popular organizational figures (Kirk Gibson) and even a college coach (Darin Erstad) before selecting Roberts, then the San Diego Padres bench coach.He won the job over Bud Black, now the Colorado Rockies manager, and Gabe Kapler, who was recently named the Philadelphia Phillies manager.Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers president of baseball operations, said he was looking foremost for an excellent communicator.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Relentless optimism was something that was important going through the grind of a 162-game season, especially in a larger market, Friedman said last week.It can be a little bit of a grind, so having someone with infectious energy was something that we were looking for from the leader of our 25-man roster.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Like so much about baseball in recent years, the idea of a players manager has evolved, too, thanks to data.With statistical analysis and sports science playing a more prominent role in how lineups are constructed and the bench is deployed each day, the modern manager must be able to communicate these new strategies particularly with younger players who may wonder why they are not playing.Relationships are the foundation for those dialogues.Just so they can think along with you, Friedman said.And therefore, they are less caught off guard by certain moves you might make, which therefore reduces some tension that might come with in-game decisions or starting lineup decisions that in large part dont manifest themselves the same way when theres that open, honest communication throughout.Communication is not strictly top down.Decisions that were once the domain of a manager are now collaborative, involving the front office, pro scouts, player development and sports science staff members, among others.Thats why for a lot of us, getting asked questions like, Who makes out the lineup?or Who decides on the roster?are strange questions, said Farhan Zaidi, the Dodgers general manager and Friedmans lieutenant.We view it as such a collaboration that its not about pointing the finger at one person who goes into an office and locks the door and makes the decision by himself.The process is a lot more organic than that, and I think thats the way the game is headed.When Roberts interviewed, he did not know Friedman or Zaidi though he had worked for another Dodgers executive, Josh Byrnes, in San Diego and he had not been a manager before.Friedman said those were formidable hurdles, but when they finished the initial interview, Zaidi remarked that it was as if Roberts had the answer key.In the few areas in which Roberts was not in lock step with Friedman and Zaidi, they took the ensuing back-and-forth as a healthy sign.Obviously the relationship is way stronger today than it was a year ago, and Ill bet its stronger a year from now than it is right now, Friedman said.Thats the nature of human relationships.As long as theres trust in place, which I think we all have, we feel like, as we look ahead, the continuity that we envision is something that we feel will be a competitive advantage for us in the coming years.And something that the Yankees would like to replicate.
Roy Halladay Dies in Plane Crash in Gulf of Mexico:::::The news of Halladays death was quickly followed by expressions of grief on social media.We are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladays untimely death, the Phillies said in a statement posted to Twitter.There are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game.A two-time Cy Young Award winner and an eight-time All-Star, Halladay was a 6-foot-6 right-hander known for his durability and command.After 12 major league seasons with the Blue Jays, who drafted him in 1995, he was traded to the Phillies in December 2009.Halladay made 2010 a definitive year in his career.He threw the 20th perfect game in major league history during the regular season, and in a division playoff series against Cincinnati, he threw the second no-hitter in postseason history.After the postseason no-hitter, Dusty Baker, the Reds manager at the time and a fixture in the sport going back to the late 1960s, said, That is the best-pitched game Ive seen since Ive been going to the playoffs and the World Series.One of the strongest messages of condolence on social media came from Pedro Martinez, the three-time Cy Young Award winner whose prime coincided with Halladays.Halladays career was cut short by back trouble, however.He became a much weaker pitcher in the 2012 and 2013 seasons, and he retired at 36, signing a one-day contract with Toronto to leave the game as a Blue Jay.Based on his retirement date, Halladay will not be considered for election to baseballs Hall of Fame until 2019, but he will have a strong case because of his dominance in his strongest seasons.His career record of 203-105 and his 2,117 career strikeouts are not eye-popping numbers, but using the JAWS system, an evaluation tool that accounts for a players peak seasons as well as his overall career, Halladay is ranked as baseballs 42nd-best starting pitcher.Only nine players ahead of him are not yet in the Hall of Fame, while more than 30 pitchers below him on the list are already enshrined in Cooperstown.His postseason success and his popularity with the news media also bolster his case.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Shortly after he retired, Halladay discussed how odd it felt not to play baseball.I find myself kind of sitting around the house thinking, Theres something missing here I should be working out, I should be running, I should be doing something, Halladay said.For a second, its kind of a little bit of panic, and then it kind of sets in: O.K., thats right.Im retiring now.Its actually a very peaceful feeling.He eventually turned to flying as an outlet, and in October he posted pictures of the plane he had recently purchased.Halladay, whose father was a pilot, knew the risks that flying presented.He joked about his wifes opposition to his purchasing the plane in a video that had been posted to YouTube by ICON but that was removed shortly after the crash.Shes fought me the whole way, Halladay said of his wife, Brandy.Hard, Brandy Halladay said in the video.I fought hard, I was very against it.She conceded after flying in the plane, though, that she understood the appeal.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Piloting small planes has long been popular among athletes, and Major League Baseball has lost other athletes to similar crashes.Thurman Munson, an All-Star catcher and the 10th captain of the Yankees, died after crashing a Cessna Citation in 1979.And Cory Lidle, a former teammate of Halladays on the 2003 Blue Jays, died in 2006 when a Cirrus SR20 he was flying with a co-pilot crashed into an apartment building on Manhattans Upper East Side.The fact that the Pasco County Sheriffs Office led Tuesdays recovery effort carried extra emotion because of Halladays personal relationship with the department, which included the donation of a police dog that the department named Doc, in reference to Halladays nickname.You wouldnt know what Roy did because Roy wouldnt tell you what he did, Nocco said.And thats the legacy of a great man.Halladay is survived by his wife and two sons, Ryan and Braden.

Jonny Evans heaps praise on Michael O'Neill as speculation surrounds the Northern Ireland manager's future:::::Northern Ireland's players would understand if manager Michael O'Neill left for an irresistible opportunity elsewhere, according to Jonny Evans.O'Neill's squad bade farewell to each other in Switzerland on Monday, going their separate ways and returning to club duty after missing out on next summer's World Cup following a devastating play-off defeat.There is a sense it could have been more of a permanent adieu from O'Neill, who intriguingly spoke of their performance in Basel being the high point of his near six-year tenure, and of the need to console his players rather than discuss his future.The 48-year-old is unlikely to be short of options if it is the end of the road with Northern Ireland as he is among the favourites for the vacancies with Scotland, the United States, Rangers and Sunderland.While it would be a wrench to lose the man who so nearly guided Northern Ireland to successive major tournaments after three decades in the international wilderness, defender Evans insists the team would accept O'Neill moving if an appealing offer was forthcoming."As a manager, he's unbelievable, we all love him and every single player plays for him," West Brom's Evans said."He's such a good manager and it would be a shame to lose him.But we know on the other side, management is such a difficult job and if something came up, where it would be difficult to turn down, no-one would ever begrudge him that."Asked if he could appreciate why countries and clubs alike would be interested in hiring O'Neill, Evans added: "Yes, definitely.He's so inspirational, he's very tactical."Even the other night, we had just got off the plane and were on the bus on the way to the hotel.He had watched the first half (of the first leg) and he came down the bus and he was like, 'We're calling a meeting and we're going to watch it because you didn't play that bad, there are so many basic things you can improve on'."It gave everyone a lift straight away.He's got such composure and his team-talks, he says the right things to get the lads going."You can see everyone plays for him and we all really, really respect him."Sunday's stalemate at St. Jakob-Park could be the last Northern Ireland game for some of O'Neill's players too.Indeed Evans could be the only one of the back four that started the game still around for the next qualification campaign with Aaron Hughes, 38, Gareth McAuley, 38 next month, and Chris Brunt, 33 in December, all likely to consider international retirement.McAuley has said his decision may hinge on what O'Neill himself does, yet his Baggies team-mate Evans is confident his central-defensive partner will play on."G's not mentioned anything about retirement or anything like that," Evans revealed."I still think he's got a lot more to give and it would be a shame if he did retire.You can see the love he's got for playing for this team and this country."I don't think it would be an easy decision to make and I'm 95 per cent certain he will stay."
Gianlugi Buffon retires: Iconic players and their last competitive international fixtures:::::Gianluigi Buffon saw his international career end in a whimper after failing to reach the World Cup with Italy.The Azzurri legend earned his 175th cap at the San Siro, but watched on as his teammates drew blank in front of goal, resulting in Italy missing out on the tournament for the first time since 1958.Juventus goalkeeper will retire at the end of the season and was expected to have his swan song in Russia.The 39-year-old made his debut for the national team back in October 1997 but has finally called time on his illustrious international career.Click the right arrow, above, to see how other iconic players ended their competitive international careers
Simon Jordan says Marco Silva should not leave Watford for the first big job as Everton come calling:::::Simon Jordan claims leaving Watford would not do Hornets boss Marco Silva any favours.The Portuguese manager was reportedly approached to become the new Everton manager, which has subsequently been rejected by Watford.The Merseyside club are on the lookout for a new manager after sacking Ronald Koeman in October.The former Hull manager has enjoyed a good start at his new club, with Watford lying 9th in the Premier League table while Everton are 15th.Watford's last game was a 3-2 defeat at Goodison Park which saw caretaker manager David Unsworth earn his first win at the helm.Speaking on talkSPORT's Kick Off, the former Crystal Palace chairman said: I think hes gone into Watford and he is doing a decent job there.Its tempting for him.If hes got any proper advisors around him and thinking of his own, he will know that managerial careers are built around upon a degree of integrity and reliability.Dropping out of the Watford job at such an early tenure when the first big job comes along will not do him any favours in the long run."
Watford reject approach from Everton for Marco Silva:::::Watford have rejected an approach from Everton for their Portuguese manager Marco Silva.The 40-year-old arrived at Vicarage Road in the summer and has only been in charge of 11 Premier League games since leaving Hull City.Everton had identified Silva as their preferred candidate to replace the sacked Ronald Koeman, but the Hornets are determined to keep their man.David Unsworth is currently in caretaker charge and has only won one of his four games a victory which came against Silvas Hornets outfit.Former England manager Sam Allardyce and Burnley boss Sean Dyche have also been linked with a move to Goodison Park.However, Silva has moved to the top of Evertons wish-list as they look to find a successor for Koeman during the international break.
Italy 0-0 Sweden: Azzurri miss out on World Cup for first time since 1958:::::Italy have failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1958 after being shut out by Sweden at a sold-out San Siro.Trailing 1-0 on aggregate to a Jakob Johansson goal scored in Friday's first leg in Stockholm, Giampiero Ventura's Azzurri were cheered on by almost 72,000 Italian fans in Milan.But despite laying siege to the Scandinavian defence over 90 feverish minutes, Italy could not make the breakthrough and the goalless draw was enough for Sweden to reach Russia 2018.Head coach Ventura, who in August agreed a new contract running until 2020, has borne the brunt of the criticism across a World Cup campaign which saw four-time world champions Italy limp to a second-place finish behind Spain, and with that the ignominy of a two-legged play-off.It was always going to be hard for Italy to get their own way in the Swedish capital, but with a wealth of striking options, one of the stingiest defences in Europe and arguably the best goalkeeper in the world in Gianluigi Buffon, much more was expected from this return clash.Buffon may be hardest hit by Italy's failure to reach the summer finals.At 39, the Juventus stopper had already decided to quit international football after the tournament and his 175th cap, won on a dismal night in Milan, may be his last.The increasingly execrated Ventura yielded to the incessant calls to use Napoli pass-master Jorginho in midfielder by handing the Brazil-born player a first competitive Italy cap.Manolo Gabbiadini got the nod - perhaps surprisingly ahead of Lorenzo Insigne - to lead the line alongside Lazio striker Ciro Immobile.The Southampton player was first to test the Swedes' resolve, finding his shot blocked before Manchester United's Matteo Darmian, deployed on the left wing, blasted wide of goal.Jorginho soon released Immobile down the right and Robin Olsen had to make a smart stop amid steadily building Italian pressure.Retaining control, the Azzurri grew in confidence after the half hour and Antonio Candreva came close to scoring when rifling Immobile's low cross towards the top of the net, where Olsen blocked.Andreas Granqvist was Sweden's saviour as half-time drew nearer.First he scooped Immobile's goalbound effort off the line before tidying up when Marco Parolo looked like turning home a Darmian pass.He and his fellow centre-back Victor Lindelof were lucky, though, when Alessandro Florenzi missed the mark when cutting inside from the left byline.After the break Darmian had a penalty shout rejected after controlling Florenzi's cross - Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz instead called handball.Florenzi's next attempt struck the far post and following another turn of the screw Immobile was left with his head in his hands after side-footing Candreva's wicked cross wide from close range.Olsen got underneath a looping ball - a deflected Florenzi strike - that threatened to drop in at his far post and from then on Italy's high-intensity approach abated somewhat.It was not until the 77th minute that the Azzurri threatened again, Florenzi blasting high from a pinpoint winger's cross by defensive stalwart Giorgio Chiellini.Olsen faced a few desperate moments as time ticked away in west Milan.The FC Copenhagen keeper parried a bullet header from Parolo and with three minutes remaining, punched substitute Stephan El Shaarawy's powerful drive to safety.It was enough for Sweden, who will play at the finals for the first time since 2006 - the same year in which Italy were last crowned champions of the world.

Stuart Pearce hoping to make instant impact on the training pitch at West Ham:::::Stuart Pearce is hopeful his coaching ability will prove to be a valuable asset alongside Alan Irvine and Billy McKinlay at West Ham.The trio of former managers were recruited by new Hammers boss David Moyes as part of a backroom staff overhaul at the London Stadium following Slaven Bilics sacking.Pearce returns to the club where he made 50 appearances and will be expected to help reverse the fortunes of a side, who currently sit in the Premier League relegation zone.And Pearce is optimistic his experience on the training ground will bring the best out of a squad lacking in confidence.David wants to have an impact quite early on which is quite understandable hes used to working with Alan Irvine and Billy [McKinlay ] before, Pearce told Kick Off.Im the only one he hasnt worked with.Its really just a case of all us finding our level and then using the strengths within our squad from there.Weve got a manager that likes coaching and three coaches as well [so] it gives us the ability to get round all the players and work individually and in units more often maybe than when youve got a lighter squad.The Hammers have conceded 23 league goals this season and have suffered heavy defeats against Manchester United, Newcastle, Brighton and Liverpool.And having watched his former club struggle while performing his punditry role at talkSPORT, Pearce believes watching from the side-lines will provide him with a good base to work from.I dont call it a prejudice, I call it an insight, Pearce added.I was fortunate enough to work with talkSPORT for two of their three last games - the one at Wembley against Tottenham and the Liverpool game.That gave me an insight on their strengths and weaknesses.Going into the football club from the offset, the first thing that grabs your attention is weve conceded more goals than anyone in the Premier League.
Northern Ireland midfielder Oliver Norwood urges boss Michael O'Neill to continue as manager:::::Oliver Norwood hopes Northern Ireland's valiant display in Switzerland will persuade manager Michael O'Neill to remain at the helm.O'Neill will consider his future after his team came up just short in their World Cup play-off with the Swiss, after a dubious penalty decision in the first leg ended their hopes of reaching back-to-back major tournaments for the first time in the country's history.It felt like the end of an era in Basel on Sunday, where at least four veteran players - Aaron Hughes, Gareth McAuley, Chris Brunt and Jamie Ward - may have pulled on the green jersey for the final time.They were among the first O'Neill consoled at full-time, though his own time with Northern Ireland may have reached its conclusion three years before his contract runs out.The 48-year-old is unlikely to be short of suitors.The Edinburgh-based boss fits the bill for Scotland, while vacancies with Sunderland and the United States, where O'Neill spent part of his playing career, may also be alluring.However, 26-year-old Norwood is banking on O'Neill being convinced that there is still more to come after Northern Ireland's performance at St Jakob-Park."We spoke about making Northern Ireland proud and I think we did that," said the midfielder, on loan at Fulham from Brighton."We are devastated as a squad, but I hope we stick together.We will stick together as it's a great bunch of lads and it is a pleasure to play for Northern Ireland."Hopefully, all the players will remain available for one more campaign."Obviously, we all want Michael to stay.We hope that our performance on Sunday night (showed we) would want him to remain in charge."The message is loud and clear from the players and fans that we would like Michael to stay as we can achieve great things with this squad."We have some good young players coming through and we have players with a lot of experience as well."O'Neill will not be rushed into determining what happens next, though no amount of time will likely remove the feeling of injustice at the manner in which Northern Ireland's World Cup dream died.Referee Ovidiu Hategan will forever be remembered by the Green and White Army as the man who somehow thought Corry Evans was guilty of deliberate handball at Windsor Park.And so while O'Neill expressed pride at a battling performance in Basel three days later, it was what happened in Belfast that rankles."As a coach or a manager, you can't really ask any more than what we got," he said."It was a privilege to be their coach and manager on Sunday night.After five and a half years, while this is a devastating moment, from what we saw in terms of character and what you want from your team, it's also a high point and something we should be proud of."We've gone toe to toe with a very, very good side, a team that made the last 16 of the Euros and the last 16 of the last World Cup."It was decided by a really poor decision and a penalty that should never have been."

MLB Rookie of the Year awards: Aaron Judge, Cody Bellinger win:::::No surprise here: The American League and National League Rookie of the Year Awards went to sluggers Aaron Judge and Cody Bellinger.Both players were unanimous choices, landing on the top of all 30 ballots.Only three previous times have both leagues Rookie of the Year been awarded unanimously: Benito Santiago and Mark McGwire in 1987, Mike Piazza and Tim Salmon in 1993 and Scott Rolen and Nomar Garciaparra in 1997.Judge, 25, is also a finalist for the AL MVP (which will be announced Thursday) after leading the AL in home runs with 52.He also had the most runs scored (128) and walks drawn (127) in the AL, while striking out a major-league high 208 times.The 52 homers broke Mark McGwires 1987 mark (49) for dingers by a rookie.Unlike Judge, Bellinger didnt start the season in the majors.But once he was called up on April 25, Bellinger proved to be one of the best hitters in the NL.He hit .267 with 39 homers, 97 RBIs and .933 OPS.In a fun coincidence, Judge and Bellinger squared off in the Home Run Derby in July, with Judge eliminating Bellinger in the semi-finals en route to becoming the first rookie to ever win the competition.Red Sox outfielder Andrew Benintendi and Orioles outfielder Trey Mancini were the other finalists in the AL.Bellinger beat out Pirates first baseman Josh Bell and Cardinals shortstop Paul DeJong.
Chargers QB Philip Rivers in Concussion Protocol:::::Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers has been placed in the NFLs concussion protocol, head coach Anthony Lynn announced Monday.Rivers did not leave Sundays game against the Jaguars but concussion symptoms may not present themselves immediately.Rivers completed 21 of 37 passes for 235 yards in an overtime loss to the Jaguars and threw an interception in the extra period that allowed Jacksonville to set up the game-winning field goal.Riverss backup is veteran Kellen Clemens, who has thrown 10 passes in the last four seasons.Cardale Jones is also on the roster.Rivers said before the season that he had never been diagnosed with a concussion and considered himself fortunate in that regard.I know every doctor will tell you theres a big difference between being diagnosed and having one, Rivers told the San Diego Union-Tribune.So, I dont know.Could I have?Well, maybe.But Ive never had symptoms to where Im like, Gosh, this is crazy.Thats a real blessing.
Cody Bellinger's Best Moments From His Rookie of the Year-Winning Season:::::In what will pass as shocking news if you didn't watch any baseball this season, Cody Bellinger is your National League Rookie of the Year.Such can be expected when you hit 39 home runs and post a .267/.352/.581 line as a 22-year-old and also help your team win its division and its first pennant since 1989 as part of a terrific World Series run.Fun fact: It took Cody just 43 games to pass his dad Clay in career home runs.In your face, dad!Given that Bellinger is just 22 years old and that the Dodgers are a factory of success, expect to see a whole lot more of him and his whip-like swing over the next decade or so.But before we look ahead to 2018 and all the rest of those seasons, let's look back on Bellinger's 2017 campaign, when he came out of the minors as a fully-formed dinger god and clubbed some real good homers (and also hit for the cycle, because why not).Bellinger's first career home run (and his second, from the same game): Bellinger takes Andrew Miller (!)deep: Bellinger homers twice in the first two innings against the Mets: Bellinger goes deep for the 10th time in 10 games (please note Kik Hernandez's reaction): Bellinger clobbers a 446-foot homer in the Home Run Derby: Bellinger hits for the cycle against the Marlins: Bellinger breaks the Dodgers' franchise record for single-season homers by a rookie: Bellinger does it all in NLDS Game 3 against the Diamondbacks: Bellinger's game-winning double in Game 4 of the World Series: Kudos on the big year, Cody.It should be fun to see what next year holds.
Aaron Judge and Cody Bellinger combined for historic rookie seasons:::::To the surprise of no one, Aaron Judge and Cody Bellinger have officially been named the American League and National League Rookies of the Year, respectively.This is by far the easiest choice that the Baseball Writers Association of America's voters get to make all week with regards to awards: The MVP races are incredibly tight, and the Cy Young picks are plenty tough, too, but Judge and Bellinger are the most obvious picks of the year.That should be expected, given that both shattered records en route to 52 and 39 home runs, respectively, while starring for playoff teams.There was no realistic case to be made for any of the other finalists in either league.In the AL, Andrew Benintendi (2.6 Wins Above Replacement) and Trey Mancini (2.2) combine for just over half of Judge's 8.1 WAR.Paul DeJong and Josh Bell don't trail by quite so much in the NL, but it would take a truly deluded voting body to overlook what Bellinger did, even if his 4.2 WAR feels pedestrian compared to Judge's season.Since there's no debate to be had as to whether or not the voters got this one right, let's focus instead on where these two players rank all-time in terms of rookie years.Each league has handed out a Rookie of the Year trophy since 1949, and some of the game's greatest stars have won the award en route to Hall of Fame-caliber careers, but not every season has produced a truly historic year.Just ask 2009's winning pair, Andrew Bailey for the AL and Chris Coghlan for the NL, to pick one recent example.But while there are still many years left to figure out just what Judge and Bellinger will be, what they accomplished in 2017 is historically great.Want proof?Check out this list of the top 10 combined Rookie of the Year-winning seasons by WAR (excluding 1976 and '79, which saw two players split top honors in the NL in the former year and in the AL in the latter).year al winner nl winner total war 2012 Mike Trout (10.8) Bryce Harper (5.1) 15.9 1964 Tony Oliva (6.8) Dick Allen (8.8) 15.6 2001 Ichiro Suzuki (7.7) Albert Pujols (6.6) 14.3 1975 Fred Lynn (7.4) John Montefusco (6.8) 14.2 1972 Carlton Fisk (7.3) Jon Matlack (6.0) 13.3 2017 Aaron Judge (8.1) Cody Bellinger (4.2) 12.3 1993 Tim Salmon (5.2) Mike Piazza (7.0) 12.2 1968 Stan Bahnsen (6.4) Johnny Bench (5.0) 11.4 1997 Nomar Garciaparra (6.6) Scott Rolen (4.5) 11.1 2016 Michael Fulmer (4.9) Corey Seager (6.1) 11.0 In what I'm sure is shocking news, Mike Trout once again tops a "Greatest [X] seasons of all time" table, this time teaming up with Bryce Harper to lead all Rookie of the Year winners in total WAR.But right there at No.6 is the duo of Judge and Bellinger, whose combined 12.3 is the most since last year's pair of Corey Seager and Michael Fulmer racked up 11 WAR between them.And for Judge, his 8.1 WAR represents the fourth-highest individual total for a rookie hitter ever, behind Trout, Shoeless Joe Jackson (9.2 in 1911) and Allen.Not everyone on that list went on to greater thingswhere have you gone, Jon Matlack?but even if Judge and Bellinger fall short of brilliant careers, they still gave us 2017 seasons that we'll never forget.Congratulations to themand to us, for being lucky enough to witness them.
Aaron Judge's Best Moments From His Rookie of the Year-Winning Season:::::Aaron Judge, the beefy man-tree who plays rightfield for the Yankees, is your American League Rookie of the Year for 2017.If this is a surprise to you, it's probably because you went into a coma in late March and didn't come out of it until just now.Judge wasn't just the best freshman in this year's AL crop; he was arguably the league's best player overall (a debate that will be settled on Thursday when the BBWAA announces its AL MVP from a group of Judge, Jose Altuve and Jose Ramirez).It was a season beyond belief for Judge, who cranked 52 home runs to go with an absurd .284/.422/.627 line, including an AL-high 127 walks (and an MLB-high 208 strikeouts), and was an integral part of a Yankees team that was supposed to be amid a rebuilding phase but instead won 91 games and came within a game of winning the pennant against the eventual World Series champion Astros.It's nice when things finally go New York's way.There will likely be far more to come from Judge as his career continues, but let's take this moment to look back on the best moments from the giant metallic demi-god who came down from Mount Olympus and launched baseballs all over these United States (and Toronto).And by "best moments," I mean all the jaw-dropping bombs he blasted.This post is best read while listening to something loud and bombasticmaybe "Immigrant Song," or "The 1812 Overture."Enjoy!Judge goes very deep in Seattle: Judge crushes a third-deck homer against the Mets: Judge goes 495 feet against the Orioles: Judge's four 500-foot Home Run Derby homers: Judge reaches the flagpoles in Yankee Stadium's leftfield with a 448-foot homer against the White Sox: Judge makes a tumbling catch at Fenway (on his birthday, no less): Judge breaks Mark McGwire's single-season rookie home run record with his 50th of the year: Judge rips a line-drive homer in the AL wild-card game against the Twins: Judge robs Francisco Lindor of a homer in ALDS Game 3 and owns Zack Hample in the process: Judge makes a wall-crashing catch in the ALCS: So there you have it: the year in Judge.Tune back next year for more of the same, most likely.
Morgan Goodwin: Wife of 49ers' Marquise Goodwin talks stillborn:::::On Sunday, San Francisco 49ers player Marquise Goodwin helped lead his team to victory against the New York Giants by catching an 83-yard touchdown pass.Hours earlier, he and his wife Morgan sat emotionally in a hospital and kissed their newborn son goodbye.We cried.It was a hard thing to take in, Morgan Goodwin, 24, tells PEOPLE of those moments with Marquise.This hurts because I was 19 weeks, I was almost halfway there.The baby, who the couple had decided to name Marquise Jr., was delivered stillborn at 3:52 a.m.Both Marquise, 26, and Morgan announced the death on their respective social media accounts, including photos of the babys hand.Morgan says she had some complications in the week leading up to the delivery.She says she was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance hours before the birth, and Marquise was by her side each step of the way.I felt joy in holding my baby even though it was a sad moment, Morgan says.I was so amazed.His eyes were still shut at this point, but the hands, the feet.He looked exactly like his daddy.Morgan and Marquise, college sweethearts, wed in February 2016 and had dreamed of starting a family.Morgan says the couple planned to have the baby and even used fertility treatments after she suffered a miscarriage in 2013.I was looking forward to having someone to call our own our own creation, she tells PEOPLE.I feel I was placed in this world to be a mother, and I want to be a mother.I want to be a mother to four kids, five.I want a lot of children so this hurts.The pair spent as long as they could with their son before letting him go, and Morgan says Marquise was too heartbroken to play the headline-making game.I said, Baby, just go out there and do your thing.Ill be okay, Morgan recalls.And so he went.After producing the teams biggest play of the year, Marquise emotionally sank to his knees in the end zone.It was very, very emotional watching him out there, Morgan tells PEOPLE.Seeing him score the touchdown and watching him get emotional after the game.I was crying.It was an amazing moment, but it was also a very sad moment.Immediately after the game, Morgan says, Marquise rushed to the hospital to be with his wife.Now, the Goodwins have been coping as best they can in the wake of the death.But Morgan says they havent given up on their dream of having children.We will try again, she says.This story originally appeared on people.com.

8-year-old girl dies after slamming race car into concrete barrier:::::This story originally appeared on Time.com An 8-year-old race car driver died after she slammed into a cement barrier during a drag race competition in Australia over the weekend, her family and officials said.Anita Board was taking her car for a test run on the track at the Perth Motorplex in Kwinana Beach, Western Australia, shortly after noon on Saturday when she failed to stop at the end of the drive and hit a barrier, police said in a statement.She was taken to the hospital with life-threatening injuries and later died, according to the Australian National Drag Racing Association, which sanctions motorsports in the country.During a news conference Monday, the girls family remembered Anita for her bright, bubbly personality and infectious smile, according to The West Australian newspaper.Her passion for motor sport, drag racing and being here as a family with her sister at the track was the highlight of her life, said Anitas father, Ian Board.We were blessed to have had her for eight years and shes going to be forever missed.The Australian National Drag Racing Association allows children between the ages of 8 and 16 to compete in junior drag racing.Anita was driving Saturday to qualify for her junior drag racing license, which more than 100 children in Australia already have, The West Australian reported.After the deadly crash, the Australian government temporarily suspended junior drag racing at the Perth Motorplex, the only venue in Western Australia where drag racing is held.The suspension of this category of motorsport activity allows for a full investigation to be carried out into the nature of the accident, Sport and Recreation Minister Mick Murray said in a statement.The State Government will wait until the details of the accident are clear following the investigation before taking any further action.Anitas father said he doesnt think any major change is needed, adding that tragedies in the sport are rare.Sadly this one in a million event happened to us, to our little girl, he said.
Italy misses World Cup: Reasons for Azzurri's failure:::::Italy did not go to the World Cup in 1930.They did not qualify for the World Cup in 1958.And they will not be at the World Cup in 2018.The four-time champion is out, beaten 1-0 over two legs by Sweden and left to wonder what on earth has gone wrong.For the 39-year-old Gianluigi Buffon, playing what was almost certainly his final international, it was a terrible way to bow out.Perhaps there was an element of misfortune.Italy was unfortunate to be drawn in a group with Spain when they might have got Romania or Wales.They were unfortunate having finished second to Spain to then draw probably the most impressive of the non-seeded second-place sides.And they will point to individual moments of misfortune in the game: the elbow on Leonardo Bonucci in the first leg that might have earned Ola Toivonen a first-minute red card; the deflected Jakob Johansson shot that brought the only goal; the string of saves made by the Sweden keeper Robin Olsen; the two penalties they might have won in the second leg.But the truth is that Sweden probably also should have had two penalties and that, for most of the second half, Italy lost their shape and discipline and as a result failed to take advantage of the way they dominated possession.In the fraught final minutes there were too many long balls, too much that was hit hopefully into vaguely dangerous areas, too little class, too little precision.And the truth also is that this set-back is a surprise but not a shock.There will be those who blame the federation for not gaming the system as Romania, Wales and Poland have done to secure a better ranking.There will be those who blame the manager Gian Piero Ventura and ask why somebody of such modest achievements should have been appointed in the first place.They will have a point.But the biggest issue by far is the players.There was a general consensus that the Italy squad that went to Euro 2016 was the weakest that had ever gone to a tournament; only the alchemic intensity of Antonio Conte dragged them to a quarter-final.But its no coincidence that Ventura picked seven starting players aged 30 or more for the first leg in Stockholm; four of them 33 or older.There were only six who started the second leg but the point remains.This is an ageing side and the main reason for that is a dearth of emerging talent.Perhaps Ventura could have been bolder in his choices.Jorginho, who has been excellent of late for Napoli, only made his competitive debut in Milan on Tuesday, and was probably Italys most creative player, certainly before half-time.His non-selection for so long has been baffling as Italy have struggled.Ventura is equally sure to be criticized as well for not introducing Lorenzo Insigne from the bench against Sweden.Yet really to talk about the game against Sweden is to miss the bigger picture.It wasnt just that Italy finished behind Spain, it was that they were hammered by them in Madrid.In Paris last summer, Contes Italy had pummeled Spain in the last 16 of the Euros and won 2-0.Two and half months later the sides met in Turin and drew 1-1.Then in September this year they met in Madrid and Spain humiliated Italy, winning 3-0 when it could have been far more.Conte had shown how effective a back three can be against Spain; Xavi had spoken of the problems Spain always had against that shape.Yet Ventura played a 4-2-4 and Spain dominated utterly through midfield.It was not just that game, though.They struggled to a 1-1 draw against FYR Macedonia.They scraped a 1-0 win over Israel at home.Throw it back further and there have been draws in friendlies in the past five years against Haiti and Luxembourg.Italy may have a point about the iniquities of the FIFA rankings but if no side can expect much sympathy with that sort of result.Assuming they qualify in 2022, Italy will head to Qatar having won only one match at a World Cup finals since they lifted the trophy in 2006.This is a failure that has been brewing or years.Ventura must take his share of the blame of course, and he has seemed a broken man since that defeat in Madrid, unable to rouse his players, panicking in his selections to such an extent that he fielded 25 players over the final three group games as he desperately sought a successful formula.But there is also something wrong in the Italian system.Gifted young players are not emerging in sufficient quantity, are not being developed.Germany, France and England have all undergone awkward reassessments of their youth structures; Italy must undergo a similar reboot.No side of Italys stature should be reliant on a team of creaking thirty-somethings.Conte papered over the cracks, but under Ventura that covering fell away, exposing the crevices beneath.
Italy Miss Out on World Cup Place After Lifeless Draw With Sweden in Playoff Second Leg:::::Italy have failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup after the Azzurri could only draw with Sweden at San Siro on Monday night.The last time the four-time winners failed to make the tournament finals was 1958 - when the tournament was held in...Sweden.Italy fails to qualify for the World Cup, the only former World Cup champion to miss the 2018 World Cup.Italy had qualified for 18 of the previous 20 World Cups, last missing the field in 1958.ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) November 13, 2017 Italian manager Gian Piero Ventura was forced into finally playing Jorginho from the start thanks to Marco Veratti's suspension, and the Napoli man was one of the only bright spots on the night for an Italy side which has consistently struggled for creativity in a tough qualifying campaign.Ventura is likely to be relieved of his duties in the coming days - if not the coming hours - after a series of bizarre selection decisions which saw Lorenzo Insigne, the top provider of key passes in Europe's top five leagues this season, left on the bench not just at the start of the game but for the full 90 minutes.Sweden's progression to the summer's tournament in Russia, which is likely to spark a series of insufferable rumours about Zlatan Ibrahimovic reversing his international retirement, leaves just three places up for grabs.Honduras and Australia will play off in Sydney on Wednesday after a 0-0 draw in the first leg of their tie, while two-legged clashes between Ireland and Denmark and Peru and New Zealand lie identically poised after their respective first legs.
LeBron rides subway, guy unaware its the Cavs (video):::::There are eight million people in New York and apparently at least one who cant identify Americas most famous athlete.New Yorks hellish traffic forced the Cavs to take the subway back to their hotel after Monday mornings shootaround at Madison Square Garden.The players all seemed to be having fun, but some of their fellow straphangers werent so thrilledparticularly the guy who ended up sitting directly next to LeBron James.The folks at FTW actually tracked this guy down and it turns out he had no idea who any of the people on the train with him were.His name is James Michael Angelo, a real estate agent and comedian, who admittedly doesnt watch much basketball.As a result, he figured the Cavs were just a college team and didnt appreciate their small forward shoving a camera in his face.I noticed a bunch of tall guys getting in the train, but I was listening to U2 and I didnt want to be filmed, Angelo told FTW.He only found out later from friends that the big guy bugging him on his way to work was an international superstar and that hed gone viral.He also posted a video on Twitter later in which he revealed he didnt even know what sport LeBron plays.He had a warning Hey, James Michael.Maybe let Kristaps Porzingis do your fighting for you.(Look him up and youll realize thats a good idea.)

Italy Misses World Cup for First Time Since 1958:::::Italy will miss the World Cup for the first time since 1958 after a 00 draw to Sweden in front of a home crowd at San Siro.Italy had qualified for 14 consecutive World Cups since 1962.Sweden won the first leg of the playoff 10 on Friday.The Azzurri found themselves in the two-legged playoff after finishing second in the UEFA qualifying group.Italy had the bad luck of being drawn into the same group as Spain.Insider Notes: Maldini Concerned as Italy Faces Crucial Qualifier Against Sweden Italy had played in every edition of the World Cup since 1962 and has won four titles (1934, 1938, 1982 and 2006).Italy failed to make it out of the Group Stage in 2014.Sweden hosted the World Cup in 1958, which Italy missed.| #Buffon: ""We have pride, strength and we're stubborn.We know how to get back up again as we've always done.I'm leaving an Italy side that will know how to speak for itself.Hugs to everyone, especially those I've shared this wonderful journey with."Italy (@azzurri) November 13, 2017 Italy is also the first previous World Cup champion to miss the tournament since 2006, according to ESPN's Paul Carr.
Vontaze Burfict: Bengals teammate reportedly says refs provoke LB:::::An unnamed Bengals teammate came to Vontaze Burfict's defense Monday, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.Schefter reports that an anonymous teammate has noticed officials cursing at Burfict and coming into contact with him multiple times over the last few weeks.He adds that Burfict feels he is being singled out by refs, and has complained to coach Marvin Lewis about it, according to Schefter.An NFL spokesman denied the claims and said it is common for officials to make contact with players and there is nothing unusual with the way Burfict has been treated, according to Schefter.Sunday, Burfict was ejected from Cincinnati's 24-20 loss to the Titans after making contact with an official.It was the first time in his six-year career that he was ejected from a game.Burfict was suspended three games to start this season for an illegal hit in the preseason.He also missed the first three games of last season for a hit on Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown from the previous playoffs.For his career, Burfict has been fined more than $300,000 for on-field incidents, not counting money lost from suspensions.Redrafting the First Round of the 2017 NFL Draft Schefter reports the NFL does not plan to suspend Burfict for this incident.The 3-6 Bengals are looking to end a two-game losing streak against the Broncos Sunday.
USA vs Portugal: How will the USMNT line up under Dave Sarachan?:::::Asked by a local reporter to discuss Tuesdays friendly between host Portugal and the USA, American midfielder Alejandro Bedoya was fewer than 30 seconds into his answer when he referenced the games charitable purpose.Wildfires across some 240,000 acres killed more than 100 people in Portugal in June and October, and last month the countrys football federation announced that the proceeds from the match at the Estdio Dr. Magalhes Pessoa in Leiria (near the site of some of the deadliest fires in June) will be funneled toward the victims.Hopefully we can help to raise awareness and some money for those families and everything.Its for a good cause, Bedoya said in Lisbon.Its obviously a cause worthy of the game and, as the U.S. national team stands on the threshold of two years of oblivion, charity remains the best reason to play it.There is no World Cup for which to prepare.There is no tactical foundation to establish.And with U.S. Soccers presidential election coming in February and, presumably, a new national team coaching staff and organizational set-up to follow, a clean slate probably is just around the corner.The performances Tuesday will matter only to the extent the next coach decides they should.That extent likely will be small.Nobodys international future will be determined, for better or worse.In that context, U.S. interim coach Dave Sarachan did the right thing.He cobbled together a one-time-only team featuring out-of-season MLS players who will benefit from an extra few days of decent training, a handful of veterans who will help the visitors avoid embarrassment Tuesday and some of the youth upon whom the USA will rely during the rebuild.This group of players wont come together again.Whats important, beyond charity, is to do right by Portugal and the spirit of the sport while giving the younger Americans an enticing taste of what it means to represent their country at the highest level.Were professionals.We have a job to do, Sarachan told reporters.What makes this week so special for me, personally, is the fact that weve assembled a group of players that I feel have a bright futureyoung players that have shown up with no bitterness in their mouth, no chip on their shoulder, with a lot of enthusiasm.Young men like Weston McKennie, Tyler Adams and Cameron Carter-Vickers wont need motivation.Theyll be thrilled for the chance to get a taste of national team life and earn their first senior cap against the European champions.More seasoned U.S. internationals like DeAndre Yedlin and Kelly Acostathose who are likely to play a role during the 2022 cyclecan begin to establish themselves as leaders.While veterans like Bedoya can think about leaving a legacy.Its a bit of a different role for me now to kind of step up and be a leader, Yedlin told reporters in Portugal.When I was young and with this team, I kind of dwelled on the mistakes I made because I thought, Oh, I make a little mistake sand im going to be out of the team, and things like that.Its normal.I know theyre prob going to be nervousgoing to have butterfliesbut they just have to realize that theyre here for a reason.Theyve been called upon for a reason.They belong here.Bedoya is the oldest, most experienced international in camp.The 30-year-old has 65 caps and appeared in both the 2014 World Cup and in seven of the 16 qualifiers for 2018.Even if hes not in frame for 2022, theres still something Bedoya believes he can accomplish.This is an opportunity for a lot of people, even the older guys like myself, to show we can continue in the program and give something back, for the young guys and the new players to come in, get a feel of what its like to play for the national team, to represent your country and see what the set-up is all about, Bedoya said.I thought thered probably be wholesale changes throughout the whole team [after losing to Trinidad & Tobago], Bedoya added.But at the same time, you go through a transitional phase and you expect some guys, like myself, whove been around for a while to be here and get that experience going.Sarachans lineup in Leiria likely will symbolize that transition.Theres arguably never been a tougher USA XI to predict, and the ways in which the manager can balance competitive experience with competitive exposure are almost endless.It doesnt do the program much long-term good to simply trot out the most seasoned players and try to wrangle a result.Conversely, throwing the teenagers to the wolves wont serve anyones interest.Portugal also likely will field a mixed side.Recognizable names like Cristiano Ronaldo, Joo Moutinho, Andr Gomes and Renato Sanches are missing from the roster.Younger stars like Andr Silva (AC Milan) and Bernardo Silva (Manchester City) will get the chance to shine, and there are 12 players called up by coach Fernando Santos who have five caps or fewer.Sarachans final decision is anyones guess, but here are a couple stabsone which prioritizes experience and another that focuses on experimentation.This 11 has a good shot to be competitive on the day while showcasing several players who should make significant contributions during the 2022 cycle.Yedlin and Jorge Villafaa often were the first-choice fullbacks under Bruce Arena.John Brooks almost certainly will remain a center back incumbent while Matt Miazga, although inexperienced internationally, now is a regular in the Dutch Eredivisie with Vitesse.Bedoya said he expected Tuesdays game to be one in which Portugal comes out on the offensive, putting the onus on the USA to stay compact, tight, and hit them on the counter.With patterns and partnerships still so nascent, Sarachan will want bodies, cover and options in midfield.Danny Williams is a Premier League defensive midfielder.It makes sense to use him as the anchor.Bedoya and Acosta are comfortable on both sides of the ball, while Lynden Gooch and Juan Agudelo (or New England teammate Kelyn Rowe) can be the attacking outlets when the ball turns over.Agudelo isnt typically a wide player.But hes creative, and he can manage on the left with support behind him.He also can combine or interchange with Acosta or Bedoya.Up front: Dom Dwyer, who scored at the CONCACAF Gold Cup and whos familiar with playing as a lone striker.This 11 is less likely to win Tuesday, but probably comes closer to representing a team that might do so in 2022.Despite the danger of defeat, this may be the squad more USA fans want to see in Portugal.Lets leave Horvath in net.The Club Brugge starter is only 22, after allfour years younger than Bill Hamid.In front of him, a three-man back line anchored by Carter-Vickers, whos got experience in that formation with Sheffield United.When Adams plays wide for the New York Red Bulls, hes on the right.But the 18-year-old also moves around so frequently and is so adaptable, that trying him on the left here and letting Yedlin stay on his customary flank might work.That leaves Acosta and the marauding Mckennie to form the spine and the links in front of Williams.Up front: Agudelostill 24 and comfortable as a second forwardand the 17-year-old, dual-junior-World-Cup-scorer Josh Sargent, wholl join Werder Bremen next year.It's a lineup that's not pragmatic or practical, but it may just be fun and a bit enlightening, and Sarachan has very little to lose.Its all been lost already, and so its time to start again.I never thought Id be here so soon.The fact that I am is amazing, Sargent told reporters.Im just looking forward to proving that I deserve to be here.We can do it a lot sooner than we thought.It gives the U.S. hope to see a lot of young talents.

Stunned Italy fail to reach World Cup as Sweden qualify:::::MILAN (Reuters) - Italian football boss Carlo Tavecchio said recently that failure to qualify for the World Cup would be the apocalypse and his worst fears came true on Monday as they missed out on the finals for the first time in 60 years.Soccer Football - 2018 World Cup Qualifications - Europe - Italy vs Sweden - San Siro, Milan, Italy - November 13, 2017 Italys Stephan El Shaarawy looks dejected as Swedens Emil Forsberg looks on after the match REUTERS/Max Rossi A desperate 0-0 draw at home to a defiant, belligerent and technically inferior Sweden ended the four-time world champions hopes of reaching next years finals in Russia and with it the international careers of several of Italys biggest names.The Swedes, whose starting lineup included only four players based with teams in Europes so-called big five leagues, will take their place after qualifying for the first time since 2006.Italys 1-0 aggregate defeat in their European playoff, after Jakob Johanssons deflected strike in Stockholm, is likely to go down alongside elimination by North Korea at the 1966 World Cup as one of their greatest football debacles.The Italians have only failed to qualify for the tournament once before - missing out on the 1958 finals in Sweden - after not entering the first World Cup in 1930.The players sank to their knees as the final whistle went, the starkest possible contrast to the Swedish joy, knowing that the match will leave an indelible stain on their careers.It was also the tear-jerking end to the career of their 39-year-old goalkeeper and captain Gianluigi Buffon who made his Italy debut 20 years ago against Russia - on the last occasion that Italy had to face a playoff for a World Cup place.LAST GAME Its upsetting that my last Italy game coincides with our elimination for the World Cup, said Buffon, a World Cup winner in 2006.Thats my only regret, because time goes by and its cruel but thats how it is.Sport teaches you to lose and win as a group and share joy and pain.The coach has the same degree of blame as us.Daniele De Rossi, Italys fearsome bearded midfielder who was surprisingly left on the bench on Monday, also announced his international retirement at 34 after 117 appearances.Soccer Football - 2018 World Cup Qualifications - Europe - Italy vs Sweden - San Siro, Milan, Italy - November 13, 2017 Sweden celebrate after the match.REUTERS/Alessandro Garofalo Defenders Giorgio Chiellini and Andrea Barzagli are almost certain to follow suit.However, Gian Piero Ventura, at 69 the oldest coach Italy has ever had, refused to confirm that he would step down, saying he needed to talk to the federation first.Ventura made four changes to the team which lost 1-0 in Stockholm on Friday in the first leg and which was fiercely criticised for its lack of flair in attack.Brazilian-born midfielder Jorginho was thrust into his first competitive international while Napolis flamboyant winger Lorenzo Insigne was once again on the bench.Slideshow (10 Images) POOR FINISHING After a scrappy opening 20 minutes, Italy took control and pressed forward in waves.They had penalty appeals turned down and were repeatedly denied by outstanding Sweden goalkeeper Robin Olsen but were also let down by some desperately poor finishing and final passes, possibly born of desperation.As the game wore on, Italys moves became more rushed and their passing increasingly sloppy and the clear-cut chances dried up.There is likely to be some long and deep soul-searching once the dust has settled as Italians wonder how it all came to this.I absolutely apologise for the result but not for the effort we put in or our desire to win, said Ventura, whose deadpan style could not be further removed from the high-energy approach of his predecessor Antonio Conte.His opposite number Jan Andersson admitted his side had to cling on to their first-leg lead.We had no weapons left.We just had to sit there and hope that we could hang on, he said.We couldnt do it in any other way, they are so skilful.

Team India To Travel By Business Class Now:::::Team India will now fly in business class when travelling on national duty after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Monday approved the Indian cricket team's proposal to upgrade the travel from economy to business class.According to reports, the players had complained about selfie requests from fellow passengers and less leg space while traveling."The proposal has been approved in a recently-held meeting of the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) in Delhi.The proposal approved in CoA meeting regarding business class travel for all cricketers for their domestic flights on and off series," BCCI acting president CK Khanna told ANI.It was Khanna who had proposed this upgrade.Earlier, former India captain Kapil Dev had suggested the BCCI to buy an aircraft for the team.He said the step will reduce travel time and resulting fatigue in an already busy schedule of the Indian cricket team."Now that BCCI is making good money, it should have its own plane.It will save a lot of time and make life easier for Team India.The board can afford it.They should have done it five years ago," he was quoted as saying by The Times of India."I would also love to see some cricketers buying their own aircrafts in the days to come.In the US, top golfers have their own planes.I don't see any reason why our players can't buy it as it will save them a lot of time."I also believe that if BCCI owns planes, the players will get enough rest between matches.I am sure BCCI can also afford the parking charges," said the World Cup-winning captain, adding that such a move will also generate a few more jobs.After beating New Zealand in the ODI and the T20I series, Kohli-led India is now scheduled to take on Sri Lanka for a three-match Test series, starting November 16 at Eden Gardena in Kolkata.
India vs Sri Lanka: Ahead Of First Test, Hosts Focus On Reverse Sweep, Short Balls:::::India gear up to face Sri Lanka in the first Test starting Thursday India gear up to face Sri Lanka in the first Test starting Thursday AFP Facing short balls and playing reverse sweeps against spinners were the highlights of Indian team's training session as they geared up for the three-Test series against Sri Lanka.The Indian team support staff was seen giving throwdowns of short pitch deliveries as the likes of Ajinkya Rahane, Shikhar Dhawan, KL Rahul and skipper Virat Kohli warmed up for their first training session ahead of the Eden Gardens Test here on November 16.Rahane was the longest to take the throwdowns that went on for about half an hour.He was seen tested by short-pitch stuff, an indication of what lies in store for the India team when they go for a two-month long tour to South Africa, which will comprise three Tests, six ODIs and three T20Is.At the nets, India followed their batting order with Rahul and Dhawan setting the tone, facing alternate spin and pace bowling.While the Indian left-right handed duo mainly played in the Vs with occasional reverse sweep, middle-order batsman Rahane's stint at the nets was peppered with the unorthodox shot to the likes of Ravichandran Ashwin and Kuldeep Yadav, hinting their strategy against Rangana Herath and Lakshan Sandakan.Hours after landing, skipper Kohli was seen in full flow during the two-and-half-hour practice.He started off with a few drills like stretching, one-legged jump.Kohli also took the throwdowns and faced some short-pitched deliveries before heading to the nets, where he too approached spinners with the reverse sweep shot.Wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha however chose to play it down, saying, "It's how you react to a particular ball.It's not that we have planned differently for a particular bowler.There's no compulsory shot like that."The Saurashtra duo of Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja -- who played in the last round match against Gujarat that ended yesterday -- opted to rest today."They are here but will come for training tomorrow," a team official said.Later Rohit Sharma, who had scored his ODI world record 264 runs here three years ago, inspected the pitch.Even Rahane and coach Ravi Shastri had a look at the strip individually.

Pakistan Super League 2018: Waqar Younis Says Fixing Still At Play At All Levels Of Cricket:::::Former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis made a big statement on Sunday, ahead of Pakistan Super League (PSL) 2018, saying that the fixing still exists in cricket.He also stressed that collective efforts were required to eradicate it.Waqar, who also coached the Pakistan national team, also said that spot-fixing has badly damaged the image of Pakistan cricket."The roots of fixing are very deep.It still exists at all levels so we need to have joint and concerted efforts to eradicate this menace," Waqar said while addressing the media during Islamabad United's press conference.Waqar is associated as a director of Islamabad United for the third edition of the PSL.He also asserted that he will keep vigil and do special monitoring for the young cricketers regarding spot-fixing."My prime task will be to guide the players on and off the field and tell them how to avoid this malpractice as this can easily derail a good career," he said.Islamabad United won the inaugural edition of the PSL in 2016, followed by Peshawar Zalmi's title win in 2017.The third season will start from February 23 with Dubai hosting the opening ceremony.Waqar also hoped that the slam-bang league will help in the revival of international cricket in Pakistan as more and more foreign stars will be in action in the third edition of the tournament.Pakistan, in September this year, hosted World XI for a three-match T20 series which was followed by a lone match against Sri Lanka."With Sri Lanka coming to Lahore, and before that the World XI series and the final of the PSL -- that all changed conceptions about Pakistan though we still need to convince the foreign players to tour us and not fear about security," he signed off.
Saina Nehwal, HS Prannoy Eye China Open to Seal Berth at Dubai Final:::::Newly-crowned national champions Saina Nehwal and H S Prannoy will look to enhance their chances of qualifying for the Dubai Super Series Finals with a good performance at the USD 700,000 China Open Superseries Premier starting on Tuesday.Former World No.1 Saina upstaged Olympic silver-medallist P V Sindhu in the national finals last week to claim her third championship crown, while Prannoy stunned Kidambi Srikanth to clinch his maiden title at the 82nd edition of the event at Nagpur.Interestingly, both Saina and Prannoy are ranked 11th in the Destination Dubai Ranking and are racing against time to book a berth at next month's Super Series Final with just two Super Series events -- China Open and Hong Kong Open -- left in the calender.The 27-year-old Indian, who clinched a bronze medal at the Glasgow World Championship, will open her campaign against USA's Beiwen Zhang, while Prannoy will face a qualifier in the opening round.However, Srikanth, who clinched four titles and reached five finals in this season, will be taking a break this week to nurse a muscle strain.Sindhu has also been in impressive form this season as she clinched two super series titles -- India Open and Korea Open -- besides winning a silver at the World Championship.She too will be pumped up to get back to her winning ways after the setback against Saina.The 22-year-old will begin her journey against Japan's Sayaka Sato, who clinched the Indonesia Open this year.If the Indian can cross the first two rounds, she might face off against Japan's Nozomi Okuhara, who had beaten her to a coveted gold at the Glasgow world championship in August after a marathon final.Among others in men's singles, B Sai Praneeth, who has been a bit off-colour ever since his Singapore Open triumph, will take on Denmark's Anders Antonsen.Ajay Jayaram, who had skipped the Denmark and French Open, will square off against Japan's Kazumasa Sakai.The Verma brothers -- Sourabh and Sameer -- will also be back in action after skipping the last two super series events due to fitness issues.While Sourabh meets France's Brice Leverdez, who had knocked out Chong Wei at the World Championship opener, Sameer faces the arduous task of upsetting world no.1 and reigning world champion Viktor Axelsen.In doubles, the mixed pair of Pranaav Jerry Chopra and N Sikki Reddy, who had reached the semifinals at Japan Open, will have to fight it out with the fifth-seeded Chinese combo of Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong.The men's pair of Manu Attri and B Sumeeth Reddy, who won the Nationals last week, faces the top-seeded Indonesian combo of Marcus Fernaldi Gideon and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo.Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty will take on fifth-seeded Chinese combo of Liu Cheng and Zhang Nan.National champions Ashwini and Sikki will cross swords with the Korean combo of Ha Na Baek and Chae Yoo Jung in women's doubles.In the qualifiers, national champions Satwiksairaj and Ashwini will look to make it to the main draw when they face Chinese Taipei's Lee Jhe-Huei and Wu Ti Jung.In men's singles, Commonwealth Games champion Parupalli Kashyap will begin his campaign in the qualifiers, taking on China's Guo Kai.

Ravichandran Ashwin, Hardik Pandya Trolled On The Big Bang Theory. Fans Unimpressed:::::A recent episode of the very popular American sitcom 'The Big Bang Theory' left Indian cricket fans surprised after names of star players Ravichandran Ashwin, Hardik Pandya and Bhuvneshwar Kumar were mentioned during the 11th season.The show, which is based on the lives of four scientists with one of them being Rajesh Koothrappali, played by Kunal Nayyar, has a huge fan following in India.In one of the scenes, Rajesh and 'Howard Wolowitz', played by Simon Helberg, are at the bar where a cricket match is being screened."I don't get how you can enjoy cricket, it makes no sense!"Wolowitz tells Rajesh."That's Ravichandran Ashwin, he is amazing.He makes Hardik Pandya look like Bhuvneshwar Kumar," replies Rajesh."Wooah, wooah, wooah!Save syllables for the rest of us," says Wolowitz.The joke on the cricketers, however, left the Indian fans rather unimpressed.Yeah!Although I didn't understand what Raj meant by "Ashwin makes Hardin Pandya look like Bhuvaneshwar Kumar."Doesn't make sense to me.S R (@SharanyaR1999) November 12, 2017 That statement, however, makes no sense.:) But congratulations @ashwinravi99.You are now a star in USA.?????(@iyerakshay) November 10, 2017 Raj doesn't make sense here but yay for ash!Just for the sake of setting up the syllable joke?koushik sridar (@koushikmacho) November 10, 2017 Ashwin has been out of India's limited-overs cricket team after the emergence of Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav.The off-spinner will make a return to the Test side as India take on Sri Lanka from November 16 onwards.On the other hand, Bhuvneshwar and Pandya have been in top form in the recently concluded series.The two are now widely regarded as India's most improved cricketers.
India vs Sri Lanka: Virat Kohli On The Verge Of Breaking Sourav Ganguly's Record In Tests:::::India are hot favourites in the upcoming three-Test series against Sri Lanka, starting on Thursday, and the rampaging hosts will aim for a clean sweep.Captain Virat Kohli will surpass former India captain Sourav Ganguly's record of 21 Test wins as captain (49 games), if the home side manages a 3-0 scoreline.Currently, Kohli has captained India in 29 Test matches, out of which they have won 19 games.MS Dhoni is on the top of the list with 27 wins in 60 matches.If Kohli's side manages to win two Tests, then he will be on par with Ganguly.The Kohli-led side is on top form with eight consecutive Test series wins, the latest being 3-0 whitewash versus Sri Lanka in their own backyard.It all started in Sri Lanka in 2015 and since then, India have beaten South Africa, the West Indies, New Zealand, England, Bangladesh, Australia and Sri Lanka in the longest format of the game.The islanders, who lost 0-9 across formats at home against India earlier this year, will play three Tests, three ODIs and three T20s on the tour.Meanwhile, Indian cricket team coach Ravi Shastri, along with a few other players, arrived in Kolkata on Sunday ahead of their first Test starting on November 16.Shastri touched down at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport late evening while pacer Umesh Yadav and opener Shikhar Dhawan arrived during the day.India Test squad for the first two Tests: Virat Kohli (capt), KL Rahul, Murali Vijay, Shikhar Dhawan, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane (vice-capt), Rohit Sharma, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Bhuvaneshwar Kumar, Ishant Sharma.
Kuldeep Yadav, Ignored By Selectors, Contemplated Suicide:::::India's rising star, spinner Kuldeep Yadav, believes he is battle-ready for any surface that a rival cricket power can lay out for him.Kuldeep, who claimed a hat-trick in India's triumphant one-day series against Australia, has become a household name at 22 and with only a handful internationals matches to his name.The road to the top, however, was rather rocky for the chinaman.When not picked Uttar Pradesh's under-15 team, Kuldeep, a 13-year-old at the time, contemplated not just quitting the game but also ending his life."I had worked hard for my selection, but when I was not picked, I mentioned suicide in frustration.It happens to everyone in the heat of the moment," he told Hindustan Times.Kuldeep made his mark in the Indian Premier League with the Kolkata Knight Riders.The latest addition to India's rich spin tradition made an instant impact with four wickets in his debut Test against Australia in Dharamsala this year.He impressed in Sri Lanka in September and then bamboozled Australian batsmen, including star opener David Warner, with his wrist spin, winning many more fans.Kuldeep grew up watching videos of spin legend Shane Warne and still calls the Aussie great his reference point in learning the rare art.Warne recently compared Kuldeep to Pakistan's established Test spinner Yasir Shah, saying the Indian can become "the best leg-spinner" if he remains patient.Kuldeep has formed a partnership with leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal and they are now India's preferred option over Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in limited-overs cricket.(With inputs from AFP)
India vs Sri Lanka: Harbhajan Singh Mocks Visitors, Then Deletes Tweet:::::Harbhajan Singh's approach to social media mirrors his personality on the cricket field.The off-spinner does not shy away from a challenge and gives back as good as he gets.From tweeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to indulging in banter with cricketers, it is impossible to predict who Bhajji might do next.That is exactly what happened after Harbhajan reacted to a comment from Sri Lankan batsman Dimuth Karunaratne, who spoke about negating the threat of Indian spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in the upcoming Test series."I know Jadeja and Ashwin are both hungry for wickets.Every time they bowl it's about sticking to the basics.If I don't give them any chance, they will try to do something else.If we need them to change the field you have to do something extra," he said.The Sri Lanka opener scored 285 runs, including a valiant 141 in the second innings of the first Test against India two months ago."That's my game plan...I wait for the loose ones and I will stick to that.If it does not work I will think out of the box and give some extra pressure to the bowlers," Karunaratne told reporters after day one of their tour match against Board President's XI,."Same way how they did in recent series.. they r getting beaten by Zimbabwe.. 1st inn 200 second inn 150.Sri Lankan team at their lowest so sad to see them like this.. hope they will revive and get to international level," tweeted Harbhajan in response to the Sri Lankan's comment.The Punjab bowler then went on to delete his tweet.Harbhajan Singh posts Tweet ridiculing Sri Lankan team, deletes post later.(Might have realised that they are gona get the shot back in this series) ??#INDVSL pic.twitter.com/b2rj5n3IK0 Nibraz Ramzan (@Nibrazcricket) November 12, 2017 Sri Lanka will look to give Bhajji a befitting reply with a strong show on the pitch.India will play 3 Tests, 3 ODIs and 3 T20Is.against the visitors.The first Test begins in Kolkata from November 16.Virat Kohli's men start as clear favorites to sweep the series as they did recently in Sri Lanka.

Tour Finals Fair For All, Says Roger Federer Amid Clay Talk:::::Roger Federer has dismissed Rafael Nadal's claim that it would be fairer if the ATP Tour Finals were played on clay courts.As the world's most formidable player on clay, Nadal has in the past suggested it would be better if the season-ending Tour Finals at least occasionally took place on his preferred surface.The prestigious season-ending event has never been held on clay since its inception in 1970 and it's a tournament which Nadal has yet to conquer.It has mostly been played on an indoor hard-court, with other stints on carpet, grass and outdoor hard-courts when it was staged in various cities before setting up home in London in 2009.Federer has always thrived on the indoor hard-court used at the O2 Arena, as he showed once again by kicking off his bid for a seventh title at the event with a 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) win over Jack Sock on Sunday.Asked about the world number one's desire for a clay finale to the season, Federer insisted the current surface was a good choice given the preponderance of other events on the crushed earth.There are currently three Masters 1000 events held on Nadal's favoured clay, with none on the faster grass that Federer prefers.Of the Grand Slams, only the French Open -- won 10 times by Nadal -- is on clay, while Wimbledon, where Federer has triumphed eight times -- is the grass-court major."'Fair'?I'm not sure if it's the right word.I think it's right and fair that it's indoors, as well," Federer said."There is no Masters 1000s on grass.There is one Masters 1000 indoors: Paris.So I feel like indoors also deserves its place."Could it be switched up to clay once in a while?Yeah, maybe.Could we have more 1000s on grass?"Yeah, we could have that, too.Could we have less on clay, more or hard courts?Could we have more or hard courts, less on clay?"Yes, it's all debatable.I think it's not the time of the year for clay, so there you have it."You can do indoor clay, I guess, but that's a bit silly.But I get his point."No regrets Federer has enjoyed a remarkable renaissance this year, winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon, as well as five other titles.Despite that stunning return to form, the 36-year-old won't finish the year on top of the world rankings.Nadal wrapped up that honour when Federer opted out of the recent Paris Masters.If world number two Federer had played and won in France, he could have kept the race going into the Tour Finals -- where he and Nadal are the leading contenders for the trophy.But he was adamant he had no worries about missing out on pole position."He was better throughout the year.He played more tournaments.He was incredibly successful throughout," Federer said."So, no, I don't have any regrets because I feel like in my stage of my competition, my age, either it comes to me or it doesn't."He had more gas left in the tank than I did.I couldn't play as much as I've wanted, or I overplayed anyway."My only regret was I would have loved to be in contention through the Montreal finals, Cincinnati, US Open."But things evaporated very quickly after he won the US Open.That's when he made his final push, was in Asia.That was it for me really."In some ways I'm happy he clinched it because he deserves it.I can focus on playing the tournament, and not having to talk about that at the same time."But, sure, I would have loved to be it, but you can't be it with that many tournaments, so it's no problem for me."
Switzerland Edge Out Northern Ireland To Qualify For 2018 FIFA World Cup:::::Switzerland players celebrate after qualifying for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.Switzerland players celebrate after qualifying for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.AFP Switzerland held off Northern Ireland to seal a place at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia with a 0-0 second-leg draw on Sunday that secured a 1-0 aggregate play-off victory.Vladimir Petkovic's side wasted numerous first-half chances as the Northern Irish stayed in the tie, but Ricardo Rodriguez's controversial first-leg penalty in Belfast proved enough for the Swiss to reach their fourth consecutive World Cup.Northern Ireland fell short in their bid to reach a first finals since 1986.Away manager Michael O'Neill replaced Kyle Lafferty up front with Queens Park Rangers striker Conor Washington, while the hosts named an unchanged starting XI.With heavy rain leaving the St Jakob-Park pitch in bad condition, Northern Ireland started strongly.Chris Brunt brought a good save from Yann Sommer with a swerving long-range strike in only the third minute, before Stuart Dallas fired over from the resulting corner.In a high-tempo opening to the game, Haris Seferovic should have doubled the hosts' aggregate lead but headed Xherdan Shaqiri's vicious cross past the far post.Switzerland continued to push for a crucial opening goal, but Gareth McAuley did well to help Blerim Dzemaili's shot over the crossbar, and Benfica striker Seferovic again headed a Shaqiri delivery off target.O'Neill's visitors still looked much brighter than they had done in Thursday's loss in Belfast, but the 25-year-old Seferovic was proving a real handful as he volleyed wide from a tight angle.Petkovic's side were struggling to make the most of their early chances, though, as goalkeeper Michael McGovern got down quickly to deny Stoke City winger Shaqiri at the near post.The Norwich City keeper was called into action once more before the half-hour mark, keeping out Steven Zuber's low drive with his legs.The Swiss, who finished second to Portugal in qualifying Group B despite winning nine of 10 matches, came out of the blocks quickly after half-time with Zuber seeing an effort blocked and left-back Rodriguez drilling narrowly wide.Northern Ireland sent out a reminder that they were still in with a chance of forcing extra-time, as Washington sent a header looping away from keeper Sommer, but also the top corner.Switzerland had become frustrated by their inability to kill the tie off, and Washington created a good chance for George Saville to break the deadlock, only for the Millwall midfielder to curl tamely at Sommer.O'Neill sent on Kilmarnock winger Jordan Jones for his international debut with 15 minutes remaining.The home side should have sealed a ticket to Russia in the 85th minute, but Seferovic's poor day in front of goal went from bad to worse when he blazed over with the goal at his mercy.Northern Ireland almost made him pay with a late rally, but Rodriguez cleared a Jonny Evans injury-time header off the line as Switzerland clung on.
india v sri lanka: SA tour in mind, India likely to field three pacers in first Test:::::KOLKATA: The Indian team management is likely to field three frontline pacers in the first Test against Sri Lanka, keeping in mind the upcoming South Africa tour.It has been learnt that the Indian team management wants tracks that are hard and bouncy without any major grass covering for all three home Tests -- something they will be getting in South Africa.Keeping that in mind, the grass cover was removed by the Eden Gardens groundsmen on Monday.As India will have to go in with three specialist speedsters in South Africa, Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav will be complemented by either Bhuvneshwar Kumar or Ishant Sharma Ishant led Delhi in three Ranji Trophy games this season, and more importantly, bowled really well in all the matches.His back of the length bowling on hard tracks can be useful.Similarly, Bhuvneshwar can be very useful considering the swing on offer during the early morning and post-tea session at the Eden Gardens.The two specialist spinners are likely to be Ravichandran Ashwin and chinaman Kuldeep Yadav.Ashwin was seen practising a lot of wrong 'uns while using the grip of a leg-break bowler.On the other hand, skipper Virat Kohli was seen facing reverse swing throwdowns against a customised red and yellow ball.These balls are specially designed so that batsmen can practice against reverse swing.One part of the seam is yellow coloured and the other is red.Normally, the throwdown expert tries to reverse it at a fast pace from 16 or 18 yards.Sachin Tendulkar used to practice a lot with these balls during the last part of his career.This practice is also common with a lot of Ranji teams including Delhi.
Saina: Saina, Prannoy eye China Open to seal berth at Dubai Final:::::FUZHOU (China): Newly-crowned national champions Saina Nehwal and HS Prannoy will look to enhance their chances of qualifying for the Dubai Super Series Finals with a good performance at the $700,000 China Open Super Series Premier starting on Tuesday.Former World No.1 Saina upstaged Olympic silver-medalist PV Sindhu in the national finals last week to claim her third championship crown, while Prannoy stunned Kidambi Srikanth to clinch his maiden title at the 82nd edition of the event at Nagpur.Interestingly, both Saina and Prannoy are ranked 11th in the Destination Dubai Ranking and are racing against time to book a berth at next month's Super Series Final with just two Super Series events - China Open and Hong Kong Open - left in the calender.The 27-year-old Indian, who clinched a bronze medal at the Glasgow World Championship, will open her campaign against USA's Beiwen Zhang, while Prannoy will face a qualifier in the opening round.However, Srikanth, who clinched four titles and reached five finals in this season, will be taking a break this week to nurse a muscle strain.Among others to pull out are Sameer Verma, Ajay Jayaram and B Sai Praneeth.Sindhu has also been in impressive form this season as she clinched two Super Series titles - India Open and Korea Open - besides winning a silver at the World Championship.She too will be pumped up to get back to her winning ways after the setback against Saina.The 22-year-old will begin her journey against Japan's Sayaka Sato, who clinched the Indonesia Open this year.If the Indian can cross the first two rounds, she might face off against Japan's Nozomi Okuhara, who had beaten her to a coveted gold at the Glasgow world championship in August after a marathon final.Sourabh Verma will also be back in action after skipping the last two Super Series events due to fitness issues.Sourabh meets France's Brice Leverdez, who had knocked out Chong Wei at the World Championship opener.In doubles, the mixed pair of Pranaav Jerry Chopra and N Sikki Reddy , who had reached the semi-finals at Japan Open, will have to fight it out with the fifth-seeded Chinese combo of Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong.The men's pair of Manu Attri and B Sumeeth Reddy , who won the Nationals last week, faces the top-seeded Indonesian combo of Marcus Fernaldi Gideon and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo.Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty will take on fifth-seeded Chinese combo of Liu Cheng and Zhang Nan.National champions Ashwini and Sikki will cross swords with the Korean combo of Ha Na Baek and Chae Yoo Jung in women's doubles.In the qualifiers on Tuesday, national champions Satwiksairaj and Ashwini will look to make it to the main draw when they face Chinese Taipei's Lee Jhe-Huei and Wu Ti Jung.In men's singles, Commonwealth Games champion Parupalli Kashyap will begin his campaign in the qualifiers, taking on China's Guo Kai.
india v sri lanka: I asked for the rest, says Hardik Pandya:::::NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Hardik Pandya , who has been rested for the Test matches against Sri Lanka, on Monday said he asked for the rest because of niggles.The 24-year-old said he will use this break to improve his fitness so that he could perform to the best of his abilities during the South Africa tour India will play three Tests, six One-Day Internationals (ODI) and three Twenty20 Internationals against the Proteas.The first Test begins on January 5 in Cape Town."To be honest, I asked for it.My body wasn't up to it, I was getting niggles because of the amount of cricket that I have played.I want to play cricket when I am totally up for it, when I can give my 100 percent," Pandya told CNN-News18."I am lucky that I have got this break.I will train in the gym during this break and improve my fitness.I won't lie, I am really excited for South Africa series.I would like to use this break to improve my fitness for the series," he added.Pandya said he will remain positive ahead of the series and will play well."Yes, I am really excited.People are talking about it....It's a much hyped series.I like challenges in life, they keep me going..... As you said I am the missing link in the team, who knows I might be the difference there.I am sure we are going to play very well," he said.When asked about the biggest turning point of his career, Pandya said: "My life changed when I got a chance to play for MI ( Mumbai Indians ) and then I never looked back.I had a small failure and that's why I learned to be even more professional.You need to understand that some things are bad.That's how you improve in life."
2019 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers: I'm ready to offer Sunil Chhetri Myanmar passport: Coach:::::MARGAO: Myanmar coach Gerd Zaise is so impressed with Sunil Chhetri that he is willing to offer the Indian football team skipper his country's passport.Referring to Chhetri's goal, which made the difference between the two teams in their first leg 2019 AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers , the German described Chhetri as the "most dangerous player"."The Indian captain is a cool customer and he's the most dangerous player.We must take care of the counter attacks and the defence line must be cautious when it involves him," Zaise stated."I am ready to give him a Myanmar Passport," he said and repeated the line when he met Chhetri after the press conference.Having assured qualification, India will fancy their chances in the return leg on Tuesday."India are really good at defending and we have to absolutely on our toes to penetrate them.I would like to congratulate them on their success but tomorrow we have to take our chances to go back with a positive result," Zaise stated."We have come to Goa to play good football and take some points.Our first target is to not lose.We were the better side in the first leg but ended up on the losing side."We need to score.Sometimes, you will get only one chance in the entire match and you need to utilise that."Captain Yan Aung Kyaw , nevertheless, dismissed talks of any "extra pressure on his side"."After 15 years we stand with a realistic chance to qualify for the AFC Asian Cup.We come out every day to get a win.Tomorrow is no different and we need nothing less than a win.There's no other alternative."
india v sri lanka: First target is to win opening Test: Wriddhiman Saha:::::KOLKATA: India's wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha on Monday said that his team's first target is to win the opening Test at the Eden Gardens to set the momentum for the three-match series against Sri Lanka."We are yet to see the wicket but the first target is to win the first Test and get momentum to win the series," Saha said after Indian team's first practice session ahead of the opening Test against Sri Lanka from November 16.Not looking too far ahead of the South Africa series, beginning with Cape Town Test on January 6, Saha said it was about taking it match by match."Every match is important and poses a different challenge, there's nothing like preparation.We will go match by match.If we do better here then we will think of the SA series."Rating Ravichandran Ashwin ahead of others, Saha said the off-spinner posed a big challenge to keep behind the stumps with many variations."Ashwin is ahead of others.He has got many variations, also the length varies, so it's tough against him.He has more variation than (Ravindra) Jadeja, Kuldeep (Yadav)."We have played many matches in Ranji, India A and during practice.The more you keep, the better idea you develop.It becomes easier after a point.I've always played with them in all my 28 Tests," he said.India boast of three spinners -- Ashwin, left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja and left-arm chinaman Kuldeep Yadav -- all are very different from each other."Your 50 per cent job is done mainly by reading the hand at the point of release then you see how it bounces off the pitch and turns.The challenge is to hold on to all the balls, even if it turns or not."Among the pacers, Saha picked Ishant Sharma and Mohammed Shami as the seam bowlers who pose a bigger challenge than swing."The ball wobbles after it goes past and it becomes tough for the wicketkeepers too.But being swing bowlers, Umesh Yadav and Bhuvneshwar Kumar there's not much of a problem."Asked whether they would play three spinners, he said: "Ultimately we will decide as per the wicket and see who gets maximum purchase from the wicket."He may have stepped down from the captaincy, but MS Dhoni is still seen overseeing the fielding in ODIs from behind the stumps and Saha said he also gives his inputs to the captain."The team management has decided that anyone can give a feedback.Kohli is usually in the slip cordon so I convey my inputs.But the ultimate decision is of the captain."He added the drill is the same during a decision review."It's about being confident and conveying it to the captain.You should never have any doubt," he said.
Saeed Ajmal: Pakistan's Saeed Ajmal retires from all cricket:::::KARACHI: Pakistan spinner Saeed Ajmal announced his retirement from all forms of cricket on Monday, two years after losing his wicket-taking bite with a remodelled bowling action that was twice deemed illegal.During a successful but controversial career, Ajmal was once celebrated as the world's number one bowler in one day internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 cricket, and was almost as successful in Tests.He famously captured 24 wickets in three Tests against England in 2012.But his time in the limelight was cut short after a temporary ban for chucking saw him return to the sport in 2015 without the same form.He took just one wicket in two ODIs and a Twenty20 in Bangladesh, his first matches after being cleared to bowl, and was never selected for the national team again."I am quitting all forms of cricket after the current National Twenty20 tournament," Ajmal told AFP from Rawalpindi on the phone."It was a highly satisfying career in which I achieved whatever goals I set for myself and helped the team win matches."Ajmal took 178 wickets in 35 Tests, the last of which was at Galle in Sri Lanka in 2014, where his bowling action was reported for a second time.It was first reported during an ODI series against Australia in the UAE in 2009.He finished with 184 wickets in 113 ODIs, and 85 in 64 Twenty20 internationals.But in spite of his early successes, Ajmal said the last two years of his career had been frustrating."Ban over action left me frustrated and hurt," he said."More hurtful was that current player Stuart Broad questioned that and his comments hurt me no end.But I have forgiven everyone."England fast bowler Broad questioned the legality of Ajmal's action when the Pakistani spinner was featuring in an English county championship a month before the umpires' report in Sri Lanka.Ajmal took a swipe at the process of calling bowlers out for illegal action."It seems that the process was meant for me and (Mohammad) Hafeez, all other bowlers with questionable actions are still playing," he said.Hafeez's action was reported for a second time last month.Ajmal said he will concentrate on coaching in the future.
Ravi Shastri's timely advice has helped me: Dinesh Karthik:::::NEW DELHI: It could well be the last of his innumerable comebacks but Dinesh Karthik is not losing sleep over it as he intends to build on the recent gains in international cricket by following the timely advice of India coach Ravi Shastri With young wicketkeeper-batsmen like Sanju Samson and Rishabh Pant waiting in the wings and veteran Parthiv Patel still knocking on the selectors' door, Karthik knows he has to keep performing, albeit only as a specialist batsman with MS Dhoni still the number one choice in limited overs cricket.On current form, he could be the stable number four batsman India is looking for in ODIs."May be it is (the last of comebacks) but I have not looked at it that way," Karthik said when asked about his latest comeback."If you start thinking on those lines (future in the team), you put extra pressure on yourself.I am satisfied with the way I batted in ODI series against New Zealand and would aim to do the same whenever I get the next opportunity."The 32-year-old has lost track of the many comebacks he has made ever since making his India debut back in 2004.The most recent recall was at the Champions Trophy in June and that too on the 11th hour as the Tami Nadu wicketkeeper-batsman replaced the injured Manish Pandey in the squad.He did not get a game in England but got his first game for India in over three years in the following limited overs series in the West Indies.The stylish right-hander scored an unbeaten 50 and 48 in three chances he got in the Caribbean before Pandey came back to replace him in ODIs in Sri Lanka.Karthik, a consistent performer on the domestic circuit over the past 24 months, was brought back into the ODI side for the New Zealand series after he struck two hundreds in the Duleep Trophy.For him, the best part of the New Zealand series was that he got to play all three games.He made a promising 37 at number five in opening ODI before making an undefeated 64 at his preferred number four spot in the second game at Pune to help India level the series."I don't know if it was my best ODI innings but it surely was an important one, personally as well as for the team," recalled Karthik.With the ODIs against Sri Lanka coming up next month, Karthik has joined a preparatory camp at the NCA to work more on his fitness and deal with a few niggles at the same time.He doesn't know what lies ahead but remains focused on improving his game with key inputs from coach Shastri as well as veteran Mumbai all-rounder Abhishek Nayar "In terms of feelers (for the future) from the team management, nothing has been communicated.But regarding my batting, I did have a long chat with Ravi bhai (Shastri)."He was happy with my batting against New Zealand but he said there are still areas where I can improve upon, especially maintaining the tempo of the innings since he feels I have all the shots.I agree with him and that is what I would look to do."As far as his close association with Nayar is concerned, not much has been in public domain but he has been working with Karthik for a while now."I would not be where I am without Abhishek Nayar.Working with him is an ongoing process.We discuss a lot about the game, mostly on the phone since we are both busy playing."For example, before the New Zealand series he advised me to show intent from ball one, be very aggressive," he said.Karthik is someone who has played against multiple captains including Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid , MS Dhoni and now Virat Kohli.Talking about Kohli, the Chennai-based cricketer said that the results of the fitness culture the Indian captain has cultivated are for all to see and even on that aspect, he leads from the front."With a leader like Virat, who has absolutely got it spot one in terms of fitness, he has built his lifestyle around it."The team members are learning a lot from that and they can see the exceptional performances he has been able to give in the last 5-6 years.It has trickled down to the players."Karthik is aware that the fitness standards are a lot higher from the time he made his India debut.However, he doesn't understand the hype around the Yo-Yo test which has to be cleared to play for the country.The minimum score required to pass the test is 16.1."The current benchmark is pretty achievable.Anybody who puts in a bit of effort can reach that mark.There is nothing earth shattering about it.It only starts getting tougher from 17.5 onwards.There has been a lot of hue and cry about it but it is pretty achievable for most sportsmen," he opined.Having played his last Test more than seven years ago, Karthik has not given up on the wearing the India whites again and is determined to make the cut for the upcoming South Africa tour as the second wicketkeeper.
india v sri lanka: India focus on reverse sweep, short balls during practice session:::::KOLKATA: Facing short balls and playing reverse sweeps against spinners were the highlights of Indian team's training session as they geared up for the three-Test series against Sri Lanka.The Indian team support staff was seen giving throwdowns of short pitch deliveries as the likes of Ajinkya Rahane KL Rahul and skipper Virat Kohli warmed up for their first training session ahead of the Eden Gardens Test on November 16.Rahane was the longest to take the throwdowns that went on for about half an hour.He was seen tested by short-pitch stuff, an indication of what lies in store for the India team when they go for a two-month long tour to South Africa, which will comprise three Tests, six ODIs and three T20Is.At the nets, India followed their batting order with Rahul and Dhawan setting the tone, facing alternate spin and pace bowling.While the Indian left-right handed duo mainly played in the Vs with occasional reverse sweep, middle-order batsman Rahane's stint at the nets was peppered with the unorthodox shot to the likes of Ravichandran Ashwin and Kuldeep Yadav, hinting their strategy against Rangana Herath and Lakshan Sandakan.Hours after landing, skipper Kohli was seen in full flow during the two-and-half-hour practice.He started off with a few drills like stretching, one-legged jump.Kohli also took the throwdowns and faced some short- pitched deliveries before heading to the nets, where he too approached spinners with the reverse sweep shot.Wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha however chose to play it down, saying, "It's how you react to a particular ball.It's not that we have planned differently for a particular bowler.There's no compulsory shot like that."The Saurashtra duo of Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja -- who played in the last round match against Gujarat that ended on Sunday -- opted to rest today."They are here but will come for training tomorrow," a team official said.Later Rohit Sharma, who had scored his ODI world record 264 runs here three years ago, inspected the pitch.Even Rahane and coach Ravi Shastri had a look at the strip individually.
Hockey India to experiment with mixed-gender format, eye Olympic inclusion:::::PUNE: Considering the growing relevance of gender-equality at the Olympic Games, the Hockey India will be conducting a 5-a-side mixed-gender tournament at Shiv Chhatrapati sports complex in Balewadi on Saturday.According to Hockey India general secretary Manoj Bhore , the format will be tried for the first time in Pune and will be watched by International Olympic Committee observers."The aim is to pitch this format for the 2024 Games.Since many individual sports like tennis, shooting, badminton have been attaining gender equality at the Games, we at Hockey India thought of bringing a concept that is faster and will fulfill the equality criteria.The tournament will be watched by an IOC member as something like this is being conducted for the first time in the world," Bhore told TOI.An International Hockey Federation (FIH) official also confirmed that the world hockey body is keeping a keen eye on the format."We have been following the developments closely.It can be a format of the future and even the IOC is in the knowhow of things," the official said.The mixed-gender event will be a day's affair, while the 5-a-side national league matches for men and women will begin from Tuesday.Each team will have nine players, five men and four women.At a time, five players will be at the ground, which will mandatorily include minimum of two women players.Top Indian players like Devendra Walmiki Rani Rampal , Savita Rani and Gurpreet Kaur will be a part of the nationals.
Lewis Hamilton: Hamilton offers glimpse of future in Brazil:::::SAO PAULO: Lewis Hamilton 's performance in Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix was "the best fourth place I have ever seen" according to his Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff The 32-year-old, who clinched his fourth world title in Mexico at the end of October, offered a glimpse of his personal determination to retain his champion's crown in his dazzling drive from the pit lane to fourth position.And while 2016 champion Nico Rosberg , Hamilton's former team-mate with Mercedes, lauded the Briton's speed and race-craft, he also suggested that Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari had this year missed out on their best chance to stop him."I don't think Sebastian Vettel will have a better chance next year," said Rosberg after watching the four-time champion make the most of Hamilton's rare blunder in Saturday's qualifying to claim his fifth win of the season ahead of Valtteri Bottas in the second Mercedes."This year the opportunity for him to win the World Championship was huge, but Mercedes as a whole team is just a power -- so I think the gap between them and Ferrari could even get bigger in the coming season."As praise for Hamilton's drive poured in, however, Rosberg warned that even the champion team can make mistakes."Yes, let's see.Even Mercedes has made mistakes and Sebastian has to hope for more of that and to be there at the right moment."Rosberg's former boss Wolff said he believed Hamilton's drive was "astonishing" and suggested that he had the speed to win the race after starting in the pit lane.Hamilton finished the race in fourth place and just 5.4 seconds adrift of the victorious Vettel after scything through the field in a repaired car fitted with a new power unit following his opening lap crash in Q1."I think a win would have been possible," said Wolff."He was the quickest guy out there, but you must remember that Sebastian was managing the pace of the race, apart from the last laps.So we haven't probably seen the real race."He added that Hamilton, who said he was satisfied to have redeemed himself by finishing fourth after his crash in qualifying, had achieved what they expected."When we discussed it in the morning, we thought that what would be a realistic target with a safety car would be P4," said Wolff."We had that so that helped us a little bit, but the gap to the Ferraris was too close to have achieved much more."Wolff added: "For me it was the best fourth place I've ever seen - to start from the pit lane and end up 5.4seconds behind the leader.That is quite an astonishing drive."Hamilton said he had been keen to show he retained his heart-felt desire to succeed and "showed that I have many more races to go in my career".
AIFF general secretary says Constantine's job not in danger:::::NEW DELHI: AIFF general secretary Kushal Das made it clear that national team coach Stephen Constantine would not be removed amid speculation that a few senior players are orchestrating a move to get him ousted.There were reports that some senior players feel that Constantine is not technically proficient enough to coach the team.However, Das said there was no question of removing the coach, under whose guidance the team has qualified for the 2019 Asian Cup after a string of impressive results in recent times."He is very much there as the coach, he has been doing a great job and delivered very impressive results.So, no question," Das said.Solely going by performance, Constantine could easily remain at the helm.Under Constantine, the Indian team qualified for the Asian Cup tournament in 2019 for the first time since 2011, after a 4-1 win over Macau last month.Constantine joined the Indian national team in February 2016, when it was placed at a dismal 173 in the FIFA rankings, and helped it break into the top 100 for the first time in over 20 years.The team is also currently unbeaten in its last 11 matches.Last Saturday, the Supreme Court stayed the order of the Delhi High Court allowing all AIFF elected committees to function on a regular basis.It also allowed Praful Patel to continue in his role as the president of the federation.Asked about the SC directive, Das said they were always "confident" of getting a stay order from the top court.The SC also appointed SY Qureshi, former Chief Election Commissioner of India and former India football captain Bhaskar Ganguly as the Ombudsman to formulate the AIFF constitution within eight weeks."Making the necessary changes in AIFF constitution to make it compliant with the sports code is not a difficult task as the changes are minor.As per the AIFF constitution, five proposers are required whereas only two are required as per the sports code," Das said.Having successfully hosted the FIFA U-17 World Cup, the general secretary hoped the events of the past few days would not have a bearing on India's bid for the U-20 World Cup in 2019.
Consistent performances can bring me back in reckoning: Abhimanyu Mithun:::::BENGALURU: Karnataka fast bowler Abhimanyu Mithun is confident that a string of consistent performances will bring him back into national reckoning."I have been bowling well and two more such innings with the ball can bring me back into contention," Mithun said after back-to-back five-wicket hauls.Karnataka skipper R Vinay Kumar also hoped for Mithun's return to the Indian side if he kept getting wickets as he did in the last two games."He has bagged five wickets each in last two games against Maharashtra and Delhi.It is a great achievement.If he keeps bowling like this, he can make a comeback into the Indian side any moment," Vinay said.Vinay said Mithun is looking a much better bowler than he was a few years ago, for he is making the batsmen play more, a ploy which gets wickets to any bowler.Asked about the reasons for his good bowling performances this season, Mithun said he has made few changes in his bowling action and worked on his fitness including yoga."I have worked on making few changes in my bowling action, plus on my fitness.I have started doing yoga.All these things are helping a lot," he said.Elaborating on changes he brought in his bowling action, Mithun said he has worked on wrist position and running into the wicket."I have made small changes like how I run into the wicket and my wrist position.(Sreenath) Aravind also helped me in this regard," he said.On his batting, Mithun said unlike in previous years, he has taken batting seriously and does not believe in throwing away his wicket."I really like batting.This Karnataka Premier League (KPL) went really well for me batting-wise.Whenever I get chance to bat, I don't throw away wickets like I did in previous seasons.That is why I am batting well," he said.

Kuldeep Yadav: Frustrated after non-selection, Kuldeep Yadav thought of committing suicide:::::NEW DELHI: Kuldeep Yadav might be Indian cricket team 's latest rising star but there was a dark phase in his life when he thought of giving up cricket and commit suicide.In a short span, Kuldeep, a chinaman bowler, has tasted success early in his international career including becoming the third ever Indian bowler to claim an ODI hat-trick.He made his international debut in March this year, against Australia in Dharamsala Test, making an immediate impression.Since then, he has been a part of two Tests (9 wickets), 12 ODIs (19 wickets) and 5 T20Is (6 wickets).The extent of the impact he has made can be gauged from the fact that the likes of experienced spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja are finding it difficult to cement a regular spot in limited-overs cricket.But before the success, he had to endure failure at the age of 13 when selectors ignored him for Uttar Pradesh's under-15 team."I had worked hard for my selection, but when I was not picked, I mentioned suicide in frustration.It happens to everyone in the heat of the moment," he was quoted as saying by Hindustantimes.com.Kuldeep also revealed that he wanted to be a seam bowler but upon his coach's insistence turned to spin bowling."I always wanted to become a seam bowler, but my coach forced me to become a spinner.When I bowled a few balls (Chinaman), I was asked to make it a habit.Otherwise, I didn't know I was bowling something different," he said.The 22-year-old said that it was his father who coaxed him into taking cricket seriously."I was a meritorious student in school and wanted to play cricket just for fun.I never thought of making it my vocation.In fact, my father wanted me to play cricket and took me to the coach," he was quoted as saying.
Sunil Gavaskar: BCCI commentators may have to give up writing columns:::::MUMBAI: A few months ago, Sunil Gavaskar was forced to shut down his player management agency after the BCCI ruled that it conflicted with his role as a commentator contracted by the Board.Well, if the BCCI adopts the Lodha Committee 's recommendations on conflict of interest issues, the batting legend could be in for a bigger blow as he may be asked to choose between commentating for the BCCI, or writing sponsored columns and participate in sponsored awards/rating programs.According to the minutes of a meeting of the Committee of Administrators (CoA), which happened on October 24, the CoA has decided that "the contracts between the BCCI and its commentators should be examined to see if they permitted BCCI commentators to 1) write sponsored columns for newspapers, and or 2) participate in sponsored awards/ rating programmes."Apart from Gavaskar, the BCCI's other contracted commentators are former India cricketers Sanjay Manjrekar and Murali Kartik , and cricket expert Harsha Bhogle .Like Gavaskar, Manjrekar and Bhogle too write sponsored columns for newspapers, and eventually be asked to choose between that and commentary.Gavaskar is a cricket expert on a news channel, and is involved with a private firm which rates and awards cricketers."As per the Lodha Committee guidelines on conflict of interest, those employed with the BCCI can't have another source of income.We've become very strict with conflict of interest issues - recently, a physiotherapist with the Indian women's team had to quit her job because her brother is an official with a state association.The CoA will have a look at their contracts, but the final call on this issue will be taken by a Supreme Court-appointed Ombudsman, as and when he's appointed by the apex court," a top BCCI official told TOI on Sunday.Interestingly, this ruling, as and when it becomes applicable, won't apply to the Hindi commentators, since they are contracted with Star Sports, and not the BCCI.It means that batting greats VVS Laxman and Virender Sehwag can continue to write sponsored columns (Laxman) and air their views on private news channels (Sehwag).Before the India-Australia series in March this year, the Board had sent out conflict of interest guidelines to its commentators, but it's learnt that they were "old," and not as per the Lodha report.For now, though, the BCCI commentators have a reason to rejoice as their "dearness allowance" has been increased from Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 a day.The Board has also decided to send the conflict of interest disclosure forms, which had earlier been sent to its staff, to the national selectors too.Another person who could be under the scanner for conflict of interest is the BCCI's acting president CK Khanna, who owns the Chand Khanna cricket club, affiliated to the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA), in Delhi.It should be noted here that former Hyderabad opener MV Sridhar, who expired recently, had to quit as GM cricket operations after he failed to disclose income from the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) due to his cricket clubs in Hyderabad.The CoA has approved the release of Rs 25 lakhs each to the cricket associations of Mumbai, Bengal and Punjab for winning the "best pitch and ground award" for the 2017 IPL.Atits meeting on November 2, the CoA has decided that from now on, both the senior India men's and women's teams, along with their respective head coaches, will only be booked in "business class" while traveling by air.The decision was taken after the Board's acting president, CK Khanna, wrote a mail to the CoA asking for the same for Virat Kohli & Co.Recently, the Indian team had complained to the Board about being mobbed by fans while travelling in 'economy class,' during flights, and thus wanted its status upgraded.To provide further boost to the Indian women's cricket team, the Board has decided to hire a physiotherapist and trainer on a contractual basis, like it's done in the case of the men's team, at the National Cricket Academy (NCA).The side will be accompanied on all tours by a permanent manager, who will be recruited in the same way (bringing out an ad mentioning, among other qualities, minimum number of years of cricketing experience) that was used to hire Sunil Subramaniam for the men's side.After hearing the claims of all the three parties who claimed to represent cricket in Pondicherry, the CoA has decided to grant associate membership to the Cricket Association of Pondicherry.
England v Brazil: Rashford reveals Ronaldo inspiration ahead of Brazil game:::::Watching Brazilian striker Ronaldo score a Champions League hat-trick for Real Madrid against Manchester United 14 years ago provided a lasting inspiration for Marcus Rashford , the England forward said on Monday.Speaking before England host Brazil in a friendly at Wembley on Tuesday, Rashford said he was a five-year-old spectator at Old Trafford when Real knocked United out 6-5 on aggregate in the quarter-finals.After the game, he and his brother Dwaine began scouring YouTube for clips of the Brazilian."It's all those clips ...and my first ever game that I saw live, he was playing in it.I always remember it.It was in 2003 and he scored a hat-trick," Rashford, who has netted seven times for United in all competitions this season, told British media."Rashford came in for high praise from Ronaldo in the build-up to last year's European championships, when the Brazilian World Cup winner said the 20-year-old Englishman reminded him of his younger self."He was my brother's favourite player - that's why I've grown up watching so much of him and his games...So when you know he's saying good things about you then it really stands out," Rashford said.England, who won eight of their 10 World Cup qualifying games and were unbeaten in Group F, held world champions Germany to a goalless draw in a friendly on Friday.
Dokic: Dokic claims her father physically, verbally, emotionally abused her:::::SYDNEY: Former Wimbledon semifinalist Jelena Dokic says her father physically, verbally and emotionally abused her from a young age when she started playing tennis.In an autobiography to be released this week, the 34-year-old Dokic says that Damir Dokic , who also was her coach, regularly beat her, pulled her hair and ears, kicked her and even spat in her face.She said her father also frequently directed vile insults toward her."He beat me really badly," the former No.4-ranked Dokic was quoted as saying in Sydney's Sunday Telegraph."It basically started day one of me playing tennis.It continued on from there.It spiraled out of control."After losing to Lindsay Davenport in the Wimbledon semifinals in 2000, at the age of 17, Dokic said her father refused to acknowledge her following the match and when she finally reached him on the telephone, he told her not to return to the hotel where the family was staying.She said she was distressed and attempted to sleep in the player area at Wimbledon, before officials contacted her agents and arranged for her stay with them.Excerpts from the book and a video interview published in Australian newspapers generated wide debate about how the situation was allowed to continue throughout Dokic's teenage years.Tennis Australia released a statement praising Dokic's courage in exposing the abuse, and responded to local media questions about why it didn't intervene by saying an official had taken the matter to the authorities."There were many in tennis at the time who were concerned for Jelena 's welfare, and many who tried to assist with what was a difficult family situation," Tennis Australia's statement said."Some officials even went as far as lodging police complaints, which without cooperation from those directly involved, unfortunately could not be fully investigated."Tennis Australia said over the past 10 years the sport had constantly improved and updated its police to increase protection for children.Damir Dokic is living in Serbia and had no comment for Australian media regarding the book.At the time, Jelena Dokic was playing at her peak, the WTA had a rule banning disruptive family members or coaches from attending tournaments.Damir Dokic was eventually banned indefinitely from all WTA Tour events after a series of public indiscretions, including accusing Australian Open organizers of fixing the 2001 tournament draw.Damir Dokic also spent time in jail for threatening the life of the Australian ambassador to Belgrade and illegally possessing weapons.He was suspended at times from other tournaments including the U.S. Open, where he was banned in 2000 for abusing staff over the price of a salmon lunch, and at Wimbledon, where he smashed a journalist's phone.Jelena Dokic started playing tennis at age eight.Her family migrated in 1994 from Europe to Australia, where Jelena trained in Sydney under her father's coaching.In 1998, she won the U.S. Open junior title and played Fed Cup for Australia, and in 1989 she beat Martina Hingis in the opening round of Wimbledon, becoming the lowest-ranked player in the Open era to beat a top seed at a Grand Slam.She switched allegiances at her father's insistence to represent Serbia in 2001, following allegations by her father that the draw for the 2001 Australian Open was rigged against her.But she returned to represent Australia from 2006.After reaching a career-high No.4 ranking in 2002, Dokic's ranking slipped into the 600s as she struggled with injuries and depression.But in 2009, she made a surprising run to the Australian Open quarterfinals as a wild-card entry and said she'd been estranged from her father for several years.She retired in 2012 with five titles in the top tier of women's tennis, but having never surpassed her 2000 success in a major.Dokic has been quoted as saying the physical violence was regular from her father but she struggled most with the emotional element of the relationship."Not just the physical pain but the emotional ... that was the one what hurt me the most," she said."When you are 11, 12 years old and hear all those nasty things ... that was more difficult for me."

Ive missed this event too many times in my career, added the Spaniard who has been plagued by knee injuries throughout his career.Nadal, who was hobbling around the court for much of the third set of his contest against Goffin, qualified for the season ending tournament for the 13th successive year but withdrew before the start on five previous occasions.Mondays withdrawal means the 31-year-old, who claimed the French and U.S. Open trophies this year to increase his grand slam haul to 16 titles, has yet to win the season-ending tournament.I was not enjoying it (out there today) so it was no fun to play like this.But I had an unforgettable season, he added.
Goffin puts Nadal out of his misery, Dimitrov wins:::::LONDON (Reuters) - The spirit was as strong as ever but Rafael Nadals troublesome knee failed him in the end as the Spaniard quit the ATP Finals after a painful defeat by Belgiums David Goffin on Monday.Tennis - ATP World Tour Finals - The O2 Arena, London, Britain - November 13, 2017 Bulgarias Grigor Dimitrov in action during his group stage match against Austrias Dominic Thiem REUTERS/Hannah McKay Nadal, at 31 the oldest player to finish a year ranked number one, fought until the last point, saving four match points in a compelling Pete Sampras Group clash, before losing 7-6(5) 6-7(4) 6-4 in two hours and 37 minutes.World number eight Goffin, the first player from Belgium to qualify for the year-ending tournament in its 48-year history, was a bundle of nerves at times but finally steadied himself to put Nadal out of his misery with his 14th ace.Nadal could be seen grimacing as the match wore on, especially when he was forced wide or low, but he still managed to scrap his way back from 4-1 down in the decider, despite apparently playing on one leg.Minutes after defeat, the 16-times grand slam champion told reporters that he was pulling out of the tournament.My season is finished.I had a commitment with the event, with the city, with myself.I tried hard.I did the thing that I had to do to try to be ready to play, Nadal, whose right knee flared up at the recent Paris Masters, said.The Mallorcan, whose career has been plagued by tendonitis, made a stunning comeback from a wrist injury this year when he reached the Australian Open final, then claimed a 10th French Open title after a three-year grand slam drought.He then went on to win the U.S. Open and reclaim the worlds top ranking for the first time since 2014.I really believed that I dont deserve after this great season to spend two more days on court with this terrible feeling, thats all, said Nadal, who will now try to recover for the start of next season.NIMBLE BELGIAN Tennis - ATP World Tour Finals - The O2 Arena, London, Britain - November 13, 2017 Bulgarias Grigor Dimitrov (R) shakes the hand of Austrias Dominic Thiem after their group stage match REUTERS/Hannah McKay Goffin completed a great day for first-time qualifiers after Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov prevailed in a superb tussle with Austrian Dominic Thiem at the 02 Arena.It was a shame that his first win against a world number one was overshadowed by Nadals misfortune because the nimble Belgian thoroughly deserved his win, even if he nearly blew it.Its the best win of my career, Goffin, who will lead Belgium in the David Cup final against France, said.It was tough even if he was not moving 100 percent.Goffin was the better player throughout.He broke Nadals serve twice in the first set, only to hand back the advantage on both occasions with lame double-faults.Slideshow (5 Images) A crunching forehand winner at 5-5 in the tiebreak earned him a set point and Nadal then dumped a backhand into the net.Another clean winner gave him a 5-3 lead in the second set but again he double-faulted when serving for the match.His first match point arrived in the next game but he missed a forehand.Goffin had three more when Nadal served at 5-6, 0-40 but the Spaniard produced two magical winners to stay alive before rolling through the tiebreak.Goffin broke twice to take control of the decider and withstood Nadals last stand to claim victory.Earlier Dimitrov beat Thiem 6-3 5-7 7-5 in the so-called battle of the backhands despite some late jitters.The world number six served for the match at 5-4 in the decider but was broken to love before two consecutive double faults by Thiem gave him another chance to close it out.Again Dimitrov wobbled, squandering two match points at 40-15 with a double-fault and a tight forehand error, but he finally bagged the win when Thiem looped a backhand long.
First U.S. trial opens in FIFA corruption probe:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers defending three former soccer officials at trial on U.S. corruption charges strove to distance their clients from a scandal that has engulfed the sport as they delivered opening statements to jurors on Monday.Former head of Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) Jose Maria Marin, arrives for opening arguments of the FIFA bribery trial at the Brooklyn Federal Courthouse in New York, U.S., November 13, 2017.REUTERS/Darren Ornitz Juan ngel Napout, formerly president of the South American soccer governing body CONMEBOL and Paraguays soccer federation, Manuel Burga, former president of Perus soccer federation and Jos Maria Marin, the former president of Brazils soccer federation are on trial in federal court in Brooklyn.The three men are the first to stand trial since U.S. prosecutors unveiled a corruption case against soccer officials around the world more than two years ago.Of 42 people charged by U.S. prosecutors in the FIFA probe, 24 have pleaded guilty and two have been sentenced so far.Assistant U.S. Attorney Keith Edelman told jurors that the three men were part of a conspiracy to take bribes from sports marketing companies in exchange for lucrative marketing rights to soccer tournaments, including the Copa America and Copa Libertadores.The defendants cheated the sport in order to line their pockets with money that should have been spent to benefit the game, not themselves, Edelman said.The money they pocketed could have been spent by soccer organizations to build fields, buy equipment and fund womens teams and youth leagues, he said.Former head of Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) Jose Maria Marin, arrives for opening arguments of the FIFA bribery trial at the Brooklyn Federal Courthouse in New York, U.S., November 13, 2017.REUTERS/Darren Ornitz None of the lawyers for the former officials denied that there was corruption in international soccer, but all told jurors that their clients had not taken part.This case is not about FIFA, said Napouts lawyer, Silvia Pinera.Its about one man, Juan Angel Napout, and his fight for justice.Slideshow (4 Images) Pinera told jurors that the case against Napout would rely on testimony from Alejandro Burzaco, the former head of sports marketing company Torneos y Competencias.Burzaco, she said, cut a sweetheart deal with the government and began telling stories after he was indicted.Burgas lawyer, Bruce Udolf, also said he expected prosecutors to rely on cooperating witnesses who might be motivated to get pretty doggone creative to avoid prison.Marins lawyer, Charles Stillman, likened corruption in international soccer to a childrens soccer game in which Marin did not participate.He was kind of like the youngster standing off to the side, picking up daisies and looking around while others are running full steam ahead, Stillman said.
Stunned Italy fail to reach World Cup as Sweden qualify:::::MILAN (Reuters) - Italian football boss Carlo Tavecchio said recently that failure to qualify for the World Cup would be the apocalypse and his worst fears came true on Monday as they missed out on the finals for the first time in 60 years.Soccer Football - 2018 World Cup Qualifications - Europe - Italy vs Sweden - San Siro, Milan, Italy - November 13, 2017 Italy players look dejected after the match REUTERS/Max Rossi A desperate 0-0 draw at home to a defiant, belligerent and technically inferior Sweden ended the four-time world champions hopes of reaching next years finals in Russia and with it the international careers of several of Italys biggest names.The Swedes, whose starting lineup included only four players based with teams in Europes so-called big five leagues, will take their place after qualifying for the first time since 2006.Italys 1-0 aggregate defeat in their European playoff, after Jakob Johanssons deflected strike in Stockholm, is likely to go down alongside elimination by North Korea at the 1966 World Cup as one of their greatest football debacles.The Italians have only failed to qualify for the tournament once before - missing out on the 1958 finals in Sweden - after not entering the first World Cup in 1930.The players sank to their knees as the final whistle went, the starkest possible contrast to the Swedish joy, knowing that the match will leave an indelible stain on their careers.It was also the tear-jerking end to the career of their 39-year-old goalkeeper and captain Gianluigi Buffon who made his Italy debut 20 years ago against Russia - on the last occasion that Italy had to face a playoff for a World Cup place.LAST GAME Its upsetting that my last Italy game coincides with our elimination for the World Cup, said Buffon, a World Cup winner in 2006.Thats my only regret, because time goes by and its cruel but thats how it is.Sport teaches you to lose and win as a group and share joy and pain.The coach has the same degree of blame as us.Daniele De Rossi, Italys fearsome bearded midfielder who was surprisingly left on the bench on Monday, also announced his international retirement at 34 after 117 appearances.Soccer Football - 2018 World Cup Qualifications - Europe - Italy vs Sweden - San Siro, Milan, Italy - November 13, 2017 Sweden celebrate after the match REUTERS/Alessandro Garofalo Defenders Giorgio Chiellini and Andrea Barzagli are almost certain to follow suit.However, Gian Piero Ventura, at 69 the oldest coach Italy has ever had, refused to confirm that he would step down, saying he needed to talk to the federation first.Ventura made four changes to the team which lost 1-0 in Stockholm on Friday in the first leg and which was fiercely criticized for its lack of flair in attack.Brazilian-born midfielder Jorginho was thrust into his first competitive international while Napolis flamboyant winger Lorenzo Insigne was once again on the bench.Slideshow (12 Images) POOR FINISHING After a scrappy opening 20 minutes, Italy took control and pressed forward in waves.They had penalty appeals turned down and were repeatedly denied by outstanding Sweden goalkeeper Robin Olsen but were also let down by some desperately poor finishing and final passes, possibly born of desperation.As the game wore on, Italys moves became more rushed and their passing increasingly sloppy and the clear-cut chances dried up.There is likely to be some long and deep soul-searching once the dust has settled as Italians wonder how it all came to this.I absolutely apologize for the result but not for the effort we put in or our desire to win, said Ventura, whose deadpan style could not be further removed from the high-energy approach of his predecessor Antonio Conte.His opposite number Jan Andersson admitted his side had to cling on to their first-leg lead.We had no weapons left.We just had to sit there and hope that we could hang on, he said.We couldnt do it in any other way, they are so skilful.

Former Star Pitcher Halladay Killed in Florida Plane Crash:::::Roy Halladay, a former pitching great for the Philadelphia Phillies, died when the small plane he was piloting crashed into the Gulf of Mexico off Florida.Legendary Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Roy Halladay has died in a plane crash, according to officials.He was 40.Halladay's ICON A5 plane went down just after noon in the Gulf of Mexico near Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday.It landed upside down in shallow water about a quarter mile west of Ben Pilot Point in New Port Richey, Florida, the Pasco County Sheriff's Office said.No Mayday calls were made to Tampa Air Traffic Control and the 911 call came in at 12:06 p.m., officials said.The sheriff's office marine unit along with Pasco Fire Rescue and the Coast Guard responded to the downed plane and found Halladay's body.No one else was on board the plane.Photo credit: WFLA "We recovered one body," Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco announced late Tuesday afternoon."It's a two-passenger plane but I can confirm that only one body is involved.And it's sad to say it's a friend of ours.It's Roy Halladay."Police haven't revealed where the plane was headed.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the crash.The ICON A5 is a two-person, single engine amphibian plane.Since retiring to Florida with his wife and two children, Halladay had picked up flying as a hobby, posting just last month about his joy of buying an ICON A5 aircraft.ICON aircraft had posted a video with Halladay trying out the ICON A5.In the video, Halladay said the terms of his baseball contract prevented him from having a pilot's license while playing, and that his wife was originally against the idea of him getting the aircraft."She's fought me the whole way," Halladay said."Hard.I fought hard.I was very against it,'' Brandy Halladay said in the same video, before explaining why she eventually understood and approved of her husband's desire to have the plane.Halladay had donated money to purchase a K9 for the Pasco County Sheriff's Office."We are grateful and blessed to have known this incredible friend," the Pasco County Sheriff's Office said in a statement."Our thoughts and prayers are with Roy's family."MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred called Halladay a well-respected figure and fierce competitor during his 16-year career in a statement expressing his sadness and condolences to Halladays family.Halladay, known as "Doc," pitched four seasons with the Phillies before retiring after injuries cut short his 2013 season.He won the 2010 National League Cy Young Award and pitched a perfect game while winning 21 games in his first season with the Phillies.He went on to pitch a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds in the 2010 divisional series.In Memoriam: MLB Star Pitcher Halladay Dies in Plane Crash He started his career with the Toronto Blue Jays, winning the 2003 American League Cy Young Award, before he was traded to the Phillies ahead of the 2010 season."We are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladays untimely death," the Phillies said in a statement."There are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game.It is with the heaviest of hearts that we pass along our condolences to Brandy, Ryan and Braden."The Toronto Blue Jays also released a statement on Halladay, writing the organization is "overcome by grief with the tragic loss of one of the franchises greatest and most respected players, but even better human being."Former Phillies pitcher and former teammate Cole Hamels spoke about the impact Halladay had on him during a press conference early Tuesday evening."He was a man of few words," Hamels said."But you just sat back and you just watched him and you watched what he did.I have two boys of my own and I got to see what that meant to him every time he was able to bring them around the ball park.That was something that really did leave an impression and hopefully I'll be able to do what he was able to do for his boys."News of Halladay's death led to many reactions from fans, former teammates, opponents, athletes from other sports, celebrities and politicians.

Dodger Yasiel Puig's Home Burglarized on Night of World Series Loss:::::While coming to terms with the loss of the World Series, Yasiel Puig takes another loss after finding out his home was broken into.Patrick Healy reports for NBC4 News on Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017.(Published Friday, Nov. 3, 2017) A San Fernando Valley home owned by Dodger Yasiel Puig was burglarized on the same night Los Angeles' dreams of its first World Series title in 29 years were dashed at Dodger Stadium.The break-in occurred shortly after Game 7 of the World Series, a disappointing 5-1 loss to Houston.A window at the address was smashed and items were taken, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.Police responded to the address after a burglary alarm was activated.Puig was likely at Dodger Stadium at the time.He was 0-for-3 at the plate in Wednesday night's loss.TMZ reported that jewelry was taken from the Mediterranean-style villa in Encino's Amestoy Estates, which Puig recently bought for $2.65 million.Security cameras captured the crime, according to TMZ.The home is not the same one owned by Puig that was burglarized in March.About $500,00 worth of jewelry was taken in the March burglary, which occurred when Puig was away at spring training.A string of burglaries have been reported in recent months targeting celebrities in the Hollywood and Beverly Hills area, including Alanis Morissette, Nicki Minaj, Emmy Rossum, Jaime Pressly, David Spade, Puig, and former Lakers Nick Young, Byron Scott and Derek Fisher.In March, a burglary was reported at the family home of Lakers star rookie Lonzo Ball.
It Can Take a Mountain of Money to Raise a Winter Olympian:::::American ice dancing duo Rachel and Michael Parsons, left, and snowboarder Mike Trapp.They've all spent tens of thousands of dollars a year on training as they vie to go to the Olympics.The rewards for competing in the Olympics this winter in Pyeongchang are largely symbolic for the vast majority of athletes who won't win medals or sign lucrative endorsement deals.And the financial strain their years of training puts on their families can hit hard."Its a daunting challenge," said Richard Parsons, whose two eldest children are the reigning U.S. and world junior ice dance champions.Rachel and Michael Parsons' win at the 2017 World Junior Figure Skating Championships in Taiwan this year marked a milestone in their quest to compete at the 2022 Olympics if not sooner, should they clinch the spot as alternates for Team USA at the 2018 Games.Once theyve qualified for the Olympics, athletes flights, accommodations, food and training are paid for by the United States Olympic Committee.But getting to that point?That's on the athletes, and often their families.Olympic Hopefuls Gear Up for Winter Games American Olympic hopefuls are doing everything they can to be ready for the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang.(Published Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017) The cost of the Parsons' 12-year journey thus far has been over $500,000, to cover the ice time, coaching, choreography, dance classes, costumes, ice skates, registration fees and travel expenses necessary to help Rachel and Michael compete at the elite level on the international stage, their dad said."When they were starting out, it was just a thousand or two a year early on.Then it started ramping up steadily as they started competing nationally and then internationally," Richard Parsons said, noting the annual expenses increased from an average of $40,000 a year to $75,000 last year.And the Maryland family is not an outlier in how much it spends eye-popping expenses are par for the course for most Olympians.Parsons said some teams in their sport spend more than $100,000 a year to train at the elite level.Mike Trapp, the 2011 and 2012 U.S. snowboarding champion, said an average season training costs about $35,000 in equipment, coaching and traveling expenses.It's more expensive in a year leading up to the Olympics.The native of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, is training in Italy ahead of World Cup qualifiers in December and January.In order to score a spot on the U.S. Olympic team, Trapp needs to finish in the top three in one of five events taking place in Italy, Austria and Slovenia.It took nearly two decades of training and discipline, plus hundreds of thousands of dollars, just for Trapp to reach the cusp of Olympic selection.Rachel and Michael Parsons.Photo credit: Daphne Backman/Ice-dance.com FUNDING THE 'A TEAM' The United States is one of the only countries with an Olympic committee that is not supported through funding from the federal government.The separation was established in 1978 with the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, which gave sole control over Americas representation in the games to the USOC and the various sports' national governing bodies under the committee.Under this legislation, the USOC has complete control over the intellectual property associated with the Olympic Games, giving it exclusive distribution rights over logos and other licensing material.The autonomy also means the USOC is responsible for raising and allocating all of the funding needed for the U.S. to compete in the Olympics and Paralympics.It does this through trademark licensing, corporate sponsors and broadcast revenue.Some of the money is also distributed to various sports' national governing bodies to help fund athlete development.Richard Parsons said that once his kids made the jump to the junior level in ice dancing they began receiving support from the U.S.Figure Skating Association, which helped offset some of their costs.The money is allocated based on performance, or "likelihood that an athlete will win a medal," according to Team USA spokesman Mark Jones.This pay-for-performance model leaves some organizations struggling to support their athletes.Olympians Try Korean Snacks In preparation for the Olympic Winter Games, NBC gave Team USA some of the most popular Korean snacks to see what they thought of them.(Published Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017) "U.S.Ski and Snowboard can only fund the A team," Trapp said.As a B team member, Trapp, who moonlights as a mechanic during his summers, has had to foot the bill for his training."I'm doing this all on my own dime," he said."That job keeps the dream alive."The A team is fully funded in the U.S. ski teams budget, which allocates about $100,000 per athlete annually, according to U.S.Ski President Tiger Shaw."But theres a $2 million funding gap in paying for travel costs for B and C team athletes."Members of the B and C teams are billed $15,000 to $20,000 at the beginning of each season to close the gap.Shaw acknowledged that is a significant amount of money, but the only other option, he said, is to cut half the team.He said the organization works with the athletes to help them find sources of revenue.EXPENSIVE SCHOOLING Like many elite athletes competing in snowsports, Trapp attended a ski academy during his formative school years, albeit part-time.From sixth to 11th grade, Trapp transferred out of his regular school curriculum for part of the year to train at Waterville Valley Academy in New Hampshire, where tuition for a three-month season cost $15,000, not including equipment and race fees.That figure pales in comparison to the $55,000 tuition Olympic gold medalist Mikaela Shiffrin paid to attend Burke Mountain Academy in Vermont full-time.Olympic Torch Lighting Starts Relay to Pyeongchang Games The torch for the 2018 Winter Olympics was lit among the ruins of Olympia, Greece, marking the start of its 100-day journey to the Pyeongchang Games.Skier Apostolos Aggelis, of Greece, was the first torch-bearer.(Published Monday, Oct. 30, 2017) Shiffrin was born in Vail, Colorado, "an epic ski town," she told NBC.Both her parents and her older brother are skiers, and they grew up with skiing as their "family recreational sport."She recalled starting out in a kids' "Fresh Tracks" training program by age 5.When it came time for high school, the prodigy who was already winning races opted for a ski academy.She gained entrance to one of the country's most exclusive ski academies, where Shiffrin trained for hours each day, learning "a lot about time management" and "being responsible."Shiffrin went on to claim gold in the slalom in Sochi.But it's not just expensive to attend an exclusive training program.To even be considered for admission to an elite ski school, applicants usually need a solid foundation in skiing and a resume of winning races."You had to apply and get in, and part of that process obviously is showing your skiing resume you couldnt just be a beginner," said Gordy Megroz, a graduate of Stratton Mountain School in Vermont.And though some ski schools offer junior classes for skill-development training, "realistically youd need to live within four or five hours of the ski area to be able to get to practice, races and lessons," said Megroz, highlighting the geographical difficulties some aspiring athletes face.He learned to ski growing up in Vermont, he said, by standing on his father's and grandfather's skis when he was as young as 2 years old.He started competing when he was 10.His parents drove him to races on weekends."You have to pay for everything from season passes to equipment to race fees," Megroz said."Its certainly an expensive sport no disputing that.People who get into ski racing probably are pretty affluent."Former U.S.Ski Team coach and co-founder of the alpine skiing World Cup, Robert "Bob" Beattie, said the cost of ski racing is pricing out talent who have no income and "killing our sport.""We're only getting kids with money," Beattie said in a March interview with the Aspen Times."Kids like Billy Kidd, Jimmie Heuga and Buddy Werner would never be ski racers now.They could never afford it.Their parents didn't have that kind of money."Kidd and Huega became the first American men to win Olympic medals in skiing, taking silver and bronze respectively in the slalom at the 1964 Games.'WE'VE HAD TO MAKE A LOT OF SACRIFICES' Chasing the Olympic dream is a risky venture, and for most families, raising an Olympic athlete is a tremendous investment with no guarantee of a monetary return.Many Olympians are young, and a lot of their expenses are covered by their parents.The average Olympic hopeful will train for a decade or more.And with athletes devoting more than six hours a day, six days a week to training, there isn't much room for a part-time job or career.Team USA Concerned About N. Korea, But Trusts USOC With tensions high between North Korea and the U.S., how do Olympic hopefuls feel about traveling to South Korea for the 2018 Olympic Winter Games?(Published Friday, Oct. 27, 2017) Michael Parsons, now 22, began skating at age 7, and sister Rachel Parsons, 19, at age 6.Their parents credit the Wheaton Ice Skating Academy, a Maryland rink run by Russian ice dancing champions Alexei Kiliakov and Elena Novak, for making the endeavor affordable in the early years by offering classes in group sessions, which are less expensive than private lessons.But as their kids began moving up the ranks, they required more training, fresh routines, new costumes and more money.And just as they were taking off on the world stage, the 2008 recession hit and Richard Parsons was laid off from his job by 2009."We've had to make a lot of sacrifices.We're just a middle class family and we've had to be very creative, especially with two," Parsons said, noting the family doesn't take vacations, he and his wife drive older-model, well-worn cars and they don't shop for new clothes.Team USA speedskater Emily Scott made headlines in 2013 when she applied for food stamps while training for the Olympics after her monthly stipend from the U.S.Speed Skating Federation got cut from $1,950 to $600.Scott turned to crowdfunding site GoFundMe for help, ultimately flying to Sochi thanks to thousands of strangers.Like many athletes vying for the Olympics, Trapp and the Parsons have also turned to crowdfunding to raise the money needed to fund their goals.Even entire teams and national sports organizations are turning to sites like Rallyme and Dreamfuel to help foot the bill to prepare for the Winter Games.But despite all the hardships, Richard Parsons said Rachel and Michael have gotten so much out of the experience that "I wouldn't change it for the world."Click here to support Team Parsons or here to support Mike Trapp.NBC's Emilie Mutert contributed to this report.

Jerry Jones' attorney, in letter, says owners being misled about Roger Goodell contract negotiations:::::An attorney for Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said NFL owners are being misled about negotiations on a contract extension for commissioner Roger Goodell, according to a letter that was sent to the league's counsel and shared with team owners and executives.A copy of the letter was obtained by ESPN.In a 24-hour period, Jones and the league have accused each other of misleading allegations, and Jones has threatened to file a lawsuit if Goodell's contract extension is completed without final review or approval from the league's 32 teams.On Saturday night, Jones was terminated as a non-voting, ad-hoc member of the league's compensation committee by committee chairman Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons.Blank cited Jones' expressed intent to sue the league and members of the committee during a Nov. 2 committee conference call as a reason for his action.In a letter sent late Wednesday by Cowboys general counsel Jason Cohen to owners on the compensation committee and to Brad Karp, the league's outside counsel retained for this matter, Jones claimed he "has discovered a number of very concerning issues" while engaged as a committee member, including that "the Ownership [sic] and Jerry Jones now understand that they have been unquestionably misled" by Blank and that "critical facts" have been misrepresented regarding Goodell's contract.The letter, which was copied to all NFL owners, alleges that Blank told owners, including Jones, on numerous occasions that the six-man committee's recommendation would be unanimous.Two ownership sources, however, said the committee is not currently unanimous on Goodell's contract, which is in its final stages.Jones' letter alleges Blank backed off his word that there would be "unanimity" on the committee before the extension was finalized.?Cohen copied all owners on the letter despite a warning sent Saturday by Karp to Jones to refrain from communicating directly with the committee or any other owners as it pertains to Goodell's contract, a league source said.An owner source, who claims to be "on the fence" regarding the dispute, provided a copy of the correspondence to ESPN.It was verified by two other sources.The tone of the letter paints a specific conflict between Jones and Blank under the larger context of negotiations and league protocol."Commissioner Goodell's contract extension is a substantial commitment by the Owners, as more than $200 million is at stake, on top of the $200 million already paid to him," the letter states."This is in addition to the unique and largely unfettered power exercised by the Commissioner.Ownership can't have the Chairman let us down again."Jones said in the letter that the compensation committee's consultants called Goodell's previous contract "the most one-sided deal they have ever seen."His current contract expires at the end of 2018, and the contract extension is proposed through 2024.Jones also alleges in the letter that he has discovered a discretionary bonus plan that was not fully explained to ownership in a working contract proposal that includes less guaranteed compensation for Goodell.A source said that Blank has assured Goodell he would be able to make at least the same $40 million he has been paid on average under the 2012 deal.Jones believes other owners would object if they knew the discretionary bonuses that appear as incentives have been presented to Goodell as such a certainty even though Blank has told owners he would review it annually.The bonus plan, per the source, does not provide clear accountability for decline in TV ratings that could impact future broadcast-rights fees, a reduction in sponsorships and a further-damaged league image due to "sloppy" oversight in controversial matters, among other issues.Blank was traveling Thursday and referred reaction to the league office.Jones was unavailable for comment.Sources said Jones repeatedly complained that Goodell retained Blank as compensation committee chairman because of the "one-sided" contract previously negotiated.Goodell was elected commissioner in 2006, and his contract was extended in 2012 by Blank's previous committee, which included Robert Kraft (New England), Tom Benson (New Orleans), Pat Bowlen (Denver), Jerry Richardson (Carolina) and Stephen Ross (Miami).In the letter, Jones said he discovered Goodell's original contract "lacks market-standard employment terms and conditions."The current compensation committee now includes Blank, Kraft, Bob McNair (Houston), Clark Hunt (Kansas City), John Mara (New York Giants) and Art Rooney II (Pittsburgh).Jones also maintained in his response that a unanimous vote in May, which authorized the committee to complete Goodell's extension, does not negate a requirement under the league's constitution that requires all 32 teams to vote on the final contract.The NFL's Karp replied to Cohen's letter Thursday, a league source said.Karp called Jones' response without merit, the source said, and stated it was inconsistent with a unanimous resolution that authorized the committee to finalize Goodell's extension.Sources said Jones believes circumstances such as the player anthem controversy, further decline in TV ratings and sponsorship concerns have changed the league's dynamics and owners should be entitled to seek transparent contract details, as allowed by the May resolution.Jones has denied to other owners that he is motivated by the disciplinary action against Cowboys star running back?Ezekiel Elliott?and has reminded them that he raised the issue of transparency on Goodell's contract at the annual owners meetings in March, well before Elliott's six-game suspension was handed down.Karp also maintained Blank has been fully transparent with the other owners about the status of the negotiations with Goodell, the source said.The league's counsel refuted claims Jones made about the substance of Goodell's proposed extension, saying the Cowboys owner was either uninformed or deliberately misleading other owners, the source added.Nevertheless, Jones is refusing to back down on the matter."The May resolution obviously did not, and could not, change that requirement, as only an amendment to the League's Constitution could change that requirement," the letter stated."Moreover, the minutes from the May meeting remain unratified."Jones portrayed the league as being in a state of "upheaval" under an "avalanche of issues that have beleaguered the NFL unlike any other time in recent memory.These changing conditions must be weighed relative to the timing of the Commissioner's contract extension."Two sources believe there are "about 15 owners" who want to review the details of any final proposal to Goodell before it is completed.?A league source countered with the belief that owners will now rally to support Blank over Jones on the issue.Jones' counsel, in his letter, wrote the primary goal of the Cowboys' owner is not to seek litigation but full transparency from Blank on terms that have been "harbored" from owners.Jones' letter said "necessary" changes to Goodell's proposal should be implemented.Absent those changes, Jones' words imply he will take legal action."Accordingly, Jerry Jones will continue to exercise his right to protect himself and the other Owners from the Committee Chairman's undertaking of a substantial financial commitment on behalf of the NFL without the Owner's vote,"

Smith said.The team was staying at a hotel near the arena but decided to take the subway back to the hotel due to traffic delays."We had two options," Kyle Korver said on James' video."A 45-minute bus ride or a six-minute train ride."A subway rider sitting next to James was visibly uncomfortable being filmed by the three-time NBA champ."Can you not?"the rider said as the camera panned on him before leaving his seat.As the Cavs were walking through Penn Station to the underground subway, one passerby said "KP gonna get y'all tonight" as he walked by James and his teammates.James and the Cavs play Kristaps Porzingis the Knicks on Monday night.James earlier caused a bit of a firestorm in New York when he said over the weekend that the Knicks should have drafted Mavericks guard Dennis Smith Jr.The Knicks took umbrage to the remarks on Sunday, perceiving them as a shot at Knicks rookie Frank Ntilikina, who was selected one spot ahead of Smith.James clarified those remarks on Monday, saying he didn't mean to "shade" Ntilikina but instead meant it as a shot at ex-Knicks team president Phil Jackson.The Metropolitan Transit Authority, an entity that runs New York City's subway system, had a little fun with James on the Cavs on its social media account:
Brian Cashman won't say Carlos Beltran has no chance to be Yanks' manager:::::NEW YORK -- New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman considers retired player Carlos Beltran a friend, a future Hall of Famer and a highly respected baseball person.Does he consider him a candidate to be the next Yankees manager?Possibly.Beltran, 40, told ESPN Deportes' Marly Rivera that he would be interested in interviewing for the team's managerial job.Cashman praised Beltran's attributes as a professional and mentioned that the past two Yankees managers -- Joe Girardi and Joe Torre -- basically went from playing to the top job in the dugout.?Torre was player/manager in 1977 with the Mets before retiring as a player to manage full time.Girardi finished playing in 2003, went into broadcasting for a few years, managed the Marlins for the 2006 season, was fired and went back to TV in 2007 before getting the Yankees job in 2008.In Cashman's mind, Beltran's lack of experience in the dugout does not sound like an immediate disqualifier."I am aware of his interest in managing in the future," Cashman said."I'll leave it at that for right now."The Yankees have already interviewed their bench coach from last year, Rob Thomson, and former Indians and Mariners manager Eric Wedge for the job.Sources told ESPN's Buster Olney that ESPN analyst Aaron Boone will receive an interview, while a source confirmed a New York Post report that Giants bench coach Hensley Meulens will be in the Bronx to meet with Cashman and other Yankee executives.Cashman is at the GM Meetings in Florida and will resume his interviews on Thursday.As a player with the Yankees in 2016, Beltran revealed his desire to manage.He reiterated that on Monday, saying he would welcome being interviewed by the Yankees."Well, one has to consider everything," Beltran told Rivera."I personally think that's a great job, a position with an incredible impact -- not only on players that I already had the opportunity to get to know, but to continue doing positive things.At the end of the day, yes.You have to listen, because it's not every day that there are vacancies available for managing in the major leagues.Just think of this, Joe Girardi was there for 10 years.You never know, there are opportunities that God gives us, and if I get an opportunity [to interview] I will not rule it out."Beltran played parts of three seasons in the Bronx from 2014-16, batting .270 with 56 homers and 180 RBIs.He retired Sunday after 20 years in the league, the most recent with the World Series champion Astros.Cashman has been in contact with Beltran over the past few weeks and was unsurprised by the news of his retirement."I've had a number of dialogues with Carlos and I that I would consider friendly," Cashman said."I think we have a personal and professional relationship.I know he has aspirations to manage.I'm not going to talk about who our potential candidates until we present those candidates to the media conference calls after the interviews go through."
Royals manager Ned Yost says fall from tree stand nearly proved fatal:::::Kansas City Royals manager Ned Yost said he nearly died a week ago when he fell from a tree and shattered his pelvis."After the surgery, the trauma doctor came in and ... said, 'Look, you guys don't know how lucky you are,'" Yost said in a conference call on Monday.'We've seen these things before -- this is a 25-30 percent mortality rate.You were crashing on the table.We couldn't get the bleeding stopped.I thought we were going to lose you.'"Yost, a hunter who has numerous tree stands on his property in Meriwether County, Georgia, was checking the safety straps on one of the stands on Nov. 4."I reached around to hook into the tree, and right as soon as I grabbed my strap to reach up to hook into the tree, it was like a hangman's gallow, the stand just let go -- down I went," Yost said."It was a massive fracture of the pelvis, and I'm glad to be alive."Yost, who was released from the hospital on Sunday, said he also fractured four ribs in the fall."There's no doubt I would have bled out if I didn't have my cellphone with me," he said."There was nobody that was coming.Nobody would have found me.I would have been dead by nightfall."Yost reached his wife by cell, and she sent Yost's son to find him.Within 20 minutes, a helicopter landed in the field where Yost fell, and he was airlifted to the hospital."Once I got to the hospital, they got me on the table, and all of a sudden I felt a shot -- the doctor had drilled a hole through my leg and through my bone and inserted a rod into it," Yost said."Then he put two 10-pound weights on each side of the rod for traction.Then they picked me up and put me in these compression pants -- it was so painful, I can't even tell you."I kept asking, 'What are you doing?'The trauma surgeon said, 'We got to do this to save your life.'I'm like, 'Save my life?What are you talking about?'What I didn't notice was that they kept giving me units of blood.They gave me seven or eight units of blood.They said, 'Look, your pelvis is full of blood vessels and arteries, and when you shatter it like you did, you have a lot of bleeding in there.We have to get it stopped.'"Yost says he will be in a wheelchair for at least two months, but he hopes to be moving better by spring training.
Oscar De La Hoya: 'Can take out Conor McGregor in two rounds':::::It remains to be seen whether Oscar De La Hoya is truly serious, but he said Monday he has been "secretly training" and called out UFC star Conor McGregor for his comeback fight after nearly a decade in retirement."You know I'm competitive," De La Hoya said."I still have it in me.I've been secretly training, secretly training.I'm faster than ever and stronger than ever.I know I can take out Conor McGregor in two rounds.I'll come back for that fight.Two rounds.Just one more [fight].I'm calling him out.Two rounds, that's all I need.That's all I'm going to say.You heard it on Golden Boy Radio.Two rounds, that's all I need."De La Hoya made the comments on "Golden Boy Radio with Tattoo and the Crew," a three-hour daily digital radio show that debuted Monday with De La Hoya as a featured guest.De La Hoya (39-6, 30 KOs) won a 1992 Olympic gold medal and 10 world titles in a then-record six weight divisions as a professional boxer.He was the biggest pay-per-view star of his time and was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2014.But De La Hoya has not fought since being savaged in a one-sided eighth-round knockout loss to Manny Pacquiao on Dec. 6, 2008.He retired shortly afterward, having lost three of his last five fights.De La Hoya, 44, did not specify a time frame in which he would be ready for his fantasy fight, but there is great irony in his mentioning McGregor, 29, of Ireland, who lost by 10th-round knockout when he crossed over from mixed martial arts for a boxing match against Floyd Mayweather, who came out of a two-year retirement for the junior middleweight megafight on Aug. 26 in Las Vegas.The Mayweather-McGregor bout sold more than 4 million pay-per-view units -- second all time to Mayweather-Pacquiao in 2015 -- according to Showtime.But De La Hoya spent much of the summer shredding the Mayweather-McGregor fight and encouraging sports fans not to buy it, in part because he was concerned it would have a negative impact on the middleweight world title fight between Gennady Golovkin and Canelo Alvarez that he was trying to sell on HBO PPV three weeks later.De La Hoya, now CEO of Golden Boy Promotions, went so far as to pen an open letter to boxing fans slamming the Mayweather-McGregor fight.He called it a "circus" and a "farce" and claimed that if it happened, "Our sport might not ever recover."De La Hoya further denigrated Mayweather-McGregor as nothing more than a money grab, which is how many would also view a De La Hoya-McGregor bout.McGregor remains under contract to UFC.He said after the loss to Mayweather that he would consider all of his options, both in boxing and MMA, although there have been talks about his next fight being inside the Octagon and not a boxing ring."I don't want to speak for him, but he's in shape and I'm sure he has been thinking about it," Eric Gomez, De La Hoya's best friend since childhood and president of Golden Boy Promotions, told ESPN of a possible De La Hoya comeback."The itch is there, has been for a long time."Another person close to De La Hoya told ESPN that De La Hoya is in fact seriously considering a return to the ring, even if it's not to fight McGregor.De La Hoya said if somehow a fight with McGregor could be made, it would be as a boxing match.De La Hoya said he has no intention of going into the cage for an MMA bout."Let's get it straight: In the cage, he would freaking destroy me.He would freaking destroy me.Only in the ring," De La Hoya said."I've been working out for the last five months.[My confidence] is how I feel now from my training.I don't know what it is, but I'll tell you now that I've never felt so good before in my life."De La Hoya has battled drug and alcohol addiction, has been to rehabilitation multiple times and currently faces charges stemming from a DUI arrest earlier in the year.But De La Hoya said in Monday's interview that he is doing well now."Every day just keeps getting better.Life is good," De La Hoya said."Life is a struggle; life is hard.It's not all peaches and cream, but life is life and you have to think about the solution of what you have to do to keep walking."This is not the first time De La Hoya has publicly toyed with the idea of coming of out of retirement.In June 2015, De La Hoya told ESPN he was considering a return to the ring."It's got to be worth my while, but this is very serious," De La Hoya said at the time, mentioning a desire to face either Golovkin or have a rematch with Mayweather, who outpointed him in a 2007 fight that set the since-surpassed pay-per-view record."I have to make sure I am fighting the very best.I don't have to come back for financial reasons or the lights or the glamour.The only reason I would come back is because I miss the competition of fighting the very best."Soon after, De La Hoya said he would remain in retirement.
Judge, Bellinger unanimous picks as Rookies of the Year:::::The only major question was whether it would be unanimous and it was.Aaron Judge and Cody Bellinger are baseball's Rookies of the Year for 2017 after their record-setting home run binges eliminated any reasonable competition for the honors.Judge led the American League with 52 homers, the most ever by a rookie.Bellinger hit 39 and had to settle for the National League's rookie record.Judge and Bellinger received every first-place vote available from the Baseball Writers' Association of America.Judge became the first New York Yankees player to receive this award since Derek Jeter in 1996.Bellinger gave the Dodgers a record 18th Rookie of the Year winner.Boston outfielder Andrew Benintendi finished second in the AL vote, followed by Baltimore slugger Trey Mancini.St. Louis infielder Paul DeJong was the NL runner-up, with Pittsburgh first baseman Josh Bell finishing third.Judge is also a finalist for the MVP award.Ichiro Suzuki in 2001 and Fred Lynn in 1975 are the only players to win the AL MVP and Rookie of the Year awards in the same season.The Yankees entered this season with marginal expectations by their standards, but the prodigious power of Judge and catcher Gary Sanchez transformed them almost overnight into an exciting young team with tremendous potential.Judge's 495-foot shot on June 11 was the longest home run in the major leagues this season, according to Statcast.Although he struck out 208 times in the regular season and 27 more in the postseason, the 25-year-old outfielder is one of a handful of reasons why the Yankees suddenly seem to have one of the brightest futures of any team in baseball.New York came within a victory of the World Series this year, losing to Houston in Game 7 of the AL Championship Series.Bellinger's team made it to that final step, but Los Angeles fell to the Astros in a seven-game World Series.Bellinger is the second straight Dodgers player to win Rookie of the Year.Shortstop Corey Seager did it last year.Bellinger made his big league debut in late April.By the time he turned 22 on July 13, he had 25 home runs.The 6-foot-4 first baseman is an appropriate counterpart to the powerful Judge.They even hit from opposite sides of the plate: Judge is a righty and Bellinger swings left-handed.This is the first time both Rookie of the Year awards were unanimous since 1997, when Nomar Garciaparra of Boston and Scott Rolen of Philadelphia won.More MLB baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball
Marlins have Stanton on the market as GM meetings start:::::The Miami Marlins will spend this week's general managers' meetings shopping Giancarlo Stanton, the pricey slugger who led the major leagues with 59 home runs but does not fit into the plans of the new payroll-paring baseball operations staff headed by former New York Yankees star Derek Jeter.As the meetings began Monday, Marlins president of baseball operations Mike Hill said, "I think over the next few days I'll get a feel for what the marketplace is for our players."Stanton, who turned 28 last week, is owed $295 million over the final decade of his record $325 million, 13-year contract.He has a full no-trade provision, so he can determine his destination.Hill said, "I do have a sense, and we'll keep that internal, and at the appropriate time we'll discuss whatever we need to discuss."
Christian players frustrated by criticism for anthem protest:::::Eric Reid and other Christian players who support Colin Kaepernick's social justice movement want believers on the opposite side of the controversial anthem protest to ask themselves a simple but powerful question: What would Jesus do?Reid joined Kaepernick, his former San Francisco 49ers teammate, in kneeling for the "The Star-Spangled Banner" last year because he wants to be a "voice for the voiceless," a lesson derived from a Bible verse found in Proverbs.The 25-year-old safety-turned-linebacker said he has discussed faith with Kaepernick, who remains unsigned."It's the foundation of why we started doing this," Reid told The Associated Press on Oct. 29."We all have a love for people.The Bible tells us love your brother as yourself so that's why we're doing it."We have to speak up for those who can't do it for themselves.My faith is ultimately what led me to start protesting and it's what continues to drive me.Faith without works is dead.I feel like the past year before we started protesting, the Lord has prepped me for this moment."Reid made the decision to kneel following a meeting with Kaepernick and former Green Beret and Seahawks long snapper Nate Boyer.Kaepernick initially sat for the anthem before his conversation with Boyer.They chose to kneel because they felt it's a "respectful gesture."But the movement has drawn heavy criticism as it continues to envelop the NFL.President Donald Trump exacerbated the situation earlier this season when he suggested team owners should fire any players who knelt during the anthem.Kaepernick, who led San Francisco to consecutive NFC championship games and one Super Bowl, filed a complaint that team owners colluded against him because of the protests, which are aimed at raising awareness for police brutality against African-Americans and other issues.Reid said he's "baffled" that some people misconstrue player demonstrations as being protests against the anthem itself, or the American flag, or the military or police.He's especially frustrated by Christians who lash out against the players."I do see some hypocrisy with the people that call themselves Christians," Reid said."If you know Jesus, he went into the house of God and turned over the tables and was angry and said they made the house of God into a marketplace so I would say this is something that He would do."But the issue has been so divisive that Christians can't agree."This is not about black, white, brown, red or yellow; it's about respect for the country and its flag, which symbolizes we are 'one' nation under God," said Joseph Bruce Sofia, senior pastor at Gloucester County Community Church in Sewell, New Jersey."The national anthem speaks of oneness and not division; it speaks of hope and unity, of poverty to wealth, from the ghetto to the Presidency.The Biblical principle of sowing and reaping is in effect here.Sow discord and we'll reap discord.Oppression is a horrible thing, and needs to be taken on head-on, but take it to the town hall or courts or social media but, in my opinion, using the national anthem during a football game draws a line in the wrong sand."Carl Lentz, the lead pastor at New York City's Hillsong Church, said many people, including Christians, are ignoring the real issues."What we see right now in culture is what's easier?To make this about a flag, which it's never been about, or to actually say, Colin, what's your beef?What's your passion?What's going on?"Lentz said."Our country has a sad history of missing the mark, missing the moment, and deflecting issues.To judge this guy for putting his career on the line for something he's passionate about, I do not understand.It's sad."Baltimore Ravens tight end Benjamin Watson, a strong advocate for social reform, said he's disappointed when Christians put "politics above the gospel, empathy and understanding.""We talk about what Jesus would do.Let's think about that," said Watson, who has been standing for the anthem."How should I Biblically look at this situation?Is my response as an American going against what my response should be as a Christian?If I'm a Christian, I want to delight in the things that (Christ) delights in and those things are blind.They're not based on color, creed or culture or money."Being kind is not predicated on what you can do for me.Justice is not predicated on if I experienced injustice or not.We can advocate for people who have experiences that we don't even have.True justice is blind and righteous.Christians should be about expanding and promoting the gospel.If you listen or think about the subject matter that players and people are concerned about, you could not as someone who reads scripture turn a blind eye to it."Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins, one of the founders of The Players Coalition , said the Christian community could effectuate positive change if it wasn't divided."As big as we are, as much influence as we have on policy and politics, if the Church ever got behind really being for equality and really being for justice, it would show up, it would come," said Jenkins, who has been raising a fist during the anthem."But a lot of times we don't show the empathy, we don't take the time to listen and we're just as segregated as the world is right now."Watson emphasized the importance of both sides listening to each other."These guys love America.We're not traitors, we just want this country to be better on some things," Watson said."When we're able to sit and communicate with one another, it allows us to understand.None of us are perfect.Reid was one of three players who took a knee Sunday on Veterans Day weekend."Our protest is against systemic oppression like we always say," Reid said."I didn't feel the need to stand today.I have a military background in my family.I've spoken to family members who don't feel disrespected."AP Pro Football Writer Josh Dubow contributed.For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/APNFL Follow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APRobMaaddi
Beltran retires at 40 after winning 1st World Series title:::::It took quite some time, but Carlos Beltran finally got there, winning a World Series title after 20 seasons in the majors.Now he is leaving the Houston Astros and leaving baseball, retiring after a career in which he was a nine-time All-Star and was Rookie of the Year.The 40-year-old designated hitter and outfielder made the announcement Monday, 12 days after the Astros beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 7 of the World Series.He announced his retirement in an essay written for The Players' Tribune website.His story touched on what finally winning a championship meant to him."I realized early on that my purpose in this game was to share knowledge with younger players and to give back to the game of baseball," he wrote."I always wanted to do that that, and be the best teammate I could possibly be.Over 20 years, I feel like I accomplished that."So whether we won or lost Game 7, I would have still been happy with my career.But it still feels nice to have a ring," he continued.Besides being named an All-Star nine times, most recently in 2016, and the 1999 AL Rookie of the Year, he won three Gold Glove and two Silver Slugger awards.His production dropped dramatically this year.He hit .295 with 29 homers and 93 RBIs for the New York Yankees and Texas in 2016.He then batted .231 with 14 homers and 51 RBIs for Houston.Despite that, Beltran's veteran presence and his work with Houston's younger players including Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa and Marwin Gonzalez proved invaluable for the Astros."He was worth every penny for us ... he helped us win in a lot of ways, even though his numbers were not what they were last year, he contributed in a lot of way that were not really seen by our fans," Houston general manager Jeff Luhnow said."They were talked about a lot by our players.Also I think people know what I'm talking about.He really was a player-coach for us this year and he contributed in ways that lead me to believe there's no way we win the championship without him this year."He finishes with a .279 average, 435 homers, 1,587 RBIs and 312 stolen bases.He also has played for Kansas City, the New York Mets, San Francisco and St. Louis.This season was Beltran's second stint with the Astros, after he was traded to Houston in June 2004.His work that postseason remains one of the best playoff performances in history.He hit .455 with four homers and nine RBIs in an NLDS win over Atlanta, then batted .417 with four more homers and five RBIs before Houston was eliminated by the Cardinals in the NLCS.Beltran appeared in 10 games this postseason, including three in the World Series.He finished with three hits, including two doubles, and an RBI in helping the Astros to their first title.Many of his current and former teammates expressed their gratitude and appreciation for Beltran on social media after his announcement on Monday.Correa posted a picture of the two of them on Instagram with a caption that read in part: "I will always look up to you brother!Thanks for making me a better player and a better person!I'm going to miss you so much!"Houston right-hander Justin Verlander tweeted about Beltran's retirement, writing: "We only played together for a short time but what a ride we had!I learned a lot about what being a veteran means and the impact we can have.You're an amazing teammate and leader.What a way to bow out ... a World Champion!"Yankees general manager Brian Cashman wouldn't say whether Beltran was a candidate to replace Joe Girardi as his team's manager.But he did rave about his career and the respect he has for him."He had leadership qualities, no question about that," Cashman said."He was someone that people gravitated to in the clubhouse.I think managers or coaches could rely, or front offices could rely on (him), kind of directing things in a positive way or keeping the ship steered in the right direction."After what Luhnow saw from Beltran in Houston this season, he could envision him becoming a manager one day."Certainly.He's one of the brightest minds I've come across in the game," he said."Now whether or not, I haven't (spoken) to him about what is intentions are after this, but I think he certainly would be a tremendous asset to any organization in whatever capacity he chooses to contribute."AP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in Orlando, Florida, contributed to this report.More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball
Giants owners say McAdoo staying as coach until season's end:::::Ben McAdoo is staying as coach of the New York Giants, at least until the end of the season.Giants co-owners John Mara and Steve Tisch issued a statement Monday saying while they are frustrated and disappointed with the Giants' 1-8 record, they won't evaluate the team and make any moves until the end of the season.McAdoo's future has been a major topic the past two weeks in the wake of a 34-point home loss to the Los Angeles Rams a little more than a week ago, then an embarrassing loss to a San Francisco 49ers team that was winless until Sunday.The owners said the 40-year-old McAdoo, who led their Giants to their first playoff berth since 2011 in his first season last year, has their support.The Giants have not fired a coach in the middle of the season since 1976."We are in the midst of an extremely disappointing season," the owners said in the statement."Our performance this year, particularly the past two weeks, is inexcusable and frustrating.While we appreciate that our fans are unhappy with what has occurred, nobody is more upset than we are."Our plan is to do what we have always done, which is to not offer a running commentary on the season," the statement continued."It is our responsibility to determine the reasons for our poor performance and at the end of the year, we will evaluate the 2017 season in its entirety and make a determination on how we move forward."McAdoo was not sure how things would change with the owners' statement, a move seemingly made to calm things and stop weekly speculation."We'll have to see how everybody responds," McAdoo said late Monday afternoon."Again, my focus is as it always is, on the week of preparation, to try to put a good plan together, help these coaches and players any way I can putting a good product on the field, and finding a way to get better."The Giants have not done that much this season, and the product had been very ugly the past two weeks.The stadium was more than half empty in the second half of the 51-17 loss to the Rams, and Sunday's loss had to be rock bottom."I am disappointed, but I am determined to find a way to get it fixed," McAdoo said "That's where my focus is.No one expected our record to be what it is at this point, or us to be playing the type of football we are playing at this point.But we are, and we are what our record says we are, and the film reflects it.We need to find a way to improve."The situation got even tougher for McAdoo last week when two anonymous players were quoted by ESPN as saying he had lost the team, some players had quit, and that players were angry about an inordinate amount of fines.The coach also caught some flak for suspending cornerbacks Janoris Jenkins and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie in the last month for violations of team rules.They are both popular with teammates.McAdoo replaced Tom Coughlin as head coach last year and led the Giants to an 11-5 record in 2016.They were blown out by the Green Bay Packers in the wild-card game.Much was expected this season with a good defense almost entirely returning and the offense bolstered by the signing of free agent receiver Brandon Marshall and the addition of tight end Evan Engram, the first-round draft pick.General manager Jerry Reese made a calculated risk to keep a weak offensive line together in hopes that the blockers would blossom.Almost everything went wrong.Marshall was a bust, then he and offensive catalyst Odell Beckham Jr. suffered season-ending ankle injuries against the Chargers on Oct. 8 in the team's fifth straight loss.The line has been horrible and banged-up for most of the season.While the defense has played well at times, it has failed to hold fourth-quarter leads early in the season and given up way too many big plays lately.NOTES: DT Damon Harrison sustained an ankle injury Sunday and is probably going to be limited in practice this week.... OT Justin Pugh aggravated a back injury and is going to have to sit a bit, McAdoo said.For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/APNFL
John Fox loses even when he wins his challenge:::::You think the Denver Broncos have it bad?Here's how low things have gotten for their former head coach in Chicago: even when John Fox wins, he loses.Fox fell to 12-29 in Chicago with a 23-16 loss to the Packers on Sunday that will best be remembered for his successful challenge that cost the Bears dearly.Bennie Cunningham caught Mitchell Trubisky's screen pass and cut outside before lunging for the right pylon in the second quarter.Cunningham was ruled out of bounds at the 2 and the Bears challenged the call, sure it would be ruled a touchdown on review."Every indication that we had was that he scored, and if anything he would be at the 1 or inside the 1 instead of I think they spotted the ball originally at the 3," Fox said.Instead, the replay showed the ball coming out of Cunningham's hands before it hit the pylon and while he was still in bounds, and the fumble into the end zone resulted in a touchback for Green Bay."Obviously, that's a play you'd like to have back," Fox said."But that's now how this game works."Here's how replay reviews do work: throw the flag and everything is fair game.The NFL's rulebook states: "All reviewable aspects of the play may be examined and are subject to reversal, even if not identified in a coach's challenge or if not the specific reason for a Replay Official's request for review."Cunningham agreed with the call after watching the replay."Coaches go over it every week.Unless it's fourth down, you don't reach the ball out at the goal line, in the red zone," Cunningham said."They talk about it.I go down at the 1, next play it's first-and-goal and we hand the ball to Jordan (Howard).It's a touchdown.So it was a bad decision."But the right call.Week 10 was filled with notable calls, and one of the biggest was Bill Belichick reaching out for Martellus Bennett after the Packers jettisoned the tight end who had opted for surgery on his injured shoulder.COME BACK: Belichick offered to bring Bennett back to New England, where he won a Super Bowl ring last year.Bennett said he told Belichick he needed to think about it "because I don't even know if I went through the seven stages of grief yet."Bennett called back a few minutes later to accept Belichick's offer and was active for New England's 41-16 shellacking of the Broncos on Sunday night, contributing three catches for 38 yards."It's good to have him back and good to have him contribute," Belichick said."He did a great job coming in on a Friday," Tom Brady said."I love having Martellus on our team.He adds a lot and he is a great player.He was for us last year, and hopefully we keep building on it. "BRONCOS BOMB: Before the Patriots handed the Broncos their fifth consecutive double-digit loss , Mike Tirico sat down with Denver general manager John Elway, who told him, "I still have dreams of playing, believe it or not, after 19 years.It's much tougher sitting up in the box watching it than it is down there playing."Back in the studio, NBC analyst Tony Dungy had the line of the day when he cracked, "You know why he wants to play?He's got a Super Bowl-caliber team and he's the best quarterback in the building."Maybe so, but for now Brock Osweiler will remain the starter after falling to 0-2 in place of Trevor Siemian, but if this slide continues, Paxton Lynch might finally get the chance to show if he's a late bloomer or a bust.For now it looks like Elway will go into his third consecutive offseason not knowing who his QB is.REPUTATION FLAGS: Bengals oft-penalized linebacker Vontaze Burfict will suit up in Denver next weekend after the NFL said he won't be suspended for contact with an official that got him ejected from Cincinnati's 24-20 loss at Tennessee.After Marcus Mariota was knocked out of bounds just shy of the goal line, Tennessee tackle Jack Conklin pushed Burfict and down judge Jeff Bergman put his left arm across Burfict's midsection to keep the players apart.As he returned to the field, Burfict lightly moved Bergman's arm away as though it were a subway turnstile.Two plays earlier, Burfict drew an unnecessary roughness penalty for hitting actually, grazing DeMarco Murray out of bounds.Burfict's former teammate, nose tackle Domata Peko, who's now in Denver, said neither flag should have been thrown on his old buddy, but noted "he's under the microscope because of his history of all these penalties.""But I love Burf.I love how he plays.He plays hard.He plays with a lot of emotion," Peko said."I saw that, he barely touched the ref.He just moved his arm.He could have chopped his arm down.He could have done something worse.But being under the microscope, you can't be doing that stuff."For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/APNFL With contributions from AP Pro Football Writer Teresa M.

LeBron: Smith comments a shot at Phil Jackson, not Ntilikina:::::LeBron James says his belief that the Knicks should have drafted Dennis Smith Jr. wasn't meant to slight Frank Ntilikina, though it was intended as a swipe at Phil Jackson."Oh yeah, it was definitely a shot at him," James said Monday."That's for sure."James said Saturday after playing in Dallas that Smith should be a Knick.New York took Ntilikina with the No.8 pick in the June draft, one spot before the Mavericks selected Smith.James said he's known Smith since the former North Carolina State point guard was 13 or 14 years old and that they had trained together.He knows only a little about Ntilikina, a teenager from France who had played overseas with one of James' friends from Ohio.Last offseason, Jackson had said the Knicks needed a point guard, either through the draft or free agency, and James figured they could do no better than taking Smith to play with Kristaps Porzingis.He compared his comments to his thoughts that the Cleveland Browns should have drafted quarterback Deshaun Watson with the No.1 pick, saying that doesn't mean Myles Garrett won't become a top defensive player."Like I said, it's no shade at Frank.I don't even know the kid," James said at the Cavaliers' shootaround before their game against the Knicks."I wasn't even thinking about the kid when I was talking about Dennis Smith.I was thinking about the Knicks organization and Phil Jackson at the time and Dennis Smith's talent and Porzingis."Jackson selected Ntilikina, but that was about the last thing he did as team president, as he and the organization parted ways at the end of June.He had angered James during his three years running the Knicks when he referred to James' friends and business partners as a "posse.""I'm not a Phil Jackson fan, I think you guys already know that," James said."That's the past.He's not even here anymore."For more NBA coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball
South American soccer officials go on trial in New York:::::Three former South American soccer officials went on trial Monday in a scandal that's shaken the sport's governing body, with U.S. prosecutors accusing them of taking millions of dollars in bribes and defense lawyers portraying them as innocent bystanders to corruption.Jose Maria Marin, Manuel Burga and Juan Angel Napout were the first soccer officials to be tried in the sprawling investigation of FIFA.Prosecutors accuse them of taking part in a 24-year scheme involving at least $150 million in bribes paid by marketing firms in exchange for lucrative broadcasting and hosting rights for prestigious tournaments."These defendants cheated the sport in order to line their own pockets ... and they did it year after year, tournament after tournament, bribe after bribe," Assistant U.S. Attorney Keith Edelman said in opening statements in federal court in Brooklyn.Some of the bribes were arranged in Miami in the spring of 2014, when international soccer officials announced that Copa America was coming to the U.S. for the first time, Edelman said.It should have been a "proud moment," the prosecutors said."But lurking under the surface are lies, greed and corruption."In their openings, defense attorneys told jurors that the case against their clients was built on the testimony of shady soccer officials who are seeking leniency in their own criminal cases stemming from the probe.A key government witness, Argentinian-Italian marketing executive Alejandro Burzaco, got a "sweetheart deal" after he "turned himself in and began telling stories," said Silvia Pinera, an attorney for Napout.Marin's lawyer, Charles Stillman, compared his client to a soccer player who remained on the sidelines while other, more powerful officials orchestrated the bribery plot."He was on the field but not playing the game," Stillman said.Marin, 85, is the former president of Brazil's soccer federation; Burga, 60, is the former president of Peru's soccer federation; and Napout, 59, is the ex-president of the South American soccer governing body CONMEBOL and of Paraguay's soccer federation.Prosecutors say Napout and Burga were among a bloc of powerful soccer officers for CONMEBOL known as the "gang of six" when Burzaco was paying the group annual six-figure bribes in exchange for getting the organization to grant broadcasting rights for the Copa Libertadores to Burzaco's firm.Separately, prosecutors said in court filings, unnamed co-conspirators were shelling out about $1 million a year in bribes to Marin from the firm vying for sponsorship of the Copa do Brasil tournament from 2013 to 2022.The trial is expected to last up to six weeks.
Bengals' Burfict avoids suspension for contact with official:::::Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict won't be suspended for the contact with an official that got him ejected from a 24-20 loss at Tennessee.A league spokesman said Monday that Burfict faces a fine only.He pushed an official's arm out of the way on the sideline in the second quarter after quarterback Marcus Mariota ran out of bounds.Two plays earlier, Burfict drew an unnecessary roughness penalty for hitting Mariota out of bounds."I've been saying it: He's going to be held to a different set of standards because of his past," defensive coordinator Paul Guenther said Monday."So he's got to understand that.He does us no good when he's sitting in the locker room for half a ballgame."It was the second game in a row that the Bengals (3-6) had a star player ejected before halftime.Receiver A.J.Green was kicked out of a loss at Jacksonville after grabbing cornerback Jalen Ramsey around the neck, tackling him and punching him.The outburst by Green was out of character.He apologized after the game.Green was fined $42,541 by the NFL but wasn't suspended.Ramsey also was ejected from the game but wasn't suspended or fined.Coach Marvin Lewis has warned Burfict about exchanging words with opponents after a play."I've explained this to Vontaze," Lewis said Monday."He understands that.(Officials) have a job to do and they're going to separate players....So get back to the huddle and get going, and that's the most important thing.We don't need to jaw with anyone after the play, any of the players."An ESPN report quoted an unidentified Bengals player saying officials have provoked Burfict.Lewis said "it would shock me" if that were true.Burfict's latest problems add to his history of fines and suspensions.His biggest meltdown came in the final minute of a playoff game against the Steelers in the 2015 season.His hit to Antonio Brown's head drew a 15-yard penalty that moved Pittsburgh into range for a field goal and an 18-16 victory.The NFL suspended Burfict for the first three games of the 2016 season in response to his hit on Brown and his history of egregious conduct.He got another three-game suspension to start this season after his egregious hit on Kansas City running back Anthony Sherman during a preseason game.The Steelers have won their past five games against the Bengals, including a 29-14 victory in Pittsburgh this season.The Steelers (7-2) play a Monday night game at Paul Brown Stadium on Dec. 4.Since the Bengals' playoff meltdown, Burfict and running back Le'Veon Bell have exchanged taunts on Twitter.After JuJu Smith-Schuster scored a touchdown Sunday during a 20-17 victory at Indianapolis, he and Bell re-enacted Green's takedown of Ramsey as their end zone celebration.The Bengals play at Denver (3-6) on Sunday, completing a stretch of three straight road games.The Broncos are coming off a 41-16 home loss to New England on Sunday night, their fifth straight defeat.Brock Osweiler is expected to start against a Bengals defense that has self-destructed lately.Cincinnati hasn't been able to move the ball on offense or get off the field on defense, resulting in a huge imbalance.In the past two games, the Bengals have run 75 fewer plays than their opponents.The Jaguars and Titans each held the ball for more than 40 minutes.The defense allowed opponents to convert 19 of 33 third down plays in the past two games.In the second half alone Sunday, Bengals penalties allowed the Titans to convert a third-and-10, a third-and-8, another third-and-10 and a third-and-5.HILL OPTS FOR SURGERY The Bengals put running back Jeremy Hill on injured reserve Saturday because of an ankle injury, ending his season.Hill got hurt in practice the day before the loss in Jacksonville.Lewis was surprised that Hill decided to have surgery, which prompted the move."Jeremy thinks he needs to have ankle surgery," Lewis said."I think he consulted a couple of physicians, both said this is something that could wait until after the season, and he just felt it was causing too much discomfort."Hill's injury leaves rookie Joe Mixon and Giovani Bernard in the backfield.The Bengals are expected to add another running back this week.They have the worst-ranked running game in the NFL.For more NFL coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/APNFL
