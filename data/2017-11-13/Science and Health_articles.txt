Mystery deepens over whether Amelia Earhart was eaten by three-foot crabs with claws like lion jaws:::::The mystery surrounding Amelia Earhart's disappearance has bewildered many for years.Some have proposed that her plane simply crashed and sank, while others have pondered a number of other explanations, including capture by the Japanese, or that she lived out her days on Gardner Island.One frequent theory is that Earhart's remains may have been eaten by coconut crabs, a 3-foot-long crab with claws so powerful it can crack open a coconut.The unproven theory suggests that Earhart crashed on the island of Nikumaroro and the crabs ate her remains.A British colonial officer in 1940 who was on the island said that a skeleton with measurements that matched the description of Amelia Earhart" was discovered by researchers but it was ultimately lost.AMELIA EARHART MYSTERY CONTINUES WITH CLAIMS OF HER GRAVE The theory has been around for years and was recently mentioned in stories by The Washington Post and others, highlighting the ferocity of the crabs.It was even mentioned in 2013 by the Smithsonian magazine, citing an article from Environmental Graffiti.A recent video from a scientist highlights a coconut crab attacking and killing a red-footed booby on Chagos Archipelago.The crabs can grow up to 3 feet, 3 inches in length and weigh as much as 9 pounds.The force in their claws is the equivalent of crushing 6 tons and they can live up to 60 years.Coconut crabs received their name after famed biologist Charles Darwin observed them destroying coconuts.
'Chilean Titanic' mystery solved after 95 years as experts locate wreck:::::Researchers have finally located the wreck of the ship known as the Chilean Titanic that sank 95 years ago.More than 400 people were on the steamer Itata when it sank in a ferocious storm off the coast of La Higuera in Chiles Coquimbo region.Some 374 people died in the disaster, according to news reports.HUNLEY MYSTERY SOLVED: BLAST FROM OWN TORPEDO LIKELY KILLED CREW The wrecks location has remained a mystery since the Itata sank on Aug. 28, 1922.A few weeks ago, experts from Chiles Catholic University of the North (UCN) and Matthias Gorny, director of science for ocean conservation group Oceana thought that they had found the spot where the ferry boat sank, but were unable to find the Itatas wreck using a robot sub.The breakthrough came a few days later when the wreckage was spotted at a depth of 200 metres (656 feet).In a statement translated via Google Translate, Carlos Corts, a filmmaker and marine biologist at the UCN and leader of the expedition, heralded the discovery as a great achievement, noting that the Itata is a crucial part of Chiles underwater heritage.THIS SHIPWRECK DATES TO WHEN GENGHIS KHANS DESCENDANTS RULED CHINA The University is planning to launch a documentary on the incredible find.Experts are also working on permits to conduct archaeological surveys of the site and seeking additional funding for their research.Corts launched the search for Itata seven years ago with audiovisual producer Ricardo Bordones.Oceana played a key role in finding the doomed vessel.Experts knew that Itata sank off the Chilean coast somewhere between Punta de Choros and Caleta Chungungo, an area that the ocean conservation group knows well.GERMAN WORLD WAR I SUBMARINE DISCOVERED INTACT WITH 23 BODIES INSIDE We have made several scientific expeditions off the coast of La Higuera due to the environmental importance of this place, said Gorny, in the statement.Therefore, we wanted to collaborate in the search for Itata, taking advantage of the technology we have, and thanks to the images of our underwater robot, we were able to confirm that what was there was the ship's remains.The Faculty of Marine Sciences at UCN will continue investigating the wreck using a robot sub.The Itata site on the Pacific seabed opens up a host of research opportunities in areas such as underwater archaeology, history and marine biology, according to Javier Sellanes, the Facultys research secretary.All this will continue to be done with the corresponding permits and due respect for those who lost their lives in this tragic event and their families, he said, in the statement.The storied ship was used by rebels during the 1891 Chilean Civil War and was involved in a diplomatic incident between the U.S. and Chile over a shipment of arms.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers
Pendant linked to Anne Frank has reunited a family:::::Chaim Motzen was intrigued when he read about a pendant excavated at a Nazi death camp with a possible link to Anne Frank.Engraved with "mazel tov""good luck" in Hebrewthe little charm belonged to Karoline Cohn, a 14-year-old Jewish girl killed at Sobibor.Motzen, an amateur genealogist, set out to find Karoline's family and discovered several branches, from the US and Israel to Nicaragua and Japan, the Times of Israel and Time report.On Monday, more than 30 of those relatives will meet in Germany to dedicate a stolpersteine, or "stumbling stone," a brass memorial plaque at Karoline's last known address in Frankfurt.Many of the girl's family members have never met, and some had no idea they lost relatives in the Holocaust."We had this person who was completely forgotten," Motzen tells the Times."Through this pendant people are learning about each other and their history, and about Karoline," he says.Motzen's first clue about Karoline's roots came when he dug up testimony online that her mother's cousin had given to Yad Vashem in 1978, per Time.From there, he found the grandchildren of her uncle.When he phoned Mandy Eisemann, 46, the daughter of Karoline's first cousin, in Maryland, she cried.Then she phoned her dad, Barry Eisemann, 72, whose own father escaped the Nazis but kept mum about the family history."He kept it from me to protect me," he tells Time."The emotions he experienced then, I'm feeling now."Barry Eisemann is "excited, but a little nervous" about meeting newly found relatives at the reunion.But he adds, "I think this is what Karoline would have wanted."(A letter buried at Auschwitz was finally published.)This article originally appeared on Newser: How a Holocaust Pendant Reunited a Family
Dwarf planet Ceres may have had a global ocean in ancient past:::::Nestled in the asteroid belt, the dwarf planet Ceres contains water-rich materials that suggest it once boasted a global ocean in its distant past.Now, two new studies from NASA's Dawn mission may reveal traces of an ancient ocean in the crust, with remnants left behind in the muddy mantle beneath.Scientists used the tug of gravity on NASA's Dawn spacecraft to track gravitational features across the dwarf planet Ceres.Combined with models of the evolution of the icy surfaces, these observations reveal an ocean mostly frozen into a strong but flexible crust, with a mud-rich inner layer that keeps things moving.Referring to the new research, Dawn project scientist Julie Castillo-Rogez told Space.com, "The [new] papers modeled the relaxation of Ceres' surface morphology at the global scale and the resulting gravitational anomalies in order to get several important results."[Awesome Ceres Photos by NASA's Dawn] Strange anomalies When Dawn arrived at Ceres in 2015, it found a mostly flat world with only a single mountain, Ahuna Mons, and craters that were smaller than anticipated and not very rich in geological features.Past researchers have hunted for an explanation for the mystery of the missing craters and the lack of mountains, and they have concluded that the planet's crust must be slowly relaxing, like honey poured onto a plate.But that research looked at only small parts of the planet.The new research examined the world on a larger scale, Castillo-Rogez said.The first paper by Anton Ermakov, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, tracked small changes in Dawn's orbit to determine what is going on beneath Ceres' surface.As the spacecraft orbited the tiny world, Ceres pulled at it.More massive regions tugged more sharply on the spacecraft, while less dense regions had less of an impact.This affected how long it took the signal to travel from the orbiter to the antennas of NASA's Deep Space Network back on Earth."The distribution of masses inside Ceres creates a gravity field," Ermakov told Space.com by email."The shape of the gravity field tells us about the mass distribution inside Ceres and thus helps us to constrain its composition."[What Would It Be Like to Live on Ceres?]By taking the gravitational measurements of the crust, Ermakov and his team found that the crust of Ceres is very close to the density of water, Castillo-Rogez said.The new data puts the crust thickness at only 25 miles (40 kilometers).The researchers also confirmed that the planet's mantle is rocky something she said was expected.(While the researchers referred to the inner layer as a mantle, they warn that it shouldn't be taken as having the normal terrestrial connotations, where the mantle is molten rock.)Ermakov and the Dawn team found that the massive mountain and three of the craters are all associated with gravity anomalies.The crater Occator is best known for hosting the largest and brightest spot on Ceres, while Kerwan and Yalode are the two largest confirmed craters on the planet.The connection of the gravitational anomalies with the four features supports the idea that Ceres is geologically active now or was very recently.[In Photos: The Weird Bright Spots on Ceres] The team also found positive mass concentrations, or mascons, under the two largest basins.These mascons have been found on Earth's moon, Mars and Mercury.Researchers suspect that mascons on the moon came from a massive asteroid impact that changed the density of the lunar surface and its magnetic field."For Kerwan and Yalode, the shape of the gravity anomaly looks like a bullseye pattern, very similar to the gravitational signatures of lunar mascons," Ermakov said.The research was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets.A strong, flexible crust Building on Ermakov's research, Roger Fu, a Dawn team member at Harvard University, examined the interior structure of the world.Ermakov and his team had demonstrated that the dwarf planet's crust was more like ice than water.But Fu's co-author and Dawn guest investigator Michael Bland of the U.S. Geological Survey had previously demonstrated that Ceres' crust is 1,000 times stronger than water ice, a finding Fu's new research confirmed.Like his fellow author, Fu examined the planet as a whole.He modeled how the planet's crust flows.Rather than a pure-ice crust, Fu found that Ceres' surface is likely to be a mixture of ice, salts and rock.He also determined that clathrate hydrates are likely to be a significant component of the crust.A clathrate hydrate is a cage of water molecules surrounding a gas molecule."Methane clathrates are only one of several different salt species that might be in the crust," Fu told Space.com."Even if it's there, it's still probably one of several co-existing phases."Castillo-Rogez describes clathrates as "really the only option that makes sense."Based on the results, the researchers think that Ceres once had more pronounced surface features that have gradually smoothed out over time.According to Fu, with a rocky crust, "the really wide plateaus and basins think in terms of global topographic features, like the Ceres equivalents of the Tibetan plateau or the entire Atlantic Ocean basin would be a lot taller or lower."But Ceres is mostly flat."The ice-salt-rock mixture crust means there isn't as much contrast between the high and low points," Fu said.The flattening of the mountains and the valleys means that the strong crust must rest on a softer layer, which Fu and his colleagues think contains liquid mixed with the rock below the crust.Castillo-Rogez describes this as "salty mud or briny mud."The team thinks most of the ancient ocean that once covered Ceres has been bound up into the crust, with only ice, clathrate hydrates and salts left behind to reveal its existence.While most of the ocean is tied up in the crust, the soft mantle suggests that some of it may still remain liquid.The results are consistent with thermal models of Ceres published before Dawn arrived.Fu's research is published in the journal Earth and Planetary Sciences Letters.Originally published on Space.com.
Dinosaur-killing space rock created dramatic temperature drop:::::Dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops became extinct about 66 million years ago, after an asteroid strike resulted in plunging temperatures.According to a new study, the frigid weather that ultimately led to their extinction was far worse than earlier models suggested.At the end of the Cretaceous era, a massive asteroid approximately 7 miles (12 kilometers) wide crashed into a limestone- and gypsum-rich region, now known as the Yucatn Peninsula in the Gulf of Mexico.A new study estimates that the sun-absorbing sulfur which vaporized into the atmosphere after the asteroid hit the gypsum was three times more abundant than previous models estimated.Of course, the asteroid impact itself was terrible for local animal inhabitants, which may have perished in the crash's immediate aftereffects such as tsunamis and landslides.But the asteroid's impact site was an extra stroke of bad luck for the rest of the planet, according to Natalia Artemieva, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, and co-author of the new study."The impact site in the current Gulf of Mexico had 3-km [of] thick sedimentary cover, a combination of limestone and sulfur-bearing evaporites," Artemieva told Space.com in an email."It's kind of a joke that 66 million years ago the asteroid fell into the worst possible place on Earth .... "would impact [have] occur[ed] into the ocean or into silicate rocks (such as granite), dinosaurs would be still alive."The so-called Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event wiped out many species, including all of the non-avian dinosaurs, according to a 2012 study by Paul Renne et al.According to a statement released by the American Geophysical Union, researchers often attribute that extinction event to the asteroid collision that hit the Yucatn Peninsula, which combined with other forces of climate change - like the Deccan Plateau volcanic eruptions - to make for hostile global environments.The space rock would have thrown enormous amounts of dust, sulfur and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and it was the abundance of sulfur in these clouds that may have caused Earth's average surface air temperatures to drop by as much as 47 degrees Fahrenheit (26 degrees Celsius) in the long term.According to the new study, detailed Oct. 30 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, the dramatically cooler temperatures lasted about three years after the asteroid impact.Artemieva, co-author Joanna Morgan of Imperial College London and their team came across these findings by using a model that, according to the study, had "the capability to simulate the dynamics of different materials within the impact plume."The different materials displaced by the space rock each act differently when shock-waves hit them, so by fine-tuning the ejection models, the team could predict how much of each temperature-altering gas was ejected high enough to linger in the atmosphere upon impact.The team calculated only the gases that flew with a minimum velocity of 1 kilometer per second (0.62 miles per second, or 2,200 mph) into the atmosphere, because gases thrown at slower speeds were likely unable to reach a high enough altitude to influence the climate, Artemieva said.Older models with less computing power are therefore less accurate, she added, because they didn't isolate for a material's chances of staying in the atmosphere.Instead, the older models calculated all of the material that turned into vapor upon impact.Researchers now know that if material is vaporized, it doesn't mean it reached the atmosphere and caused climatic change, since much of it actually stayed near the crater.Recent geophysical studies, including more up-to-date information on how rocks behave under extreme conditions and various impact angle models, suggest the Chicxulub crater formed when hit at an approximately 60-degree angle.The revised data means more sulfur was ejected into the sky, the researchers said.According to Artemieva, volcanoes may offer insight into the effect this mineral has on Earth's climate when it gets pummeled into tiny solid particles known as aerosols."Sulfur aerosols cause cooling as they block incoming sunlight.Currently, the amount of CO2 and SOx [sulfur oxide] in Earth's atmosphere are balanced somehow, and we have our current (quite comfortable) climate," Artemieva said.Volcanic eruptions, for example, release a lot of sulfur into the atmosphere, which can cause local cooling, and even global cooling for one to two years, she added.Original article on Space.com.
That's Baa-rack! Sheep can ID Obama, other celebs:::::Sheep are social animals, and as such, it behooves them to recognize one another's faces.They have even shown they can recall the faces of people who regularly care for them.But sheep recently demonstrated an ability that is somewhat unusual: They can learn to recognize an unfamiliar human face even when they aren't seeing it in three dimensions.The new study showed that sheep could be trained using photos to recognize people who were previously unknown to them such as actress Emma Watson and former U.S. President Barack Obama.And the animals were able to repeatedly do so, even with images that showed the faces from different angles.And the wooly creatures aren't half baa-aad at it.In fact, their performance demonstrated facial-recognition abilities on par with those of humans and other primates, the study authors reported.[The 12 Weirdest Animal Discoveries] Facial recognition is an important human social skill, and scientists evaluate how well animals recognize faces in order to understand the beasts' cognition, and to analyze the implications of facial recognition for the animals' social behavior.Previous studies showed that sheep can tell the difference between human and sheep faces in photos, and studies show sheep activate similar neural pathways during facial recognition tasks as humans and nonhuman primates do, the study authors reported.Face-off For the new study, eight sheep were trained to recognize four faces that are relatively famous (to humans, anyway): those of Watson, Obama, actor Jake Gyllenhaal and British television journalist Fiona Bruce, which were presented to the sheep as images on a computer screen.The scientists selected these particular celebrities because there were plenty of images of them available online, and because they were fairly certain that the sheep had never seen any of them in person before, "though Barack Obama has been to Cambridge recently," study co-author Jennifer Morton, a professor of neurobiology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, told Live Science in an email.First, the sheep learned to select a "celebrity" face image rather than an image of a black screen or an inanimate, vaguely head-shaped object.They then progressed to a choice between a celebrity face and a similar but unfamiliar face.Then, to make sure that the sheep weren't merely memorizing images but truly recognized a face by its distinct features, researchers offered the sheep a choice between two photos: one of an unfamiliar face and one of the celebrity face, but displayed at a different angle than seen in previous trials.The sheep chose the celebrity faces the ones that were familiar to them about 79 percent of the time.Their rate of success dipped somewhat to about 67 percent when the faces were angled to the left or right, or had a different hairstyle, but these results were still significantly higher than if the sheep were picking faces purely by chance, the study authors reported.Interestingly, human success rates in facial recognition tests showed a similar drop when people looked at familiar faces that were presented a different angle, according to the study."We can't know that the sheep recognized the person, but the evidence suggests this is so," Morton told Live Science."A lot of work has been done on how humans recognize faces.We based our conclusions on what has been shown in humans," she said.Further tests showed that sheep could also recognize the faces of their handlers from photographs, selecting them correctly in 72 percent of trials without any additional training.Prior animal studies have shown that chimpanzees, our close relatives, can identify human faces, but so can other animals that aren't part of the primate family.Pigeons can remember the faces of people that shoo them away, avoiding those individuals even when they are wearing different clothes.In 2011, scientists reported that magpies on a university campus scolded and attacked researchers who had previously surveyed the animals' nests, even after the researchers had swapped clothes with other people.And be careful about crossing a crow; not only do they remember the faces of people who threaten them , but they can also hold grudges that last for decades, researchers found.Crows also appear to share information with their friends and family about individuals that they recognize; scientists reported in 2011 that after they had captured and released individual crows, they would be scolded by dozens of angry corvids when they returned to the area.But for Morton and her colleagues, learning about facial recognition in sheep was just one step in the researchers' goal of answering bigger questions about brain function.The study informs their ongoing work with sheep to investigate Huntington's disease (HD), a hereditary and degenerative disorder in people that affects motor regions of the brain.The disease is currently incurable and has limited options for treatment, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke."Cognitive decline is a major therapeutic target in HD," Morton explained on her research department's website."If we can test cognition in sheep, we can see if there is a decline in cognition in the HD sheep.If so, they will be very useful large-animal models of HD in which novel therapies can be tested," Morton said.The findings were published online Nov. 7 in the journal Royal Society Open Science.Original article on Live Science.
Weather observer seen braving frigid 100-mph wind:::::Weather observers stationed atop the highest peak in the Northeast are having a blast braving wind gusts of more than 100 mph.With the roaring wind, temperatures got down to below zero and the wind chill hit minus-40 on Friday at the Mount Washington Observatory in New Hampshire, site of some of the worlds worst recorded weather.The frigid conditions didnt stop the observatorys Tom Padham from battling the whipping winds to record the experience.In a video post on the observatorys Facebook page, Padham is seen strapping on a pair of goggles and heading outside for a bit of fun struggling to stand against the wind.It feels like January across the upper Midwest and Northeast.The National Weather Service said high temperatures are 15 to 25 degrees below average and numerous freeze warnings are in effect.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
'Monster' alligator captured in Florida garage:::::A monster alligator was captured Saturday night after wildlife officials lured the 8-foot reptile out of a Florida homes garage.The alligator was discovered in the garage at Valencia Golf and Country Club in Naples, WINK News reported.Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officials were captured on video slowly luring the reptile out as it thrashed and hissed at them with its jaws open.Officials then clamped the gators mouth down, but it lunged at them again.The gator was captured and removed after a brief battle.Its unclear how the alligator crawled into the garage and where it was taken.Theres an estimated 1.3 million alligators living throughout the state, according to Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.Female alligators in Florida rarely grow past 9 feet in length, but male alligators can be more than 14 feet long.

How big would an 'alien megastructure' have to be?:::::A bizarre flicker of light from space led to the discovery of a still-mysterious star called KIC 8462852, otherwise known as "Tabby's Star," "Boyajian's Star" or the star surrounded by an "alien megastructure."The star and its weird flicker have been generating headlines since 2015, when the object was first observed.That year, the Kepler Space Telescope, which trails Earth as the planet orbits the sun, was looking for Earth-like planets around thousands of stars when it spotted KIC 8462852.Ordinarily, a planet that passes in front of a star dims the light reaching Earth from that star, a small dip that recurs at regular intervals.KIC 8462852 didn't have that sort of dimming.For starters, the star dimmed more than it would if a planet were passing in front of it; planets might cut a star's brightness by 1 percent if they are huge, like Jupiter.KIC 8462852's light dipped by up to 22 percent.On top of that, the pattern of changes wasn't regular, as it would be if a planet were passing in front of the star.[5 Times 'Aliens' Fooled Us] There are several ideas about what the source of the brightness changes could be.Explanations include fragments of comets, a Saturn-like ringed planet or an asteroid field produced as a planet disintegrates.Generally, astronomers don't think it's aliens.And lately, some researchers have proposed that it is an irregularly shaped dust cloud.Initially, though, some speculated that the star could be harboring a megastructure: a gigantic construction built by an alien civilization that is orbiting around the star.Such a structure could explain the patterns in the star's light.[Greetings, Earthlings!8 Ways Aliens Could Contact Us] But science-fiction fans want to know if it was an alien structure, how big would it have to be to create the light-dimming scientists observed?KIC 8462852 is an F-type star, hotter than the sun and about 1,300 light-years away from Earth, where 1 light-year is about 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion kilometers).However, that distance is an estimate, and the star could be as far away as 1,680 light-years and as close as 1,030.The star is about 1.43 times the sun's mass and 1.58 times its diameter so it's about 1.37 million miles (2.2 million km) across.(To get an idea of how big that is, about the 455 United States, lengthwise, could fit inside this alien megastructure.)Any structure built around this star would have to be quite large to block the star's light in any noticeable way.Columbia University astronomer David Kipping, who has been searching for exoplanetary moons, estimated that if whatever is passing in front of the star is some discrete object or set of objects, it would have to be on the order of five times the sun's radius, and larger than KIC 8462852 itself.To put that in perspective, imagine something so big that if it passed between the sun and Earth, the eclipse would last for several days, perhaps weeks, as the structure moved by.The sun's radius is about 432,288 miles (695,700 km).For a structure five times as large 2.16 million miles (3.4 million kilomters) across It would take 11.6 seconds for a radio signal to travel from one end to the other (it takes 1.3 seconds for such a signal to travel from Earth to the moon).In 1960, physicist Freeman Dyson proposed that a sufficiently advanced civilization could build a sphere around a star and would be able to capture all the star's radiant energy (Earthbound observers would see it re-radiated it as infrared light, so the star would look like a giant heat source).But Tabby's star is clearly not surrounded by a solid sphere, since we can see the star's light.The kind of alien megastructure that one might imagine around this star would be a swarm of small bodies arranged in a spherical formation, or perhaps some large object or set of objects that regularly passes in front of the star.[Dyson Spheres: How Advanced Alien Civilizations Would Conquer the Galaxy (Infographic)] The former is called a Dyson swarm, and would be easier to build than a sphere.If the star was surrounded by a Dyson swarm, each satellite would have to be at least asteroid-size, and you'd need many thousands of them.If they are orbiting at distances comparable to our own solar system's inner planets, their periods, or the time it takes them to make one revolution around their host star, would be anywhere from a few months to a few years, following Kepler's laws of planetary motion.Could Tabby's star be surrounded by a ring-shaped structure a la Larry Niven's "Ringworld" novels?Such a ring, if built around the sun, would have to be about 93 million miles (149 million km) in radius, or about 584 million miles (940 million km) in circumference.That's so large that no known material could survive the stresses; Niven had to come up with a fictional material called scrith.Astrophysicist Katie Mack, told the BBC that you'd need something that was bound more strongly than ordinary molecular bonds.Niven's books posit a Ringworld that is about 1 million miles (1.6 million km) wide, large enough that it would block the light from its parent star if it was in the line of sight of an observer.But the pattern of eclipsing light from Tabby's star doesn't seem to fit what you'd see with a ring; the dimming wouldn't show the irregularities that it does with such a structure, according to Mack.One could imagine a vast Dyson ring, though, with miles-wide satellites placed at intervals around Tabby's star.But in this case, too, to be at all visible, the satellites would need to be orders of magnitude larger than any space habitat humans have ever attempted to build or colonize, according to Mack even the ISS is only 368 feet (108 meters) across, and that's far too small to be visible even from as "close" as Mars, let alone light years distant.The smallest exoplanet that Kepler has found so far is larger than Earth's moon.Called Kepler 37b, it's also a lot closer to Earth than Tabby's star is, only 215 light-years distant.If Tabby's star is surrounded by satellites, they would have to be even bigger than the Death Star from "Star Wars," which is stated in various franchise-related sources as being 60 miles (100 kilomters) across.['Star Wars' Tech: 8 Sci-Fi Inventions and Their Real-Life Counterparts] So why don't scientists think aliens are the explanation for the dimming of Tabby's star?One reason is that an alien megastructure would give off radiation in the infrared in a specific way.Any object that gets lit by a nearby star reflects some light and absorbs the rest, and that absorbed light gets re-emitted in a longer wavelength.Basically, objects warm up.In a talk at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute in Mountain View, California, in August 2016, astronomer Jason Wright of Penn State University said studies of the star's light have shown no sign of such "waste heat" with Tabby's star.The other issue is that such megastructures would be difficult to keep stable.A swarm of satellites orbiting would eventually settle into a disk-like arrangement absent active controls, because any object orbiting another or rotating experiences some centripetal force this is why the Earth is slightly flattened.The same is true for Dyson rings and swarms.Futurist Anders Sandberg notes on his site outlining Dyson sphere principles that one structure that might stay stable is a Dyson bubble, made of gigantic, miles-square satellites that stay in place because of radiation pressure, in huge solar sails.But to stay in place, those satellites would have to be stationary with respect to the parent star, so they wouldn't cause anomalous dimming over time as was seen with Tabby's star.Original article on Live Science.
Trillions of Flies Can’t All Be Bad:::::Her life among flies involves both museum work and field research.For her, this is a dream job.She recalled the first time she went behind the scenes at the museum, as a student, before she actually worked there.Id been let into a building that had 34 million insects.I said, Oh hello, I quite like you.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. McAlisters fascination began in childhood.I used to catch the fleas off the cats, she said, inspecting them with a microscope her parents had given her.But she soon gravitated toward more gruesome insects.Decomposing carcasses of small creatures, also courtesy of the cats, were treasure troves of maggots, which she still delights in.I quite like the darker side of nature, she said, just before discussing the lives of spider-killing flies.The larvae hurl themselves at spiders in order to land on them and burrow into the abdomen.They then eat the spider from the inside out.But if the spiders are immature, the larvae may go to sleep for a few years until the spider grows into a bigger meal.Photo One of her few disappointments: Ive yet to get my own botfly.She means that despite spending time in the tropics, no adult botfly has laid an egg on her arm or leg so that the larva could burrow under her skin and develop into the notoriously painful, itchy worm before it emerges.Many flies do an enormous service for us and the planet by cleaning up all sorts of the biological worlds detritus, from dead wood to the slime in drainpipes.Drain flies, or sewer gnats, are actually cleaning up human mess.Occasionally, however, they may have a population boom that sends the adults into the air, which is annoying; if the bodies disintegrate into tiny particles in the air, they are potentially harmful to human health.And, of course, there are the flies that feed on dead bodies the 1,100 different species of blow flies, favorites of forensic detective shows.The maggots of these flies, like the very attractive bluebottle larva, devour corpses of mice and men and everything else.Knowledge of which species lay eggs at which stages of decomposition can help determine how long ago a person turned into a body.(If its Tuesday, it must be a bluebottle.)Photo Within science, flies are one of the great subjects of laboratory study.Or rather, the fly: Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as the fruit fly, although Dr. McAlister points out it actually belongs to a group called the vinegar flies.Advertisement Continue reading the main story They are easy to work with and share the same basic DNA as all life.Historically, they have provided much of the foundation for modern genetics.And now they may provide deep insights into neuroscience and other fields.On Thursday, scientists at the Salk Institute reported that their studies of how the fly brain works can improve internet search engines.At the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Janelia Research Institute in Virginia, the search is on to develop a wiring diagram of the fly brain, and then figure out in the greatest detail how they think.Inviting Flies Into the Newsroom The Timess James Gorman recently took reader questions on Facebook Live with Erica McAlister, a curator of flies at the National History Museum, London.And they do think, according to Vivek Jayaraman, who runs a lab there, in the sense that flies dont just react instinctively.Their brains make decisions based on several different inputs smell, memory, hunger and fear, for instance.And that whole process is what he hopes to decipher, neuron by neuron.You can go end to end, potentially, in the fly, he said.Dr. McAlister admits the importance of Drosophila, although a bit reluctantly.She is really interested in the countless other fly species, from the Antarctic to the Arctic, from predators that kill dragonflies on the wing to the tiny fungus gnats.There are 160,000 known species of fly, and entomologists can only guess at the number we dont know its somewhere between hundreds of thousands and millions.Photo Marlene Zuk, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Minnesota, as well as a decidedly pro-insect scientific popularizer, couldnt agree more.Dr. Zuk, whose chosen study subject is a cricket, also studies a parasitic fly that lays its larvae in them.I called her to talk flies.Wow, she said, you never get asked what your favorite fly is.Dr. Zuk quickly came up with an unfavorite.Flies are always cursed by Drosophila, she said.But flies are unbelievably diverse.She mentioned the value to research of the blowfly and referred to a classic paper, and later a book, on hunger in the blowfly, by Vincent G. Dethier.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The paper showed the physiological process that signaled to a blowfly larva that it had eaten enough, for the moment, of whatever dead thing it was dining on.Dr. Dethier also wrote what might be described as a cult favorite, To Know a Fly.Assuming entomologists and their hangers-on can be considered a cult.Flies are actually prolific muses, in addition to their other qualities.Consider A Fly for the Prosecution, The Life of the Fly, and Lords of the Fly for the Drosophila crowd, among many others.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. McAlister said that her work and her book have bemused and pleased her relatives, including an aunt who is quite delighted to have an author in the family.My parents were a bit confused to start, she said.But I was a middle child and they let me do my own thing.Eventually, she said, they realized, Oh, shes done all right.Flies can be startling in their appearance as well as their behavior.One Middle Eastern fruit fly has patterns on its wings that look something like spiders.No one knows why.Another fly, Achias rothschildi, must swallow air to inflate its eye stalks when it first emerges as an adult.
The Secret to Long Life? It May Lurk in the DNA of the Oldest Among Us:::::The full genetic sequences of Ms. Michelson, Mr. Harris and Ms. Morano are among some three dozen genomes of North American, Caribbean and European supercentenarians being made available this week by a nonprofit called Betterhumans to any researcher who wants to dive in.A few additional genomes come from people who died at 107, 108 or 109.If unusual patterns in their three billion pairs of As, Cs, Gs and Ts the nucleobases that make up all genomes can be shown to have prolonged their lives and protected their health, the logic goes, it is conceivable that a drug or gene therapy could be devised to replicate the effects in the rest of us.I hope you find something that does someone some good, said Clarence Matthews, 110, who allowed his blood to be drawn as a final contribution to the database last year at his Indian Wells, Calif., home while I watched at his side.One in Five Million Photo The rare cache of supercentenarian genomes, the largest yet to be sequenced and made public, comes as studies of garden-variety longevity have yielded few solid clues to healthy aging.Lifestyle and luck, it seems, still factor heavily into why people live into their 90s and 100s.To the extent that they have a genetic advantage, it appears to come partly from having inherited fewer than usual DNA variations known to raise the risk of heart disease, Alzheimers disease and other afflictions.That is not enough, some researchers say, to explain what they call truly rare survival, or why supercentenarians are more uniformly healthy than centenarians in their final months and years.Rather than having won dozens of hereditary coin tosses with DNA variations that are less bad, scientists suggest, supercentenarians may possess genetic code that actively protects them from aging.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the effort to find that code has been challenged, as a group of leading longevity researchers put it in a recent academic paper, in part by the difficulties in acquiring supercentenarian DNA.The New England Centenarian Study, one of a handful of longevity research groups around the world focusing on supercentenarians, now turns down prospective DNA donors under age 103: We tell them theyre too young, said Dr. Thomas Perls, the studys director.The DNA sequences being released this week were acquired almost single-handedly by James Clement, 61, the founder of a company advised by the prominent Harvard geneticist George Church.A professed citizen-scientist, Mr. Clement collected blood, skin or saliva from supercentenarians in 14 states and seven countries over a six-year period.Many were still gardening, arguing, driving and flirting.Ms. Michelson, for one, was fond of reading and reciting Shakespeare.The usefulness of such a small group for a genetic study is unclear, which is one reason Mr. Clements company, now defunct, has turned into a crowdsourcing project.Complex traits like height, body mass index and disease risk phenotypes, as they are known in genetics-speak typically arise from a combination of hundreds of places in the genome where the DNA alphabet differs between individuals.Zeroing in on which variations affect which phenotypes requires the statistical power of tens of thousands of DNA samples almost certainly a dealbreaker when it comes to supercentenarians, whose verified number, worldwide, hovers at around 150.On large swaths of the planet, where birth records are sketchy or nonexistent, identifying verified supercentenarians is virtually impossible.In the United States, researchers say supercentenarians account for about one in five million people.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Amateur genealogists dedicated to validating the ages of the worlds oldest people estimate that even the unverified total comes to only about 1,000.Still, some researchers hope that despite the limited number of available genomes, it will be possible to identify the secret sauce of supercentenarians with methods used to uncover the genetic basis for other rare conditions.No one quite knows how many genomes might be necessary.This is what we call an extreme phenotype, said Dr. Church, who ultimately arranged for the genomes to be sequenced so that Mr. Clement could release them through a nonprofit.The farther out you go on the bell curve, the more likely you are to find something, even with a small sample size.As the goal of slowing aging to extend human health span has gained traction in the scientific mainstream, research has largely been limited to animal studies.A secretive Google spinoff called Calico, for California Life Company, is said to be scrutinizing the genome of the naked mole rat, celebrated for a life span 10 times longer than that of most of its rat cousins.Federally funded scientists are testing a drug on monkeys based on an experiment that doubled the lives of roundworms.And in laboratories across the world, the markers of age in over-the-hill mice, rats and turquoise killifish are, sometimes, being reversed.But what works in shorter-lived organisms often does not translate to humans, whose average life span in developed countries is approaching 80 years.So despite the limitations of Mr. Clements database, several prominent researchers have already expressed interest in it.This could show the utility of starting a bigger collection, said Paola Sebastiani, a longevity researcher at Boston University.Advertisement Continue reading the main story An account of what Mr. Clement calls the Supercentenarian Research Project offers a glimpse at what that might entail, including perseverance, compassion and a sense of humor that trends toward dark.Life or Death It was an inauspicious start, Mr. Clement admitted in an email to a friend in January 2011.The first supercentenarian Mr. Clement had lined up to visit, Mississippi Winn, had died at 113 before he could get from his home in San Jose, Calif., to hers in Shreveport, La.Photo RIP Miss Winn, he posted on the Facebook page that family members had set up for Ms. Winn, believed to be the last living child of African-Americans born into slavery.Such condolences would become a familiar refrain.Of the 70,000 or so Americans who live to be 100, only some two dozen are typically alive at 110.Once that milestone is reached, as Mr. Clement quickly learned, the chance of dying within the next year is roughly 50 percent.After 113, the odds are closer to 66 percent.The oldest person on record, Jeanne Calment, was 122 when she died in 1997; only one other person is known to have lived beyond age 118.Even while youre packing the car, the person may fall ill and say theyre not up to it, Mr. Clement said, after the first of several plans for me to observe a DNA donation was abruptly canceled.Mr. Clement could extract DNA from post-mortem samples, with permission from the family and assuming he could reach the funeral home in time.Exhumation is also possible, in theory, to obtain samples.But for understandable reasons, he said, family members most often ended communications with him at the time of a supercentenarians death.To improve the odds of getting samples and the gender balance, since supercentenarians are nearly all women he lowered his target age from 110 to 106.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Its better to get there when theyre alive, he said.Guided by the Worlds Oldest People email list, whose moderator, Robert D. Young, verifies ages on behalf of Guinness World Records and tracks supercentenarians for the Gerontology Research Group, Mr. Clement placed decal dots designating the locations of prospective participants on a map pinned to the wall of his home office.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He created Google alerts for the phrases 109th birthday, 110th birthday, and 111th birthday, and for the obituaries of known supercentenarians.Unlike so-called blue zones, where centenarians are said to cluster, there is no geographical shortcut for netting supercentenarians.So he called, emailed and sent Facebook friend requests to whatever contacts he could find, wherever he could find them.A Birthday Invitation There was, nominally, the prospect of making money.But with a business plan that, even to some of his investors, sounded more like a research project, Mr. Clement seems to have undertaken the task largely because it provided the chance to act on a longstanding interest in human longevity, including his own.A self-described transhumanist who eats mostly low-glycemic vegetables and nuts and walks seven miles a day, Mr. Clement has accumulated an eclectic rsum that includes starting a brew pub, practicing international tax law and cofounding a futurist magazine.He harbors what he prefers to call a healthy love of life, rather than an aversion to death, and he is possessed of an apparently genuine conviction that longer lives would make humans more humane.Photo My hat was off to someone who was willing to take the time out of his life to go get these precious specimens, said Dr. Church, the Harvard geneticist, who has devoted a portion of his laboratory to research into the reversal of aging.The kind of ultrarare mutations that supercentenarians might harbor, Dr. Church believed, were not likely to be detected with standard techniques, which scan only the places in the genome where DNA is already known to vary between individuals.To look for as-yet-uncataloged variations would require sequencing all of the supercentenarians six billion genetic letters, a far more expensive procedure.When he and Mr. Clement first discussed the idea in 2010, the cost was about $50,000 per genome.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the price was falling.And with the financial support of a handful of like-minded wealthy individuals who agreed to invest in the exploratory phase of the project, it just seemed, Mr. Clement said, like something I could do.Even with the Harvard name as a calling card, several of the families he contacted over the next few years did not respond to his inquiries.A few, Mr. Clement knew, had already been approached by laboratories at Stanford and Boston University, which were collecting their own stashes of supercentenarian DNA.She already did her DNA donation, Paul Cooper, the grandson of Besse Cooper, a 116-year-old former suffragist, told Mr. Clement, who had driven several hundred miles to her Monroe, Ga., nursing home in 2012.Walter Breuning, of Great Falls, Mont., one of just a handful of men known to have lived to 114, replied in late 2010 that it was his preference not to risk winter meetings.He died early the next spring.An invitation to the 111th birthday party of James Sisnett in Barbados finally served as Mr. Clements entree in February 2011.He died two years later.Mr. Sisnett, who grew his own food until he was 105, was still fascinated by seeing a nice-looking backside when he was in his 110s, his daughter, Everine Carter, 88, recalled in a telephone interview.Losing Precious Samples The best time to get DNA from a supercentenarian, Mr. Clement found, is midmorning.By lunchtime, they would prefer to be eating.After lunch, they might be groggy or napping.Most, like Dorothy Peel of London, then 108, had sharp minds.Ms. Peel inspected the informed consent form through her reading glasses and peppered him with questions about other supercentenarians he had met.Photo Crisscrossing Europe in 2011, Mr. Clement hit his collecting stride.But there were some bumps.He had ordered an inexpensive kit that allowed him to prick a supercentenarians finger and deposit a drop of blood on a card to preserve it, often used by geneticists in the field.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Within a few months he had blood drops from 15 donors, including Ralph Tarrant of Sheffield, England, who at 108 completed the London Times crossword puzzle every afternoon.Not until he had switched to hiring a phlebotomist to perform blood draws with a needle did he learn that the cards with the original 15 samples were defective.We could not detect any DNA, read a 2011 email from the laboratory.Mr. Clement confessed the news to Dr. Church in a meeting at his Harvard office.You didnt test the cards?the geneticist asked him gently.Still, Mr. Clement had 23 good samples in hand, and the cost of sequencing by this time had fallen to some $15,000 per genome.With his remaining funds, he sequenced 15, leaving the rest in cold storage.Photo Mr. Clement quickly discovered 2,500 differences between the supercentenarian DNA and those of controls.But even with help from graduate students in Dr. Churchs lab, it was hard with such a small group to know which, if any, were significant.So over the next few years, Mr. Clement, working without a salary, collected samples whenever he could, adding another dozen from supercentenarians across the United States.In the spring of last year, a company Dr. Church had co-founded, Veritas Genetics, announced that it would sequence human genomes for $1,000 each.Dr. Church told Mr. Clement that Veritas would sequence the remaining samples, and so he set out to collect a few more.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advice From Americas Oldest Man Photo In July 2016, I was invited to accompany Mr. Clement to Mr. Matthewss home in California.As much as I looked forward to meeting my first supercentenarian, I was not prepared to envy his win in the genetic longevity lottery.I had feared he would be lonely, a concern echoed by several of the Facebook viewers who watched me ply him with questions over a live video stream the morning we met.I dont want to outlive my friends and family, one typed.Thats no fun.The prospect of shifting todays average life span to that of the known limit of all humanity is disorienting.An average life expectancy of 80 in some ways seems generous it was just 48 when Mr. Matthews was born in 1906.Most of us expect around 80 years on the planet, assuming nothing horrendous happens.When you have children the first time, it dont come with a manual, and it dont come with a manual when your dad gets to be 100, then 105, then 110, said Mr. Matthewss son, Steve, 75, who also gave blood the day we visited.But Mr. Matthews asserted without hesitation that he still enjoyed life.Pleasures included his lunchtime smoothie, his family, the kindness of his caregiver, and this with a nod to a New York Times photographer and a rakish grin having my picture taken.He reminisced fondly about his second wife, Katherine, who died in 1980 and with whom he had loved to dance.At 110, he said he had never been diagnosed with a serious illness.The younger Mr. Matthews recalled that his father had played a one-under-par, 18-hole golf game on his 99th birthday.Having built a successful real estate business, he provided financial support to his last surviving sibling, a sister who was 105.Talking to him, it was hard not to fantasize about the possibility that, as another Facebook participant suggested, by the time we get to that age, we may all be living to 110.At the time the oldest man in America, Mr. Matthews sometimes strained to hear, but his sense of humor and perspective were intact.If that was what we wanted, he advised, Keep breathing.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr.

The Dream Chaser Space Plane Takes Flight and Aces Its Landing:::::Advertisement Trilobites The Dream Chaser Space Plane Takes Flight and Aces Its Landing Image The crewless Dream Chaser lands at Edwards Air Force Base in California on Saturday after a successful test flight.Credit NASA/Sierra Nevada Corporation If you miss NASAs space shuttles, you might like the Dream Chaser.The compact space plane carries no crew, but will transport cargo to the International Space Station in the years ahead and conduct other missions in orbit around the Earth.On Saturday, the vehicle completed an important milestone in its development.A helicopter lifted Dream Chaser more than 2.3 miles off the ground, then dropped it.Over the course of one minute, the craft accelerated to 330 miles per hour, made a couple of turns and glided 10 miles to a runway at Edwards Air Force Base in California.It touched down at a speed of 191 miles per hour, rolling 4,200 feet before coming to a stop.The vehicle is in perfect shape, no issues, Mark N. Sirangelo, the head of Sierra Nevada Space Systems, the maker of the Dream Chaser, said in an interview.Mr. Sirangelo said he thought no more glide tests would be needed.If NASA agrees, the very next flight of the Dream Chaser might be a return from orbit two or three years from now at the end of a mission taking cargo to and from the space station.It is to land on the same runway at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida that the space shuttles once used.Image A helicopter lifted the Dream Chaser more than two miles off the ground, then dropped it.In a minute, the spacecraft accelerated to 330 miles per hour, made a couple of turns and glided 10 miles to the runway.Credit NASA/Sierra Nevada Corporation Last year, NASA awarded Sierra Nevada a contract for at least six cargo flights.The Dream Chaser is an autonomous, self-flying spacecraft, and this iteration will not carry any people.Saturdays test demonstrated that the software that guides the vehicle worked as designed.There was no problem with the landing gear, unlike the glide test four years ago when the left wheel never lowered and the Dream Chaser skidded off the runway.That mishap proved beneficial in retrospect.One of the cool things actually was that we proved how strong the vehicle was, Mr. Sirangelo said.The entire interior of the vehicle in the previous flight was undamaged.Sierra Nevada fixed the dings on its exterior, upgraded the landing gear and used the same vehicle for Saturdays test.If NASA agrees that this test was sufficient, the test vehicle will go into storage.The company will then focus on an update, already under construction, that will launch on top of an Atlas 5 rocket en route to the space station.NASA has not yet chosen a date for that flight, but Mr. Sirangelo said that it would likely be in the second quarter of 2020.Winged spacecraft offer some advantages over traditional capsules like the Russian Soyuz, which astronauts currently use to get to and from the space station, and the SpaceX Dragon, which is used to return experimental cargo to Earth The ride back to Earth on Dream Chaser would be gentler, less jarring to delicate scientific payloads like protein crystals grown in experiments aboard the space station.Dream Chaser can, in principle, land at any airport that can handle a 737 jet, and the returning cargo can be unloaded much more quickly.Sierra Nevada also hopes to use the Dream Chaser for non-NASA flights.The company has an agreement with the United Nations to carry 20 to 30 experiments from around the world to space aboard a Dream Chaser flight in 2021.Other missions could include repairing satellites in orbit and clearing out space debris.What remains on the back burner is a people-carrying version of Dream Chaser.Sierra Nevada originally developed the spacecraft hoping to win a contract to take astronauts to the space station.SpaceX and Boeing won the NASA contracts in 2014.Sierra Nevada came in third and was left out.Sign up for Science Times Well bring you stories that capture the wonders of the human body, nature and the cosmos.SEE SAMPLE Please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.* Required field You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times products and services.You are already subscribed to this email.Sign Up
Wine From Prehistoric Georgia With an 8,000-Year-Old Vintage:::::Georgia had always suspected it had a Neolithic wine, there were several claims, said David Lordkipanidze, the general director of the Georgian National Museum and an author on the paper.But now there is real evidence.Photo To uncork the mystery of the oldest wine, Dr. McGovern and his team searched the remains of two villages from the Neolithic era or the last part of the Stone Age about 30 miles south of the capital, Tbilisi.Clay vessels found at these Neolithic sites and others in Georgia suggest the people most likely stored their wine in large, round jars as big as 300 liters, enough to hold about 400 bottles.They also probably buried them underground to ferment, which is still practiced in Georgia to this day.The team retrieved several jar shards from the sites, which they then chemically analyzed.To their surprise, eight had telltale signs of wine residue long absorbed into the pottery, including tartaric acid, which is like a flashing neon light indicating traces of grape, as well as malic, succinic and citric acids.Dr. McGovern said that to his knowledge, the combination of these four acids is found only in grape wine.Radiocarbon dating of the site dated jar shards to the years 6,000 to 5,800 B.C.The team also found traces of ancient grape pollen, starch from grape wine and remains from Neolithic fruit flies.They did not find any DNA or pigments on the residue, so they could not say whether it was red or white wine.More Reporting on Archaeology Although it is possible these prehistoric people were just making grape juice, Stephen Batiuk, an archaeologist from the University of Toronto and an author on the study, said the decorations on the jars implied they were used to store something important, like wine.Robert Desalle, a molecular biologist at the American Museum of Natural History and co-author of the book A Natural History of Wine, called the study airtight, adding that the findings will prompt him to rewrite the chapter in his book about the oldest site for winemaking.Andrew Waterhouse, a wine chemist at the University of California, Davis, agreed, saying that finding succinic acid indicated that fermentation had taken place.But he suggested that humanitys love affair with wine most likely extended deeper into the archaeological record.The animal hides probably used by even earlier prehistoric peoples who fermented grapes into wine most likely decayed over thousands of years, so pottery remains our best bet for discovering how humanity first got buzzed.
Debating Whether Reptiles or Amphibians Should Be House Pets:::::Collector demand for rare animals means some suppliers seek threatened, new or unclassified species in the wild, a trend that has become so problematic that scientists withhold details about the locations of species they study in publications for fear of poaching.To bypass international trade regulations, collectors may pass off wild animals as captive-bred.Overexploitation also becomes a problem when demand is high and wild animals are cheaper to capture than breed.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Captive breeding is favored over wild capture because of conservation concerns.But it isnt perfect and may introduce problems, like increased susceptibility to disease in some species or contributing to demand for animals falsely claimed to be captive-bred.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In your home, its hard to read the demands of stone-faced herps evolved for wild living.They need proper temperature, humidity, food, lighting and exercise, and have other species-specific psychological and social requirements.If you meet these needs, you must accept that your pet could grow quite big and live a couple decades.If you dont, yours will probably die in its first year, like 75 percent of pet reptiles and amphibians brought home as pets.Reptiles and amphibians dont make good pets and should not be part of the pet trade, said Lorelei Tibbetts, a vet technician and manager at The Center for Avian and Exotic Medicine in New York.Most of the time, animal patients come to her with metabolic or reproductive issues related to improper nutrition, husbandry and life in captivity.Its really not possible for us to care for these animals in order for them to thrive and live a decent life, she said.People may neglect pet reptiles and amphibians no more than common pets.But even the best environments will result in controlled deprivation, as is also the case with caged birds and rabbits, or fish in tanks, wrote Dr. Pasmans in his review.Just as many pet owners provide a high standard of care for dogs, cats, birds or fish, it is possible, with a lot of effort, to properly look after some reptiles and amphibians in homes, he adds.For instance, bearded dragons adapt rather well to captivity.Photo Clifford Warwick, a consulting biologist on exotic animal welfare and lead author of a viewpoint in the journal, said we cant provide proper care because we dont know what many species need.Even when we do, misinformation on the internet leads pet owners astray.Its easy to buy a cute pet on impulse, but when people find out how much trouble they are, they turn them loose, said Ms. Leahy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Generally, the limited options for dealing with unwanted exotic pets means many owners just release them.Discarded pets can wreak havoc on nonnative ecosystems.That red-eared slider in my cart from Mississippi is a huge problem in Europe and Asia.And Florida is dealing with the biggest invasive species problem on the planet, mostly because of the pet trade.There, iguanas have destroyed concrete infrastructure and Burmese pythons have eaten protected and common species, setting off a disease-spreading chain reaction.Despite all these concerns, reptile and amphibian owners arent going to disappear any sooner than dog, cat or bird owners.In the past, people have summoned emotional arguments to single out slick-skinned exotic pets with bad reputations.But the animals arent as harmful as the harm inherent in trading them.The contributors to the review hope that by heeding scientific arguments, rules about reptile ownership will be conceived of fairly.

That’s When the Trouble Starts.:::::Photo A bouncy foot bridge is charming until it isnt.This was the case for Brooklyns Squibb Park Bridge in 2014, Londons Millennium Bridge in 2000 and a long list of other bridges throughout history that became worrisomely wobbly when large crowds crossed over them.Authorities temporarily closed the Squibb Park and Millennium bridges and spent millions of dollars on repairs.What gives?Engineers expect all bridges to move a little with cars, people and wind.But when things get dangerous, like during the Millennium Bridge opening, you can blame it on the interactions between moving crowds and bridges, scientists suggest in a study published Friday in the journal Science Advances.Photo Movements of bridges and people feed off one another, Igor Belykh, an applied mathematician at Georgia State University, who led the study, explained.You step on a bridge, it moves a little bit; you adjust to steady yourself.And on and on.However when the bridge starts wobbling significantly, I, as a pedestrian, have to adjust my gait, he said.And when a critical number of people try to find balance at the same time and their movements sync up, they can align with the sway of the bridge.And thats when things get scary.Researchers had attributed the wobbly Millennium Bridge to this phenomenon, which they call phase-locking.The new study confirmed that and challenged a popular belief that the sway gradually grew with crowd size.They found that the wobble starts suddenly, after the crowd exceeds a critical threshold.For the Millennium Bridge, that was about 165 people.Photo Dr. Belykh and his colleagues described these dynamic relationships using complex mathematical models which they jokingly call crash test dummies that they hope will become part of industry standards.Using these models, engineers and designers may be able to plug in all the details about a bridge and its potential pedestrians and figure out how big a crowd must get before a bridge starts to wobble.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What exactly causes the initial wobbling, though, is something the researchers are still trying to figure out.It may have something to do with how you might switch your gait to find balance, taking wider steps, moving from side to side and lifting your legs more.They describe pedestrians moving in this manner as non-smooth oscillators in their models.More Reporting on Mathematics Every time you step, you push the ground one way, then the other.If youre on a bridge, you push it too.This causes it to sway.You respond.It sways.And so on.Now imagine a whole bunch of you in a crowd hundreds of non-smooth oscillators.The timing of your steps, and the force they put on the bridge are important to what happens with wobbliness.This might also explain cases of wobbly bridges that didnt show visual signs of crowds syncing up steps, like the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, England, where authorities limited pedestrian traffic during the citys busy annual Balloon Fiesta.The researchers are currently collaborating with scientists in England and the United States to see if this is the case and if visual signals could help orchestrate crowd movements to prevent or stop bridges from wobbling.
Dinosaurs Might Not Be Extinct Had the Asteroid Struck Elsewhere:::::Photo Dinosaurs reigned supreme for more than 160 million years.Their dynasty came to a cataclysmic close 66 million years ago when an asteroid crashed into the Yucatn Peninsula in Mexico at a site now known as the Chicxulub crater, paving the way for mammals and eventually humans to inherit the Earth.But had the extraterrestrial impact happened nearly anywhere else, like in the ocean or in the middle of most continents, some scientists now say it is possible dinosaurs could have survived annihilation.Only 13 percent of the Earths surface harbored the ingredients necessary to turn the cosmic collision into this specific mass extinction event, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.I think dinosaurs could still be alive today, if the asteroid had landed elsewhere, Kunio Kaiho, a paleontologist from Tohoku University in Japan and lead author on the study, said in an email.Other researchers questioned their findings.When the asteroid, which had a diameter about half the length of Manhattan, struck the coast of Mexico, it found a rich source of sulfur and hydrocarbons, or organic deposits like fossil fuels, according to the researchers.Scorching hot temperatures at the impact crater would have ignited the fuel.The combustion would have spewed soot and sulfur into the stratosphere in sufficient quantities to blot out the sun and change the climate, setting into motion the collapse of entire ecosystems and the extinction of three-quarters of all species on Earth.Photo The Chicxulub impact spewed an extraordinary amount of black carbon, or soot, from the rocks, the researchers said.That in turn launched nearly 60 Hoover Dams worth of soot into the upper atmosphere, cooling the Earths surface by as much as 18 degrees Fahrenheit, they said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Not every place on the planet has the same amount of fossil fuel reserves and sulfur trapped beneath its surface.Locations with less hydrocarbons would have jetted less soot into the sky upon impact and created a smaller cooling effect around the globe.So Dr. Kaiho set out to determine the mass extinction hot spots in the Mesozoic real estate market.
NASA’s Rocket to Deep Space May Not Be Ready Until 2020:::::This earlier launch date is reasonable and challenges the teams to stay focused on tasks without creating undue pressure, William H. Gerstenmaier, NASAs associate administrator for human exploration and operations, said at a hearing of the House space subcommittee on Thursday.Furthermore, NASA is taking additional steps to reduce schedule risks for both known and unknown issues and protect for the earliest possible launch date.At the request of the Trump administration, NASA examined the possibility of putting astronauts aboard the rockets first flight.But that would have further pushed back the launch date and added as much as $900 million to the programs price tag.NASA and the administration decided to stick with the original plan.A crewless flight also allows more thorough testing, closer to the edge of the capabilities of the Orion capsule, the separate spacecraft carried by the rocket where astronauts will eventually be seated.Photo Mr. Gerstenmaier told Congress that the additional delay for the first flight adds less than 15 percent to the cost of the rocket and slightly more than that for ground systems.The delays have been caused in part by technological hiccups as well as factors out of NASAs control, like a tornado striking the Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana, where parts of the rocket are being built, in February.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He said that NASA is still on track for the first flight with astronauts in 2023.The rocket could also be used in the early 2020s to propel a robotic probe to Jupiter to study Europa, a moon with a vast ocean under its icy crust that is thought to be one of the most promising places in the solar system to look for life.Mr. Gerstenmaier said the agency would soon a provide a framework of NASAs plans beyond 2023.A report this week from NASAs inspector general highlighted problems that the program still faces including very tight budget reserves.NASA also remains without a permanent leader since Charles F. Bolden Jr. stepped down as administrator on President Trumps Inauguration Day.The 293 days that have passed since are the longest that NASA has been without a permanent administrator.
Protesters Jeer as Trump Team Promotes Coal at U.N. Climate Talks:::::The American presentation came the same day that a new study showed that emissions were rising worldwide after three years on a plateau.Researchers said the emissions growth was driven largely by increased burning of coal in China and India.The question is not if we will continue to use coal, but how, said Holly Krutka, vice president of coal generation and emissions technologies at Peabody Energy.Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who has spent tens of millions of dollars on a campaign to shut down coal plants, said, Promoting coal at a climate summit is like promoting tobacco at a cancer summit.Mr. Bloomberg, who is attending part of the Bonn conference, this week donated $50 million to environmental groups to help countries shift away from coal, starting in Europe.Photo While many energy experts agree that technologies like carbon capture for coal plants and nuclear power can play a critical role in reducing emissions, the fact that Trump administration officials have played down concern over global warming has triggered deep suspicion about American intentions.Nuclear and carbon capture are critical to reducing CO 2 emissions, but going to Bonn to promote the technologies without admitting climate change is a crisis is a logical absurdity, said Josh Freed, director of the clean energy program at the centrist think tank Third Way.He said that denying that climate change is a problem while pushing technology to solve it made no sense.Why would anyone trust or work with you?he said.Several American lawmakers who flew to Germany for the climate change talks denounced the coal discussion.Gov.Jay Inslee of Washington, a Democrat, pre-empted the White House event by striding into the packed conference room and calling it a sideshow that the rest of the world would ignore.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its a total distraction, said Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank based in Washington.Still, Mr.Steer acknowledged, countries throughout Asia and Africa are continuing to build coal plants in their quest to provide energy access for millions living without electricity.This is not wickedness on the part of these countries that want to get cheaper energy, he said.Trump administration officials made a similar point.We need to lift one billion plus people out of energy poverty, Mr. Banks said.He argued that while renewable energy has a bright future, only fossil fuels at the moment can deliver enough energy to allow people to rise out of poverty.Yet even as the Trump administration pushes for a revival of the coal industry, other countries say they are phasing it out.France has vowed to eliminate coal from its electricity mix by 2022, and Italy by 2025.The United Kingdom and Canada said this week that they, too, would take steps to phase out coal.Were passed the time that we want to be using coal, said Catherine McKenna, Canadas environment minister.People do not want polluting coal.They do not want it.Some developing countries described a more balanced view, however, conceding a need for fossil fuels in the short term while ultimately calling for stronger global action on climate change and a shift toward cleaner forms of energy, including renewables like wind and solar energy.Officials from Bangladesh, which still gets most of its electricity from natural gas and has plans to build 25 new coal-fired plants by 2022, said they would welcome the use of technology to improve the efficiency of their coal plants as a steppingstone toward renewable energy.Keep in mind that this is a developing country that has a huge need for electricity, said Muhammad Azizul Haque, a deputy secretary in Bangladeshs Environment Ministry.So there has to be balance, its not just saying, O.K., well go for renewables.Its very complicated, because people need energy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Pakistan, for its part, has begun importing more liquefied natural gas in order to reduce its reliance on burning coal and oil for electricity, said Tariq Banuri, executive director of Pakistans Global Change Impact Study Center.Those imports have helped offset 1 percent of the countrys emissions.Mr. Banuri said that Pakistans emissions were likely to grow in the coming decades as it lifts itself out of poverty, though the country is also making a big push on renewable energy and could do more if wealthier nations provided more aid to help drive down the cost of wind and solar even further.But any nuanced discussions of energy policy were overshadowed by anger at the Trump administration for disengaging from the global community on climate change.During a question-and-answer session, audience members pressed American officials to clarify the White Houses stance on climate change.Climate mitigation is an important goal of the United States, Mr. Banks said, but I dont think its any surprise that economic security and energy security are higher priorities.
A Race to Save 10 Stranded Whales:::::The team seems to be determined to work during night time to release the remaining whales, Whale Stranding Indonesia reported.Two more whales were released just before sunrise, the group said, according to an official from the Center for Coastal and Marine Resources Management, the regional marine and fisheries authority in Indonesia.Photo Time was of the essence in this situation, in part because whales that come near land are at risk of suffocation and organ failure.If youre 60,000 pounds and your body is meant to float around then gravity can take its toll, said Regina Asmutis-Silvia, the director of the North American office of Whale and Dolphins Conservation, a nonprofit that has assisted with whale strandings in the United States.In addition, the shock of being stranded evokes a stress response.Elevated levels of adrenaline also take toll on the organs, Ms. Asmutis-Silvia said.Its similar to that of a human that has been in a car accident, she added.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Its unclear why the pod of whales swam so close to shore.Sperm whales, which are listed as an endangered species, are the largest of the toothed whales.They are not usually found in waters less than 984 feet deep, and prefer areas two times deeper than that, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries.In February, more than 650 pilot whales became stranded at the northern tip of South Island in New Zealand for reasons that were also unknown, and about 400 of them died.Pathologists hoped to find answers by studying some of the dead animals.And in April, officials said they were investigating an alarming number of humpback whale strandings along the Atlantic coast.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There are multiple reasons these events can happen, Ms. Asmutis-Silvia said, including navigational error, changes in the environment, a wayward hunt for food or tidal changes.Sperm whales tend to travel as a group and are unlikely to abandon their podmates.When theyre in tight social groups theyre in this together, Ms. Asmutis-Silvia said.Whales are especially important to the ecosystem, she said, because their waste fertilizes phytoplankton, the plants that produce half the worlds oxygen.
Yale Professors Race Google and IBM to the First Quantum Computer:::::Quantum computing systems are difficult to understand because they do not behave like the everyday world we live in.But this counterintuitive behavior is what allows them to perform calculations at rate that would not be possible on a typical computer.Todays computers store information as bits, with each transistor holding either a 1 or a 0.But thanks to something called the superposition principle behavior exhibited by subatomic particles like electrons and photons, the fundamental particles of light a quantum bit, or qubit, can store a 1 and a 0 at the same time.This means two qubits can hold four values at once.As you expand the number of qubits, the machine becomes exponentially more powerful.Todd Holmdahl, who oversees the quantum project at Microsoft, said he envisioned a quantum computer as something that could instantly find its way through a maze.A typical computer will try one path and get blocked and then try another and another and another, he said.A quantum computer can try all paths at the same time.The trouble is that storing information in a quantum system for more than a short amount of time is very difficult, and this short coherence time leads to errors in calculations.But over the past two decades, Mr. Schoelkopf and other physicists have worked to solve this problem using what are called superconducting circuits.They have built qubits from materials that exhibit quantum properties when cooled to extremely low temperatures.With this technique, they have shown that, every three years or so, they can improve coherence times by a factor of 10.This is known as Schoelkopfs Law, a playful ode to Moores Law, the rule that says the number of transistors on computer chips will double every two years.Photo Schoelkopfs Law started as a joke, but now we use it in many of our research papers, said Isaac Chuang, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.No one expected this would be possible, but the improvement has been exponential.These superconducting circuits have become the primary area of quantum computing research across the industry.One of Mr. Schoelkopfs former students now leads the quantum computing program at IBM.The founder of Rigetti Computing studied with Michel Devoret, one of the other Yale professors behind Quantum Circuits.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In recent months, after grabbing a team of top researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara, Google indicated it is on the verge of using this method to build a machine that can achieve quantum supremacy when a quantum machine performs a task that would be impossible on your laptop or any other machine that obeys the laws of classical physics.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.There are other areas of research that show promise.Microsoft, for example, is betting on particles known as anyons.But superconducting circuits appear likely to be the first systems that will bear real fruit.The belief is that quantum machines will eventually analyze the interactions between physical molecules with a precision that is not possible today, something that could radically accelerate the development of new medications.Google and others also believe that these systems can significantly accelerate machine learning, the field of teaching computers to learn tasks on their own by analyzing data or experiments with certain behavior.A quantum computer could also be able to break the encryption algorithms that guard the worlds most sensitive corporate and government data.With so much at stake, it is no surprise that so many companies are betting on this technology, including start-ups like Quantum Circuits.The deck is stacked against the smaller players, because the big-name companies have so much more money to throw at the problem.But start-ups have their own advantages, even in such a complex and expensive area of research.Small teams of exceptional people can do exceptional things, said Bill Coughran, who helped oversee the creation of Googles vast internet infrastructure and is now investing in Mr. Schoelkopfs company as a partner at Sequoia.I have yet to see large teams inside big companies doing anything tremendously innovative.Though Quantum Circuits is using the same quantum method as its bigger competitors, Mr. Schoelkopf argued that his company has an edge because it is tackling the problem differently.Rather than building one large quantum machine, it is constructing a series of tiny machines that can be networked together.He said this will make it easier to correct errors in quantum calculations one of the main difficulties in building one of these complex machines.But each of the big companies insist that they hold an advantage and each is loudly trumpeting its progress, even if a working machine is still years away.Mr. Coughran said that he and Sequoia envision Quantum Circuits evolving into a company that can deliver quantum computing to any business or researcher that needs it.Another investor, Canaans Brendan Dickinson, said that if a company like this develops a viable quantum machine, it will become a prime acquisition target.The promise of a large quantum computer is incredibly powerful, Mr. Dickinson said.It will solve problems we cant even imagine right now.
Under New Guidelines, Millions More Americans Will Need to Lower Blood Pressure:::::If Americans act on the guidelines and lower their blood pressure by exercising more and eating a healthier diet, or with drug therapy, they could drive an already falling death rate from heart attacks and stroke even lower, experts said.Now, high blood pressure will be defined as 130/80 millimeters of mercury or greater for anyone with a significant risk of heart attack or stroke.The previous guidelines defined high blood pressure as 140/90.(The first number describes the pressure on blood vessels when the heart contracts, and the second refers to the pressure as the heart relaxes between beats.)Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death among Americans.The new criteria, the first official diagnostic revision since 2003, result from growing evidence that blood pressure far lower than had been considered normal greatly reduces the chances of heart attack and stroke, as well as the overall risk of death.Recent research indicates this is true even among older people for whom intensive treatment had been thought too risky.That finding, from a large federal study in 2015, caught many experts by surprise and set the stage for the new revision.That calculation must be individualized, and experts are recommending that patients use a calculator developed by the guidelines committee at ccccalculator.ccctracker.com.Nearly half of all American adults, and nearly 80 percent of those aged 65 and older, will find that they qualify and will need to take steps to reduce their blood pressure.Even under the relatively more lenient standard that had prevailed for years, close to half of patients did not manage to get their blood pressure down to normal.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Is it going to affect a lot of people, and is it going to be hard to meet those blood pressure goals?asked Dr. Raymond Townsend, director of the hypertension program at Penn Medicine.The answer is a pretty significant yes.According to the new guidelines, anyone with at least a 10 percent risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next decade should aim for blood pressure below 130/80.But simply being age 65 or older brings a 10 percent risk of cardiovascular trouble, and so effectively everyone over that age will have to shoot for the new target.Younger patients with this level of risk include those with conditions like heart disease, kidney disease or diabetes.The new standard will apply to them, as well.People whose risk of heart attack or stroke is less than 10 percent will be told to aim for blood pressure below 140/90, a more lenient standard, and to take medications if necessary to do so.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If there is any good news for patients here, it is that nearly all the drugs used to treat high blood pressure are generic now.Many cost pennies a day, and most people can take them without side effects.In formulating the guidelines, the expert committee reviewed more than 1,000 research reports.But the change is due largely to convincing data from a federal study published in 2015.That study, called Sprint, explored whether markedly lower blood pressure in older people lower than researchers had ever tried to establish might be both achievable and beneficial.The investigators assigned more than 9,300 men and women ages 50 and older who were at high risk of heart disease to one of two targets: a systolic pressure (the higher of the two blood pressure measures) of less than 120, or a systolic pressure of less than 140.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In participants who were assigned to get their systolic pressures below 120, the incidence of heart attacks, heart failure and strokes fell by a third, and the risk of death fell by nearly a quarter.Those patients ended up taking three drugs on average, instead of two, yet experienced no more side effects or complications than subjects in the other group.Some experts in geriatrics had expected many more complications among older patients receiving more intense treatment, especially increased dizziness, falls and dehydration.Instead, the benefits for older people were impressive.With a lower risk of heart attacks and strokes, they were more likely to maintain their independence.They had half the rate of disability, said Dr. Jeff Williamson, head of the Sticht Center on Aging at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center and the only geriatrician on the committee drawing up the new guidelines.But more intensive drug treatment in so many more patients may increase rates of kidney disease, some experts fear.In the Sprint trial, the incidence of acute kidney injury was twice as high in the group receiving drugs to reduce their systolic pressure to 120.Although the lower goal was better for the heart, it wasnt better for the kidney, said Dr. Townsend of Penn Medicine, who is a kidney specialist.So yeah, Im worried.While agreeing that lower blood pressure is better, Dr. J. Michael Gaziano, a preventive cardiologist at Brigham and Womens Hospital and the VA Boston, worries about having doctors and patients fixating on a particular goal.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its true, he said, that doctors ought to be more aggressive in treating people at high risk.But, he added, If a patient comes in with a blood pressure of 180, I will not get him to 130.Lifestyle changes like diet and exercise can help many patients lower blood pressure.But many of the newly diagnosed are likely to wind up on drugs, said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale University.This is a big change that will end up labeling many more people with hypertension and recommending drug treatment for many more people, he said.The current treatment strategy has not been so successful for many patients, he noted.How they tolerate drugs, whether they want to pursue lower levels, are all choices and should not be dictated to them, said Dr. Krumholz.Or we will have the same situation as today many prescriptions that go unfilled and pills untaken.
She Took On Colombia’s Soda Industry. Then She Was Silenced.:::::But public health organizations, including the W.H.O., cite soda taxes as one of the most effective policy tools for cutting consumption of what nutritionists call a liquid candy that has contributed to an epidemic of obesity and related health conditions around the world.Dr. Kathryn Backholer, an expert on the issue at Deakin University in Australia, said taxes on soda were low-hanging fruit in the fight against obesity, diabetes and other weight-related diseases because such drinks are easily categorized to tax and sensible to target because they have little or no nutritional value.Dr. Backholer and other experts said the turning point for soda tax proponents came in 2014, when Mexico Coca-Colas biggest consumer market by per capita consumption approved a 10 percent tax.Mexico also showcased how dirty the fight could get.Last year, numerous advocates of a proposal to double Mexicos tax to 20 percent received strings of upsetting and fraudulent texts from unknown numbers.One man got a message saying his daughter had been seriously injured; another found a text saying his wife was having an affair; a third received a link to a funeral home.Spyware was found on the phones.The proposal failed.Elsewhere in the world, soda companies have assiduously worked their government connections and economic clout.In internal company emails leaked to an American watchdog group last year, Coke executives described strategies for winning over government ministers and other officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, Portugal, and regions of Spain.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Australian Beverages Council wrote in its 2016 annual report that fighting a soft drinks tax has been consuming vast amounts of resources, and that our learnings from other markets through our international network tells us that these types of threats must be constantly challenged before they get before a parliament for debate.In Colombia, where soda is often cheaper than bottled water, the soda-tax fight took place in a key market for beverage makers.Sales volume of carbonated drinks here has climbed more than 25 percent over the past 15 years; during that same time in the United States, it fell 12 percent, according to Euromonitor, a market research firm.Coke and Pepsi were far less visible in the Colombia battle, leaving the big national beverage company, Postobn, in the spotlight.Postobn, a drinks maker and distributor for Pepsi, is part of a huge conglomerate that includes sugar cane growers, sugar mills and the countrys biggest media company, RCN Televisin, which helped disseminate the anti-tax message.Postobn and RCN declined interview requests.The stage was set for a clash between a powerful industry and a stubborn public advocate.Showdown Over an Ad In early 2016, Colombia, a nation of 49 million, was facing the unfamiliar prospect of stability and peace.After decades of civil war and narco-terrorism, Colombians were enjoying the fruits of an aggressive United States-backed military campaign that had largely decimated the countrys drug cartels.Unemployment was near historic lows, the poverty rate was dropping and millions were hopeful about the possibility of lasting peace with the countrys main rebel group, the FARC.In March 2016, the countrys health minister, Alejandro Gaviria Uribe, proposed a 20 percent tax on soda and sugar-sweetened beverages the equivalent of about 10 cents on a liter bottle that became part of a larger tax overhaul backed by Colombias president and the Ministry of Finance.For the first time in our lives, we thought we might become a normal country and be able to deal with issues other than violence, said Diana Guarnizo, a lawyer with Dejusticia, a rights group that helped promote the soda tax.Here we were, an organization that had dealt with peace, violence, land reform and gross injustice, and suddenly we had the luxury to talk about what mothers are putting in their childrens lunchboxes.The measure was designed to inject $340 million a year into Colombias chronically underfunded national health care system, but Mr. Gaviria had a larger goal: to dampen soda consumption in a country with an obesity rate that had tripled since 1980 to 19 percent of adults.The fastest growth had occurred among Colombian youth from ages 5 to 17.Each year, 4,000 people age 30 to 70 die from obesity-related illnesses like heart disease and diabetes, the Health Ministry said.
The Bonn Climate Conference: What You Need to Know:::::Here are answers to the five biggest questions about Bonn, including: Whats the best-case scenario?And what might set off a fight?Here are five world leaders, or sets of leaders, who are emerging as climate change champions as the United States disengages.Photo Two years after Paris, the world is still off track Under the Paris deal, nearly 200 countries submitted proposals for cutting their greenhouse gas emissions.Yet not one of the major industrialized nations is on course to hit those goals.And even those goals are just a starting point emissions would have to be cut even further to stop global average temperatures from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels, the point at which scientists say drastic consequences will be unavoidable.Where do the countries stand now, what have they pledged and what will they eventually need to achieve?These charts lay it out: Separately, a study released on Monday was another indication that the world has not turned the corner on cutting emissions.Industrial emissions had been steady for the past three years, but are projected to rise to record highs this year: The United States is in an awkward position The Trump administration has sent a delegation to Bonn, but the American negotiators will be hashing out the details of a climate deal that President Trump has vowed to abandon like a spouse who demands a divorce but then continues to live at home, as our reporter Lisa Friedman put it.A shadow American delegation is also at the talks, led by former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Gov.Jerry Brown of California, who have vowed that states, cities and businesses are still in the Paris agreement, even if the federal government is not.The Trump administration is also sending representatives from energy companies to promote coal, natural gas and nuclear power.Mr. Trump has pledged to support those industries, but the presentation may receive a frosty reception, given that emissions from fossil fuels are a primary driver of global warming and some environmentalists shun nuclear energy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Syria announced last week that it would join the Paris climate accord, meaning that every country in the world has now signed on to the pact or intends to join and only one, the United States, has signaled its intention to withdraw from it.(Nicaragua, another holdout, said last month that it would join the agreement.)On the Friday before the conference opened, 13 federal agencies released a comprehensive scientific report that affirmed that humans are to blame for most of the global warming that has occurred since the start of the 20th century.That will not surprise anyone at the Bonn conference but it does directly contradict statements from some top Trump administration officials.Photo Heres some of our best climate coverage this year The Bonn conference is a good occasion to catch up on some climate change reading.We answered 17 often-asked questions about climate change.If youre looking for a climate F.A.Q., look no further.You can even send us your questions at the bottom.There is no silver bullet for climate change, but you might be surprised by a particular solution that would be more effective than others.See if you can guess which one it is.We went to Antarctica to see its flowing ice sheets for ourselves, and to learn about what they might portend.Read our Antarctic Dispatches here, and take yourself there in virtual reality.We also went to Alaska, and found out that its permafrost is no longer permanent.And as it thaws, it is dumping carbon into the atmosphere.Arctic sea ice is disappearing, too.Take a look at the trend in this chart.(It will be pretty easy to spot.)Shifting from ice to heat: Summers are getting hotter.You arent imagining it, and it wasnt always this way.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In those hotter summers, the most extreme hot days with highs of 95 degrees Fahrenheit, or 35 degrees Celsius are expected to multiply.And if countries renege on their Paris pledges and take no action, it will be even worse.Could you fix the worlds carbon budget?This feature from The Timess Opinion Pages lets you try.And here are six maps that explain how Americans think about climate change.It turns out that people agree on certain issues more than you might expect.
Floating Cities, No Longer Science Fiction, Begin to Take Shape:::::Earlier this year, the government of French Polynesia agreed to let the Seasteading Institute begin testing in its waters.Construction could begin soon, and the first floating buildings the nucleus of a city might be inhabitable in just a few years.If you could have a floating city, it would essentially be a start-up country, said Joe Quirk, president of the Seasteading Institute.We can create a huge diversity of governments for a huge diversity of people.The term seasteading has been around since at least 1981, when the avid sailor Ken Neumeyer wrote a book, Sailing the Farm, that discussed living sustainably aboard a sailboat.Two decades later, the idea attracted the attention of Patri Friedman, the grandson of the economist Milton Friedman, who seized on the notion.Mr. Friedman, a freethinker who had founded intentional communities while in college, was living in Silicon Valley at the time and was inspired to think big.So in 2008 he quit his job at Google and co-founded the Seasteading Institute with seed funding from Peter Thiel, the libertarian billionaire.In a 2009 essay, Mr. Thiel described seasteading as a long shot, but one worth taking.Between cyberspace and outer space lies the possibility of settling the oceans, he wrote.The investment from Mr. Thiel generated a flurry of media attention, but for several years after its founding, the Seasteading Institute did not amount to much.A prototype planned for San Francisco Bay in 2010 never materialized, and seasteading became a punch line to jokes about the techno-utopian fantasies gone awry, even becoming a plotline in the HBO series Silicon Valley.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But over the years, the core idea behind seasteading that a floating city in international waters might give people a chance to redesign society and government steadily attracted more adherents.In 2011, Mr. Quirk, an author, was at Burning Man when he first heard about seasteading.He was intrigued by the idea and spent the next year learning about the concept.For Mr. Quirk, Burning Man, where innovators gather, was not just his introduction to seasteading.It was a model for the kind of society that seasteading might enable.Anyone who goes to Burning Man multiple times become fascinated by the way that rules dont observe their usual parameters, he said.The next year, he was back at Burning Man speaking about seasteading in a geodesic dome.Soon after that, he became involved with the Seasteading Institute, took over as president and, with Mr. Friedman, wrote Seasteading: How Floating Nations Will Restore The Environment, Enrich The Poor, Cure The Sick and Liberate Humanity From Politicians.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Seasteading is more than a fanciful hobby to Mr. Quirk and others involved in the effort.It is, in their minds, an opportunity to rewrite the rules that govern society.Governments just dont get better, Mr. Quirk said.Theyre stuck in previous centuries.Thats because land incentivizes a violent monopoly to control it.No land, no more conflict, the thinking goes.Even if the Seasteading Institute is able to start a handful of sustainable structures, theres no guarantee that a utopian community will flourish.People fight about much more than land, of course, and pirates have emerged as a menace in certain regions.And though maritime law suggests that seasteading may have a sound legal basis, it is impossible to know how real governments might respond to new neighbors floating offshore.Mr. Quirk and his team are focusing on their Floating Island Project in French Polynesia.The government is creating what is effectively a special economic zone for the Seasteading Institute to experiment in and has offered 100 acres of beachfront where the group can operate.Mr. Quirk and his collaborators created a new company, Blue Frontiers, which will build and operate the floating islands in French Polynesia.The goal is to build about a dozen structures by 2020, including homes, hotels, offices and restaurants, at a cost of about $60 million.To fund the construction, the team is working on an initial coin offering.If all goes as planned, the structures will feature living roofs, use local wood, bamboo and coconut fiber, and recycled metal and plastic.I want to see floating cities by 2050, thousands of them hopefully, each of them offering different ways of governance, Mr. Quirk said.The more people moving among them, the more choices well have and the more likely it is we can have peace prosperity and innovation.
Trump Health Agency Challenges Consensus on Reducing Costs:::::In September, the department released an outline of a new direction for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, set up by the Affordable Care Act to test models aimed at improving medical care and reducing costs.While the Obama administration had pushed large, mandatory experiments to test new models of pay, the Trump administration wants to encourage smaller, voluntary programs and has asked the doctors to help design them.Clearly a great big foot has been put on the brake, said Donald Crane, the chief executive of CAPG, a group of doctors and hospital administrators that, unlike many in the profession, has pushed to tie physician pay to quality measures rather than the old model of fee for service.Mr. Crane was referring specifically to the scaling back of the cardiac and joint replacement programs by Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon and Republican former congressman chosen by Mr. Trump as secretary of health and human services.Mr. Price, who resigned in September over his use of expensive private jets, had accused the Obama administration of trying to commandeer clinical decision-making by forcing doctors to participate in experiments that test new ways of paying for care.Mr. Trump is said to be close to appointing a successor possibly Alex Azar, a former pharmaceutical company executive who worked in the Department of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush and doctors groups will be watching carefully to see if the agency continues in the same direction.Already, other administration officials have signaled support for protecting doctors and giving them more say.The agencys Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, led by Seema Verma, has suggested it will accept more recommendations than it did in the past from a committee of doctors formed by the American Medical Association on how much Medicare should pay for services and procedures essentially letting doctors set their own pay.Ms. Vermas agency also issued the call for changing the direction of the innovation center.The formal request for information proposed, among other potential changes, allowing doctors and hospitals to contract directly with Medicare patients.This would allow doctors and other providers to propose their own prices, moving toward a long-held Republican goal of so-called premium pricing.Research has shown that the traditional model of paying doctors, known as fee for service, often results in unnecessary or inappropriate care.The federal government has been slowly moving away from it since 1983, when Medicare changed some of its payments to hospitals.But the changes now pushed by H.H.S.are a renunciation of the Obama administration in particular.It had sought to shift 30 percent of fee-for-service Medicare payments to alternative payments based on quality or value by 2016 a goal it achieved and 50 percent by 2018.To do so, it required doctors and hospitals in many regions of the country to adopt those new payment models.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Canceling mandatory bundled payments for cardiac and orthopedic procedures was a pet project for Mr. Price, who had fought against what he saw as unnecessary government intervention since his days as a surgeon in the suburbs north of Atlanta.Mr. Price defended the old model in front of thousands of doctors and medical administrators gathered in June for the annual meeting of CAPG, the group pushing for new payment models, arguing that the health care system in the United States the finest, he said, in the world had developed around it.So we ought to recognize, he told the group, that fee for service may not be the end of the world.Photo Many in the health care field criticized some of the rules issued by the Obama administration as overly prescriptive and welcomed the departments effort to review them.Many experiments that the Obama administration launched were overly micromanaged, said Grace-Marie Turner, an opponent of the health law and president of the Galen Institute, a research center that advocates free-market health policies.Innovation has to percolate up from the bottom.The Obama administration tried to drive it from the top.Even with Mr. Prices departure, the department still has numerous people who have advocated strongly for doctors and industry in the past.They include senior staff members who have worked representing medical device makers, pharmaceutical and hospital supply companies, the nursing home industry and physician specialty groups.The acting secretary of health and human services, Eric Hargan, is a former lawyer for the law and lobbying firm Greenberg Traurig who served as a deputy secretary at the agency during Mr. Bushs tenure.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Miranda Franco, senior policy adviser at the law firm Holland & Knight, has closely tracked the changes.She said it appeared the administration was using the innovation center to further its priorities of more provider-friendly approaches, more voluntary models.Ms. Verma, the administrator of the centers, seemed to confirm that when she wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed: Providers need the freedom to design and offer new approaches to delivering care.Our goal is to increase flexibility by providing more waivers from current requirements.Last month, Ms. Verma also announced a plan to re-examine and streamline all the ways the federal government has been measuring the quality of the care doctors provide, saying in a speech, We want to move to a system that pays for value and quality but how we define value and quality today is a problem.The goal, she said, was to relieve doctors of excessive regulatory burdens and make sure payment policies are guided by those on the front lines serving patients.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Gail Wilensky, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid in the first Bush administration, said she heard many complaints from doctors who felt that during the Obama presidency the agency was not listening to any of their ideas for how to move toward payment based on quality rather than quantity.Its hard for me to believe that physicians will do any better than they would have done, having Tom Price there, Ms. Wilensky said.From their point of view, this was about as good as it was going to get.But Tim Gronniger, a deputy chief of staff at the centers during the Obama administration, argued that there was little demand from hospitals or physicians to cancel the bundled payments, or to delay the merit-based payments.In fact, many doctors are still subject to the rules of the merit-based system, which passed with bipartisan support in Congress in 2015.And other value-based programs are continuing.Theyve confused people, said Mr. Gronniger, now a senior vice president at Caravan Health, which helps health care providers shift to value-based payment models.The risk that H.H.S.and Tom Price created is that some physicians incorrectly read the press release or hear from their colleagues that Medicare is canceling value-based purchasing and think all of thats over.Physicians and hospitals need to be engaged in this work, he added, and exempting them doesnt do them any favors.Although little has changed since Mr. Prices departure, there are signs that the agency is still trying to figure out the best way to proceed, said Michael Chernew, an economist at Harvard Medical School who supports moving away from fee for service.Mr. Chernew said he was cautiously hopeful about H.H.S.continuing to promote alternative payment models, pointing out that Medicare rates under fee for service will remain flat over the next decade anyway under the payment law that Congress passed in 2015.My general sense, and Ive met with them, is that they genuinely want to try to have a better set of payment models, Mr. Chernew said of Ms. Verma and those working for her at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.They dont just want to try to blow everything up.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He added, If you take all the politics out of it, the right thing for them to do is move ahead.
As U.S. Sheds Role as Climate Change Leader, Who Will Fill the Void?:::::Many political analysts say China has indeed moved dramatically on climate change, both to meet its own pledge under the Paris accord to cap carbon emissions by 2030, and to start the worlds largest carbon market and swiftly expand the use of electric cars.In recent months, China has hosted ministerial-level meetings on clean energy and joined Canada and the European Union to lead discussions on climate.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in Climate Change?Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Robert N. Stavins, the director of the environmental economics program at Harvard University who was in China recently to discuss climate change, said he had seen a dramatic shift in tenor among Chinese officials.Having been engaged very, very closely on climate change with the Obama administration as a co-leader, China appears quite content to move from co-leadership to sole leadership, he said.Yet skepticism abounds.While the country is ahead of its Paris target, China still burns more coal than any other country.It also remains to be seen how eager the country will be to allow greater transparency of its own carbon reduction efforts, and many fear it will revert to old demands that it and other developing countries be treated with softer rules.Photo 2.Justin Trudeau For many years Canada was considered a laggard on climate change, leaving the Kyoto Protocol and rarely making an impression at United Nations negotiations.That all changed with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who cozied up to panda bears and declared Canada is back at the Paris global warming talks in 2015.Mr. Trudeau said he was deeply disappointed in the United States decision to withdraw from the Paris deal, declaring Canada is unwavering in our commitment to fight climate change.Since then, he has made good on much of that goal doubling his countrys contribution to the United Nations science body and sliding into Americas place in some international arenas.In September, for example, Canada hosted a meeting of the worlds largest economies to discuss climate change.American officials in the George W. Bush administration had created that gathering, originally known as the Major Economies Forum, and it continued under Mr. Obama.The Trump administration essentially abandoned it this year.Advertisement Continue reading the main story If the U.S. is going to step back, were going to step up, Canadas environment minister, Catherine McKenna, said.But the country is still struggling to deliver meaningful climate change policy at home, and Mr. Trudeau in recent months has approved bitumen pipelines and liquid natural gas projects.Activists in Canada say if Mr. Trudeau wants to be a true leader, hell have to reject new fossil fuel infrastructure something that will be a steep and perhaps unmeetable challenge.Photo 3.State and local U.S. leaders Perhaps no group has made a bigger splash on the world stage this year than the coalition of United States governors, mayors and businesses who call themselves the We Are Still In coalition.Informally led by Gov.Jerry Brown of California; Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, and Gov.Jay Inslee of Washington, the group has vowed to uphold the Paris agreement and move ahead with policies to fight climate change.When the Trump administration opted not to have a United States pavilion at the Bonn climate talks to highlight American efforts on climate change, Mr. Bloomberg and others agreed to pay for it.Now the American pavilion is hosting a sort of shadow delegation of local leaders who say they are representing a different face of government.I feel very strongly America should be represented there, Mr. Bloomberg said.Yet without participation from more states, particularly those that are fossil-fuel heavy, the United States as a whole will still fall short of the Paris pledge, several analyses have found.Photo 4.Angela Merkel & Emmanuel Macron The Obama administration gets a lot of credit for helping to forge the Paris Agreement, but in reality it was Europe that insisted on the accord in the first place.Since Mr. Trumps withdrawal announcement, European leaders have lost no chance to reassert themselves as the guardians of global climate change ambition.Mr. Macron in particular has continued to champion the agreement hammered out in his nations capital.He has invited American scientists who work on climate change to move to France, and pressed Mr. Trump several times to remain in the deal.In December, France will host a celebration of the Paris Agreement, to which the United States has not yet been invited.Ms. Merkel put climate change at the center of a Group of 20 summit of the worlds largest economies in Hamburg, Germany, this year.Its not clear how much those leaders efforts will shift United States policy.As Frank V. Maisano, a partner at the law firm Bracewell who represents energy clients, said recently, Trumps supporters dont care that Macron is yelling at him.They like that.Photo 5.Antnio Gutteres, U.N. secretary general Mr. Gutteres stepped into his new role in January, and those who work with him say the former prime minister of Portugal jumped in with both feet.Mr. Guterres made sure climate change was highlighted during the United Nations General Assembly, meeting with former Vice President Al Gore and Governor Brown of California to discuss ways the United Nations can promote solutions.He also opened a special session to discuss climate change and its impact on small islands after several devastating hurricanes battered the Caribbean.Robert C. Orr, the dean of the University of Marylands School of Public Policy and a special adviser to Mr. Guterres on climate change, said the United Nations leader was putting his own stamp on climate change by hosting a major summit at United Nations headquarters in New York in 2018.
30 Vaquita Porpoises Are Left. One Died in a Rescue Mission.:::::Mexico banned totoaba fishing in 1993, but it was only in 2015 when vaquita numbers dwindled to about 100 that the government also banned most gill nets, including those used for catching shrimp and other kinds of fish.The gill nets catch the totoaba, and also trap the vaquitas.Fishermen are still allowed to use a different type of net, intended for catching corvina fish, that is not supposed to pose a threat to the vaquitas.But because the corvina and totoaba fishing seasons overlap, fishermen can hide the totoaba nets beneath the corvina nets on their boats, said Lorenzo Rojas-Bracho, the director of Vaquita CPR.You can use a corvina as a cover-up, and thats what happened, he said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in Climate Change?Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Most of the regions fishermen, who have been out of work since the ban, poach totoaba swim bladders, which fetch $3,000 to $10,000 per kilogram, said Andrea Crosta, the director of a group that investigates the totoaba trade.An equivalent catch of shrimp might earn a fisherman $200 at best.If youre out here on the water, youre not risking jail time to catch shrimp, said Dave Bader, a spokesman for Vaquita CPR.After the death of the captured vaquita, the scientists agreed to shut down the program.The evidence today is vaquita are not good candidates for being protected in this way, Dr. Smith said.Its heartbreaking.The scientists had hoped to keep the animals in captivity temporarily, and possibly even breed them, until gill nets were eliminated from their habitat.While any wild animal is expected to experience some stress when captured, the group had hoped the vaquita could cope with being handled.(Last month, the scientists released a vaquita calf they had pulled from the waters when they determined it was too young to be separated from its mother.)Other conservationists had been critical of the plan.I was telling them that this was going to happen, youre going to stress out the animals, said Paul Watson, the founder of the Sea Shepherd conservation group, which also works to protect vaquitas.They are very elusive, they are very shy; youre going to kill one of them.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Crosta said that while he admired the work of the biologists, they couldnt possibly solve a problem that starts in San Felipe and ends in a shop in China.The fate of the vaquita, he said, was entirely in the hands of law enforcement.In the past two years, Sea Shepherd and local groups have recovered more than 25,000 yards of gill nets from the gulf, weighing about 50 tons.Now that efforts to capture the vaquitas have failed, conservationists say hauling in the poachers nets is the best bet to save the species from extinction.The Mexican government, conservationists say, also needs to crack down on illegal fishing, while providing sustainable alternatives for the community.Financial compensation from the government often never makes it into the hands of the fishermen, diverted by corruption, Mr. Crosta said.Local economies are an important consideration in conservation biology, Dr. Rojas-Bracho said.You cannot save vaquita, and drive fishers to extinction.
A Shadow Delegation Stalks the Official U.S. Team at Climate Talks:::::Yet seven in 10 Americans believe global warming is occurring, according to a Yale University survey, and more than 60 percent say they are at least somewhat worried about its effects.Theres a debate in the United States between the denialists who pooh-pooh any thought about climate change and the catastrophic dangers it portends, and those who agree with the scientific academies of every country in the world that were facing an existential threat and we have to do something about it, Governor Brown said Saturday.He and Mr. Bloomberg announced that the states, cities and businesses that had pledged to abide by the Paris accord were on track to meet the Obama administration pledge to cut emissions at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.Former Vice President Al Gore, a longtime champion of strong action on climate change, said Mr. Trump represented a minority view on the subject.President Trump does not speak for the country as a whole on the climate issue, Mr. Gore said.Of course hes our president, of course he has the authority that any president has.But on this issue he is very much out of sync with the country as a whole.According to a new report from Americas Pledge, a group led by Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Brown, if the institutions working to meet the Obama targets were a separate country, they would be the third-largest economy in the world after the United States and China.Even as the Trump administration plans to roll back federal climate change policies like the Clean Power Plan, the study found, falling clean technology prices, the low price of natural gas and local carbon-cutting efforts have already cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 11.5 percent between 2005 and 2015.The official American negotiating team for now is laying low.Career State Department officials are managing the technical negotiations, speaking up on issues like demanding more transparency from developing countries on their progress cutting emissions.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Trump administrations true debut will come Monday when a team from the White House hosts a forum promoting fossil fuels and nuclear energy.Speakers will include executives from Peabody Energy, a coal company; NuScale Power, a nuclear engineering firm; and Tellurian, a liquefied natural gas exporter.Christiana Figueres, a former United Nations climate envoy who spent her morning with the shadow American delegation, said the Trump administration was sending the wrong message to a conference aimed at decarbonizing the global economy.Coal is to be thanked for all of its hard work and it now deserves to be retired.It is of retirement age and needs to be put in the retirement home, Ms. Figueres said.Jim Lakely, a spokesman for the Heartland Institute, said he hoped United Nations climate delegates would also hear his groups message.Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is not the driver of global warming, he said.So there is no moral case for restricting the use of fossil fuels, especially because that is vital to raising the quality and length of life of the worlds poorest people.Diplomats from other countries said they were glad to see governors, mayors and other Americans still committed to the Paris agreement making their presence felt.But they also said they werent sure which voice of American policy they should believe.Unfortunately theres no connect between those processes, said Dr. Ian Fry, lead negotiator for Tuvalu, a South Pacific island threatened by rising seas.Its just two worlds, unfortunately.
In Africa, Rural Clinics Entice Pregnant Women With ‘Baby Pictures’:::::The medical charity Bridge to Health Medical and Dental tested the concept in the highlands of southwest Uganda in 2014.Their study, published by PLOS One this year, found that when doctors set up temporary clinics in rural villages, six times as many pregnant women visited when free ultrasounds were advertised, compared with the turnout in villages where the ultrasounds were not offered or were advertised only by word of mouth.Women who previously had seen only traditional healers were nine times more likely to show up if the ultrasounds were advertised.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Its magic to be able to see your unborn baby, said Dr. Michael S. Silverman, an infectious disease specialist at Western University in London, Canada, and a study co-author.The ultrasound scanners in the study cost $10,000 new or $2,500 refurbished, said Dr. William Cherniak, the executive director of Bridge to Health and another co-author.They are battery-powered, do 40 scans per charge, and can survive bouncing along rutted dirt roads.The group hopes to test inexpensive new scanners that plug directly into smartphones; the technician can view the fetus on the phone and transmit the image to a radiologist anywhere in the world, Dr. Cherniak said.The women in the study could see their fetuses only on monitors, but Bridge to Health has since added a printer so the women can take home pictures.We even diagnosed acute appendicitis in an older woman who came in even though she wasnt pregnant, Dr. Cherniak said.These machines have lots of uses.
The Way the Wind Blows:::::Photo Q.The wind turbines that generate electricity seem to have just three blades, or sometimes two.Why so few?A.As many as 90 percent of the turbines in use now have three blades.But experiments are still underway to determine what number of blades works best in terms of efficiency, durability and economy.When the wind shifts, the three-blade design minimizes vibration or chatter.A two-blade system is subject to considerable chatter when the blades are in the horizontal position, with associated wear and tear on the turbine.The chatter is sometimes audible.A design with only one blade would actually be the most aerodynamically efficient, but the single blade would move very fast, producing objectionable noise, and it wears out the assembly more quickly.Adding a fourth blade increases energy production by only a small percentage, and the added expense is comparatively large.Finally, many people consider the three-blade turbine to be the most aesthetically pleasing design.
$300 Billion War Beneath the Street: Fighting to Replace America’s Water Pipes:::::Corporations pay membership fees as high as $25,000 to gain access to some 1,500 mayors and local council members who have signed up for the initiative.At a July convention in Denver that brought together about three dozen local legislators, Bruce Hollands, executive director of the plastic pipe industry group Uni-Bell PVC Pipe Association, discussed what had gone wrong in Flint, and explained what needed to be done to open up local bidding for plastic water pipes.To spur local decision-making, the A.C.C.E.has also adopted model legislation pushing for more open bidding for water pipes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Were just trying to take up policies that limit the size of government, that keep it from growing exponentially, said Jon Russell, national director of the A.C.C.E.and a councilman from the town of Culpeper, Va. Plastics are an obvious replacement for the countrys aging pipes.Lightweight, easy to install, corrosion-free and up to 50 percent cheaper than iron, plastic pipes have already taken the place of copper as the preferred material for service lines that connect homes to municipal mains, as well as water pipes inside the home.Still, some scientists warn that the rapid replacement of Americas water infrastructure with plastic could bring its own health concerns.Scientists are just starting to understand the effect of plastic on the quality and safety of drinking water, including what sort of chemicals can leach into the water from the pipes themselves, or from surrounding groundwater contamination.Studies have shown that toxic pollutants like benzene and toluene from spills and contaminated soil can permeate certain types of plastic pipes as they age.A 2013 review of research on leaching from plastic pipe identified more than 150 contaminants migrating from plastic pipes into drinking water.Plastics are being installed without any real understanding of what theyre doing to our drinking water, said Andrew J. Whelton, assistant professor of civil engineering at Purdue University, and an author of the 2013 study.We dont know what chemicals were being exposed to.Sensing an opening, the iron pipe industry has started a public relations push of its own, voicing concerns over plastic, wooing President Trump with accolades for his infrastructure drive and setting up a war between the two industries.Iron is just more durable.Its a more proven material, said Patrick Hogan, president of the Ductile Iron Pipe Research Association, the industrys main lobby group.Irons been in the ground for 100 years.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Plastic groups have criticized the studies, saying they focus on older generations of plastic piping and conflate different types of plastics.They also stress that their pipes are independently tested by the third-party organization.Its not a new material.Its a safe material.Its independently tested, said Mr. Hollands, executive director of the Uni-Bell plastic pipes group.The industry outreach, at times, has been more overt.At the height of Flints water crisis, the chief executive of one of the nations largest manufacturers of plastic pipes, JM Eagle, traveled to the beleaguered city and offered to replace the citys lead pipes at no cost.Pipes from JM Eagle would last 100 years and are a long-lasting and safe solution, the companys chief executive, Walter Wang, told the City Council last February.This water crisis, this contamination issue, he said, its hurting children and making them sick.Photo JM Eagle, however, has faced recent legal problems.In 2013, a federal jury in California found that the Los Angeles-based company had defrauded states and municipalities for more than a decade by knowingly selling defective water pipes.In some places, PVC pipes that were supposed to last 50 years exploded in their first year, causing injuries and flooding.JM Eagle declined to comment but has previously said the litigation was based on scurrilous allegations by a disgruntled former employee.Formosa Plastics, a Taiwanese industrial conglomerate that was its parent company at the time, agreed to pay $22.5 million in a settlement with municipalities and other government agencies in California.The uncertainty over potable water pipes of all kinds is exacerbated by a lack of regulation over their safety.There is no federal oversight of the materials or processes used to manufacture plastic water pipes; instead, water pipes are certified and tested by an organization paid for by industry.That organization, NSF International, displays a picture of the Capitol building on its regulatory resources web page and runs a hotline for questions on regulations and product safety.Yet it has never received regulatory authority from the federal government.Nor does it disclose test results for the pipes it certifies.Advertisement Continue reading the main story NSF International called its testing robust.If a product does not meet the requirements of a standard, it will not pass, said Dave Purkiss, the organizations general manager of water systems.For now, Flint is fitting the city with service lines made with another material: copper, at an expected cost of more than $140 million.Officials discussed creating a pilot area using plastic to replace the service lines to houses on several city blocks, according to Plastics News, though a Flint spokeswoman, Kristin Moore, said plastic pipes were not currently under consideration.When you take that inherent issue that we needed to rebuild trust of the citizens in the water system, we felt that copper was the way to go, Michael McDaniel, a retired Michigan National Guard brigadier general put in charge of replacing Flints water pipes, said at a conference this year.In Burton, just next door to Flint, budget realities have made plastics the realistic choice.The small city of 29,000 saved $2.2 million by using plastic to replace its own 1930s-era water system after state regulators alerted the city to critically needed fixes.For a municipality struggling with a dwindling tax base, those savings were huge.We needed safe water, and we needed it fast.We needed to replace the system, and PVC was a good choice for us, said Burtons mayor, Paula Zelenko.Ive got to get the best bang for the buck, because bucks are hard to come by these days.
What’s at Stake in the Bonn Climate Talks?:::::Under the Paris agreement, each country submitted a voluntary pledge to tackle its greenhouse gas emissions and then agreed to meet every five years to review their collective progress and prod one another to ratchet up their efforts.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in Climate Change?Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.But so far, those pledges have proved inadequate.Most industrialized countries from Europe to Japan to the United States arent on track to meet their

Antarctica, drastic sea-level rise and more destructive heat waves and droughts.To stay well below 2 degrees, countries would need to cut back fossil-fuel emissions far more rapidly than theyve promised so far.In 2018, leaders plan to assess their efforts to date and discuss what further action could help lessen the odds of drastic global warming with the goal of crafting newer, stronger national pledges by 2020.But before they can do any of that, they need to agree to formal ground rules for that exercise.That rule book will be a focus at Bonn.How do countries plan to make progress on climate change?One widely recognized problem with the current Paris pledges is that theyre fairly vague.China promised that its emissions would peak around 2030, but the countrys energy data is notoriously murky, so its hard to tell how much progress its actually making.Similarly, the European Union vowed to cut emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, but offered few specifics on how to achieve that goal making it hard to gauge whether European policymakers could realistically be doing much more.At Bonn, negotiators will be discussing how to make these pledges more rigorous and transparent, so that countries can more readily be held accountable for their actions.That means tackling questions like: Whats the best way to track nations progress, to see if theyre doing what they said they would do?Is there a way to tell if a countrys pledge could be made more ambitious?Which specific policies are working well and which arent?Because the Paris pledges are largely voluntary world leaders would have never agreed to a deal otherwise no one can force governments to take additional action.But, the idea goes, if pledges and policies are made more transparent, world leaders will be better able to pressure and help each other to do more.The final draft of this rule book is not due until next year, and it may not actually get finished at Bonn, but negotiators are hoping to make significant progress on a long list of items at these talks.As always, diplomacy tends to proceed fitfully.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What role will the U.S. play?Even though the Trump administration has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement, the United States cant formally exit the climate talks until 2020.So the State Department is sending a small team of negotiators to discuss some of the details of the pact.Photo The United States and China will still preside over a working group on transparency, though it remains to be seen how much influence American officials can wield.The administration will also hold an event in Bonn with representatives from energy companies to promote coal, natural gas and nuclear power as solutions to global warming.Other countries are expected to view the American push to promote fossil fuels with a wary eye.In the meantime, a coalition of pro-Paris governors and other officials plan to attend the conference to tout efforts that states, cities and businesses are making to reduce emissions despite the Trump administrations stance highlighting the countrys deep divide over climate policy.Any disagreements expected?Discussions around the rule book for assessing and ratcheting up pledges could prove contentious.In the past, for instance, the United States has insisted that developing countries be held to the same strict monitoring standards as wealthy countries, while China and India have pushed for a bifurcated system.Developing countries have also argued that they need financial aid from wealthier nations to expand clean energy and adapt to the ravages of climate change.The government of Fiji is presiding over the Bonn conference, which will put the spotlight on issues like loss and damage that is, whether wealthy nations should compensate island nations and other poorer countries for the droughts, storms and rising sea levels that their emissions are causing.The Paris agreement broached this issue only briefly, and industrialized nations have resisted calls to be held legally liable for their role in warming the planet.Whats the best-case scenario from Bonn?Whats the worst?Some climate advocates are hoping for a relatively low-key conference that makes modest progress on issues like transparency and climate finance.In this scenario, American officials would play a quietly constructive role in helping craft the rule book for ratcheting up pledges.And nonstate actors, including cities and businesses, would continue to press forward on efforts to tackle climate change outside of the formal United Nations process.Conversely, its entirely possible that the Trump administrations rejection of the Paris deal could lead other countries to disengage from global efforts to address climate change.Or the talks could get bogged down by the traditional rifts between richer and poorer nations.That, in turn, could stall momentum right before the next big round of climate talks in 2018 when countries are supposed to get down to the details of whats needed to step up their climate policies going forward.
News Shared on Twitter Can Drive the Conversation, Study Finds:::::Dr. King and his colleagues, Benjamin Schneer, of Florida State University, and Ariel White, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, spent almost five years on the study, with the first three years dedicated to observing, learning from and building trust with journalists.Key to getting them on board, he said, was limiting his teams involvement to a part of the process that is often arbitrary: the timing of publication.In some sense, youre flipping the coin already, he said, noting that for many non-breaking stories, publication timing is subject to the whims of editors or the news cycle.At all times, the publications retained the right to bow out of the experiment, shelve the stories or publish them when they wanted.The study is not without its critics.Creative as it may be, the paper overstates its conclusion, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, who studies political communication and is the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.Is this methodologically ingenious?Yes.Do we know whether or not the findings are substantively important?Not based on the disclosed information, she said.Twitter is just one social media platform and social media itself is only one venue in which the national conversation takes place.Tweets also hardly amount to discussion, Ms. Jamieson said.Many people simply share links on Twitter, offering, at best, a few lines of commentary.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Without seeing the content of the articles or the tweets, its difficult to judge the studys findings, she said.(While the authors provided the names of the outlets that participated in the experiment, they withheld the articles involved to protect the reputations of the publications.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story To those who participated, though, the experiment offered a chance to better understand their influence, a crucial issue for media organizations.When we had the opportunity to actually measure impact in a new way, we were really, really excited.This is core to our mission, said Jo Ellen Green Kaiser, executive director of the Media Consortium, a network of independent news outlets whose members accounted for the majority of those involved in the study.While most of the outlets the researchers worked with were small, independent publications, such as Truthout or In These Times, the study included some more well-known outlets, too, including The Nation, The Progressive, Ms. Magazine and Yes!Magazine, according to the authors.In all, 33 outlets participated in the final experiment, though more than a dozen more participated in earlier trial runs, which were designed differently.The authors did not say which publications participated in which part of the study.The researchers were principally involved at only two points in the publication process: the beginning and the end.Each experiment began with them choosing from one of 11 broad policy areas, such as food, immigration, reproductive rights or jobs, which had been identified as already being of interest to the news organizations.The researchers then asked a handful of outlets to volunteer to collaborate, in groups of two to five, on stories of their own choosing related to the topic.For example, the authors said, with technology as a topic, the group might decide to write pieces about how Uber drivers feel about driverless cars.The researchers then chose a two-week window in which to study discussion online, asking the outlets to publish the stories during either week, chosen at random.They would then compare the discussion on Twitter related to that topic in the week in which the pieces ran to the week in which they did not.The stories, typically published on Tuesday, could come in any form, be they straight news, investigations, interviews, opinion pieces, videos or podcasts.The outlets treated them no differently and the researchers said that, as far as they were aware, their involvement went unnoticed by readers.Awareness of the study varied at each outlet, but editors and reporters were often informed.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We really had to get whole editorial teams on board, and then often the reporters knew, too, Ms. Kaiser said.In the end, the authors conducted 35 experiments for the study over a year and a half beginning in October 2014.The authors tried to anticipate some criticisms, too.Many tweets are created by bots, they acknowledged, but they found that bot traffic was consistent each week, making it essentially background noise.The researchers also avoided weeks when known world events, say a planned presidential speech on immigration, might have influenced the results.
From Brussels to Arkansas, a Tough Week for Monsanto:::::Taken together, the decisions reflect an increasing political resistance to pesticides in Europe and parts of the United States, as well as the specific shortcomings of dicamba, whose tendency to drift has given pause even to the Trump administrations Environmental Protection Agency, which has otherwise largely acceded to the wishes of the chemical industry.Dicamba has damaged more than 3.6 million acres of soybean crops in 25 states, roughly 4 percent of all soybeans planted this year in the United States.In a statement, an industry trade group known as the Glyphosate Task Force, which includes Monsanto and Syngenta, called the European decision discriminatory and unacceptable, adding that delays of this nature which are evident during the final stages of the process simply expose acute politicization of the regulatory procedure.But Nicolas Hulot, the French environment minister, tweeted after the vote: Thanks to our opposition glyphosate is not reauthorized for 10 years, nor 5 years.The effort to get out of pesticides continues!Regarding the decision in Arkansas, Scott Partridge, vice president of global strategy for Monsanto, said in a statement on Wednesday that the company was disappointed that state regulators voted to put Arkansas farmers at a disadvantage, but well continue to follow the process to help those growers have greater choice next season.The European Unions decision followed years of haggling and delay.Policymakers largely brushed aside the opinions of two of the blocs science agencies, which had found that glyphosate was not a carcinogen.But glyphosate, which accounts for about a quarter of the global market, has been plunged into controversy since the International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization, declared it a probable carcinogen in 2015.The finding, which has been disputed by a number of other government agencies, has made the weedkiller a magnet for controversy.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Glyphosate is also at the center of a federal case in the United States over claims that it causes cancer, and California has declared it a carcinogen, following in the footsteps of the international cancer agency.Use of glyphosate has soared in the United States and other parts of the world over the last two decades, after Monsanto introduced crops that were genetically engineered to be resistant to the chemical.That meant key crops like corn, soybeans and cotton could be sprayed with the herbicide after they emerged from the ground.During that time, the presence of glyphosate in human urine increased 500 percent, according to a recent study by the University of California San Diego School of Medicine and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Europe, by contrast, has largely shunned genetically modified crops, but glyphosate is still the Continents biggest seller.In Britain and Germany, it is used on as much as 40 percent of agricultural land, according to an industry trade group.But political sentiment in Europe has been turning against Monsanto, the American company that has become the face of the agrochemical industry, even though it is in the process of being acquired by Bayer, a German chemicals giant.The European Parliament voted last month to ban glyphosate, a step that was nonbinding.And in September, the Parliament made Monsanto the first company to be barred from lobbying the chamber.The science around glyphosate has become a muddle of allegations and counterallegations.Environmental activists have accused national regulators of hewing too closely to Monsantos wishes, while the industry has been exasperated that European politicians are overruling their science agencies.The litigation in the United States has only muddied the waters further, with evidence emerging that Monsanto ghostwrote both journalism and academic work, eroding trust in a company that had long been a lightning rod.But the latest major study, published Thursday by researchers at the National Institutes of Health, observed no associations between glyphosate use and overall cancer risk.With dicamba, the industry received warnings years ago that the weedkiller was prone to drifting on crops and vegetation it was not intended to treat.Dicamba is supposed to be used with soybeans that are genetically modified to resist its effects.Steve Smith, a member of an advisory panel set up by Monsanto, warned as far back as 2010 that widespread use of dicamba is incompatible with Midwestern agriculture, according to congressional testimony he gave that year.Even the best, the most conscientious farmers cannot control where this weedkiller will end up.Monsanto has argued that drift is occurring when dicamba is sprayed improperly or when unapproved versions are used.Many farmers and weed scientists say it can also turn into a gas and drift in certain weather conditions.Environmentalists called for federal action by the Environmental Protection Agency on dicamba.Its long past time the agency heed independent science and protect farmers by prohibiting the use of this hazardous weedkiller, said Bill Freese, a science policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety.
Trump Ignores Climate Change. That’s Very Bad for Disaster Planners.:::::FEMA also began folding climate adaptation into a program that allows cities to receive discounts on their flood-insurance premiums if they take additional steps to reduce their flood risk.Under the Community Rating System, cities can now get credit for planning for the effects of rising sea levels.Officials in the Florida Keys are planning to take advantage of these credits as they map their vulnerable roadways.A week before Mr. Trump entered the White House, FEMA also unveiled a proposal for a public assistance deductible, in which states would be responsible for a greater portion of the cost of disaster recovery unless they took steps like enacting stricter building codes to limit exposure to disasters.While this proposal, which is not yet implemented, may face pushback from states and homebuilders, environmentalists and fiscal conservatives say it could lessen the moral hazard around flood policy.Experts caution that FEMA can only do so much on its own.They cant force the hands of communities, said Laura Lightbody, director of the Pew Charitable Trusts Flood-Prepared Communities initiative.Ultimately its up to local leaders to take responsibility.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But, she added, I do think the federal government has woken up to the fact that we need to start thinking more seriously about future risk.Climate Change, a Political Flash Point Since coming to office, Mr. Trump has moved quickly to repeal Obama-era policies focused on curbing the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change and has vowed to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord.But, apart from the rollback of Mr. Obamas flood order, the Trump administration has been more restrained in directly targeting measures aimed at adapting to future disasters.While the Environmental Protection Agency has scrubbed mentions of global warming from its website, FEMAs climate adaptation page remains.Mr. Wright, who has held his FEMA position since 2013, said the agency was still pursuing many of the mitigation efforts begun under the previous administration, while working to quadruple investments in pre-disaster mitigation by 2023.And administration officials are now contemplating a new federal flood standard that could guide post-disaster rebuilding efforts.Asked whether skepticism about climate change might impede these efforts, Mr. Wright said, I have never experienced that as an obstacle.And I say that full stop.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Fugate, the former FEMA administrator, was warier: The direction of this administration has been so uncertain, and you hope that theyre not just focused on getting rid of anything that might suggest that climate change is a problem.Alice C. Hill, who helped develop the Obama administrations climate resilience strategy, had a different concern: Unless the administration was actively engaged on adaptation efforts, it was less likely that such programs would expand in the future.Within any administration, its easy for the urgent to overcome the important, she said.At some point, climate change will become urgent, but for now its still in the important category it doesnt need to get done today.So unless somebodys actively pushing on agencies to act, it wont get done.For example, in 2012, Congress created an advisory council to help FEMA improve its flood insurance program maps.The council has made dozens of recommendations, including ways that FEMA could produce maps that accounted for climate risks to help communities plan for the future.But the task is costly, requiring airborne mapping of much of the country, and Congress hasnt provided sufficient funds for FEMA to implement it.And in his first budget, Mr. Trump proposed further cuts to mapping programs.Ms. Hill said adaptation programs may have the best chance of survival if theyre not explicitly framed as climate measures.This whole issue has become highly politicized, she said.But the longer Ive worked on this issue, the less I care what we call it.You can just talk about fiscal risk.This is a fiscally conservative approach.
Are Mass Murderers Insane? Usually Not, Researchers Say:::::Ditto for Dylann Roof, the racist who murdered nine African-American churchgoers in South Carolina in 2015, and Christopher Harper-Mercer, the angry young man who killed nine people at a community college in Oregon the same year.Nor does anything in these criminals history including domestic violence, like Mr. Kelleys serve to reliably predict their spectacularly cruel acts.Even if spree killers have committed domestic violence disproportionately more often and this assertion is in dispute the vast majority of men who are guilty of that crime never proceed to mass murder.Most mass murderers instead belong to a rogues gallery of the disgruntled and aggrieved, whose anger and intentions wax and wane over time, eventually curdling into violence in the wake of some perceived humiliation.In almost all high-end mass killings, the perpetrators thinking evolves, said Kevin Cameron, executive director of the Canadian Center for Threat Assessment and Trauma Response.They have a passing thought.They think about it more, they fantasize, they slowly build a justification.They prepare, and then when the right set of circumstances comes along, it unleashes the rage.This evolution proceeds rationally and logically, at least in the murderers mind.The unthinkable becomes thinkable, then inevitable.Researchers define mass killings as an event leaving four or more dead at the same place and time.These incidents occur at an average of about one a day across the United States; few make national headlines.Advertisement Continue reading the main story At least half of the perpetrators die in the act, either by committing suicide (Mr. Kelley is said to have shot himself in the head) or being felled by police.Photo Analyzing his database, Dr. Stone has concluded that about 65 percent of mass killers exhibited no evidence of a severe mental disorder; 22 percent likely had psychosis, the delusional thinking and hallucinations that characterize schizophrenia, or sometimes accompany mania and severe depression.(The remainder likely had depressive or antisocial traits.)Among the psychotic, he counts Jared Loughner, the Arizona man who shot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, and 18 others in 2011.By most accounts, including his own, Mr. Loughner was becoming increasingly delusional.Adam Lanza, who in 2012 killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., exhibited extreme paranoia in the months leading up to his crime, isolating himself in his room.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But what to make of John Robert Neumann Jr., who in June shot and killed five former co-workers at a warehouse in Orlando before turning the gun on himself?Mr. Neumann was not overtly psychotic, as far as anyone knows, and this is far more typical of the men who commit mass killings generally.The majority of the killers were disgruntled workers or jilted lovers who were acting on a deep sense of injustice, and not mentally ill, Dr. Stone said of his research.In a 2016 analysis of 71 lone-actor terrorists and 115 mass killers, researchers convened by the Department of Justice found the rate of psychotic disorders to be about what Dr. Stone had discovered: roughly 20 percent.The overall rate of any psychiatric history among mass killers including such probable diagnoses as depression, learning disabilities or A.D.H.D.was 48 percent.About two-thirds of this group had faced long-term stress, like trouble at school or keeping a job, failure in business, or disabling physical injuries from, say, a car accident.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Substance abuse was also common: More than 40 percent had problems with alcohol, marijuana or other drugs.Looking at both studies, and using data from his own work, J. Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist who consults with the F.B.I., has identified what he believes is a common thread: a paranoid spectrum, he calls it.At the extreme end is full-on psychosis of the Loughner variety.But the majority of people on this spectrum are not deeply ill; rather, they are injustice collectors.They are prone to perceive insults and failures as cumulative, and often to blame them on one person or one group.If you have this paranoid streak, this vigilance, this sense that others have been persecuting you for years, theres an accumulation of maltreatment and an intense urge to stop that persecution, Dr. Meloy said.That may never happen.The person may never act on the urge.But when they do, typically theres a triggering event.Its a loss in love or work something that starts a clock ticking, that starts the planning.Mental health treatment might make a difference for the one in five murderers who have severe mental disorders, experts say.Prevention is also possible in a few other cases for instance, if the perpetrators make overt threats and those threats are reported.But other factors must be weighed.In my large file of mass murders, if you look decade by decade, the numbers of victims are fairly small up until the 1960s, said Dr. Stone.Thats when the deaths start going way up.When the AK-47s and the Kalashnikovs and the Uzis all these semiautomatic weapons, when they became so easily accessible.
Congress Weighs Repeal of Tax Credit for Rare Disease Drugs:::::No matter what happens, some experts welcomed a discussion about a political issue that was once considered untouchable because opponents risked being labeled coldhearted toward people with serious medical conditions.I think it opens up the debate on the orphan drug tax credit, which we think is a flawed incentive, said James Love, director of the consumers group Knowledge Ecology International.And I think thats a positive thing.Under current law, companies that develop drugs for rare diseases can receive a tax credit for half of the cost of their clinical trials and they are also granted seven years of exclusivity, when the drug is protected from competition.Companies are not required to disclose the amounts of the tax credits they receive.Mr. Love said he favored replacing the tax credit with direct government subsidies of clinical trials for rare-disease treatments.In public, the pharmaceutical industrys largest lobbying groups have not said much about the credit.The Biotechnology Innovation Organization, whose members include smaller companies, praised the overall tax plan in a statement last week, but disagreed with the elimination of the tax credit.The other major trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, whose members are generally large public companies, said in a statement that it was pleased that Congress has taken up a tax overhaul and, without mentioning the tax credit, encouraged policymakers to maintain incentives for research into rare-disease treatments.Big drugmakers in particular stand to benefit more from the proposed lower corporate tax rate than from the loss of a tax credit that some companies do not use.And like other major corporations, the industrys opposition may be coalescing far more against a proposed excise tax that could penalize companies for manufacturing their products overseas.These days, many drugs are made outside the United States.Companies that make drugs to treat rare diseases and their lobbyists are already marshaling forces to retain the tax credit.Tactics include enlisting patient-advocacy groups many financed by drug companies and members, whose life-threatening and debilitating diseases often have more of a compelling effect than pharmaceutical executives on lawmakers and the public.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We didnt have any prior warning, said Paul Melmeyer, federal policy director for the National Organization for Rare Disorders, or NORD.We look at that just utter lack of therapies for our patient populations.There could be even 33 percent fewer than what we have, going forward, and that is really what our concern is.Over the last decade, the number of new drugs to treat rare diseases has proliferated, in part because of advancements in scientific research and in part because drug companies have found new ways to profit from diseases that were once seen as unworthy of corporate investment.In 2016, nine of the 22 new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration were for rare diseases; in 2015, 21 of the 45 drugs approved fell into that category.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Despite the investment, advocates note that of the 7,000 rare diseases that have been identified, only about 5 percent have an approved therapy.About 30 million Americans have a rare disease, or about a tenth of the population.While many rare-disease approvals bring advances for patients, companies have also been seen to be taking advantage of the program by seeking the designation for drugs that would be profitable anyway.The drugmaker AbbVie has won multiple approvals for rare-disease uses for Humira, the worlds best-selling drug, ranging from a form of juvenile arthritis to an eye disease, uveitis.Many new cancer approvals also receive orphan-drug designation because they are targeted at a narrow slice of the population.With the coveted exclusivity granted by their orphan-drug status, companies can charge virtually anything they want for these products, and some manufacturers have set astronomical prices for drugs that have gone on to bring in billions in sales.Soliris, made by Alexion, racked up more than $2.8 billion in sales in 2016 even though it is only approved to treat three rare diseases.In May, three Republican senators, including Senator Hatch, asked the Government Accountability Office to look into possible abuses of the Orphan Drug Act, prompted by an investigation by Kaiser Health News.Mr. Melmeyer said he did not think the request showed a change of heart by Senator Hatch, who is chairman of the Finance Committee that may release its tax plan as early as Thursday.Were very much counting on him to step up and be the champion on this, Mr. Melmeyer said.In 2015, a report commissioned by the biotechnology trade group and NORD estimated that if the tax credit were removed, the number of drugs approved over the next decade would decline by 33 percent.Eric Davis, the executive vice president and general counsel of BioMarin Pharmaceutical, which develops what it describes as ultrarare drugs, said the tax credit is really critical to helping us get over the hump with our investment decisions, and I think thats true for a lot of companies in our space.Philip English, a former Republican Congressman who now lobbies for drug firms, said he believed that his clients were picking up support from Republicans and said he was confident that the tax credit would survive any Senate plan.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I think there is a consensus within the industry and within the advocacy community that the orphan drug credit has been immensely successful in generating innovative investment that has produced a string of successes, Mr. English said.Rachel Klein, the senior director of advocacy and strategy for the EveryLife Foundation for Rare Diseases, which was founded by a drug industry executive, said policymakers need to be careful about tinkering with a program that has been around for decades.What seem like small changes can really have a large impact, she said.Ultimately this could end up doing more harm than good, and that really would be a problem for the millions of people who are relying on these companies to develop new therapies.
Ending Medical Tax Break Could Be a ‘Gut Punch’ to the Middle Class:::::This bill helps Americans keep more of the money they earn for expenses that arise throughout their lives such as medical bills rather than providing a myriad of provisions that many Americans may only use once in their lifetimes, and only if they go through the hassle and frustration of itemizing, said Lauren Aronson, a spokeswoman for the House Ways and Means committee.Photo According to an analysis in January from the Joint Committee on Taxation, most taxpayers who claim the deduction have incomes below $100,000, with about 40 percent below $75,000.More than half of those who claim it are older than 65, according to AARP, the lobby for older Americans.They often face staggering medical and long-term care costs.The deduction also helps younger families struggling to pay the enormous cost of caring for children with chronic conditions or disabilities, and couples going through costly fertility treatments like in vitro fertilization.In interviews, some who claimed it said the deduction is the difference allowing them to afford mental health care, new chemotherapy drugs, or cancer surgeries by doctors who fall outside insurance networks.I understand that in order to get tax reform through there need to be some pay fors, but getting those revenues from families who have been hardest hit by high cost medical conditions like autism or cancer seems a bit like targeting hurricane victims as a potential source of revenue, said John Rodakis, 48, of Dallas, who has a son with autism and runs a nonprofit foundation devoted to autism research.The Joint Committee estimated that the deduction for medical expenses would cost the federal government $10 billion next year, if it were not eliminated.That is far less than the two big deductions the Republican bill would preserve: one for interest paid on home mortgages is expected to cost $63.6 billion, and one for charitable donations, $47.8 billion.Most taxpayers claiming those deductions have incomes above $100,000.Taxpayers claimed a total of $87 billion in medical costs through the deduction in 2015, according to the Internal Revenue Service.An increase in the standard deduction would not nearly make up for that, tax experts said.The average Medicare beneficiary, for example, pays $5,680 a year in out-of-pocket costs, according to AARP.Last year Heather Block, 54, deducted $9,349 in medical expenses.For most of her career as a freelance international aid worker, she carried two health insurance policies.Before she got breast cancer six years ago, she said, it wouldnt have dawned on me that people had these medical expenses.Photo Her cancer is now stage 4.One month this year, she said, oral chemotherapy alone was $4,000.I feel like Ive had a running contest since I got cancer, she said, Am I going to use up my savings and go bankrupt or am I going to die first?Advertisement Continue reading the main story While the Affordable Care Act expanded coverage to millions more Americans and limited out-of-pocket costs, many, like Ms. Block, still face large expenses that insurance does not cover.Its like a backstop, and until such time that we have a health care system that covers everybody for everything, were going to need that backstop, said Alexandra Thornton, the senior director of tax policy at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress.Thats the thing with deductions, they recognize that sometimes people are in a situation where its harder to pay their taxes.Some are harder to defend, but this is one of the easier ones.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Lisa and Peter Witzlers second son, Jackson, was born with spina bifida, a defect caused when the spinal cord does not close in the womb.By his fifth month of life, hed spent three months in the hospital six weeks in neonatal intensive care and his parents had spent the money they had planned to put toward day care.Doctors had recommended private nursing because Jackson had severe sleep apnea and would repeatedly stop breathing and turn blue.But insurance would not cover it.We didnt have that time to prepare or save for anything, said Mr. Witzler, a union organizer.Photo The family, which lives in Montgomery Village, Md., had $25,000 in unreimbursed medical expenses last year.Being able to deduct those expenses, the Witzlers said, is the difference between their son getting treatment now, or needing more public services later in his

2017, she said.Ms. Lynch, who manages regional media advocacy for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said that the deduction, which would lower her taxable income by more than $20,000, would help rebuild the emergency savings that she and her husband have spent on fertility treatments this year.Advertisement Continue reading the main story To go after this is a gut punch, she said.Robert Graboyes, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said the plan to eliminate the deduction was part of a larger deal where one way you pay for broad tax cuts for a large part of the population is by ending a variety of small ones.My guess is they needed some revenue and this was a way to do it.But eliminating the deduction could hasten the speed at which some older Americans spend down their savings and have to go on Medicaid, a far greater expense for the federal government.Already Im having to dip severely into whatever Ive saved, said

Gene Therapy Creates Replacement Skin to Save a Dying Boy:::::Dr. Marinkovich has been conducting similar research and published a report a year ago in JAMA in which his team treated smaller areas of skin in four adults with a different form of the disease.Some improved, but the responses varied and tended to decline after a year.The research is continuing.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The new report, he said, has taken it to the next step and has actually used it to treat a large amount of skin.Thats whats really incredible.Other researchers have tried bone-marrow transplants to correct the genetic flaws in the disease, but several children have died from the side effects of that arduous treatment, and results have been mixed in those who survived.The boy in the Nature article had suffered since birth from blisters all over his body, and in 2015, when he was 7, contracted bacterial infections that caused him to lose two-thirds of his skin.His doctors did not know how to treat him, other than keeping him on morphine for the pain.Because burn victims also lose skin, the doctors sent him to the burn unit of the Childrens Hospital at Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany.A photograph of him then shows an emaciated body encased in raw, crimson flesh.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.We had a lot of trouble keeping this kid alive, Dr. Tobias Rothoeft, of the Childrens Hospital, said during a telephone briefing.Doctors in the burn unit tried everything: antibiotics, bandages, special nutritional measures, a skin transplant from the boys father.Nothing worked.After two months, we were sure we could do nothing for this kid and he would die, Dr. Rothoeft said.The physicians began to discuss just keeping the boy comfortable.But his parents begged them to keep trying.The doctors pored over medical journals and decided to approach Dr. Michele De Luca, the director of the Center for Regenerative Medicine Stefano Ferrari at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in Modena, Italy.Photo His team had treated smaller patches of skin on a patient with the same disease, and he had expertise in growing large skin grafts, which had been used to treat hundreds of burn victims.He is also renowned in the field for producing corneal grafts that have saved the sight of people with eye injuries.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He promised he could give us enough skin to heal this kid, which we then tried, and we were in the end successful, Dr. Rothoeft said.Dr. De Luca described the case as compassionate use of an experimental therapy that is being tested in clinical trials.The doctors removed a sample of the boys skin slightly more than half a square inch and took it to Modena, where they genetically engineered his cells, using a virus to insert the normal form of his mutated gene into his DNA.Then they grew the engineered cells in the laboratory into sheets of skin and transported them back to Germany, where surgeons grafted them onto the boys body.In October 2015, they covered his arms and legs with the new skin, and in November, his back.Ultimately, they replaced 80 percent of the childs skin.Dr. De Luca said that when the bandages were removed, It was spectacular.It was great.We removed the gauze, and saw the epidermis underneath.Everybody was pretty happy.We got the feeling that the body of the kid was recovering, was responding.That was the time where we thought, maybe we can make it.A major concern with any type of gene therapy is that the inserted genetic material could have dangerous side effects, like turning off an essential gene or turning on one that could lead to cancer.Analyses of the patients new skin did not find the added genetic material in any worrisome places, the researchers reported.Tests also showed that just a few long-lived stem cells maintained the new skin, an important finding that underlines the need for careful cell culturing, Dr. De Luca said.The boy was in the hospital for almost eight months, Dr. De Luca said, including more than four months during which he was kept in a medically induced coma to spare him from pain.The drugs were stopped a few weeks before Christmas.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When he woke up, Dr. De Luca said, he realized he had a new skin.
Democrats Assail Environmental Nominees Over Climate Change:::::Your positions are so far out of the mainstream, they are not just outliers, they are outrageous, said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts.You have a fringe voice that denies science, economics and reality.Asked if she stood by her previous statements, Mrs. White replied, Its likely that CO 2 has some influence on the climate, but added that carbon dioxide did not have the characteristics of a pollutant that directly affects human health.Its a plant nutrient, she said.The Trump administration last week issued a comprehensive report on climate science that said that the planet was definitely growing warmer and that human activities were the predominant cause.Despite those unambiguous findings, administration officials and nominees continue to question the validity of climate change science.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in Climate Change?Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Mr. Wheeler, a former aide to Senator James M. Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, faced lighter questioning.He declined to pledge to recuse himself from working on lawsuits that Murray Energy has filed against the E.P.A., saying he would abide by the guidance of the agencys ethics advisers.Midwestern Republicans, meanwhile, pressed Mrs. White on her past criticism of the renewable fuel standard, which requires refiners to blend corn-based ethanol with gasoline.White House officials last month directed the E.P.A.to halt efforts to weaken a federal biofuel mandate after pressure from Iowa politicians and others who threatened to hold up agency nominees.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mrs. White said that her position had recently changed because she had read new data and that she now supported the fuel standard.If the two are confirmed, it will go a small way toward filling the still largely empty ranks of senior energy and environmental posts, which are slowing the Trump administrations ability to achieve its agenda.According to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan and nonprofit organization that tracks federal nominations, 28 key positions at the E.P.A., the Energy Department and the Interior Department that require Senate confirmation lack nominees.Photo That includes critical positions like the under secretary for nuclear energy at the Energy Department and the director of the United States Geological Survey, who essentially serves as the Interior Departments chief scientist.At the E.P.A., only the administrator, Scott Pruitt, has been confirmed by the Senate.Five others are awaiting confirmation, including William L. Wehrum to lead the agencys air office and Michael L. Dourson to head the chemical safety office.Lawmakers acknowledged that Mrs. White and Mr. Wheeler may not have a confirmation vote until the end of the year, and six other E.P.A.positions are still without a nominee.Even Trump administration supporters who have applauded the E.P.A.s moves to undo Obama-era climate change rules said they were frustrated.You can talk the talk, but you need people to actually walk the walk in rolling back these agendas, said Nicolas Loris, a research fellow in energy and environmental policy at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group.You need people and staff in place to get these through the process.Senator John Barrasso, the Wyoming Republican who is chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, blamed Democrats for holding up the 11 environmental candidates the panel has approved and some 100 Trump administration nominees across agencies.The Senate, for example, has yet to confirm the administrator of NASA.All year long Democrats have been putting up roadblocks to President Trumps nominees, he said.Its time to end this pointless spectacle.Mr. Trump has indicated many of the vacancies may be permanent.Im generally not going to make a lot of the appointments that would normally be because you dont need them, he told Forbes.I mean, you look at some of these agencies, how massive they are, and its totally unnecessary.They have hundreds of thousands of people.Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, agreed that in some cases confirmations for Mr. Trumps nominees were taking longer than for other recent presidents.And, he said, Mr. Trump may be correct when he says the more than 4,000 appointments every new president must make are too many and largely unnecessary.Still, he said, with only about 440 people nominated to the 1,200 jobs requiring Senate confirmation, the fault, bluntly, is predominantly with the executive branch.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Nobody has done this quickly or well, Mr. Stier said.President Trump is just doing it worse than anyone else so far.
Syria Joins Paris Climate Accord, Leaving Only U.S. Opposed:::::Photo WASHINGTON Then there was one.Syria announced during United Nations climate talks on Tuesday that it would sign the Paris agreement on climate change.The move, which comes on the heels of Nicaragua signing the accord last month, will leave the United States as the only country that has rejected the global pact.According to several people who were in a plenary session at the climate talks in Bonn, Germany, a Syrian delegate announced that the country was poised to send its ratification of the Paris agreement to the United Nations.This is the very last country that actually announced, so everyone has joined and the U.S. is now so isolated, said Safa Al Jayoussi, executive director of IndyAct, an environmental organization based in Lebanon that works with Arab countries on climate change.A White House spokeswoman, Kelly Love, pointed reporters to a statement the administration made when Nicaragua joined the pact, noting there had been no change in the United States position.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in Climate Change?Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.As the president previously stated, the United States is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms the are more favorable for our country, the statement said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story President Trump announced in a Rose Garden speech this summer that the United States would quit the deal, calling it bad for Americas economy.
Wolves Know How to Work Together:::::Dogs have evolved to be friendly and tolerant of humans and one another, which might suggest they would be good at cooperative tasks.Wolves are known to cooperate in hunting and even in raising one anothers pups, but they can seem pretty intolerant of one another when they are snapping and growling around a kill.So researchers at the Wolf Science Center at the University of Vienna decided to compare the performance of wolves and dogs on a classic behavioral test.To get a food treat, two animals have to pull ropes attached to different ends of a tray.The trick is that they have to pull both ropes at the same time.Chimps, parrots, rooks and elephants have all succeeded at the task.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When Sarah Marshall-Pescini, Friederike Range and colleagues put wolves and dogs to the test, wolves did very well and dogs very poorly.In recordings of the experiments, the pairs of wolves look like experts, while the dogs seem, well, adorable and confused.More Reporting on Dogs The researchers reported their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.With no training, five of seven wolf pairs succeeded in mastering the task at least once.Only one of eight dog pairs did.

Lab Chimps Are Moving to Sanctuaries — Slowly:::::All the government chimps are headed to Chimp Haven, a sanctuary in Keithville, La., where they will have a full social life and room to roam outdoors.Some critics say the process has been unnecessarily slow, but both Chimp Haven and the N.I.H.say transfers are moving more quickly now.The sanctuary has accepted 14 chimps in the past two months and is expecting more before the end of the year.Chimp Haven, with a staff of 50, more than 200 chimps and a 30-year history, has had a lot of experience caring for retired chimps.They are kept in mixed groups of various sizes and their social interactions monitored.Advertisement Continue reading the main story To prevent breeding new chimps that would have to spend their lives in captivity, Chimp Haven gives all the males vasectomies.But vasectomies do fail, said Raven Jackson-Jewett, the attending veterinarian at the sanctuary.Conan was the one that taught us that.Conan had the procedure but somehow fathered three youngsters anyway, including Tracy, now 10 and a favorite of visitors.Dr. Jackson-Jewett said that because of Conan, Chimp Haven had learned that chimp vasectomies fail more often than those in humans.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The staff changed its technique, re-vasectomized about 75 chimps with the new method, and hasnt had a pregnancy since.The sanctuary also has learned to care for frail chimps.Many animals from labs have been infected with H.I.V.and hepatitis for vaccine experiments, and some have diabetes (not related to experiments).They are often old: Some arrive near 50 years of age, and the lifespan of chimps in captivity runs from 50 to 60 years.Occasionally chimps are deemed too old even to handle the stress of being sent to the sanctuary.Photo The sanctuaries hope eventually to put themselves out of business.If all goes as planned, in another 50 years or so, there will be no more lab retirees.Chimps will still be in zoos and, as the laws now stand, private owners could still breed them.But since the demand for their use in research is now zero, that is unlikely to happen on a large scale.Most privately owned laboratory chimpanzees are also headed for retirement centers.New Iberia has shipped 22 animals to Project Chimps, where Bo and his cohort now live, but still has nearly 200.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Project Chimps facility, which formerly housed gorillas, is still being renovated for chimps.They will get to play in eight acres of walled-in open space, with trees, a stream and an open meadow once the walls are fixed.(Unlike gorillas, chimps are agile climbers.)Those left at New Iberia arent isolated.They live in groups in large, dome-shaped outdoor cages.The domes have a bit less than a 1,000 square feet of floor space.Although chimps in research were once housed in smaller cages, and in isolation for experiments, practices have changed; labs and sanctuaries have recognized that it is cruel to house chimps alone.The only other private chimps still at research institutions include 46 owned by the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, and one at Georgia State University.Yerkes is looking for retirement facilities for its chimps and has sent seven to the Chattanooga Zoo.Yerkes also sent eight chimpanzees to an unaccredited zoo in England, prompting an outcry from animal welfare advocates in this country and in Europe.The move prompted a lawsuit, because the Fish and Wildlife Service approved it even though advocates insisted there were better options in the United States.Yerkes said that the English zoo was well equipped and enlisted comment from Dr. Goodall, who said she had visited the facility and supported the move.
ALMA details merger of two massive, super bright galaxies:::::Nov. 13 (UPI) -- ALMA has provided astronomers with new observations of the ongoing merger between two hyper-luminous starburst galaxies.The galaxies, collectively known as ADFS-27, are extremely large and bright.Astronomers believe intense rates of star formation were triggered when the two galaxies first grazed each other as they began their prolonged merging process.This near-collision jump-started what some astronomers think is the best example of violent star formation yet observed."Finding just one hyper-luminous starburst galaxy is remarkable in itself.Finding two of these rare galaxies in such close proximity is truly astounding," Dominik Riechers, an astronomer at Cornell University, said in a news release."Considering their extreme distance from Earth and the frenetic star-forming activity inside each, it's possible we may be witnessing the most intense galaxy merger known to date."ADFS-27 is located 12.7 billion light-years from Earth, which means astronomers are viewing the dynamics of galactic evolution as they played out just a billion years after the Big Bang and the birth of the universe.The cosmic object was first spotted by the European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory.Follow up observations were made using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array.The observations revealed remarkably intense regions of star formation.The intense stellar factories are fueled by the massive amounts of star-forming materials, gas and dust, surrounding the system -- 50 times more star-forming gas than is found in the Milky Way."Much of this gas will be converted into new stars very quickly," Riechers said."Our current observations indicate that these two galaxies are indeed producing stars at a breakneck pace, about one thousand times faster than our home galaxy."Unfortunately, the shell of dust and gas obscures much of the intense blue light emitted by young stars.Instead, the stellar light is absorbed by the gas and dust and reemitted in infrared form, which can be observed by ALMA."Due to their great distance and dustiness, these galaxies remain completely undetected at visible wavelengths," Riechers said."Eventually, we hope to combine the exquisite ALMA data with future infrared observations with NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.These two telescopes will form an astronomer's 'dream team' to better understand the nature of this and other such exceptionally rare, extreme systems."The latest ALMA observations show the duo remain 30,000 light-years apart.They will likely graze each other several more times before they collide head on and fuse into a single entity.The process will take several hundred million years.Researchers described their observations of the unique galactic system in a new paper published this week in the Astrophysical Journal.
Climate change is destroying Earth's natural wonders, UN report warns:::::Nov. 13 (UPI) -- In just the last three years, the number of World Heritage sites threatened by climate change has nearly doubled from 35 to 62, according to the latest report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.Sites are granted the World Heritage designation by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization for both cultural and natural significance.There are 206 natural World Heritage sites.Examples include Florida's Everglades, Australia's Great Barrier Reef and Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro.According to the latest IUCN report, a growing percentage of theses sites are threatened by global warming and its consequences -- including sea level rise, greater flooding, larger coastal storms, more frequent wildfires and prolonged drought.IUCN issued the report as delegates gather in Bonn, Germany, at the latest UN Climate Change Conference."This IUCN report sends a clear message to the delegates gathered here in Bonn: climate change acts fast and is not sparing the finest treasures of our planet," Inger Andersen, IUCN director general, said in a news release."The scale and the pace at which it is damaging our natural heritage underline the need for urgent and ambitious national commitments and actions to implement the Paris Agreement."The reports highlights the growth threat of warmer more acidic seas, which scientists blame for coral bleaching events.Corals bleaching threatens several World Heritage sites, including the the Great Barrier Reef, as well as the Aldabra Atoll in the Indian Ocean and the Belize Barrier Reef in the Atlantic.Warming temperatures threaten glaciers atop Mount Kilimanjaro and the Alps, while rising seas threaten the unique species of the Galapagos Islands, another World Heritage site."Natural World Heritage sites play a crucial role supporting local economies and livelihoods," said Tim Badman, director of IUCN's World Heritage program."Their destruction can thus have devastating consequences that go beyond their exceptional beauty and natural value.In Peru's Huascarn National Park, for example, melting glaciers affect water supplies and contaminate water and soil due to the release of heavy metals previously trapped under ice."The latest report also warned global warming can facilitate and worsen other threats to protected sites, like the spread of harmful invasive species and the threat of unsustainable tourism.And as climate change-related threats intensify, many sites are suffering from subpar management as a result of insufficient funding."If we cannot secure the highest quality protection for the world's most precious natural areas, what will this say about our ability to fulfill our collective commitments towards the planet, including the Paris agreement?"Anderson said.
Urban trees are growing faster than their rural peers:::::Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Trees in cities around the globe are growing faster than rural trees, according to a new study by researchers at the Technical University of Munich.The study -- published this week in the journal Nature -- is the first to measure the impact of the heat island effect on urban tree growth."While the effects of climate change on tree growth in forests have been extensively studied, there is little information available so far for urban trees," TUM researcher Hans Pretzsch said in a news release.Studies have shown trees to have a variety of ecological and health benefits, especially for residents of cities.As more of the world's population becomes concentrated in cities, the benefits of urban trees will grow in significance.Researchers at TUM analyzed heartwood samples from 1,400 trees, including a variety of species, growing in Berlin, Brisbane, Cape Town, Hanoi, Houston, Munich, Paris, Prince George, Santiago de Chile and Sapporo.Trees in rural areas surrounding each city were also sampled for comparison."We can show that urban trees of the same age are larger on average than rural trees because urban trees grow faster," Pretzsch said."While the difference amounts to about a quarter at the age of 50, it is still just under 20 percent at a hundred years of age."Researchers believe the heat island effect is boosting growth rates of trees in cities.The amount of heat-absorbent materials among buildings and urban infrastructure causes many cities to get between three and ten degrees Celsius warmer during the day than surrounding areas.The warmer temps can encourage photosynthetic activity and lengthen the growing season, allowing city trees to grow faster and get bigger than their rural peers.The new research also confirmed previous studies that found both urban and rural trees are growing faster -- as a result of global warming -- than they were several decades ago."The general acceleration of growth in all trees by about 20 percent, which we report in the current study, is comparable to previous findings on forests.This effect has also been observed in agricultural production," Pretzsch said."In this context, in addition to global warming, fertilization effects due to the rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and increased nitrogen depositions are discussed as potential driving forces."While so far tree growth has benefited from global warming, researchers warn that tree growth could reach a limit and plateau, allowing the negative consequences of global warming -- including extreme weather such as drought and large storms -- to catch up.
Rare, ancient life form found in Tasmania's wetlands:::::Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Scientists have discovered rare, living stromatolites among the wetlands of a remote Tasmanian Valley -- the first living stromatolites found on the island."Stromatolites are laminated structures of micro-organisms which have created layers of minerals using elements dissolved in the water in which they live," Bernadette Proemse, a researcher at the University of Tasmania, said in a news release."Fossil stromatolites are the oldest evidence for life on Earth -- they first appeared 3.7 billion years ago!"Living stromatolites are especially rare because other aquatic species like sea snails consume the microorganisms that form them.Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area is home to peat-bound karstic wetlands, which feature peaty soils on top and limestone beneath.The unique wetlands host spring mounds from which highly mineralized water flows, soaking the peat-rich soil.Structures in the underlying limestone force water to the surface, forming the spring mounds.The minerals provide food for the biofilm of microorganisms that form the stromatolites.In fact, stromatolites have helped grow the mounds.Scientists also found dozens of dead sea snails near the mounds."This is good for stromatolites because it means there are very few living snails to eat them.Fortuitously, these Tasmanian 'living fossils' are protected by the World Heritage Area and the sheer remoteness of the spring mounds," Proemse said.Researchers described their unique discovery in a new paper published this week in the journal Nature."The discovery of living stromatolites in Tasmania is highly significant because stromatolites are rare globally and not previously known from Tasmania except as ancient fossils," said Roland Eberhard, a researcher with the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water & Environment."DNA analysis indicates that the Tasmanian stromatolites are micro-organism communities which differ from all other known stromatolites."
Scientists make progress in quest for fusion energy:::::Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Creating fusion energy presents a variety of challenges, but researchers at Texas A&M University are closer to besting at least of the obstacles.Scientists have developed a new method for creating resilient materials -- possibly strong enough to survive the intensity of a fusion core.Fusion energy is the nuclear energy that powers the sun.One of the problems posed by fusion energy is the core is so powerful it would destroy most materials.The chief threat in a fusion core is helium.Fusion happens when two hydrogen atoms are fused to form a single helium atom.The helium can damage materials needed to build a fusion core."Helium is an element that we don't usually think of as being harmful," Dr. Michael Demkowicz, an associate professor of materials science and engineering at Texas A&M, said in a news release."It is not toxic and not a greenhouse gas, which is one reason why fusion power is so attractive."When fused into metal, helium forms bubbles in an attempt to escape just as CO2 fizzes out of a soft drink."Literally, you get these helium bubbles inside of the metal that stay there forever because the metal is solid," Demkowicz said."As you accumulate more and more helium, the bubbles start to link up and destroy the entire material."In labs at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Demkowicz and his research partners observed the behavior of helium inside nanocomposite solids, metals comprised of thick layers.They found the helium formed long vein-like channels instead of bubbles."We were blown away by what we saw," Demkowicz said."As you put more and more helium inside these nanocomposites, rather than destroying the material, the veins actually start to interconnect, resulting in kind of a vascular system."The channels provide an escape route for the helium without damaging the material.Researchers believe the nanocomposite metals could be used to build a fusion reactor.Researchers detailed the new materials in the journal Science Advances."Applications to fusion reactors are just the tip of the iceberg," Demkowicz said."I think the bigger picture here is in vascularized solids, ones that are kind of like tissues with vascular networks.What else could be transported through such networks?Perhaps heat or electricity or even chemicals that could help the material self-heal."
Biologist records rare sighting of giant crab hunting, killing bird:::::Nov. 12 (UPI) -- A biologist studying the world's largest crabs on a small island in the Indian Ocean caught video of one of them attacking and eating a bird.Last year, biologist Mark Laidre of Dartmouth College was in the Chagos Archipelago studying coconut crabs, the world's largest terrestrial invertebrate, which can get as big as small dogs.During one observation session, he saw one coconut crab about to kill a red-footed booby, which was a rare sighting.Crabs are known to feed on carcasses, but actually hunting down a live animal was rarely seen."Before leaving for Chagos, I wondered what coconut crabs would eat," Laidre wrote in a paper published this month."I had undertaken studies of foraging in terrestrial hermit crabs for almost a decade, in Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico, and these revealed an omnivorous and often carnivorous diet, one of the most diverse of any crustacean."Laidre added: "Yet only twice in all those years have I observed predation by terrestrial hermit crabs, in both cases on another invertebrate (hymenopterans that fell on the beach in their final death throes).All other carnivory involved scavenged dead carcasses."Not only did the coconut crab kill the red-footed booby, but it climbed up a tree to hunt it down."The booby had been sleeping on a low-lying branch, less than a meter up the tree.The crab slowly climbed up and grabbed the booby's wing with its claw, breaking the bone and causing the booby to fall to the ground, where it was unable to fly," Laidre wrote."The crab then approached the bird, grabbing and breaking its other wing.The booby struggled and pecked at the crab, but the crab retained its grip with both claws, kicking at the bird with its ambulatory legs."Within 20 minutes, five more coconut crabs arrived on the scene, "likely cueing in on the blood with their neurologically acute olfactory sense," Laidre wrote."As the booby lay paralyzed, the crabs fought, eventually tearing the bird apart over several hours, carrying it away, and consuming it."Warning: The video below might be disturbing for some viewers
Orbital ATK confirms Antares rocket launch: 'We have liftoff':::::Nov. 12 (UPI) -- Orbital ATK says Sunday's Antares rocket launch was successful and its fourth International Space Station resupply mission is now underway.The launch was slated for Saturday, but rescheduled after another aircraft flew into restricted airspace near NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia.The mission is to deliver 7,400 pounds of supplies, equipment and science experiments to the ISS."We have liftoff of #Antares carrying our S.S.

Rocket launch rescheduled after aircraft enters restricted space:::::Nov. 11 (UPI) -- Orbital OTK rescheduled Saturday's Antares rocket launch after another aircraft flew into restricted airspace near NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia.The rocket was expected to carry the Cygnus aircraft into orbit and deliver 7,400 pounds of supplies, equipment and science experiments to the International Space Station.Within 2 minutes of the scheduled launch time of 7:37 a.m., Orbital OTK scrapped the launch saying a "small aircraft" was flying at about 500 feet some 6 miles offshore."We were working no issues until an aircraft flew into restricted airspace," the aerospace company said on Twitter."We are currently de-tanking and will be ready to go tomorrow morning."Orbital OTK rescheduled the launch for 7:14 a.m. Sunday.Should skies remain clear, it was predicted the rocket launched would be seen from as far north as Boston to as far south as South Carolina.Among the thousands of pounds of supplies are several science experiments, including an experiment designed to measure antibiotic resistance in microgravity.A number of other experiments will explore the science of plant and crop growth in space.Several experimental CubeSats are also packed inside the Cygnus spacecraft.One of the box-shaped satellites will test a laser-based communications systems designed for small spacecrafts.Another mini satellite will test a hybrid solar power panel and communication solar antenna.Sunday's launch will be Orbital ATK's fourth ISS resupply mission.The company has yet to secure a private client for its launch services.Brooks Hays contributed to this report.
East Coast viewers may be able to see Saturday's Orbital ATK rocket launch:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- If weather conditions cooperate, viewers up and down the East Coast may be able to spot Orbital ATK's Antares rocket, scheduled to launch from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia on Saturday morning.The rocket will carry Orbital ATK's Cygnus spacecraft into orbit.Once in orbit, the craft will deliver 7,400 pounds of supplies, equipment and science experiments to the International Space Station.Saturday's blastoff is scheduled for 7:37am ET.If the current forecast for exceptionally clear skies along the Eastern Seaboard holds, the rocket launch could be glimpsed as far north as Boston and as far south as South Carolina.Among the thousands of pounds of supplies are several science experiments, including an experiment designed to measure antibiotic resistance in microgravity.A number of other experiments will explore the science of plant and crop growth in space.Several experimental CubeSats are also packed inside the Cygnus spacecraft.One of the box-shaped satellites will test a laser-based communications systems designed for small spacecrafts.Another mini satellite will test a hybrid solar power panel and communication solar antenna.NASA TV will offer coverage of the launch, including a live broadcast of the blastoff and flight, as well as followup coverage and commentary.As Ars Technica reports, Orbital ATK has failed to keep pace with SpaceX, its main competitor in the private rocket launch industry.SpaceX has launched 16 rockets for missions headed by NASA and other federal agencies.It's also executed 20 launches for private customers.Saturday's launch will be Orbital ATK's fourth ISS resupply mission.The company has yet to secure a private client for its launch services.
How to watch the Taurid meteor shower this weekend:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- The Taurid meteor shower can be slow going.But while the show isn't action packed, Taurid meteors are often bigger and brighter than others.To watch the Taurids, look skyward during this weekend's predawn hours.Sunday night, November 12, and early Monday morning, will provide the best viewing.Meteors are the result of collisions between Earth's upper atmosphere and rock and ice fragments left behind by asteroids and comets.The debris responsible for the Taurids was left behind by the comet Encke.Most of the fragments weigh just a few ounces."The dust associated with the comet hits the Earth's atmosphere at 65,000 miles per hour and burns up," NASA reported.The Taurids are named so because they appear to radiate from the constellation Taurus.The show actually began a few weeks ago; the shower is one of Earth's longest-lasting meteor showers.Though it never reaches much of a crescendo, it offers the chance to see shooting stars from mid-October through mid-November.A full moon made meteor watching difficult last weekend, but the moon is now waning and Sunday evening into Monday morning will offer seven hours of moon-free darkness.But every night for the next several nights will feature at least a few shooting stars -- as long as skies are clear."Each evening, up until the time the moon comes above the horizon, up to about 15 meteors may be visible per hour," the Scientific American reported."They are often yellowish-orange and, as meteors go, appear to move rather slowly."
Sunshine encourages more aggressive bidding at auctions:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- If you're looking for a real estate steal, you better hope it rains on auction day.Sunshine tends to encourage higher bids at auctions, according to a new study of home sale prices in Australia."Weather is known to affect mood, and some studies have shown a link between the weather and stock prices, so we decided to look at weather and house prices," Adrian Lee, finance lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney, said in a news release.Lee and his research partner Maggie Hu, finance professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, compiled the selling price of homes sold both privately and at auction in Sydney, Australia, between 2000 and 2014.They compared sales prices with daily measurements collected by the Bureau of Meteorology, including temperature, rainfall and solar exposure.Consumer sentiment survey data provided their analysis further context.Their findings showed sunny days boosted the winning bid of homes sold at auction by 0.974 percent, nearly $11,500 based on the median sale price of a house in Sydney."There is a link between sentiment, or mood, as measured by consumer sentiment surveys, and asset prices -- including house prices," Lee said.Warmer days had a similar effect on prices.Ten degrees of warmth translated to a 0.635 percent larger winning bid.For bargain hunters, rainy days are when to shop.Homes sold at auction went for 0.174 percent less when it rained -- a savings of $2,050.Long weekends and holidays are other good times for bidders looking for a lower price."Houses are not priced rationally," Lee said."The price is partly driven by people's feelings, particularly at auctions.So if you are buying or selling a house, it is good to be aware of these influences."Private home sales were impacted by the weather.Lee and Hu are scheduled to present their research at American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association Conference, being held in Philadelphia in January 2018.
Ancient Egyptian scribes mixed copper in their ink:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- New X-ray images have revealed copper in the ink scrawled on 2,000-year-old Egyptian papyri fragments.Until now, archaeologists thought Egyptian scribes used ink composed entirely of carbon-based ingredients until the fourth and fifth centuries AD.The latest findings -- detailed in the journal Scientific Reports -- suggest scribes began mixing copper into their carbon-based inks much earlier than previously thought.The practice was apparently widespread, as X-ray microscopy images revealed copper in a variety of papyri fragments, hailing from different geographical regions and produced over a period of 300 years."The composition of the copper-containing carbon inks showed no significant differences that could be related to time periods or geographical locations, which suggests that the ancient Egyptians used the same technology for ink production throughout Egypt from roughly 200 BC to 100 AD," Thomas Christiansen, an Egyptologist at the University of Copenhagen, said in a news release.The fragments surveyed in the latest study are part of the Papyrus Carlsberg Collection at the University of Copenhagen.Several of the fragments are sourced from the papers of Horus, an Egyptian soldier who kept a diary of sorts during his time at the military camp in Pathyris, a city near Thebes.Other fragments belong to manuscripts recovered from the Tebtunis temple library, the only surviving institutional library of Ancient Egypt."None of the four inks studied here was completely identical, and there can even be variations within a single papyrus fragment, suggesting that the composition of ink produced at the same location could vary a great deal," Christiansen said."This makes it impossible to produce maps of ink signatures that otherwise could have been used to date and place papyri fragments of uncertain provenance.""However, as many papyri have been handed down to us as fragments, the observation that ink used on individual manuscripts can differ from other manuscripts from the same source is good news insofar as it might facilitate the identification of fragments belonging to specific manuscripts or sections thereof," Christiansen added.Knowledge about the exact composition of ancient inks can help inform decisions about how best to preserve ancient papyri artifacts.
Historic data proves ice sheets can melt fast when climate warms:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- Ice sheets can disappear surprisingly quickly according to a new analysis by researchers at Purdue University.Scientists determined that the Cordilleran Ice Sheet was halved in size in just 500 years at the end of the last ice age.It's possible the modern Greenland Ice Sheet could suffer a similar fate as global temperatures continue to rise.During the Pleistocene, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet blanketed much of North America.Previous studies have found evidence of the ice sheet's presence in western Canada as late as 12,500 years ago.More recently, scientists determined much of western Canada was ice-free just 1,500 years prior, proof that ice sheets can dramatically advance and retreat during a relatively short amount of time.Scientists estimate the melting of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet at the end of the last ice age caused sea levels to rise by some 20 feet.When cold meltwater enters the ocean it sinks to the bottom as a result of its density.The influx of cold, dense water can disrupt the system of global ocean currents known as the conveyer belt.To better understand how quickly ice sheets can disappear and how rapidly glaciers can advance and retreat, researchers analyzed beryllium isotopes from moraine samples across Canada.Moraines are the deposits of rock left at the terminus of a glacier."We have one group of beryllium-10 measurements, which is 14,000 years old, and another group, which is 11,500 years old, and the difference in these ages is statistically significant," Marc Caffee, professor of physics in Purdue, said in a news release."The only way this would happen is if the ice in that area had completely gone away and then advanced."When the planet started to warm 14,000 years ago, ice receded from the tops of Canada's mountains.But shortly after, the planet began to cool again and the ice returned.The ice again retreated -- for good in most places -- as the ice age ended and the Pleistocene became the Holocene.Establishing timelines helps scientists tease out the cause and effect of different climate and geologic phenomena.Their latest analysis confirms that the Cordilleran Ice Sheet had disappeared prior to the period of global cooling just before the end of the last ice age, known the Younger Dryras cooling.Had the Cordilleran Ice Sheet still been present during this brief respite of cooling, researchers wouldn't see evidence of advancing cirque and valley glaciers.Thus, scientists can confirm the ice sheet melting was rapid not gradual.Researchers detailed their conclusions in a new paper published this week in the journal Science.Though rapid, the continental ice sheet's disappearance was surely complicated, researchers estimate.More research is needed to better understand how exactly the ice sheet melted so quickly -- and what that might mean for the Greenland Ice Sheet moving forward.
NASA shares new JunoCam image:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- Having received a fresh batch of data from Juno, NASA has shared a stunning new image of Jupiter's atmosphere captured during the probe's most recent flyby.Last month, Juno executed its eighth close approach to the gas giant.Though the flyby happened on Oct. 24, NASA scientists had to wait until Oct. 31 to begin receiving data from the approach, as Juno-to-Earth communication was blocked by the presence of the sun.A new image showcasing Jupiter's swirling atmosphere was released by NASA this week.Juno snapped the new image from a vantage of 20,577 miles from Jupiter's clouds.At 40 degrees south latitude, viewers can spot one of the eight massive storms spinning through Jupiter's atmosphere.The storms are known as the "String of Pearls."The new image was processed by a pair of citizen scientists, Gerald Eichstdt and Sen Doran.Dozens of raw images captured by JunoCam are available online for manipulation by amateur astronomers.
Unlucky dinosaurs: Scientists say asteroid had 13% chance of triggering extinction:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- When an asteroid came barreling into Earth some 66 million years ago, it wasn't necessarily a guarantee that life on planet Earth would be drastically altered -- that 75 percent of all plant and animal species, including the dinosaurs, would disappear.According to a new study published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports, there was just a 13 percent chance such a collision would prove so catastrophic.Most scientists agree that the Cretaceous-Paleogene, or K-Pg, extinction event, was triggered by the impact of a giant space rock some 66 million years ago.Now, a pair of scientists argue the main driver of extinction was the vast amount of soot expelled into the atmosphere by the impact.Had the rock hit elsewhere, the explosion may have emitted less soot, and the dinosaurs might have survived.Only 13 percent of the planet hosted sufficient amounts of hydrocarbons to yield catastrophic levels of soot.That 13 percent included the Yucatan Peninsula, where the asteroid hit.The exploded soot clogged the skies, triggering global cooling and drought."They were unlucky," said Kunio Kaiho, a professor at Japan's Tohoku University.Though most agree on the significance of the primary actor, the asteroid, not everyone agrees on the domino effect of geologic and ecological mechanisms that ultimately snuffed out the dinosaurs.Some have argued the impact triggered a series of firestorms and volcanic activity, both of which could have contributed large amounts of soot.Other scientists have argued the impact released large amounts of gas, not dust, into the atmosphere.Blown high into the upper layers of the atmosphere, large amounts of CO2 and sulfur would have quickly cooled the planet."The 13 percent number they're quoting has a lot of assumptions based around it," Sean Gulick, a geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin, told the Washington Post.But Kaiho and his research partner, Naga Oshima, an atmospheric chemist at Japan's Meteorological Research Institute, claim analysis of ancient soot deposits show the hydrocarbons burned at extremely high temperature -- temperatures that could have only be generated by a massive collision, not by firestorms or magma.No matter the odds, humans can be glad the asteroid struck where it did.With dinosaurs gone, mammals began to explore daylight hours, diversify and flourish.
Study details massive haul of ancient primate finger, toe bones from China:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Scientists have detailed the discovery of some 500 ancient primate toe and finger bones.The tiny fossils were recovered from China and described this week in the Journal of Human Evolution."The fossils are extraordinarily small, but in terms of quantity this is the largest single assemblage of fossil primate finger and toe specimens ever recorded," Dan Gebo, a researcher at Northern Illinois University, said in a news release.Many of the bones are barely larger than a grain of rice, but they have offered scientists a glimpse into the lives of the earliest primates.The bones represent a variety of primate families and at least 25 different early primate species, including the first known anthropoid, Eosimias.Three of the fossils represent newer, more advanced anthropoid species.The earliest primates -- hailing from the mid-Eocene period, around 45 million years ago -- ranged in size from 10 to 1,000 grams.They occupied the tree canopies of ancient jungles, eating fruits and insects.All of the fossils reveal an ability to grasp with both hands and feet, a prerequisite for life among the tree tops."The new study provides further evidence that early anthropoids were minuscule creatures, the size of a mouse or smaller," Gebo said."It also adds to the evidence pointing toward Asia as the initial continent for primate evolution.While apes and fossil humans do come from Africa, their ancestors came from Asia."The bones were recovered from a quarry near Shanghuang, a village in the south of Jiangsu Province, which is positioned along the central portion of China's east coast.The limestone in the quarry dates back to the Triassic, some 220 million years ago, when the first dinosaurs emerged.But erosion left fissures in the rock, which captured layers of fossil-rich sediment dated to the Eocene, when mammals begin to flourish in the absence of the dinosaurs."Because of commercial exploitation of the quarry site, the fossil-bearing fissure-fillings at Shanghuang are now exhausted," said Christopher Beard, a paleontologist at the University of Kansas."So, the fossils that we currently have are all that will ever be found from this site."But researchers continue to sift through the remarkable paleontological record that was recovered from the quarry over the last few decades.The diversity of primate species found at Shanghuang is unusual, and researchers hope their ongoing analysis can help scientists better understand the evolution of primate anatomy, including the unique fingers shared by all modern anthropoids, or higher primates."These are the earliest known examples of those narrow fingers and toes that are key to anthropoid evolution," Gebo said."We can see evolution occurring at this site, from the broader finger or toe tips to more narrow."
Science has more impact when researchers travel, collaborate:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- If nations and their research institutions are to produce more impactful science, they need to encourage scientists to travel, collaborate and work across international borders -- not restrict them.Concerned and curious about how new policies like Brexit and U.S. President Donald Trump's travel ban might impact science, researchers have been taking a closer look at the relationship between movement, collaboration and productivity.Their work has revealed patterns that include strong correlations between mobility, collaboration and scientific impact.These correlations were revealed by an analysis of scientific citations.Thanks to improved databases, scientists can now more accurately track how many times a study and its authors are cited by others.They can also normalize these numbers for each specific scientific field.If a scientist publishing in the field of biology is cited 20 times, and the average biology paper is cited four times, the scientist earns an impact factor of four.When Cassidy Sugimoto and her research partners looked at how a scientist's movement affected their impact, they found mobile scientists were more impactful on average than non-mobile scientists.They also found scientists became more impactful after they became mobile.Sugimoto and her colleagues are careful, however, not to equate impact with quality."A citation score is not a good measure of scientific quality," Sugimoto, an associate professor of informatics at Indiana University, told UPI."The best word for it is visibility, what I see is connection between impact and the visibility."In interviews, Sugimoto and her colleagues regularly reference the Matthew effect, which describes the accumulative advantage enjoyed by the most accomplished scientists.The effect works like a positive feedback loop, the most cited scientists are more likely to be mobile, and their mobility leads to more citations -- the richer get richer.But by narrowing their focus and viewing the correlation from a variety of angles, researchers say they were able to show mobility truly is a boon to impactful science."The patterns are quite consistent, so we are more or less certain that this is happening," said Nicolas Robinson-Garcia, a social scientist and bibliometrics specialist at the Technical University of Valencia in Spain.But besides more impactful, visible science, what happens when researchers move?How do they move and where do they go?Sugimoto, Robinson-Garcia and their colleagues tracked scientists' movement by tracing citations.Each citation is linked with an author's affiliation with one or more universities or research institutions.The country where a scientist first publishes is considered the scientist's country of origin."It's really important to disentangle academic origin from country of origin," Sugimoto said."We're most interested in the country that produced you academically."When a researcher is cited with a new affiliation in a different country, the scientist is classified as mobile.Researchers classify mobile scientists as either migrants or travelers.If someone continues to add new affiliations around the world, but never drops their original affiliation -- or maintains affiliations with their home country -- they are travelers.Most mobile scientists are travelers.So while some Asian countries may suffer brain drain in the sense that more scientists add North American affiliations to their Asian affiliations than vice versa, most scientists maintain relationships with their country long after they become mobile.Not all mobility is created equal.North America and Europe tend to operate as both an incubator and producer -- cultivating talent from elsewhere and introducing well-cited scientists to other parts of the world.Asian countries are mostly recruiters, bringing already accomplished scientists into their networks."We found women coming from many Middle Eastern countries, once they arrive in the U.S., had a much higher jump in their production and impact than their male counterparts," Sugimoto said."Mobility allows for new voices in science that might not have been heard otherwise."But mobility can also be a double-edged sword -- the Matthew effect is always lurking.Men tend to be more mobile, and thus are in an advantaged position when it comes to benefiting from the impact boost movement offers."Young moms don't move around as much and don't go to conferences as much," said Caroline Wagner, who conducts research in the field of science and technology at Ohio State University.Wagner is the lead author of another study looking at how a country's openness impacts scientific productivity and impact.Wagner and her colleagues assigned countries openness scores based on how easily researchers are able to come and go, how much collaboration is emphasized and how often scientists share co-authorship with scientists from other countries.Like Sugimoto, Wagner found a correlation between the ability to move and scientific impact.In fact, Wagner's work showed a country's openness was a better predictor of impactful science -- more frequently cited science -- than investment in research and development."New knowledge creation is recombination of ideas and thoughts into new and usually unexpected formations," Wagner said."Brains working together, challenging one another tends to contribute to creativity."Wagner says the research shows diversity breeds greater creativity, which is why she thinks it's important to encourage, not restrict, mobility and collaboration."Diverse teams are more creative, and gendered diverse teams are even more creative," she said."This has been shown in research."To encourage this kind of diversity, Sugimoto would like to see places like the United States change the way they fund the sciences."Our funding agencies keep thinking about national competitiveness and so we fund nationally instead of internationally," Sugimoto said."The EU has taken a different approach -- and the U.S. is falling behind on that -- by cultivating relationships and not creating barriers."But just as mobility can be a double-edged sword, so can international collaboration.Like Sugimoto, Wagner stresses the importance of mobility, openness and collaboration, but she worries the Matthew effect could see only the most accomplished scientists benefit from the advantages of international collaboration, while local researchers get left behind."I am very concerned that international collaboration -- while exciting and fruitful -- can leave the local level somewhat impoverished," Wagner said.Now, the question for Wagner, Sugimoto and others becomes, how can science policy encourage mobility and collaboration while ensuring the benefits they offer are broadly shared."Policymaking needs to shift from a 'push' model of creating knowledge to a 'scan and integrate' model," Wagner said."Smart people are all over and new ideas are emerging worldwide.Governments need to be scanning the global and helping reintegrate knowledge so that it is available locally when and where needed."
Experiment on Earth suggests microbes could survive on Mars:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- To better understand the limits of survival in our solar system and beyond, researchers exposed microbial communities to conditions replicating the harsh environment found on Mars.The microbes were surprisingly resilient.An improved understanding of life's limits can aid scientists as they search for biomarkers and signs of life throughout the solar system.Mars is cold, with an average temperature of negative 63 degrees Celsius.Its air pressure is also several hundred times less than Earth's and intense radiation, including gamma rays, regularly bombard Red Planet's surface.Scientists at Lomonosov Moscow State University replicated these harsh conditions in a small chamber in the lab.The test subjects included microbial communities collected from the Arctic permafrost.Researchers also sampled layers of ancient permafrost that haven't melted for 2 million years.Astrobiologists estimate the sediment layers on Mars act similarly to ancient Arctic permafrost, preserving microbes in a cryo-conserved state."In a nutshell, we have conducted a simulation experiment that covered the conditions of cryo-conservation in Martian regolith," Vladimir S. Cheptsov, a post-graduate student at LMSU, said in a news release.The tests results showed the permafrost microbes were surprisingly resilient.Prokaryotic cells and metabolically active bacterial cells survived as long as the control communities.Cultured bacteria, microbes growing on nutrient media, didn't fair as well.Researchers were surprised to find significant biodiversity among the microbes in the permafrost exposed to Mars-like radiation.The microbial communities weren't unaffected, however.Their makeup changed as a result of exposure, with certain strains becoming more dominant.Researchers published the results of their experiments this week in the journal Extremophiles."The results of the study indicate the possibility of prolonged cryo-conservation of viable microorganisms in the Martian regolith," researchers wrote."The data obtained can also be applied to assess the possibility of detecting viable microorganisms on other objects of the solar system and within small bodies in outer space."
Twice-dead star explodes 50 years later:::::Nov. 8 (UPI) -- It's the star that keeps on dying -- astronomers have discovered a star that's exploded several times over the last half-century.Scientists first noted supernova iPTF14hls in September 2014.The fresh explosion seemed like the average type II-P supernova.The glow of such explosions usually last for 100 days.This supernova remained bright for 600 days.When researchers examined archival observations of this specific spot in the sky, they found a 1954 explosion in the very same location.Apparently, the star suffered a fiery near-death explosion, survived, and then exploded again five decades later."This supernova breaks everything we thought we knew about how they work," Iair Arcavi, an astronomer at the University of California Santa Barbara and Las Cumbres Observatory, said in a news release.The supernova was first spotted using an instrument designed by Nick Konidaris, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution for Science.The SED Machine is designed to analyze astronomical data and identify and classify transient events.According to the SED Machine, iPTF14hls brightened and dimmed some five times over three years."I never expected it would help us analyze an explosion as strange as this zombie star," Konidaris said of his invention.Researchers described the zombie star in a paper published this week in the journal Nature.
Faith not linked to intuition or rational thinking, study shows:::::Nov. 8 (UPI) -- New research suggests people's religious beliefs are not directly influenced by intuition or rational thinking.Instead, a person's faith is most closely linked with their upbringing and socio-cultural background.Previous studies have hypothesized that religious beliefs are intuitive and that a person's faith is diminished when they're required to use analytical thinking.But a team of neuroscientists, cognitive psychologists and philosophers from Coventry University and Oxford University found little evidence for such a connection.The latest research, published this week in the journal Scientific Reports, included an investigation of people making the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage.The pilgrimage encompasses a network of routes through France and northern Spain leading to a shrine to the apostle Saint James the Great in the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain.Researchers interviewed pilgrims about the intensity of their faith and the time spent on the pilgrimage routes.They also assessed each pilgrim's intuitive thinking using a probability test, which called on participants to choose between a logical choice and a "gut response."The results of the experiment revealed no link between intuitive thinking and predilection for belief in the supernatural.In follow up tests, researchers attempted to boost intuition using a series of mathematical puzzles.The tests also failed to show a link between faith and intuitive thinking."What drives our belief in gods -- intuition or reason; heart or head?"lead study author Miguel Farias said in a news release."There has been a long debate on this matter but our studies have challenged the theory that being a religious believer is determined by how much individuals rely on intuitive or analytical thinking."In the final part of the study, researchers surveyed study participants about their faith after stimulating parts of the brain linked with cognitive inhibition, the ability to tune out stimuli.Previous studies have shown atheists rely on increased activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus when suppressing supernatural beliefs.The tests showed increased cognitive inhibition had no effect on religious beliefs.Researchers say their findings show humans are born believers.Humans don't come to faith intuitively the same way we take naturally to language learning."The available sociological and historical data show that what we believe in is mainly based on social and educational factors, and not on cognitive styles, such as intuitive/analytical thinking," Farias said."Religious belief is most likely rooted in culture rather than in some primitive gut intuition."
Shallow soil minerals can help store large reservoirs of carbon:::::Nov. 8 (UPI) -- One of the planet's biggest potential carbon sinks doesn't require carbon to sink very far.According to new research, soil minerals buried just a few feet below the surface can store vast amounts of carbon.Marc Kramer, an assistant professor of environmental chemistry at Washington State University Vancouver, believes the shallow carbon sink could help reduce the amount of CO2 stored in the atmosphere and curb global warming.The soil can store three times more carbon than Earth's atmosphere, but Kramer says few studies have explored its carbon-storing potential.He likens its mysteries of those of the deep ocean."Hardly anyone has been down there and they just found a new species of octopus," he said in a news release."We know more about the surface of Mars than we do about either oceans or soils on Earth."Kramer and his research partners previously characterized the carbon-storing abilities of soil in the journal Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.This week, Kramer published a new study in the journal Biogeochemistry Letters, detailing the specific minerals associated with carbon and nitrogen storage a few feet beneath the surface.In order to utilize the soil's carbon storing abilities, Kramer says we need to better understand how the carbon cycle works.We also need to prevent this carbon sink from being disrupted.Some 75 percent of all the carbon stored in the top three feet of soil is impacted by agriculture, grazing or forest management.Kramer's work has previously shown how improved management practices can help the soil on farms take up more carbon instead of releasing carbon back into the atmosphere and ocean.Such practices will become more imperative as agriculture continues to expand to meet the needs of the planet's growing human population."Don't forget, we need to double food production in the next 40 years," Kramer said.
Tracking collars reveal raiding strategies used by hungry baboons:::::Nov. 8 (UPI) -- Baboons in South Africa mostly use a sit and wait tactic before raiding homes in search of food, according to new research.Scientists used tracking collars to reveal the raiding strategies of local baboons, publishing the results of their research this week in the journal Scientific Reports."Raiding baboons are a real challenge in the Cape Peninsula, South Africa," Justin O'Riain, director of the Institute for Communities and Wildlife in Africa at the University of Cape Town, said in a news release."The baboons enter properties to raid in gardens and bins, but also enter homes and sometimes take food directly from people."After earlier research showed some male baboons were thwarting management companies and still managing to sneak into properties, O'Riain and his colleagues decided to design tracking collars to fit baboons."People assume the baboons don't have enough food in their natural habitats and therefore have no choice but to forage in town," said lead study author Galle Fehlmann."In fact, our research shows there is plenty of food in the natural environment where there is very little risk of the baboons being disturbed by anyone."Still, baboons are drawn to the rich bounties of food to be found in the city and suburbs.The density of calories is apparently worth the risk.Data from the tracking collars showed most baboons use a sit and wait tactic, roaming the edges of the city and executing short raids when they see an opportunity.Researchers hope their findings will help baboon management operations refine their strategies for deterring raids."We suspected the baboons were doing something clever to allow them to minimize the risks associated with urban foraging, and the data collected from the collars confirmed this," said Andrew King, researcher at Swansea University.Researchers found raiding baboons spend much less time foraging -- just 10 percent -- than their non-raiding peers elsewhere, who spend nearly half of their waking life looking for food."Our results present unequivocal evidence of extreme behavioral flexibility in these baboons," Fehlmann said."Behavioral flexibility has long been considered a central component of a species ability to cope with human-induced environmental changes, but has been difficult or impossible to quantify in wild animal populations.The new tracking technologies employed by the researchers are changing this."
Collision of giant galaxy clusters yields colorful image:::::Nov. 7 (UPI) -- A new image released by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory showcases the intense radio emissions triggered by the collision of several giant galaxy clusters.The cosmic collision triggered shockwaves and released massive amounts of energy, heating up gas and dust across a region of space several million light-years wide.The massive galaxy cluster is named Abell 2744, or Pandora's Cluster.It's located 4 billion light-years from Earth.The newly released image is a composite of observations made by several instruments.Scientists combined new data collected by the National Science Foundation's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array with older data recorded by NASA's Chandra X-ray observatory.The renderings of Abell 2744's radio wave and X-ray emissions are overlaid on a visible light composite image of the super cluster captured by the Subaru telescope and the Very Large Telescope.Thanks to the newest VLA data, astronomers were able to spot previously undetected areas of space where shockwaves have excited subatomic particles and triggered radio emissions.Pandora's Cluster was formed by a series of collisions between galaxy clusters over the course of some 350 million years.Researchers hope the latest image can help them better understand the timeline of collisions that yielded the super cluster.The latest analysis -- detailed in the Astrophysical Journal -- suggests the super cluster is made up of a collision oriented along a north-south axis and another another along an east-west axis.Scientists believe there was a third major collision, but are still trying to tease out its signature in the latest renderings.
Scientists design smart paper capable of detecting water, conducting electricity:::::Nov. 7 (UPI) -- Scientists at the University of Washington have designed smart paper capable of sensing water and conducting electricity.The paper could be used to detect water leaks in city pipes.Even small leaks in a city's maze of pipes can prove costly.Left alone, the problem can get worse.And finding the leak can prove timely.The American Water Works Association estimate leaks cause 250,000 water line breaks every year, costing public water utilities an annual sum of $2.8 billion.Scientists hope their new smart paper can shrink those costs by making it easier to find and fix leaks.The paper can sense the presence of water and conduct an electric current to sound an alarm or trigger a light, alerting maintenance authorities to the presence of a leak."Water sensing is very challenging to do due to the polar nature of water, and what is used now is very expensive and not practical to implement," Anthony Dichiara, assistant professor of bioresource science and engineering at UW's School of Environment and Forest Sciences, said in a news release."That led to the reason to pursue this work."Scientists used the standard paper making process but mixed the wood fiber pulp with nanomaterials capable of detecting water and conducting current.The technology originally came about by accident.Researchers were simply trying to make a paper capable of powering an LED light.When a few drops of water spilled onto their paper, the light was disrupted.The scientists thought they'd ruined their technology.In fact, they'd created water-sensitive paper.The water swells the fibrous wood cells disrupting the current, but as the paper dries, the nanomaterials reform the conductive network.The paper can also be designed to trigger a current when it detects water.Researchers believe the paper could be outfitted with a battery and wrapped around pipes or positioned between complex intersections of pipes.When the paper detects a water leak, a current will alert maintenance workers."I believe that for large-scale applications, this is definitely doable," Dichiara said."The price for nanomaterials is going to drop, and we're already using an established papermaking process.You just add what we developed in the right place and time in the process."The carbon nanomaterials are composed of carbon atoms that can be extracted from a variety of natural sources.Scientists burned banana peels, tree bark, animal feces and even wood to create charcoal, from which carbon atoms can be extracted and incorporated into the paper making process."Now we have a sustainable process where everything is from pulp and paper, and we can make conductive materials from them," Dichiara said.Researchers described their discovery in a new paper published the November issue of the Journal of Materials Chemistry A.Next, scientists hope to test their technology using industrial paper-making machinery.
Fossils of human's oldest mammalian relatives found along English coast:::::Nov. 7 (UPI) -- Paleontologists have discovered the remains of the earliest mammals belonging to the lineage that evolved modern humans.The fossils were found along the coast of southern England.Researchers from the University of Portsmouth discovered a pair of small teeth while sifting through rocks.The teeth belonged to a small rat-like creature that scurried along the forest floor 145 million years ago, while giant dinosaurs were tromping overhead.The mammal is the earliest undisputed member of the lineage that yielded Homo sapiens.The fossil teeth were found by undergraduate student Grant Smith, but they were identified by Steve Sweetman, a research fellow at Portsmouth."Grant was sifting through small samples of earliest Cretaceous rocks collected on the coast of Dorset as part of his undergraduate dissertation project in the hope of finding some interesting remains," Sweetman said in a news release."Quite unexpectedly he found not one but two quite remarkable teeth of a type never before seen from rocks of this age."The discovery landed Smith's name in the journal Acta Palaeontologica Polonica."Steve made the connection immediately, but what I'm most pleased about is that a student who is a complete beginner was able to make a remarkable scientific discovery in palaeontology and see his discovery and his name published in a scientific paper," said Dave Martill, professor of palaeobiology.Sweetman recognized the teeth as being uniquely evolved, recalling the teeth of mammal species that wouldn't appear in the fossil record for another 60 million years.It was immediately clear they belonged to an early mammal species."In the world of palaeontology there has been a lot of debate around a specimen found in China, which is approximately 160 million years old," Sweetman said."This was originally said to be of the same type as ours but recent studies have ruled this out.That being the case, our 145 million year old teeth are undoubtedly the earliest yet known from the line of mammals that lead to our own species."Sweetman believes the rat-like creature to which the teeth belonged was small, furry and nocturnal.The teeth were capable of piercing and crushing food, which suggests the small mammal likely ate both insects and plants.The two teeth were also quite worn, suggesting the specimen lived to a decent age.The teeth were found among rocks collected from the cliffs near Swanage, a town in the south east of Dorset.The rocks there have yielded thousands of unique fossils through the years."The Jurassic Coast is always unveiling fresh secrets and I'd like to think that similar discoveries will continue to be made right on our doorstep," said Martill.
Exoplanets Lurking in Dusty Disks Reveal Their Secrets:::::A disk of gas and dust around a star some 450 light-years from Earth had astronomers puzzled.When observations of the star HL Tauri revealed a glowing disk split by crisp bands, some assumed unseen planets were carving out paths as they orbited.But new simulations suggest a more complex picture.Those gaps may actually result from gravitational tugs of planets elsewhere in the disk, even outside of the disk, and learning to read these patterns could speed the detection of currently hard-to-find planets.Were going to start seeing more of these coming out very soon, a lot of these beautiful, high signal-to-noise ratio disks that we can see with these structures, says Maryam Tabeshian, developer of the model and researcher at Western University in Ontario.Astronomers love such planet-forming, or protoplanetary, disks as well as their less gaseous cousins, debris disks, for the same reason paparazzi love a crowd: a quick glance can usually tell you where your target is.But rather than fame, Tabeshian proposes relying on orbital jostling motions to aid the search.These dust-and-gas disks may look solid, but they are composed of grains, boulders and mini planets all orbiting at different speedsfaster up close to the star and slower farther out.When a planet syncs up with a distant particle orbiting, say, two times slower or three times faster, it is known as mean motion resonance.Each time the planet aligns with a particle, it gives it a gravitational nudge, which can ultimately eject it from the disk entirely.When this process is spread out along an entire ring, it can open holes far from the planet responsible.Features such as the width, location and shape of the gap could be used to predict the planets mass and orbit, according to a pair of papers, the latest of which was published in September by The Astrophysical Journal.For example, a planet orbiting beyond a disks radius would produce two rotating arc-shaped holes whereas one orbiting in its interior would create only one, Tabeshian says.An extra gap of a certain type would suggest a planet with a more oblong orbit, and wider gaps point to the presence of more massive planets.Tabeshian has already put the theory into practice.A study currently under review, prepared with Western University astronomer Paul Wiegert, shows that via resonances, three properly placed exoplanets could produce five of HL Tauris gaps.Educated guesses like these could narrow the haystack that exoplanet hunters have to search or, in the case of exterior planets, hint that certain needles lie outside the haystack entirely.Its great that theorists like Maryam and Paul are preparing these tools, says astronomer Erika Nesvold of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, so then when observers do take interesting pictures, they can get an idea of what theyre looking at.But the dusty signs Tabeshians simulation predicts may prove hard to read.The view of these disks from Earth has to be just right: top-down, not edge-on.Whats more, the patterns sit right on the technological edge of what current tools can resolve.The trick is to figure out whether you can do it with either our current telescopes or the next generation of telescopes, notes Nesvold, who was not involved in the research.Nesvold is no stranger to the challenges of applying theory to reality: She developed her own model that simulates the chain reaction of collisions a planet sets off when it careens through a debris cloud.Still, she sees these disk techniques as natural complements to well-established planet-detection methods.Looking for planets based on stars that wobble or flicker tends to reveal big exoplanets with tight orbitsmore like Mercury than Earthbut debris disks register disturbances from bodies both near and far.More distant planets would actually be easier to detect, Nesvold says, because the stars light washes out inner-disk regions.Then, if disk behavior hints at outlying bodies, astronomers will have a better idea where to aim telescopes for the money shotimaging them directly.This detection method also favors planets orbiting distantly from their stars.As they refine their techniques, however, direct imagers will strive to find planets closer to their bright host stars, and those who search for wobbles and flickers will push outward toward wider orbits.No method has found an exact Earth twin yet, but Nesvold suggests debris disk models can help the two methods meet in the middle.To get to Earth orbit, she says, were kind of coming at it from both ends.
Repair or Renovate? Puerto Rico Faces Stark Power Grid Options:::::It has been 68 days since Hurricane Irma took down much of Puerto Ricos aging power grid and 54 days since Hurricane Maria finished the job, leaving nearly all 3.4 million residents without electricity.The islands state-owned utility company, the U.S. government and workers on loan from other utilities are installing new poles, lines and power distribution circuits to replace those blown away by the storms.Despite the progress that has been made, more than half of Puerto Rico continues to soldier on without some of modern lifes bare necessitiesincluding lights, refrigeration, air-conditioning and access to computer networks.Without significant improvements to create a more resilient grid, however, many are questioning how Puerto Rico can avoid a similar catastrophe the next time a major storm hits.The consensus among the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and others involved in the current restoration project is that Puerto Rico isand has been for a long timein desperate need of a power grid makeover.Last Wednesday, during a press conference, Ricardo Ramos, executive director of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), indicated the utility has created a transformation plan to improve service.Within 24 hours of the press conference a transmission line supposedly repaired a few days earlier failed, plunging San Juan and several other cities back into darkness until power could once again be restored in the following days.Such is the nature of power in Puerto Rico, as PREPA struggles to keep its fragile electrical grid online while promising to make improvements that to date have failed to materialize.A three-day blackout in September 2016 derailed the power utilitys previous push to upgrade the islands fragile grid.(pdf, in Spanish) Ramoss new plan lacks specifics but includes two key components: better distribution of power plants throughout the island and the implementation of microgrids that serve fewer customers but can keep the lights on when the main grid fails.Planning for Failure A microgrid is a local, self-sufficient network of generators, storage devices (typically batteries) and equipment that routes electricity to homes, businesses and other structures that require service.A key benefit of such a setup is that it can operate as part of the main grid or function autonomously.These grids can be powered by diesel-burning generators or a combination of fossil fuels and renewable energy sources such as solar and/or wind.Distributing the load in this way can alleviate reliance on one main system whose failure could cut power to the entire island.Puerto Rico needs a mix of microgrids disbursed throughout the island to provide electricity in a cost-effective way, says Jos Antonio Santivez, a professor of industrial management engineering at Puerto Ricos University of Turabo.Another reason microgrids are a good option for Puerto Rico is that there are hard-to-reach places on the island where [PREPA] said it would never be able to deliver power.Those residents live off the main grid and already rely mostly on portable generators for electricity.Many businesses and tourist resorts in Puerto Rico also have their own self-contained power networks in order to operate during emergencies or even PREPAs normal power outages.PREPAs customer outage rate is four to five times higher than other U.S. utilities (pdf).The main problem, though, is that people living in rural areas dont have the money to build or manage their own microgrids, so the government would have to step in to help, Santivez says.There are other drawbacks to these self-contained systems: A lot of people want to be part of the main grid because the quality of the power is much better, says Mike Hyland, senior vice president of engineering services for the American Public Power Association, a trade group for the utility industry.Thats a big issue when it comes to electronics and manufacturing businesses, in which they cant have transient spikes or blips causing sudden changes in voltage that could [damage] or freeze up their electronics.The main grids large-scale energy production enables it to smooth over sudden changes in voltage in ways that a microgrid cannot.Im a big fan of microgrids, but they arent the saviors that many people think they are, he adds.The PREPA plans mention of distributed generation is an acknowledgement the island needs more generators positioned throughout the island, and that they need to be closer to their consumers.Many of PREPAs largest power plants are in Salinas, Guayanilla and other towns near the islands southern coast, where land is less expensive and the Commonwealth Oil Refining Co. once operated a large (now defunct) oil refinery.Most of the population, however, lives in the northern half of the island separated from the south by a mountainous central region.It has been decades since the south was home to large facilities that needed lots of power, and Puerto Ricos governor has an interest in locating the power generators closer to the population that they support, Maj. Gen. Donald Jackson, deputy commanding general for the Army Corps Civil and Emergency Operations, testified at an October 31 U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing.That would obviate the long transmission lines currently needed across the island.The [U.S. Department of Energy] is looking at that.Such a move is long overdue, according to Santivez.Bringing power from the southern part of the island to the northern part has been a lost cause, he says.It has been more than two months since the storms and most people still dont have electricity.In addition to better distribution of power plants throughout the island, increased use of underground cabling could enable the power company to deliver electricity to customers without worrying about poles and lines downed by hurricane gales.That approach has been effective in areas of Puerto Ricos capital, San Juanalthough the cables could be vulnerable to damage from flooding.The limitations on underground cable include high costs10 times greater than aboveground lines and polesand the islands mountainous terrain.Underground power cables also require more time and money to manufacture than do overhead wires, Hyland says.And, because they are out of sight, it is difficult to know when they have been damaged, he adds.Still, Hyland acknowledges it makes sense to consider subterranean lines in specific parts of the island for the future.Another approach would be to supplement more of the grids diesel oil generators with power from solar and wind farms, although such power sources are too intermittent to replace a fossil fuel grid, Santivez says.Renewable energy sources such as solar panels would be good for one house or a group of homesif they could afford itbut not for the entire island, he adds.I have a suspicion that those solar panels in particular would be gone with the wind in the event of another category 5 storm, he says.Solar panel debris is seen scattered in a solar panel field in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Humacao, Puerto Rico on October 2, 2017. Credit: Ricardo Arduengo Getty Images Red Tape None of those upgrades will happen anytime soon, however, because FEMA is not allowed to fund them.The 1988 Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act authorizes government agencies only to restore utility service to its predisaster condition.Additionally, PREPA has no money to pay for upgrades.The U.S. Army Corps is working to reestablish the grid to U.S. code standards, FEMA Administrator Brock Long testified at the October 31 Senate committee hearing.Typically, we have to restore to a predisaster condition, but obviously that is not optimal and not the way I would ever recommend [Puerto Rico] to go.We do not want to be back in this situation again.A category 4 or 5 storm such as Irma or Maria will knock down any aboveground wires, Long added, even if they are attached to newly installed poles.The discussion that needs to be taken after that is: How do we build a power grid that is resilient?Long told the committee.Thats going to require authorities far greater than the Stafford Act affords me and FEMA.The agency needs additional legal authority from Congress for money to make any additional improvements, according to Long.PREPAs bankruptcy in May further complicates Puerto Ricos efforts to improve grid resilience.The government-owned power authority is responsible for about $9 billion of the islands $73-billion debt.Puerto Rico formed PREPA in 1941 to be the sole provider of electricity for the islands then 1.5 million customers.The companys power plants are, on average, currently more than 40 years old, Long testified, adding, worldwide, the average age of power plants is 18 years.PREPA made headlines recently for awarding a couple of large contracts that would have spent a lot of FEMAs money, apparently without the agencys approval.The first was a $300-million deal with a two-person operation based in Montana called Whitefish Energy that has since been cancelled and is under investigation.Just a few days later PREPA awarded a second questionable contract to pay Cobra Acquisitions, a subsidiary of Oklahoma Citybased Mammoth Energy, $200 million even though the small firm has little experience with disaster recovery.The power utility has since turned to utilities in New York State and Florida, whose services FEMA will help pay for.Public and private utilities in New York have already pledged to send 350 utility personnel and 220 vehicles, with more to follow.Ultimately, major improvements to Puerto Ricos grid will have to wait until after PREPA and its partners fix the hurricane damage to the existing infrastructure.Trying to make big changes and get the power up and running at the same time are not necessarily in the cards, says Steve Hauser, chief executive officer of the GridWise Alliance, a lobbyist organization pushing the U.S. government to invest in upgrades to the countrys power grid.Hauser, a former vice president of grid integration at the Energy Department's National Renewable Energy Laboratory adds, If you want to rebuild it in a modern design, that probably takes years, not weeks.Not surprisingly, the restrictions on FEMA funding do not sit well with Puerto Ricans, many of whom face the daunting choice of living through at least several more weeks without power or evacuating to the mainland.PREPA plans to have 50 percent of its grid online by mid-November and nearly all of it up and running by mid-December.Other estimates, however, suggest some of the islands rural areas likely will not be able to turn on the lights before springtime at the earliest.
4 Laws That Could Stem the Rising Threat of Mass Shootings:::::After the massacre this week in Sutherland Springs, Texas, that states attorney general told Fox News gun control laws will not prevent mass shootings.This guy violated the laws against murder, Ken Paxton said of shooter Devin Kelley.Adding some other gun law would not, I dont think, in any way change this guys behavior.Former Texas State Senator Jerry Patterson made the same point to The New York Times: All these window-dressing proposed laws dont make us safer.These claimsrepeated across the countryare wrong.The right gun laws do prevent shootings, research strongly indicates.And these laws do not mean confiscating everybodys guns.Scientific American spoke with Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis, Medical Center, and Daniel Webster, director of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Healths Center for Gun Policy and Research, about four feasible legal and policy changes that would be most effective.Here are the life-saving laws and the data that supports them.Require permits to purchase One clear flaw in federal gun laws is that prospective buyers do not get background checks when buying from private sellers, only when buying from licensed dealers.An effective solution would be to require people to apply, in-person, at local law enforcement agencies for gun purchase permits.This approach would make it harder for bad guys to buy guns, Wintemute says.These laws are already in place for handgun purchases in 10 states and in Washington, D.C.In a 2009 study involving 53 cities Webster and his colleagues found this approach, which gives law enforcement officials discretion about who they gave permits to, was linked with a 68 percent reduced risk of guns being diverted to criminals post-sale.But after Missouri repealed its permit-to-purchase handgun law in 2007, firearm homicide rates increased by 25 percent, a jump that was not seen in neighboring states or the rest of the country, Websters team reported.Missouris repeal was also linked with a 52 percent increase in handgun murders of law enforcement officers in the line of duty.Permit-to-purchase approaches are more effective than seller-focused comprehensive or universal background checks.One reason is that sellers who fail to conduct checks are rarely punished.Our research in Maryland and Pennsylvania has shown that very few people are arrested, prosecuted and punished for not complying, Webster says.There is no available evidence that comprehensive background checks without permit-to-purchase is effective in reducing shootings.Another major flaw with universal checks is that relevant information is not always reported to agencies to be included in the background check database.Kelley should have failed his background check because of his domestic violence conviction in the Air Force, but the incident had not been reported.Agencies just dont report when they know theyre supposed to, when they know theyre required to, Wintemute says, because reporting is time- and labor-intensive.Permit-to-purchase laws could circumvent this issue because local law enforcement has direct access to details about criminal history.Ban individuals convicted of any violent crime from gun purchase Americans with convictions for domestic violence are already banned for life from buying guns (although again, Kelley fell through the cracks).But that is not the case for other violent offenders.If I punch my partner and Im convicted, under federal law Im prohibited for life, Wintemute says, but I can punch my next-door neighbor and in most of the country that has no implications for gun ownership whatsoever.California is an illustrative exception: In 1991 the state passed a law preventing individuals with violent convictions from buying guns.And in a study published in JAMA The Journal of the American Medical Association in 2001 Wintemute and his colleagues studied its effects.Convicts who were allowed to buy guns before the law passed were nearly 30 percent more likely to be arrested later for a gun crime or other violent act compared with convicts who tried, but were unable, to buy guns after the law was passed.Thats a big effect, Wintemute says.Make all serious domestic violence offenders surrender firearms The federal statute preventing domestic violence criminals from having guns has a big loophole: Guns often arent taken away unless criminals voluntarily relinquish them to local law enforcement agencies.So offenders can get out of jail and immediately start using guns they have cached.Some states are now passing state laws requiring individuals convicted of domestic violence crimes to surrender their firearms; an October 2017 study found that these relinquishment laws are nearly 50 percent more effective than non-relinquishment laws at reducing intimate partner violence.It would also help a lot to restrict guns from people with domestic violence restraining orders against them.In a 2010 study Webster and his colleagues found restrictions based on restraining orders were associated with a 19 percent reduction in the risk for intimate partner homicide in large U.S. cities.Such restrictions are in place in 35 states and Washington D.C.These changes are important because intimate partner violence is strongly tied to mass shootings: A 2015 report by the Congressional Research Service found more than one fifth of all public mass shootings between 1999 and 2013 were precipitated in part by domestic disputes.During this period there were also 127 nonpublic mass shootings in the U.S. that involved an individual killing at least four family members.Keeping people prone to domestic violence away from firearms would prevent many massacres.Temporarily ban active alcohol abusers from firearms Federal law prohibits people who are addicted to and/or unlawfully using controlled substances from owning guns.But recent data suggest some nine million U.S. firearm owners also binge drink, which is a specific medical problem involving abuse of the substance alcohol.Wintemutes research suggests people with DUIs (driving under the influence) are four to five times as likely as people with no criminal record to be arrested for a violent crime in the future.Based on these data, Wintemute proposes a temporary ban on gun possession among individuals who have had, in the past five years, two or more convictions for DUI or another crime that indicates alcohol abuse.Theres just no question that alcohol abuse is a risk factor for future violence in the general population, and its specifically a risk factor for future firearm violence, he says.The evidence, taken together, shows these four laws could make a significant dent in U.S. gun violence if implemented in every state.In particular they could reduce the terrible death toll from mass shootings.Given the apathetic track record of U.S. Congress and many state governments, its unclear whether our country has the political will to make these changes.We do, however, have a good sense of how effective these changes would be.
More Guns Mean More Violent Crime--or Less? A Researcher Aims at Scientific American:::::The Objection John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center in Swarthmore, Pa., writes: Melinda Wenner Moyers article Journey to Gunland (October 2017) is very biased and ignores virtually all of the literature on right-to-carry laws and gun ownership since 1998.About two thirds of the peer-reviewed, published literature shows concealed carry laws help reduce crime.I even provided Moyer with those published papers, but she doesnt provide a single reference to or quote from them.Moyer appears completely unaware any of my research after 1998, making no mention of the 2nd and 3rd editions of More Guns, Less Crime (University of Chicago Press, 2000, 2010).Moyer cites the National Research Council (NRC), but fails to accurately describe its findings.The council was more supportive of right-to-carry laws than it was of any other gun law.As is typical of NRC reports, the 2005 Firearms and Violence by the council refrained from endorsing any of the over 100 different gun regulations it studied.However, there was one unexpected dissent by preeminent criminologist James Q. Wilson.Dissents in NRC reports are extremely rare.In the 10 years prior to the NRC report there were only two dissents out of 236 reports.Wilson, who had always supported gun control, had been on four previous panels but never had written a dissent.Finally, however, he pointed out the NRCs own regressions consistently show right-to-carry laws reduce murder rates.Moyer quotes physician Garen Wintemute: Few studiessuggest that liberalizing access to concealed firearms has, on balance, beneficial effects.But Moyer ignores 24 peer-reviewed publications just showing that crime in the U.S. drops after people are allowed to carry concealed handguns.She references a recent unpublished paper by John Donohue, Abhay Aneja and Kyle Weber, but, unlike other studies, they dont measure the number of permits issued, account for any other gun-control laws or deal with well-known statistical errors (such as truncation problems from a lot of zero values in the crime rates).The study also relies almost exclusively on trends in Hawaii to predict violent crime rates in Idaho, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska and Utah.Take one example of Moyers sloppiness or bias in her article.Moyer has a long discussion of Arthur Kellermanns work on the risks of guns in the home, and notes that Kellermann studied 444 people who had been killed between 1987 and 1992 at home.But Moyer fails to note that, in fact, in only eight of these 444 homicide cases was the murder weapon a gun that had been kept in the home (The New England Journal of Medicine, February 3, 1994, p. 368).If Moyer had even read the 1998 edition of More Guns, Less Crime, she would have learned this.The Rebuttal Melinda Wenner Moyer responds: John R. Lott, Jr., is wrong in his claims.He asserts two thirds of the peer-reviewed, published literature shows that concealed carry laws help reduce crime.This figure comes from a 2012 paper Lott himself wrote for the Maryland Law Review.In it he asserts that 18 peer-reviewed studies show right-to-carry laws reduce violent crime but only 11 suggest a different result.But his two-thirds claim is false.Many of these 18 supposed pro-carry studies are off-topic.One is a paper by Lott on gun storage laws that has nothing to do with concealed carry.A second paper investigates how abortion relates to crime, a third concerns laws that prevent minors from owning gunsagain, irrelevant to concealed carry.Lott also includes the second edition of his own book as one of these 18 peer-reviewed studies.In total, one third of his proconcealed-carry citations refer to his own work.Not only does Lott inflate the number of studies that support his thesis, but he also completely omits many peer-reviewed studies that belong on the other side.Lott is also wrong in his contention that I ignore 24 peer-reviewed publications showing that crime in the U.S. drops after people are allowed to carry concealed handguns.Included among these 24, which are listed on his Web site, are the irrelevant papers mentioned above, as well as other studies that do not show links between concealed carry policies and low crime.One of them, for example, is a paper on the relationship between crime and subscriptions to Handguns magazine.Lotts inaccuracies certainly do not reflect the true weight of the evidence.My investigation involved far more than the impact of concealed-carry laws and ultimately concluded that more gunsperiodare associated with more crime and violence.Lott mistakenly states that I did not mention that one National Research Council committee member dissented from the committees conclusion that it is not possible to determine that there is a causal link between the passage of right-to-carry laws and crime rates.I did, in fact, state in my piece that the vote was not unanimous.And 14 of the 15 members did agree with the committee conclusion, a fact Lott ignores.Clearly an overwhelming consensus had been reached among the researchers.Finally, Lott criticizes me for omitting a detail about the Kellerman study that he considers importantbut it is not.The study found the odds of being murdered nearly tripled among those who kept guns at home.Lott says it is important that most of these homicides did not involve the residents gun.That is a straw man.The study was designed to assess the relationship between keeping a gun in the home and the risk of being murdered by any weapon.Murder victims are murder victims, regardless of weapon or means.

Science Says These Police Tactics Reduce Crime:::::When Bill de Blasio first ran for New York City mayor four years ago, ending stop-and-frisk police searches was a cornerstone of his campaign.Critics warned halting the practice would fuel crime.But this week de Blasio coasted into reelection against a backdrop of historically low crime rates.The city of more than 8.5 million people has seen fewer than 300 murders so far in 2017.That puts its body count lower than much-smaller jurisdictions including Baltimore, a city of fewer than 620,000 people where 303 people have been murdered this year, and Chicago, where the number has risen above 580 in a population of 2.7 million.So what factors can really help drive down crime?The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine said in a report released Thursday that certain proactive policies aimed at preventing crime before it happensincluding stop and friskshow mixed results.Yet it is not enough to simply identify what policies appear to reduce crime, a panel convened by the National Academies cautions in the report.Authorities must also consider the real-world risks of applying these approaches in ways that are racist, biased or illegal, they wrote.Historically, policing has focused largely on responding to calls and investigating crimes.But in the past few decades there has been a shift toward preventing crime by routinely sending officers into communities and identifying potential problem areas.Not all police departments are using these strategies, notes David Weisburd, chair of the expert panel and director of the center for evidence-based crime policy at George Mason University.But it is becoming relatively common and is a big departure from the standard model, in which police mostly respond to crimes that already occurred, Weisburd says.What Works For police chiefs who want to do something, increases in violent crime are often very localized and occur among specific people and on specific streetsand the evidence from the report is that when you focus on those, you can produce reductions in crime, Weisburd says.Hot-spotting, for examplea practice in which police are disproportionately stationed in areas with higher crime ratesseems to help, and does not just displace crime into immediately surrounding areas, the committee says.And stop and frisk can be effective when it is highly focused on areas with high concentrations of crime or robberies, Weisburd adds.His committee also found that third-party policingin which businesses or building owners partner with police or are pressured to work with themcan help.When police officers identify specific problems, try to understand them and make a tailored plan to solve them, it can reduce crime, too.Finally, focusing police resources on high-rate offenders (to either get them off the street or reduce crime) has good evidence behind it.What Doesnt Work The report also identified police strategies that do not seem to work.Broken windows policing, in which officers crack down on even small instances of disorder before they overwhelm a neighborhood, does not typically lead to less crime, the panel says.But it adds that if such efforts are much more nuancedfocused on a small number of high-crime streetsthey can sometimes make a positive difference.Another topic under the panels scrutiny is community policing, which generally refers to police building relationships with local residents and involving them in their decision-making about problems.Politicians and others have pushed the concept hard, but the panel says it does not have strong evidence that community policing reduces crime.If you can increase cooperation with the public, you would assume they report crime more often.But programs so far that encourage community policingthat use newsletters to involve the public, meet often with the public and spend a lot of time dealing with the public in a cooperative waythose projects, at least from the evidence we have now, dont seem to have crime prevention effects, Weisburd says.There is evidence these programs improve community attitudes toward police, however.So when police are thinking about what they are doing, they should think about it as a method to improve relationships with the public and perhaps combine different strategies together to reduce crime and improve community perceptions, Weisburd adds.I wouldnt take [the panels report] as torpedo below the waterline for the entire concept of community policing.I would say we need a longer study of what types of community engagement strategies work, says Ames Grawert, a counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, who was not involved with the report.Our hunch is that, over a very long time, strategies focused on getting officers engaged in the communities they serve will pay off in a number of ways.But I dont expect to see significant changes in just a year or two.The reports findings are somewhat at odds with some of the conclusions from The Presidents Task Force on 21st-Century Policing, whose recommendations in 2015 included a strong push for procedural justicewhich seeks to convince communities, through its interactions with them, that the police are neutral and exercise their authority in legitimate ways.Weisburd notes the task force promoted this approach, but his panel concluded there was not strong evidence to support it.We found there isnt enough evidence to say if it has an effect on crime, and whether or not to say it has a strong effect on perceptions of legitimacy, he says.We arent saying it doesnt have an effect, but we are saying that there isnt strong evidence.With longer-term data, the Brennan Centers Grawert says, there may be more positive results.The Jury Is Still Out Most studies on police policies have focused on short-term evaluations, so the committee could not point to what will work over longer periods, Weisburd explains.It is also hard to know how well interventions applied across an entire jurisdiction will work in particular neighborhoods or if strategies that work well in one area will definitely work well in another.There is also very little social science data on how often proactive police tactics lead to illegal behavior, power abuses and differences in outcomes by race.Right now, Weisburd says, we just dont have that evidence.
U.S. Cities and States Try to Keep Washington’s Climate Promises:::::A giant star-spangled pavilion sits outside the formal negotiating area for the U.N. climate meeting in Bonn, Germany, which began this Monday.American-accented English dominates the potpourri of languages there, and power-suited representatives from U.S. cities, states and businesses mingle with their foreign counterparts.Above it all hangs a giant banner with a hashtagged slogan: #We Are Still In.The We is Americans, and what they are still In is the 2015 Paris climate agreement.Not officiallyearlier this year, Pres.Donald Trump announced he would withdraw the U.S. from its Paris commitmentsbut in intent.The pavilion is the home base for an alliance of more than 2,500 leaders from Americas cities, states, businesses, universities, faith organizations, tribes and other groups.Stymied by the slow pace of the negotiationswhich they are not even allowed to participate inthese so-called subnationals have worked on the sidelines for years, using political will, economic leverage and the celebrity status of prominent politicians to advance their climate goals.Now Trump's presidency has galvanized subnational leaders, who want to uphold the U.S. Paris pledge to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.Their ambitious plan for this years meeting: Convince the rest of the world they can keep the promises their president abandoned.Subnationals, particularly cities, have long been among the more proactive leaders on climate change.For example, a 1,500 municipality-strong coalition called Local Governments for Sustainability has emissions-cutting agreements dating back nearly three decades.The subnational voices at the climate talks have been getting louder for a long time, says Reed Schuler, a senior policy advisor for the state of Washington who has been attending global climate meetings for a decade.But a lot of the biggest growth has happened over the past two years.Things really started taking off in May 2015 when California Gov.Jerry Brown and the minister of BadenWrttemberg in Germany developed a nonbinding memorandum to return their states emissions to pre-1990 levels by the year 2050.By the time the Paris meeting came around in late 2015, nearly 80 other subnational governments had signed on.Eventually that memorandum grew into the Under2 Coalition, which encompasses 188 jurisdictions all pledging their part to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius.California is the undeniable star of the subnationals.On Saturday Brown will sit on a panel about regional and local efforts to uphold U.S. Paris goals.Organizers expect the event will test the pavilion's 700-person capacity.California has celebrity here, but it comes from having the climate credentials that demonstrate theyve actually done the work, says British Columbias Assistant Deputy Minister of Environment Susanna Laaksonen-Craig.The state has long led the U.S. in environmental regulations, from high vehicle-emissions standards to a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programand it has done so without sacrificing its economy.Although Brown is the most visible among those U.S. politicians publicly resisting the president's anti-Paris agenda, his compatriots include mayors of cities like Washington, D.C., and Houston as well as governors of states that include New York and Washington.Agreements like the Under2 Coalition help expand the influence of these subnational groups.At last count, the coalition's signatories represent more than 1.2 billion people and nearly $30 trillion in annual gross domestic product.British Columbia, a coalition member, is a small province, with only 4.6 million people, Laaksonen-Craig says.We cant go to car manufacturers and tell them to upgrade their vehicles all by ourselves.But these partnerships open up new conversations.That includes conversations directly with the negotiators.A key element of COP23 is a Fijian dialogue process called talanoa, where nations will try to resolve shortcomings in the nationally determined contributions (NDCs)each country's pledge to reduce emissions.A U.N.Environment Program report released last week showed that, taken together, the NDCs only account for a third of the necessary emissions reductions needed to keep global average temperatures from heating 2 degrees C above preindustrial levels.Theres a growing recognition that inputs from nonsovereign actors will be valuable if the parties really want to shore up these nationally determined contributions, says Mariana Panuncio-Feldman, the World Wildlife Funds senior director of International Climate Cooperation.California, for one, has played an increasingly important role in international climate collaboration; earlier this year it struck an emissions-cutting deal with China.Business groups have their own niche at the climate talks.The We Mean Business coalition has 630 companies signed on to reduce their carbon footprints.It includes some of the largest companies in the world, such as Walmart, Cargill and Nestle.According to industry advocates, these companies will work hard at the meeting to convince the official American negotiating team how important the Paris agreement is to the U.S. business community.(The U.S. still has a seat at the table until its Paris pullout takes effect in 2020.).Its only the first week here, so I feel like things are just getting going, but in the coming days we will help business leaders meet with lawmakers to help bolster the U.S. position, and to make sure the official U.S. delegation is bold, says Anne Kelly, senior policy director at Ceres, a business and sustainability nonprofit.Taken together, the collective promises from American cities, states and others will likely fall short of the U.S. Paris goalthey can only accomplish so much.But optics are another matter.From the panels, speeches and joint agreements to the massive star-spangled pavilion, subnational leaders are loudly proclaiming their commitments.It is unclear whether all that noise will be enough to overshadow the official U.S. presence at the meeting, and the worlds dismay over Trumps decision.
Steven Pinker: This Is History's Most Peaceful Time--New Study: "Not So Fast":::::In his 2011 book The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, Harvard University psychologist and famed intellect Steven Pinker argues humans are now living in the most peaceful era in the history of our species.At the time the U.S. was mired in two wars in the Middle East and Central Asia, the conflict in Darfur had just come to a close and terrorist insurgent group Boko Haram was setting off bombs across northern Nigeria.Such examples still abound years later.Last week violent incidents in New York City and Sutherland Springs, Texas, left many dead and injured.The claim that we are living in an unusually peaceful time may strike you as somewhere between hallucinatory and obscene, Pinker wrote.I know from conversations and survey data that most people refuse to believe it.Yet there is plenty of evidence supporting Pinkers claim.Most scholars agree the percentage of people who die violent war-related deaths has plummeted through history; and that proportionally violent deaths decline as populations become increasingly large and organized, or move from nonstate statussuch as huntergatherer societiesto fully fledged states.Still, there are many ways to look at the dataand quantifying the definition of a violent society.A study in Current Anthropology published online October 13 acknowledges the percentage of a population suffering violent war-related deathsfatalities due to intentional conflict between differing communitiesdoes decrease as a population grows.At the same time, though, the absolute numbers increase more than would be expected from just population growth.In fact, it appears, the data suggest, the overall battle-death toll in modern organized societies is exponentially higher than in huntergatherer societies surveyed during the past 200 years.The studyled by anthropologists Dean Falk at The Florida State University and Charles Hildebolt at Washington University in Saint Louiscut across cultures and species and compared annual war deaths for 11 chimpanzee communities, 24 huntergatherer or other nonstate groups and 19 and 22 countries that fought in World Wars I and II, respectively.Overall, the authors analysis shows the larger the population of a group of chimps, the lower their rate of annual deaths due to conflict.This, according to the authors, was not the case in human populations.People, their data show, have evolved to be more violent than chimps.And, despite high rates of violent death in comparison with population size, nonstate groups are on average no more or less violent than those living in organized societies.Falk and Hildebolt point out Pinkers claims are based on data looking at violent death rates per 100,000 people.They contend such ratios dont take into account how overall population size alters war death talliesin other words how those ratios change as a population grows, which their findings do.There is a strong trend for larger societies to lose smaller percentages of their members to war, Falk says, but the actual number of war deaths increases with growing population sizes.This is not what one would predict if larger societies were less violent than smaller ones, she says.Falk adds that small communities are not necessarily more violent than larger populationsthey are simply more vulnerable to losing a significant portion of their population due to outsider attacks.If I walk down a dark alley at night, I am potentially more vulnerable to being killed than I am when I attend a football game, Falk says.She admits citing a population of one in an alley is an extreme example.But she adds that smaller populations suffering a higher percentage of casualties at the hands of another population are not necessarily more innately violent than large modern societies arethey might instead just be the victims.The outsize rise in total war-related deaths associated with larger groups of people may be due, in part, to the advances in weaponry and military strategy that come with increased communication and collaboration: A similar degree of violent behavior enacted by a similar number of people just does more damage on a nuclear scale than it ever could with axes and spears.For his part, Pinker disputes the new findings.The claim that the difference between [chimp] death rates can explain the difference in [absolute] death rates between the New Guinean Dugum and Nazi Germany or the difference between [the] U.S.S.R. and India in World War II falls into this category of mindless curve-fitting, he commented to Scientific American, referring to the studys data on absolute numbers of deaths and the fact cultural and geographical factors can greatly sway war-death totals in individual populations.Presumably the fact that Hitler invaded the Soviet Union whereas India was thousands of miles away from the major theaters of war has more to do with that difference than their population size!He also argues the authors exaggerate what they describe as exponential growth in deaths among large populations, given that their data shows the average war deaths during World Wars I and IIand surveyed across the last two centuries of data for nonstate groupsdid not rise all that significantly as populations grew, and differ wildly among populations.He goes so far as to say the authors misdescribe their own data, noting their numbers suggest total deaths during World War I actually decreased with increasing population size.Using that average to conclude that humans are more violent than chimps and that war deaths scale exponentially with population size is going way beyond what the data can support, says Pinker.Pinker points out many anthropologists are committed to some version of the noble savage theorythe idea that in the wild humans are innately good, only to be corrupted by society and civilization.Falk acknowledges this, in part, motivated her to undertake the study.As anthropologists we were primarily concerned about the negative portrayal of small-scale societies as more violent than civilized state dwellers.Yet Falk and Hildebolt do not believe any bias skewed their results.We had no expectations regarding absolute number of war deaths and population sizes, and we were indeed surprised by the [results], Falk says.In The Better Angels of Our Nature Pinker wrote our cognitive faculties predispose us to believe we live in violent timesand modern media does not help: As he puts it, If it bleeds, it leads.Our tendency is to broadcast negativity.We only leave Yelp reviews when our steak was overcooked.We leave comments online when we are outraged, not enlightened.And we typically approximate the probability of something happening based on when we last witnessed it.Pinker believes that even in times of very low violent deaths there will always be enough such incidents for the media to exploit; enough to warp our sense of the reality.It may be too early to say exactly how our new hyper-connected culture will influence rates of violent mortality.Does increased awareness and exposure to the worlds wrongs via a 24-hour global news cycle render us wearier of violence or more empathetic to the victimized?Or do horrific and continual mass killings in turn incite more copycat violence?Pinker cites a number of trends through history he feels support the idea that despite the seemingly continual carnage in the world, we have actually inched toward a more civil society.Our transition from huntergatherers to farmers is thought to have reduced violent death fivefold; between the Middle Ages and the 20th century, Europe saw a 10- to 50-fold drop in murder; and in the 70-plus years since World War II warring among the leading powers has for the most part stopped, a first in the history of civilization.None of this gives Falk much comfort when it comes to mass-scale war and mortality, given that modern weaponry can inflict sky-high total death counts.Astronomical death tolls can be tallied in a matter of days, even minutes, not decades.All it would take is for one homicidal leaderwho we know existsto unleash a weapon of mass destruction, she warns.The 70-odd years that have transpired since World War II is a proverbial drop in the bucket compared with the five [million] to seven million years humans and our ancestors have been around.The probability of World War III is not negligible.
Watch Live Today: Unveiling the Fabric of the Universe, One Fundamental Question at a Time:::::Particle physicists typically arent looking for a cure to an illness or a solution to an underlying societal problem.Propelled by curiosity, they are searching for answers about what makes up, well, everything.And they have a long way to goroughly 95 percent of the universe seems to consist of dark matter and dark energy, about which we know next to nothing.So what is the nature of that mysterious dark stuff?Why is there so much of it?And why is there so relatively little of what we are familiar withgalaxies, stars, planets?Why, in fact, is there something rather than nothing at all?In particle physics the preferred way to tackle these fundamental questions is to gather thousands of scientists from dozens of nations to build a big, expensive machine.The biggest and most expensive at present is CERNs Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a 27-kilometer-long subterranean tunnel lined with superconducting magnets that smashes particles together at nearly light-speed in search of even smaller and more elusive particles in the subatomic wreckage.The feat seems improbable, even sillylike searching for the meaning of an abstract painting or of a figure in the clouds.Yet, five years ago LHC physicists demonstrated the colliders potential by discovering the Higgs boson, the long-sought particle that imbues all other particles with mass.By virtue of its weighty task, the Higgs helps explain why we exist and why we look out on a sky filled with starswithout its handiwork, the universe would be bereft of such forms, existing instead as an amorphous soup of zooming particles.It was one of the greatest discoveries of all time in particle physics, leaving scientists beaming and the world in wonderment.Yet, such research is sometimes described as useless for not having an immediate practical application to everyday life.Does it deserve this harsh assessment?Pauline Gagnon, a retired particle physicist from Indiana University Bloomington and CERN argues that even beyond the understanding it gives us of our own universe, such fundamental research leads to many spin-off technological developments, from the World Wide Web (originated at CERN) to medical imaging.Join Gagnon tonight at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario for a glimpse into how fundamental research can, in fact, be vital for advancing technology and improving lives.The talk, Improbable Feats and Useless Discoveries is part of Perimeters public lecture series and will take place at 7 P.M. Eastern time.Online viewers can participate in the discussion by tweeting to @perimeter using the #piLIVE hashtag.
Massive Skin Replacement Saves Child’s Life:::::The German doctors realized they had to do something drastic or their seven-year-old patient would die.The boy had escaped war-ravaged Syria with his parents, and a rare genetic disease had left him with raw, blistering sores over 80 percent of his body.His doctors in a childrens burn unit tried everything they could to treat his illness, called junctional epidermolysis bullosaeven grafting some skin from his father to see if it would heal the childs wounds.But his body rejected this.Finally, they e-mailed Michele De Luca, a researcher in Italy, to ask for help.Twelve years earlier De Luca, director of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilias Center for Regenerative Medicine had successfully used gene therapy to restore skin on the legs of someone with a similar disease.No one had ever attempted using gene therapy to replace as much skin as the boy needed, however, and De Lucas work had been sidelined by bureaucratic hurdles.But after nearly a decade of filing paperwork and improving his skin cell production system, De Luca was ready to try.The doctors took a small sample of skin from one of the few places on the boys body where it was not flaming red or flaking off, and sent it to De Luca.His team at the center used a virus to insert into the skin cells a correct copy of a gene called LAMB3; the boys own defective copy had caused his epidermolysis bullosa.De Luca and his colleagues grew the skin cells over scaffolds in their lab to form large sheets, the way doctors often do for burn patients.In two surgeries in October and November 2015, the Italian and German teams covered the boys limbs, sides and back with these sheets of fresh skin.After being too sick even to get out of bed before his surgeries, he was standing up already by Christmas, De Luca says.In January 2016 the boy, whose name is not being released to protect his privacy, received a few more skin patchesand in February he was released from the University Hospitals of the Ruhr University Bochum in Germany.A year later, the boy proudly showed off his skin to students and researchers in De Lucas lab.It was a quite moving moment, says De Luca, who published a report on the treatment Wednesday in Nature.After this 10 years of struggling to accomplish all these rules and paperwork and bureaucracy, the moment you see a patient like this, you understand it was worth it to do it.The boys epidermisthe top layer of skintotally regenerated itself after the new cells were added, proving for the first time that the entire epidermis is sustained only by a relatively few stem cells in the skin, De Luca says.Once you have regenerated the epidermis with stem cells, the stem cells behave like theyre supposed to: They adjust their number and they keep making the renewal of epidermis as a normal physiological situation, he said Tuesday in a news conference.Other researchers in the field say they are impressed with the teams results.Its a fantastic piece of work, says Cdric Blanpain, a professor and stem cell biologist at the Free University of Brussels, who wrote an opinion article accompanying the study.This is a beautiful example of how you can move stem cells into the clinic in a very safe and powerful manner, he says, also calling the work a powerful demonstration that only a few stem cells are indeed maintaining the skin epidermis rather than many different progenitors.Some unusual pigmentation remains on the boys skin because of the earlier damage.But other than that, he is now a normal nine-year-old who is fond of soccer and running, De Luca says.When we engrafted him he was 17 kilograms [37 pounds], he adds.Now, hes a robust kid.His skin no longer blisters or itches, and unlike many burn patients who must apply ointment once or twice a day for the rest of their lives, his repaired skin needs no ongoing treatment.It also heals normally from cuts and bruises and now produces essentially normal levels of the protein laminin 332, which the child had lacked from birth due to his condition.The protein is crucial for, among other things, sticking the epidermis to the underlying dermis.The boy has no scarring, because his disease was literally only skin-deep.It did not affect the deeper dermis, where cuts trigger scars.In patients with epidermolysis bullosa every skin cell has a genetic disorder that limits its ability to grow healthy skin.This is why De Luca had to correct the gene before growing new skin for the boy.The illness can be caused by one of several mutations.The defect on the boys LAMB3 gene gave him a devastating illnessbut also may have made it easier to recover after the gene therapy, says Peter Marinkovich, an associate professor of dermatology and epidermolysis bullosa expert at Stanford University, who was not involved in the boys treatment.In his own research Marinkovich has used gene therapy to treat four patients with a different genetic form of epidermolysis bullosa.Those patients showed significant improvement but their skin did not engraft as smoothly as the boys, he says.De Luca is collaborating with doctors at the EB House Austria and the University Hospital of the Paracelsus Medical University in Salzburg to conduct several early-stage clinical trials, testing his gene therapy approach on 20 more patients with two types of epidermolysis bullosa.The complicated treatment will not be cheap.Thats the price we have to pay for advanced therapy for a genetic disease, De Luca says.Caring for children with epidermolysis bullosa is not cheap either, Marinkovich notes, adding that it can cost $100,000 a year to dress their woundswhich is sometimes not covered by insurance.In the future De Luca hopes to use the therapy on children younger than the boy, even on babies.Children with the most serious form of epidermolysis bullosa often die before they reach school age.Prevention, De Luca says, is better than restoration.The sooner we do it, he explains, the better it is for the kids.In a younger child who is less critically ill, still-healthy epidermis can be removed much more slowly and replaced in pieces over the course of a year or two, he says.Because the treatment is still functioning well in the patient De Luca worked with 12 years earlier, he is fairly confident the boys skin will remain healthy in the long term.But no one really knows, because the approach is so new.De Luca says he will follow the boys progress indefinitely to make sure he continues to thrive.Gene therapy, however, carries the risk of cancer, he notes.But he hopes that because this particular treatment involves the skin, any tumors will be easy to spot and can be quickly removed.The gene therapy approach might also be helpful for other skin diseases someday.De Luca says he has enough work to do fighting epidermolysis bullosa.It will, he says, take more time beyond my working life span.
Here’s How Drones Do (and Don’t) Threaten Passenger Aircraft:::::One warm evening this fall a pair of U.S. Army UH-60M Blackhawk helicopters cruised low over New York Citys Staten Island, providing security for the United Nations General Assemblys annual meeting in nearby Manhattan.Just after sunset a shoe boxsize airborne object collided with one of the choppers, damaging its main rotor blade, window frame and transmission system.Inspection at a nearby airfield revealed evidence of something that had never happened beforea civilian drone had plowed into a crewed craft in U.S. airspace.That sent the Army, the National Transportation Safety Board and other government agencies scrambling to investigate how and why this had happened.Those questions, although important, are less interesting to aviation researchers than determining just how much damage increasingly common droneslike the 1.4-kilogram quadcopter in the Staten Island incidentcan potentially inflict on helicopters and small, low-flying aircraft.Data on the risk that lightweight drones pose to aviation safety is scarce, even as consumer and commercial drone sales take off.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) projects that almost seven million drones could be sold in the U.S. by 2020.Pilots already take the potential for drone collisions very seriously, sometimes putting potentially lifesaving missions on hold for fear of such a strike.In August firefighters battling a large blaze on Montanas Rice Ridge temporarily shut down helicopter operations when an unauthorized drone was spotted in the sky nearby.The following month government agencies issued terse warnings for civilians to keep their drones far away from low-flying aircraft being used to locate and evacuate Hurricane Harvey victims in Houston.It remains unclear, however, whether the risk of a drone collision is big enough to outweigh the need for those aircraft to carry out their missions.Low-flying helicopterssuch as those conducting search-and-rescue operationslikely face the most serious risk of collision because they often occupy the same airspace as multirotor consumer and commercial drones, says Ian Horsfall, professor of armor systems at Cranfield University and the Defense Academy of the United Kingdom.Not only is there a threat of poorly controlled drones being in the wrong place, but also the nature of helicopter flight is such that [even] a properly licensed and piloted drone might be hit by a helicopter that strays into its airspace, or vice versa, Horsfall says.The Army Blackhawk over Staten Island had been flying at an altitude of about 150 meters when it was hit.Hobbyist drones are barred from most parts of New York City but are permitted in some locationsincluding Staten Islands LaTourette Parkas long as they stay below about 120 meters.Fixed-wing aircraft may not spend as much time in quadcopter-accessible airspace as helicopters, but they could sustain severe damage from a collision.Barely a month after the Staten Island incident, a drone smashed into a twin-engine propeller plane near Quebec City.The Beechcraft King Air A100 aircraft was approaching a runway at Jean Lesage International Airport when its left wing collided with the drone at just above 450 meters.A ground inspection later revealed only minor harm: scratches on the wings top surface and scrape marks on a de-icing system.But Marc Garneau, Canadas Minister of Transport, said during a press conference following the incident that the collision could have had catastrophic results if the drone had crashed through the cockpit window or damaged an engine.Indeed, some of the most dangerous scenarios for low-flying aircraft involve drones smashing windshields or knocking out main engines.The hazards vary depending on the type of drone and piloted aircraft involved, according to Javid Bayandor, founder and director of the Crashworthiness for Aerospace Structures and Hybrids (CRASH) Lab at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York.Previously based at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Bayandor and his colleagues have spent years putting together data on more than 150 drone models, and using computer simulations to study the potential threat to aircraft.We're not only categorizing the drones and figuring out what their damage footprint would be on different locations on a number of aircraft types and engines, Bayandor says.Were also looking into possible damage-mitigation methods."A 2016 study by the U.K.s Department for Transport and Military Aviation Authority concluded drone collisions could be far worse than the impact of soft-bodied birds.Tests conducted for the U.K. study involved shooting custom-built drones of different sizes at helicopter and large aircraft windshields, and found that a 1.5-kilogram drone could sometimes break through.Consumer drones pose far less of a threat to high-flying commercial aircraft; a jet airliner is in drone airspace only during takeoff and landing, and is very fast-moving target for a quadcopter.The greatest risk would probably be a drone getting sucked into one of its turbines.Bayandors CRASH Lab once created a video showing a simulation of how a drone might get shredded into fragments inside a jet engine.Those fragments can get shot around the engine, sometimes at very high velocities, and can continue to propagate the damage, he says.The overall chance of drone collisions with any type of aircraft actually remains relatively low, according to researchers.Without much data available about drone collisions or even near-misses, a March 2016 report by George Mason Universitys Mercatus Center studied bird strikes as a proxy for quadcopters (pdf).The researchers found that although there are an estimated 10 billion birds in U.S. airspace, there are just hundreds of bird strikes per year.Compared to the enormous population of birds, damaging bird strikes are rare, according to the report, which concluded the risk to the airspace caused by drones weighing up to two kilograms is minimal.There werent any drone collisions until now, and when you consider how many flights there are, I think it confirms my suspicion that there is not this insane risk of planes going down regularly as sometimes the media had us fear would happen, says Mykel Kochenderfer, an aeronautics engineer and director of the Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory at Stanford University.Still, he described the recent U.S. and Canada incidents as a wake-up call to drone operators about their potential impact on aviation safety.
WHO Moves to Contain Superbugs on the Farm:::::The food industry must stop dosing healthy livestock with antibiotics, the World Health Organization said Tuesday.For decades animals food and drinking water have often been spiked with medications aimed at boosting growth and preventing disease.But that practice can provide the necessary spark for antibiotic resistance that endangers human health, the agency warned.In a series of new recommendations aimed at preserving the efficacy of important drugs for people, the global health body called for national governments and food companies to follow rules that have existed in the European Union since 2006such as not using drugs to promote livestock growth.The guidelines also urge farmers to wait until animals are medically diagnosed with a problem before administering antibiotics and, whenever possible, to select medications that are not important for human health.These [guidelines] are a great starting place, and taking these actions would make a huge difference, says microbiologist Lance Price, director of the Antibiotic Resistance Action Center at The George Washington University.Some countries take these kind of thingsWHO recommendationsmore seriously than others, but I do think it is important to have these guidelines codified by a very respected international group dedicated to protecting human health.Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, agrees.I think WHO recommendations are very important, he says.Without them, countries can be confused and say they dont have evidence to take action.But these recommendations are not law.WHO recommendations are not mandatory, says Kazuaki Miyagishima, director of WHOs Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses.These are aspirational in the sense that there is no reward and no punishment to countries that do or do not implement them, he adds.It is not mandatory and it is not legally binding.Still, Miyagishima notes the CODEX Alimentariuss task force on antimicrobial resistancean intergovernmental group that reviews these recommendations and other datawill consider them in a meeting later this month.The body could eventually decide to codify them into international standards that could be used to regulate global trade.There is a long backstory to this issue.In the U.S. there has been a push to curb routine antibiotic use on farms since 1977.But many food producers have insisted that staying competitiveand maintaining healthy flocks and herdsrequires regular use of antibiotics (especially as animals have increasingly been housed in close quarters on factory farms).This practice has had a big hoofprint: The Food and Drug Administrations most recent data, for 2015, says some 34.3 million pounds (pdf) of antibiotics were sold for use on animals in the U.S. that year (and that roughly 21.4 million pounds of that load were drugs considered medically important for humans).But numbers like that are expected to drop in the years ahead.Earlier this year that landscape tilted when new FDA regulations took effect, making it illegal to drug farm animals purely for growth promotion.The rules do not ban all antibiotic use for purposes such as disease prevention, so critics say this regulation is a big step in the right direction, but they worry loopholes will still enable unnecessary antibiotic use.Yet even as the U.S. has moved toward reducing antibiotic use in agriculture, China and other countries have started using moreand evidence has accumulated indicating those decisions are driving antibiotic resistance and putting humans at risk.Take colistinits a last-resort antibiotic for humans, used sparingly due to serious side effects.After Chinese pig farmers wanted to boost livestock growth and started routinely dosing our porcine pals with this old, cheap medication, however, drug resistance started showing up in the pigs on an alarming scaleeven outside the country.In some places almost 100 percent of hogs carry the resistance gene, called mcr-1.And whats particularly concerning is this resistance gene is on a DNA ring called a plasmid that can be easily transferred from one bacteria species to another, multiplying the problem.Moreover, that drug use and subsequent resistance in animals appears to have already led to human health concerns: Last year, for example, this resistance gene was detected in an American patient.There are some indications that more conclusive science and recommendations like the WHOs could lead to more judicious antibiotic use.In response to the spread of mcr-1 China has banned use of the drug in animal feed.That does give hope that countries like China do recognize the need for action, and thats a really positive sign, Laxminarayan says.(Although he notes Chinas current ban may not be enforced everywhere in the vast country.)Slashing the use of drugs like colistin can still make a difference, Price adds.You need both that successful resistance gene and a successful bugone good at colonizing and infecting peopleto really get this to mushroom, and we havent seen that yet, so reducing its use would help protect people and get a real payoff, he says.Evidence has also started to pile up that curbing drug use on the farm would specifically combat resistance.On Monday a WHO-funded systematic review was published in The Lancet Planetary Health.The work, which helped inform the new WHO recommendations, concluded that implementing restrictions on antibiotic use could reduce antibiotic-resistant bacteria in farm animals by up to 39 percentalthough in most of the reviewed studies, cutting antibiotic use led to reductions in resistance between 10 and 15 percent.The analysis is based on a diverse mix of about 180 papers that look at various drugs and outcomes in animals or humans.This makes it hard to apply those numbers across the board, Price notes.But overall, he says, I think that what they show is that there is clearly a reduction in resistance with these interventions.Although scientists agree that dosing animals is a problem, it still remains difficult to pin down what percentage of the antibiotic-resistance problem comes from animal use.I think it is impossible to truly quantify the relative contribution of antibiotics in animals versus people, because they work synergistically, Price says.Cutting antibiotic use in animals in an environment where people take a lot of these same drugs will have a different effect than if its in an environment where few people take those drugs.For now, the WHO says, it hopes these recommendations will fuel speedy action.It says countries should swap out unnecessary antibiotic use in favor of better housing and vaccination practices

“Slightly Crazy” 19th-Century Weathermen Who Braved Formidable Conditions Could Aid Climate Predictions:::::On the evening of February 21, 1885, two Scottish meteorologists living atop Ben Nevisthe highest peak in the U.K. at some 4,400 feetattempted to make their appointed hourly measurements.But the tempestuous elements had other ideas: The roaring winds ripped their notebook in two and blew it away.The lanterns wouldnt stay lit long enough for the men to read the thermometers.And when the intrepid observers tried three times to venture out into the raging storm, they had to be hauled back in by rope.After that the observer did not go out," the log book entry for the evening dryly notes.In the two decades from 1883 to 1904 a group of hardy, dedicated men braved these howling winds, bone-chilling temperatures and almost ever-present fog to faithfully gather meteorological observations nearly every hour of every day from their observatory perched above the Scottish Highlands.They were explorers of the atmosphere, akin to their Victorian contemporaries who launched expeditions to the South Pole, says Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading.They were also, he says, slightly crazy.Once a source of Scottish scientific pride, their work had largely been forgotten, their data filed away in little-used bound volumes in the Edinburgh Meteorological Office archives.Now Hawkins and his colleagues have launched an effort to rescue the nearly two million data points the weathermen worked so hard to gather, asking volunteers to type them into a database column by column.The data will help scientists like Hawkins improve model predictions of how the climate will change as global temperatures rise by filling in gaps in the historical record and providing more context for todays weather extremes.If were going to put things in context, we need to have a much longer context to put things in, Hawkins says.He had been casting around for a data-rescue project when he heard the story of the Ben Nevis observatory from Marjory Roy, a retired U.K. Met Office employee and Edinburgh native who came across the trove of records in the 1980s and later wrote a book about the efforts, The Weathermen of Ben Nevis.During storms, the winds at the summit were (and still are) ferocious, reaching up to 120 miles per hour, equivalent to a category 3 hurricane.In winter the observers didnt use the anemometer, an instrument for measuring wind speed, for fear it would be damaged by the supercooled water droplets that froze to everything, leaving the observatory caked in windblown ice.Instead, they measured winds by how far they could lean into them, even calibrating against one another and the anemometer.Those winds also frequently buried the observatory in snow drifts, forcing the meteorologists to repeatedly tunnel out or use a second door built into the observatorys tower.Although the Ben Nevis data are from a single spot, it is rare even today to have dataespecially hourly datafrom a mountain peak and from such a northerly location, where the climate is warming at one of the fastest rates on Earth.There arent many hourly observations from any time in history, especially back that far, says Hawkins, who has climbed the Ben, where the ruins of the observatory still sit.When data like these are included in climate models, it can refine representations of hard-to-capture features such as storms.It takes the picture from a fuzzy, impressionist painting to perhaps a Polaroidnot as clearly resolved as todays satellite images, but a definite improvement.The magnificent view from the peak also allowed the meteorologists to observe phenomena such as the aurora, Roy says.Hawkins says those observations will help fill in gaps in that record as well.Of course, digitizing such data is a tedious process.Hawkins estimates it would take one person two years to work through the Ben Nevis archive.Hence, the need for a slew of volunteers who can collectively type in temperature, pressure and rainfall data from the scanned-in pages on an easy-to-use interface far faster.(The volunteer effort is fitting, as the observatory itself was crowdfunded; even Queen Victoria pitched in 50.)In the nearly two months since the new project launched, more than 9,000 people have each entered at least one column of data.Eleven dedicated people have each done more than 1,000 columns.I liked the thought of helping to preserve this data and making it available for use to current scientists.A small effort from me to help an important project, says Sheree Lester, a retired IT worker living in the south of England.Given the volunteer response so far, Hawkins expects theyll complete the project by early 2018.Then he hopes to tackle more of the millions of pages of old, non-digitized data languishing in archives all over the world.We do have all this data from the past that is sitting on paper, he says, that we know would be very valuable if it was all rescued.
Flu Vaccine “Factories” Create Errors That Reduce Protection:::::Flu vaccines saved an estimated 40,000 American lives between 2005 and 2014, but they are not good enough.The vaccine used during the 201617 flu season, for example, was only 43 percent effective against the predominant influenza A H3N2 strain, and protection has been almost as low in other years.Two studies now suggest a new reason for the problem: The vaccine strain mutates during the manufacturing process in ways that cause mismatches with real circulating flu strains.Researchers already knew the flu shot had a flaw.Because the virus evolves very quickly, an inoculation devised months before flu season often differs from what ends up infecting the public.Now it appears other important mismatches are triggered because vaccines are grown inside chicken eggs.Weve got to get out of chicken eggs, says Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved in the research.He concedes, though, thats not easy to do, and thats expensivevery expensive.Last years flu vaccine should have worked well.The strain that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration chose for the seasonal vaccine did indeed closely match the viruses that sickened people.So when its effectiveness proved disappointing, Scott Hensley, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, and his colleagues began to investigate.Flu vaccines are killed or highly weakened viruses that, when injected into the body, alert the immune system to fight the real thing.For 70 years most flu vaccine strains have been grown in fertilized chicken eggs because egg growth incites excellent yield.But it has long been known that the viruses also evolve in these egg hosts.They adopt genetic changes that help them grow in the egg environment.What Hensley and his colleagues found was such changes can cause problems for the end product.In a paper published online today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Hensleys team zeroed in on a new molecule that the H3N2 virus started wearing on one of its surface proteins in 2014.This molecule, a type of sugar, has become chemically glued to a location on the viruss surface near where human antibodiesimmune system watchdogsattach to mark the virus as a dangerous invader.The sugar made it hard for antibodies to stick, so it helped the virus avoid immune destruction.When flu researchers learned about this new sugar-adorned H3N2 virus in 2014, they made sure to include that strain in the 201617 seasonal flu vaccine so that immunized individuals would mount an immune response against it.But when Hensley and his colleagues studied the strain that ended up in the U.S. vaccine, they saw that, mysteriously, the sugar molecule had disappeared.The loss was bad for the vaccine: In a series of experiments Hensley and his colleagues showed antibodies from humans and ferrets (a good animal model for influenza A studies) that had been exposed to the egg-grown vaccine did not effectively kill the circulating sugar-adorned viruses.Antibodies incited by a similar vaccine that was not grown in eggs, on the other hand, worked quite well.(Two U.S. influenza vaccines do not use egg-adapted strains.One, FLUCELVAX, is grown in canine kidney cells, and the second, Flublok, is grown in insect cells.)The new sugar molecule hinders the viruss ability to grow in eggsso once the vaccine strains are put into eggs, they ditch it.The viruses, originally isolated in humans, are simply adapting to the new cells in their environment, says Sarah Cobey, an ecologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago and one of the papers co-authors.But by eliminating the sugar molecule, the new mutation also affects a key region in the virus that is targeted by the immune system, Hensley adds, making the vaccine less effective.Egg-based production changes the flu virus in other important ways, too.In a separate study published on October 23 in PLOS Pathogens, a team of researchersincluding Hensleyshowed vaccine virus strains grown in chicken eggs also acquire a mutation that alters the structure of the same region important for human antibody binding.Basically, in acquiring that mutation, the vaccine looks like a triangle, but the viruses that are circulating look like a circle, Hensley says.So if you mount responses against the triangle, theyre not going to bind very well to the circle.Hensley and his team reported this egg-induced mutation, which was present in the 201617 U.S. seasonal flu vaccine, decreases the ability of certain antibodies to attach to and destroy the flu virusby a whopping three orders of magnitude.These egg-based changes bode ill for the real world.A 2014 study used epidemiological data to show egg-based mutations are associated with low vaccine effectiveness in human populations.The vaccine used during the 201213 flu season in Canada did not work very well, despite the fact that the circulating flu viruses had not seemingly changed much after the vaccine strains had been chosen.Upon investigating further, Danuta Skowronski, the lead epidemiologist for flu and emerging pathogens at the British Columbia Centers for Disease Control, and her colleagues reported in PLOS One that the egg-production process had induced three mutations at immunologically important sites in the vaccine virus strain and that these mutations were linked with low vaccine protection.Recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest this seasons vaccine may suffer from similar problems.Since May 21, 2017, the agency has analyzed H3N2 viruses that have circulated in the U.S. and internationally.Only 33 percent of these viruses were neutralized by antibodies from ferrets vaccinated with egg-grown strains, whereas 97 percent of viruses were inhibited by antibodies from ferrets inoculated with a nonegg-grown vaccine.A recent study from Australia, which is just finishing its flu season and used the vaccine strains that the U.S. is now using, suggests the H3N2 component of this seasons vaccine is only 10 percent effective.This futility is not surprising since this egg-grown vaccine still contains the two mutations described in the new papers.But although abandoning egg-based vaccines is the obvious fix, that move is not going to be easy, Hensley says.Theres a great amount of infrastructure that exists in producing these vaccines in eggs because thats how its always been done, he points out.It may take years, if not decades, to shift the majority of flu vaccine production out of chicken eggs and into other bio-factories like cells.In the meantime the CDC is working to improve the process.It is using next-generation genetic sequencing to study egg-induced mutations in the hopes of identifying some that improve rather than reduce vaccine effectiveness.Then the agency will select for these viral strains and use them for future vaccines.Hensley emphasizes that even though the current vaccine does have limitations, people should still get annual flu shots.The vaccine lowers infection risk--it works very well against influenza B--and may also minimize the risk of severe infection.And vaccinated individuals also protect vulnerable people such as those with immune conditions and severe allergies who cannot get vaccinated.The goal of these new studies is not to pooh-pooh the flu vaccine; they are just trying to make things better, Hensley says.Scientists have to acknowledge theres room for improvement in order to make progress.Editor's note: The first paragraph has been clarified on Nov. 6, 2017 to compare low protection rates to a 43 percent figure.
Q&A: Plotting U.S. Space Policy with White House Adviser Scott Pace:::::During his campaign, candidate Donald Trump said little about space science and exploration other than that he thought it was terrific, hastening to add, We have to fix our potholes, too.As president he has been slightly more outspoken, telling Congress in February, American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream, and pushing for NASA to accelerate its plans for sending astronauts beyond low Earth orbit.Speaking from his desk in the Oval Office, he has mused about sending humans to Mars during his second term and has promised were going to lead again in space, which he calls the next great American frontier.None of this is very surprisingall presidents in recent memory have scarcely discussed space at all on the campaign trail, and once elected offer similar blandishments about the nations once and future leadership in space.But in at least one respect Trumps space plans are different from those of his most recent predecessors.In June he revived the National Space Council, a White House advisory body that originated in the Eisenhower administration and was last active between 1989 and 1992, during the presidency of George H. W. Bush.Helmed by Vice Pres.Mike Pence and packed with high-powered cabinet members including the secretaries of State, Defense, Commerce, Transportation and Homeland Security, the Space Council is meant to coordinate and oversee policymaking for the nations military, civil and commercial space efforts.At its first meeting, held in public on October 5 in a massive airplane hangar, Pence declared the nation would soon send humans back to the moon, breaking from an Obama-era policy that favored human missions to asteroids.Whether, when and how such journeys ever happen, however, may depend to some degree on the day-to-day leadership of the Council by Pences second-in-command, Executive Secretary Scott Pace.Tapped for the position in July, Pace is the former director of the Space Policy Institute at The George Washington University.He has previously worked for NASA, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.Scientific American spoke with Pace about his goals for the National Space Council, the balance between scientific research and human space exploration, and the administrations nascent plans to send astronauts back the moon.[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]What is the core purpose of the National Space Council, and why is it coming back now?Its purpose is the same as most any White House coordinating body that works issues which cut across multiple departments and agencies: to press the presidents agenda down and oversee that its being done, and then to adjudicate issues that come up, where there naturally will be conflicts or differences of viewpoint between different agencies.Also, space has become much more globalized.There are many more players in it.Some people call it the democratization of space.But there are certainly many more spacefaring countries around then ever before.There are many more private sector actors that are more capable than ever before.And so its a much more complex world than when we were responding to a space race, or dealing with the immediate aftermath of the cold war.Because of this globalization of space, because a lot of these space issues cut across multiple agencies and departments, coordination at the level of the White House has natural value.In terms of enacting the White Houses agenda, the two most important facts here are that the president cares and that the vice president cares.That makes all the difference in the world.I work for the vice president in particular, and Ive been very gratified with how interested, engaged and energetic he is on this challenging subject.Hes pushing always to do more.And the other offices have been very welcoming.There is an interest group spread across the executive office of the presidentpoints of contact who have space in their portfoliosand we have good relationships with all of them.What were trying to do with the Space Council is have a unity of effort that recognizes these different aspects of national powernational security, commercial, diplomatic, scientificand how they affect each other, to the extent that we have, say, more international cooperation on exploration.That actually opens up opportunitiesfor achieving our diplomatic objectives, for leveraging the commercial sector morewhich can get us more efficiencies, so that we can do more science and exploration at less cost than what might have otherwise been historically the case.These things all feed on each other and relate to each other.Everybody has separate responsibilities, but that perception of a need for a unity of effort is in part what I think the president and the vice president are intending.You brought up diplomacy, international collaboration and working with the commercial sector, and that all seems to come together in Vice Pres.Pences recent announcement that NASA will be returning humans to the surface of the moon, shifting away from the Obama-era policy that favored crewed missions to asteroids and to Mars.What motivated that decision?This is an update to the existing national space policy directive issued by Pres.Obama in 2010.And as such [sending humans to] Mars is still therethat is still the horizon goal, and hasnt been eliminated.The reason we chose a return to the moon is because this reflects the presidents and vice presidents sense of whats in the national interest.I became very much a critic of the Mars and asteroidoriented policy, but not because I think Mars and asteroids arent great missionsthey are.They are inspiring, and they offer some great science.But they were so ambitious that they really didnt provide opportunities for international or commercial partnerships, and therefore I would argue they were actually contrary to U.S. national interests.And the reason we do space is not simply to do it, but to advance U.S. national interests.The nature of leadership in space is very different than it was in the 1960s and 1970s, when we last went beyond low Earth orbit with the Apollo missions.Back then it was about showing leadership by doing things no other country could do.Thats still a factor today.But now the measure of leadership is how many people want to work with you, how many people want to be part of your team, right?If we want to be a global leader in space exploration today, we need to have projects that are both challenging and realisticbut which also allow for meaningful international partnership and private sector participation: building components, delivering cargo, providing services of various kinds.An architecture that returns to the moon, then on to Mars, offers those opportunities because it is more in alignment with where industry is and where our international partners are.This reflects where the space community has been going and has wanted to go for some time.There are lots of countries that havent been to the moon.We havent been to the [surface of the] moon since the last Apollo mission in 1972.And were already seeing private sector proposals for doing things there.NASA has to be rethinking thingsand they have beenbut now theyre cleared to do that in a more concrete manner.The vice president wants NASA to come back with specific plans.These ideas have been bubbling around for quite some time, and now theyre coming out more clearly in the open.Were hopefully going to see them become more concrete in the year ahead as people take stock of this change in direction.Speaking of going back to the moon, rethinking things and engaging more with the private sector, NASA is spending billions of dollars developing its own heavy-lift rocket, the Space Launch System, as the centerpiece for future exploration activities beyond low Earth orbit.But private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are pursuing more reusable heavy-lift vehicles of their own that may be less expensive to build and operate.Is there room for public-private partnership there, and what might that look like?Heavy-lift rockets are strategic national assets, like aircraft carriers.There are some people who have talked about buying heavy-lift as a service as opposed to owning and operating, in which case the government would, of course, have to continue to own the intellectual properties so it wasnt hostage to any one contractor.One could imagine this but, in general, building a heavy-lift rocket is no more commercial than building an aircraft carrier with private contractors would be.In the past, funding for NASAs science missions has suffered when the agency is directed to shifting budgetary resources toward tasks like building new rockets and spacecraft for astronauts.What is your strategy for preserving balance between the agencys human exploration program and its diverse science missions?Well, lets also mention that imbalances can occur within NASAs science community.You can see situations where one particular sectorwhether it be Earth science or planetary science, depending on the year youre looking atstarted doing more at the expense of others, like heliophysics or aeronautics.And particular projects like the James Webb Space Telescope have had a big impact on the astrophysics budget line.And so what we consider first of all is, are we following the scientific priorities laid out [by each sector]?Now were obviously never able to do all those prioritiestheres never enough money to do everythingbut first of all, are you looking at those and trying to comply with them?Then the second thing you look for in balancing among the different sectors is the health of the underlying community.That is, its not just a matter of how much money youre spending, but also whether new researchers are able to come in and get funding to make important contributions.In that regard neither NASAs budget nor human space exploration is really the primary threat or problem.The larger problem is the pressure on all nondefense discretionary spending, and the resulting need for larger entitlement reform and for tax reform.Because its not a matter of some zero-sum game between scientific sectors or between exploration, engineering and technology development.The larger problem is that our ability to invest in innovation, to invest in the future, is under tremendous pressure on account of all our nondefense discretionary spending.This is a problem both the Congress and the executive branch have been struggling with.One of the ways to cope with thisnot to solve itis to look for synergies between exploration and science.So for example, lets look at the Deep Space Gateway, a space station near the moon, which NASA has proposed.What kinds of astrophysics or lunar science might be done using that?If were looking at doing a Mars atmospheric entry probe, NASAs aeronautics people could have instruments onboard that would give them beneficial information for their hypersonics research.So breaking down some of the traditional divisions between these entities is helpful; making sure were tracking each communitys priorities is really important; and thinking about their underlying health is critical because you dont want to go down a path that you know makes an entire field unviable.But the far larger issue, I would argue, is not one of space policy issue but rather of tax policy and entitlement reform.Looking forward four years or eight years from now, what do you hope will be the National Space Councils greatest accomplishment during your tenure as executive secretary?I hope that the habit of thinking about space as a vital aspect of national power and of national interest becomes more routine across all sectors of policymaking.This requires getting people out of their swim lanes, so they can think about space in a more integrative way as opposed to strictly seeing it as a national security issue or as a science issue.In terms of more tangible outcomes, Id like to see a stronger and more vibrant commercial space community that has been able to take advantage of regulatory reform and relief.Id like to see the U.S. capitalizing on a lot of those newly opened opportunities and leading the world in commercial space industry growth.And on exploration and science, Id like to make sure the U.S. is still a global leader in science exploration, and that our astronauts are operating beyond low Earth orbit for the first time since 1972but that were doing it with a bigger community of commercial and international partners.If we can get past policymaking divisions, if we can get smarter with regulation on our industries and make our going out into deep space more of a team effort, then I think it will be time well spent.
MDMA’s Journey from Molly to Medicine:::::James Casey recalls having a fondness for fireworks while growing up on the outskirts of small towns in rural Louisiana and North Carolina.That was before his 2011 deployment as a U.S. Army medic to Kandahar, Afghanistan, where he was steadily exposed to the trauma of modern warfare.After he returned to the U.S. a year later at age 19, the sound of fireworks and similar blasts of noise produced ghastly images of the lifeless Kandahar patients who proved beyond his medical aid, mangled bodies that at times covered his entire field of view.Like nearly 30 percent of Afghanistan and Iraq War veterans, Casey was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder, which he sought to quell with everything from medication to group therapy to hypnosis.Nothing worked.After 18 months Casey was ready to accept his PTSD as a life sentence, he says.Then he read about upcoming trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD patients in Boulder, Colorado, where he was headed to study molecular biology.It gave me my life back, he says, recalling the phase II trial organized in 2015 by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS, in which Casey underwent three MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions over five weeks.I did a year and a half of therapy before MDMA, he says.But with MDMA it was like a year and a half of the previous therapy in one day.The speed and effectiveness of the psychedelic experience Casey describes has caught the attention of the Food and Drug Administration, despite the Drug Enforcement Administrations 1985 classification of MDMA as a Schedule I substancethe murderers row of illicit drugs that include heroin and are deemed to have no medical value.This past August the FDA granted MDMA breakthrough therapy status in the treatment of PTSD, meaning it may provide a substantial improvement over existing therapies.The agency will work closely with MAPSa privately funded research institute founded in Florida 31 years ago and based in Santa Cruz, Californiato design and conduct phase III trials starting next spring.This marks the first time psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy will be monitored in phase III trials for possible prescription use.The German pharmaceutical company Merck first developed MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine) in 1912, during its search for a drug to control blood clotting.But the company soon abandoned the project.MDMA sat dormant until Alexander Shulgin, a research scientist for Dow Chemical, synthesized the psychedelic again in 1965.Shulgin soon began using the drug in self-trials, and concluded it was a powerful psychoactive with potential use for psychotherapy.By the mid-1970s a small network of psychiatrists was using MDMA informally in treatment.But the drug, known recreationally as ecstasy or Molly, was also turning into a staple of the global rave and club scene, and the DEA outlawed its use in 1985 amid the Reagan administrations Just Say No to drugs campaign.It is just in the last few years that MDMA has witnessed a scientific resurgence, as academic institutions increasingly reevaluate the therapeutic potential of MDMA and other psychedelics including LSD and psilocybin.Previous MDMA-assisted psychotherapy studies have shown great promise.A 2010 trial conducted in Charleston, South Carolina, with veterans, firefighters and police officersa previously treatment-resistant group of people who had suffered PTSD for an average of 17 yearsfound that 83 percent of participants no longer met the criteria for PTSD after four months of the experimental treatment.MAPS-organized phase II studies showed similar results, with 68 percent of participants no longer meeting the PTSD criteria one year after the therapy.In terms of effectiveness, there is nothing else like it, says Mark Haden, the psychedelic program officer at the British Columbia Center on Substance Use in Vancouver, Canada, who is helping design phase III trials for MAPS.Two medications often prescribed for PTSDparoxetine and sertralinehave proved ineffective for many patients according to the National Academies.And the most common psychotherapy approachprolonged exposure therapy, which gradually recreates the trauma so patients can confront ittakes years and suffers from high dropout rates.MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is probably going to be the next standard of treatment for PTSD, Haden says.Other experts express more caution.Empirical evidence for MDMA therapys effectiveness is scarce and treatment guidelines remain experimental, they note, adding that the drug's safety also remains to be firmly established.The work of Michael Mithoefer has been very impressive, says Charles Grob, a psychiatry and behavioral studies professor at University of California Los Angeles, referring to the PTSD therapist who directed MAPS first phase II trials in 2004.Hes demonstrated fairly impressive efficacy and reduction of PTSD symptoms, and even amelioration of the disturbance."Grob, who is not involved in MAPS research or trials, adds: Time will tell whether it bears out in regards to maintaining strong safety parameters and demonstrating efficacy, but the preliminary evidence is quite good."Little is certain about MDMAs pharmacological mechanismsa lack of information blamed largely on decades of DEA restrictions on research.The drug affects the brain by increasing the activity of neurotransmitters including serotonin, which helps regulate mood.It also increases levels of the neurohormone oxytocin, which scientists believe helps increase trust and reduce reactions to traumatic memories.Neuroscientists also think MDMA may reduce activity in the amygdala, the fight-or-flight response center of the brain, so people can confront traumatic memoriesand talk through them in detail with a therapistwithout feeling danger.These scientific hunches may help explain Caseys reaction to MDMA.It was like this armor that I could put over myself.I could dive into the darkness of my traumatic experience and come out unscathed, he says.It really allowed me to wade through my subconscious and figure out the root causes for some of the problems in my life.Whereas phase II trials were about confirming MDMAs effectiveness on a small group of patients, phase III will focus on reproducing those results on a larger sample sizebetween 200 and 300 participantssays Shannon Clare Carlin, manager of MAPS MDMA therapy training program.Phase III will also focus on collecting safety data in search of rare health risks that have not shown up in previous trials, such as potential adverse effects on a certain blood type or people with a rare gene.The quality of the data and statistical significance from phase III is pretty much the main factor the FDA is going to look at to see if this therapy can be made into a legal medicine, Carlin says, adding that MAPS has raised a little over $18 million of the $25 million needed to finance phase III trials.In recent years MDMA has added to a renaissance of psychedelic research to treat a range of medical conditions.In a 2011 study researchers at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine found that psilocybin, the psychoactive compound found in some species of mushroom, had life-changing health benefits with minimal negative effects.Other studies have highlighted psilocybin as an overwhelmingly safe, effective treatment against tobacco and alcohol addiction.Carlin says that the MAPS trials have also shown MDMA to be fairly safe, and that MAPS is working to mitigate side effects such as jaw clenching and nausea in some participants.Along with the drugs physiological and psychoactive effects, Carlin and Casey both underline the importance of the psychotherapists role in MDMA therapy.Participants dictate the direction of the MDMA-assisted sessions, with the two psychotherapists on hand taking cues from each subjects sensations, moods and speech.The therapists say they do not follow a strict agenda, and instead try to create the ideal environment and facilitate emotional processing so participants can achieve their own healing.Casey likens the effect to going through the depths of a dark cave.The MDMA is a headlamp that provides him with a limited view of the cave, he says, while the psychotherapistswho are more familiar with the psychedelic landscapeaccompany him on his journey.MAPS encourages therapists to undergo an MDMA session as part of their preparation for sitting with the patients.This FDA-approved training involves one placebo and one MDMA session, something MAPS finds invaluable to the training.Its interesting to do research and drug development with the FDA because it really doesnt care how the drug works.They just care that it works, Carlin says.The FDA is looking for good science.If somebody shows them good data, that something works, they will seriously

Global Climate Meeting Will Forge Ahead, Despite Trump’s Contempt:::::A shadow looms over this years United Nations climate change meeting.The 23rd Conference of the Partiesor its shorthand, COP 23begins Monday in Bonn, Germany.It commences just five months after Pres.Donald Trump announced he would withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, which aims to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsiusor ideally, 1.5 degrees C. The international community strongly reprimanded the Trump administration for its decision, and it has vowed to disregard that setback and forge ahead at COP23.No other countries have reneged on the accord.Nations have a lot to figure out.The 2015 Paris accord was a landmark agreement, says Cara Horowitz, co-executive director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law.But it left many of the details about [implementation] still to be negotiated.At COP 23, country representatives will work out the nitty-gritty of how to execute the accord, which will ultimately determine its long-term success.This is quite a consequential meeting, says Barry Rabe, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan.It represents an important early test of [nations] resolve to honor what they agreed on in Paris.The implementation guidelines that country representatives will develop are often collectively referred to as the Paris rule book.The numerous rules will address issues such as how countries will track and report their emissions and have them verified, all in a transparent way; how countries will be required to communicate their future emissions-reduction plans as well as their pledges for funding adaptation efforts; and if and how market mechanisms, such as emissions trading between countries, will be applied to national targets.The representatives will also address how nations will assess the gap between global progress made and the Paris agreements 2-degree C goala collective five-year review named the global stocktake that will commence in 2023.Experts say countries likely will not finalize any major guidelines during the two-week COP 23 meeting but will be making crucial progress.The concerns of small island nations will influence the meeting in a new way.This years COP president is Fijis prime minister, Frank Bainimaramathe first representative from a small island nation to lead the U.N. climate meeting.The COP president typically has a fair amount of power to set the tone for negotiations, Horowitz explains.I expect well see a lot at this COP that relates to the priorities of small island nations.These nations are extremely vulnerable to rising oceanstheir fate is tied to the success of the Paris accord.They could be among the first to lose significant sovereign territory, Horowitz says.They will likely push for greater greenhouse gas reductions as well as emphasize adaptation to climate change and paying for losses and damages.Some U.S. officials are still attending COP23, but Michael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University Law School, worries that without U.S. leadership, the Paris accord rules could end up vague.The U.S. has strongly favored transparency, Wara says.An agreement with a lot more ambiguity is more favorable to countries that are very concerned about showing [they have met their commitments].They want to preserve some ambiguity around compliance.That would really weaken the prospects for meeting the Paris accord goal, he adds, stressing the importance of transparency.The more transparent you are, the more you can see whether nations are meeting their commitment, and the greater level of trust.And if countries trust each other, they can continue to make bigger emissions commitments, which is exactly how the Paris agreement is supposed to work.Jonathan Elkind, former Department of Energy assistant secretary for international affairs under the Obama administration, says these concerns about transparency are valid, and he questions the U.S.s influence at COP23 due to Trumps decision.At a minimum, the U.S.s ability to be persuasive to other parties is really placed under pressure, says Elkind, who is now a fellow and senior adjunct research scholar at Columbia Universitys Center on Global Energy Policy.Horowitz thinks that even without the U.S. leading, otherssuch as the European Unionwill do so.Although the U.S. government has stepped away from climate leadership, many subnational leadersgovernors, mayors, tribal statesmen, CEOs and university headshave formed a coalition to uphold the U.S.s Paris accord promise.These groups will have a big presence at COP23, Horowitz says.Among others, governors Jerry Brown (Calif.), Terry McAuliffe (Va.), Kate Brown (Ore.) and Jay Inslee (Wash.) will attend the meeting.Their presence signals very loudly to the rest of the world that the U.S is not the Trump administration, Wara says.While Trump is here for now, that's not forever.The world still faces a long, difficult path to achieving its goal.Last Tuesday, the U.N. announced a wide gap remains between nations current emissions pledges and the reductions needed to keep the planets temperature increase below 2 degrees C. Without greater ambition, the U.N. reported, the global rise could be 3 degrees C or more this century.
Mail-Order CRISPR Kits Allow Absolutely Anyone to Hack DNA:::::We arent going to get sick, are we?my roommate Brett asked me.He cringed as I knelt down and stuffed a plate of E. coli bacteriawhich came as part of the DIY CRISPRCas9 kit I bought onlineinto our fridge next to cartons of eggs, strawberry jam, bottles of beer and a block of cheese.No, we wont.The label says non-pathogenic, I replied, trying to sound assuring.But honestly, I had no clue what I was doing.I nudged all the food up against the fridge wall, and left a two-inch border around the plate of living cellsa no mans land between the microbes and our dinner.A couple inches probably would not stop the bugs, but I figured it couldnt hurt.CRISPRCas9 (or CRISPR, for short) has given scientists a powerful way to make precise changes to DNAin microbes, plants, mice, dogs and even in human cells.The technique may help researchers engineer drought-resistance crops, develop better drugs, cure genetic disorders, eradicate infectious diseases and much more.Ask any biologist, and theyll likely tell you that CRISPR is revolutionary.Its cheap and effective, and in many cases, it works much better than older methods for making genetic modifications.Biologists will also tell you that CRISPR is very easy to use.But what does easy to use mean?I am not a DIY scientist, much less a professional scientist.You wont find me swabbing my cheek cells for DNA or tinkering with yeast in a lab on the weekend.But I wondered: Is CRISPR so easy that even amateurs like me can make meaningful contributions to science?And also, does this new technique make gene editing so accessible that we need to worry about DIY scientists cooking up pandemic viruses in their basements?If you Google DIY CRISPR, stories such as What Happens If Someone Uses this DIY Gene Hacking Kit to Make Mutant Bacteria?pop up.I attempted to find answers to all these questions myself, starting with the plate of bacteria in the kitchen of my San Francisco apartment.CUT AND SPLICE CRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.The CRISPR system is made up of two components: a protein called Cas9 and a guide RNA, a string of nucleic acid molecules with a certain genetic code.Put them together, and they create a tool you can use to tweak an organisms genome.To do this, CRISPR searches the organisms DNA for a certain sequencespecifically, the one encoded by the guide RNA, which holds the inverse sequence of your target DNA.Cas9 opens up the DNA, it separates the strands of the double helix in a very small area, and allows the guide RNA to pair with one of the strands, explains Dana Carroll, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Utah.If it is a good match, cutting occurs.If it is not a good match, Cas9 and [the] guide RNA fall off and try again somewhere else.When it finds the right sequence, the Cas9 protein slices the DNA at that precise spot.At this point, if you leave the cell alone, it will usually mend CRISPRs cutbut it will occasionally also make a mistake in the repair process, breaking a gene or other parts of the genome.Since CRISPR repeatedly goes back and slices the DNA again after the cell mends it, the gene eventually breaks, or, in technical terms, gets knocked out.And, if you add new DNA, the cell may incorporate it while fixing the cut.This means you can insert DNA where you want to in the genomeyou just need to know the organisms genetic sequence of your desired target area.Scientists originally discovered this sophisticated system in archaea and bacteria, which deploy CRISPR to chop up invading viruses.But a few years ago, researchers figured out how to repurpose CRISPR to run in pretty much any living thing they want.And now its made genetic engineering easier than ever before.For my own experiment, everything I needed came in a small cardboard boxan assortment of bottles, tubes, plates, powders and liquids (plus E. coli).I ordered my kit for $130 from the crowd-funding site Indiegogo as part of a campaign created by Bay Area biohacker Josiah Zayner.Zayner has a PhD in molecular biophysics and spent two years as a research fellow at NASA.He ran the crowdfunding campaign out of his apartment, and by the end of it, he had raised over $70,000 and sold 250 DIY CRISPR kitsone of which now sat on my kitchen table.Zayner has now sold over a thousand kits, largely on his companys website, The Odin.The idea behind the kit experiment is quite simple.The goal: modify the E. coli so that it can grow on an antibiotic called streptomycin, which normally kills bacteria.With materials and instructions from the kit, I will introduce CRISPR into the bacteria cells, and use it to rewrite a tiny part of their DNA, creating genetically altered cells that happily thrive on streptomycin.In the end, CRISPR will track down and then change only a single base pair (which are the building blocks for DNA) out of the 4.6 million base pairs in the E. coli genome.It will swap out the chemical compound adenine for cytosineor, in terms of the genetic alphabet, an A for a C. Because of that tiny code change, my bacteria cells will make the amino acid lysine instead of another one, threonine.If my gene editing succeeds, this will stop streptomycin from interfering with the E. coli.On a Monday afternoon in May, I donned latex gloves and spread newspaper over the dinner table.I grabbed three small plastic tubes from the freezer, picked up a pipettea hand-held instrument, used in labs to measure out liquidsfrom my DIY kit, and started adding the CRISPR ingredients to tubes of E. coli.I put in the Cas9 protein and guide RNA, which came as liquids in small, plastic test tubes, to my bacteria cells.Then I dipped my pipette into a small tube of DNA and tried to suck up 10 microliters.Nothing came out.I squinted at the tiny drop of clear liquid, and realized it had frozen solid.I had no clue why.Uh oh, I hope thats not a problem.Would it harm my experiment?I had absolutely no idea, so I just waited for the DNA solution to thaw and then squirted it into the bacteria tube.After several more steps, I spread my CRISPRd bacteria onto three plastic plates and put them in my laundry room.The instructions said to wait 2448 hours, then check for small white dots of bacteria.If I saw dots, CRISPR had done its job of splicing in the streptomycin-resistance gene.If not well, failure is also part of the scientific process.I had no problem conducting the experimentCRISPR is easy, I concluded.I basically just measured, scraped and stirred a bunch of ingredients, occasionally cooling them or heating them up.But for all the godlike powers that I imagined CRISPR gave me, I actually had little say over what I did to my bacteria.Everything was predetermined, with instructions laid out for me like steps in a cookbook: Add 100 microliters Transformation mix to a new centrifuge tube, Incubate this tube in the fridge for 30 minutes, and so on.Ultimately, I had made zero decisions.Of course, I could have designed a custom-made CRISPR experimentbut it would have taken more time, more materials, more money, and a lot more knowledge than I currently had.I inspected my bacteria 48 hours later.Crossing my fingers, I lifted the lid on the first plate.No white dots.Then the second plate: nothing.My stomach sank with disappointment.Then I gently raised the lid off the third plate, and saw something.The plate had two faint milky white circles.Had CRISPR worked?Maybe.But then why did one plate have white spots, but not the other plates?Id followed the same steps for each of them.Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me.Or perhaps I had contaminated the third plate.If only I could show my plates to someone who knew how to interpret them.Like a scientist.Unfortunately, there was no one to ask in my kitchen.OPEN TO EVERYONE A few weeks later, I drove 40 miles south of San Francisco to meet a DIY scientist named Johan Sosa, who knows way more about CRISPR than I do.We met at BioCurious, a community laboratory in Sunnyvale where he works most weekends and some evenings.Located in Santa Clara, BioCurious is a co-working space outfitted with science equipment and shared by scientists, technologists, entrepreneurs, and amateurs who believe that innovations in biology should be accessible, affordable, and open to everyone, according to its Web site.The lab is funded by donations and membersSosa is one of its several dozen members.At six foot, five inches, Sosa towers over most people.Im probably the tallest DIY biologist, he jokes.He laughs easily, which offsets his height to lend him a gentle, laid-back manner.He is 40 years old, his dark hair flecked with silver.Originally from Sri Lanka, Sosa came to the U.S. for college at 15 years old to study computer science, and hes worked for Bank of America and IBM as a computer security specialist and software engineer.He now has a day job in computer securitybut he spends most of his free time at BioCurious.You could say I have no life, he chuckles, This is my biggest hobby.He has learned everything he knows about science (both theory and lab techniques) from others at BioCurious, by reading science papers, watching YouTube videos, attending lectures, and also through trial-and-error in his own research.Sosa is one of a few DIY scientists at BioCurious using CRISPR.He first read about the technique in 2012, from one of biochemist Jennifer Doudnas papers in the journal Science.Doudna, a professor at University of California, Berkeley, is one of the pioneers of CRISPR.I didnt think it was that big of a deal, because I knew there were already other ways of modifying DNA, he recalls, But I did think, This is something I could do.He started experimenting with CRISPR in 2013.On a muggy, overcast afternoon, I followed Sosa inside BioCurious.We strolled through a lobby and into a large windowless room.It had big cabinets crammed with bottles of liquid, racks of latex gloves, a giant bio-hood, microwave and fridge.Microscopes, scales, centrifuges and a bunch of other well-worn science equipment lay scattered across lab desks.A calm thrum of buzzing machinery filled the room, and test tubes shook quietly in an incubator nearby.Johan walked around the room, searching for a thermometer.One thing about a DIY lab is that you leave something somewhere, and it always ends up somewhere else, he told me.I had joined Sosa at BioCurious so I could learn more about what CRISPR means for DIY scientists, and also to do a (hopefully) more successful experiment, with his help.We decided on a very basic goal: we would use the powerful editing tool to cut DNA he had already extracted from yeast cells.This task is easier than the one I tried in my kitchen, because you dont need to get CRISPR inside cells in order to slice the DNA.Professional scientists might use such a method as an intermediate step, such as when they need to cut and paste DNA together to make a gene as part of a bigger research project.Thats a type of experiment everyone does every day, explains Charles Gersbach, a professor of biomedical engineering at Duke Universitythough he notes that traditionally, researchers have used a type of protein called a restriction enzyme, not CRISPR, to do this.Sosa and I pulled on latex gloves and carefully pipetted liquids into tubes to make our guide RNA from scratchwe first synthesized DNA strands with a specific sequence we wanted, used that as a template for the RNA, then destroyed the DNA and isolated the guide RNA from our test tube mixture.Later, we put the RNA in a new test tube, along with the other materials needed to make CRISPR work in this experiment: protein buffer, bovine serum albumin (a protein isolated from cows), water.Sosa sucked up the yeast DNA in his pipette.Without warning, the plastic needle-nose tip fell off into the tube of DNA.Someone, he told me, had donated the tips to their lab, but they werent the correct size.I guess you got the full DIY experience, he smiled, and pushed the plastic tip back onto the pipette.Then he picked up the Cas9 protein.Heres the world-famous Cas9, he said, and handed it to me.I added it to our test tube.Until CRISPR, DIY scientists didnt have an easy, cheap or reliable way to precisely edit DNA.Many of them couldnt afford the pricey and imperfect tools that professional scientists used for gene editing at the time.Before CRISPR, there was TALENS [transcription activator-like effector nucleases] and zinc finger nucleasesolder technologies that were not as precise or reliable, explains Sosa.They were out of the budget and the time constraints of DIY scientists.Sosa says that if a DIY-er used those other technologies, it might cost him or her thousands of dollars to do a genetic engineering experiment.But with CRISPR, its vastly more affordable, especially if you want to attempt an experiment more than once.With TALENS, you try it once and fail, says Sosa.With CRISPR, you can try it multiple times.That alone is a big deal.This means that CRISPR gives DIY-ers a whole new way to do science.So far, Sosa and his lab mates have tried out CRISPR in a number of ways: cutting yeast genomes, slicing DNA inside E. coli cells, and attempting to modify the CRISPR system by shrinking it or attaching other molecules to it.Sosa has goals for his CRISPR research.I want to understand how a cell really functions, and what are all the little things that happen in it, he explains.And when something goes wrong [such as in diseases], how to fix it or make it do what I want.After several hours, Sosa and I checked to see if CRISPR had cut our yeast DNA.We dyed our DNA-CRISPR mixture blue and ran it through an electrically charged gel, which separates bigger DNA pieces from smaller ones.Tiny channels in the gel run from one charged end to the other, and the sliced DNA strands are pulled through them towards the positively charged side.If our experiment succeeded, we should see two blue bands for the short CRISPR-cut DNA strands in one spot, and one blue band for a longer, uncut piece of DNA (our control) in another location.Sosa carried the gel into the bathroom, where we turned off the lights and looked at it under blue light.I held my breath while I inspected the gel for markings.One light-blue band gleamed in the darkthe controland another single band lit up the spot where we should have seen our CRISPRd DNA.I dont know what happened, but it doesnt look right, Sosa said, I dont think it worked.I left the lab feeling defeated, and headed back to San Francisco.Sosa texted me a few minutes later.Hey, I figured out what happened.There was no DNA to start with, he wrote.What happened?I texted back.I think the DNA had either degraded or gotten too diluted, he wrote.Even if we had got all the other parts (RNA, proteins, etc.)working, it didnt matter.We hadnt given CRISPR any DNA to cut.My second attempt at CRISPR had utterly failed.BETTER, FASTER, CHEAPER My own frustrating struggles with CRISPR aside, I wanted to see what professional biologists are doing with CRISPR, so I visited the lab of Nipam Patel at the University of California, Berkeley.After a quick tour of the lab, I sat down and stared into the microscope at a small, writhing marine creature: Parhyale hawaiensis, commonly called a beach hopper.At one centimeter long, Parhyale looks punyyoud step on it at the beach without even noticing.But under the microscope, this female hopper resembled a giant translucent shrimp with many powerful, kicking legs.Parhyale is the star of this lab.Were looking at how you develop an individual body, explains Erin Jarvis, a PhD student in Patels lab, And also how you build a body form over evolutionary time.And theyre using CRISPR to do it.With CRISPR, these researchers knock out so-called Hox genes in Parhyale.Hox genes are found in all animals, including humans, and they control the development of their body plans.Among other things, they determine what appendagessuch as swimming legs, claws and antennaegrown on which section of the body.Knock out a certain Hox gene with CRISPR and Parhyale will grow forward-walking legs where it should have jumping legs, for example.Parhyale has nine Hox genes, and Patels team has knocked out seven of them.The researchers also have plans to add completely new genes to Parhyale using CRISPRtheyve already done it once, by inserting a gene that codes for green fluorescent proteins, which allowed the researchers to visualize where a specific Hox gene is expressed in Parhyale.From an evolutionary perspective, this [gives] us insight into how body plans evolve between species, when comparing Parhyale to, for example, the well-studied fruit fly, Drosophila, explains Patel.We believe that such evolutionary patterns help us understand the general mechanisms by which evolution creates animal diversity.What we learn improves our knowledge about the function of these genes in other animals, including humans.CRISPR has transformed how Patel and his colleagues do their research.His lab has looked at Parhyale for about 20 years now.Before CRISPR they used another technique to knock out genes that required a lot more money, and even then, it wasnt very efficient.It cost them about $900 to knock out a single gene in a group of Parhyale embryos with their other method.The technique, called RNA interference, silences expression of a geneit doesnt genetically knock it out as CRISPR does.The problem was, sometimes the method didnt work at all.Now it costs them less than $100 to knock out a gene.Suddenly, with CRISPR, you dont have to decide, Which one gene do I want to put all my resources into?Jarvis says, You can try a lot of different genes.And with CRISPR, theyre able to break genes in up to 75 percent of Parhyale embryos, versus a maximum 25 percent success rate with the old technique.Even better, they now have the ability to mutate several genes at once with CRISPR, which means they can now see how genes interact.When the researchers had tried to mutate multiple genes with their old technique, it rarely worked.(Though Patel notes that the older RNA technique is still very useful for certain applications).Their research takes less time with CRISPR, tooin a study Patels lab published in Current Biology in 2015, they knocked out six Hox genes in about a year.Before that, they had already spent years trying to break a specific Hox gene with their old method, but were never able to do it.Everything just goes faster, says Patel, a professor of genetics, genomics and development.CRISPR-Cas9 is an incredibly elegant system, and its very easy to control.It also makes it simpler to study more exotic creatures (beyond the standard flies and mice), such as animals like Parhyale or butterflies.Its always been hard to work with a new organism, says Jarvis, CRISPR is awesome because suddenly, you dont have to spend decades developing a model.As long as you have the sequence of the gene you want to target, youre set.Patels lab is hardly the only one capitalizing on CRISPRscientists around the world are exploring all sorts of different uses for the gene editing tool, like wiping out malaria-spreading mosquitoes, finding new ways to treat cancer, or engineering disease-resistant crops.In July, researchers announced they had successfully edited the genome of viable human embryos with CRISPR; the technique allowed them to fix a disease-causing mutation in the embryos DNA (though some are now skeptical of the researchers results).Just a few weeks later, scientists in Massachusetts reported they had made a significant advance towards pig-to-human organ transplants.They used CRISPR to inactivate 25 viruses intrinsic to pigs genomes, overcoming a big obstacle in making porcine transplants safe for humans.PLAYING GOD I had reached the end of my CRISPR experimentso what had I learned?First, I found out it was not completely crazy for my roommate to wonder whether a DIY CRISPR kit in our fridge would make us sick.This year, German authorities restricted imports of the Odin DIY CRISPR bacteria kit after the Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority tested two kits and found them to contain potentially pathogenic bacteria.But even the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control concluded that there was little to worry aboutthat the risk of infection by the contaminating strains in the kit is low for the users assuming that they are healthy people.(Zayner declined to comment on the record about the incident, but he publicly posted a response on Twitter, where he criticized the methodology used by the Bavarian agency and denied wrongdoing by his company.The kits are still available for purchase online through The Odin.)As for my bigger questioncould untrained DIY-ers actually achieve scientific breakthroughs?I asked academic researchers what they thought.Dana Carroll, for his part, believes amateurs could make meaningful discoveries.In the professional science community, people keep coming up with new ways to use this technologypeople are really only limited by their imagination, he explains.Its possible that people working in their garages or their kitchens will come up with a novel application or a solution to a problem that professionals just havent gotten around to.And Carroll says it would be easy for a DIY-er to share any discoveries with researchers, by attending their talks or simply by contacting them through their Web sites.Yet he notes that the DIY community faces limitations, because amateur scientists likely would lack the necessary resources.Its unlikely they will bring a major application all the way to fruition, he says, But they could certainly get started on something.Finally, what about the nightmare scenario: Is CRISPR so easy to use that we need to worry about biohackerseither accidentally or intentionallycreating dangerous pathogens?Carroll and others think that the danger of putting CRISPR in the hands of the average person is relatively low.People have imagined scenarios where scientists could use CRISPR to generate a virulent pathogen, he says.How big is the risk?Its not zero, but its fairly small.Gersbach agrees.Right now, its difficult to imagine how itd be dangerous in a real way, he explains, If you want to do harm, there are much easier and simpler ways than using this highly sophisticated genetic editing technique.Back in Patels lab, Jarvis replaced the squirming female beach hopper under my microscope with a tiny Parhyale embryo.Jarvis told me she knocked out a Hox gene called Abd-B in this onethe embryo will grow jumping legs where it should have swimming legs, and forward walking legs instead of anchor legs.At this point, it just looked like an opaque ball of goo to me.Next to me, another grad student examined a fragment of a brown and gold butterfly wingPatels lab is also knocking out butterfly genes with CRISPR to see how they build wing color.An old grad student used to joke that we were genetically modifying the wings to make the Mona Lisa, Jarvis told me.I laughed and glanced back under the microscope.A puff of my breath suddenly struck the Parhyale embryo.It danced wildly around the petri dish, like a grain of sand caught in a windstorm.
Could Genetic Engineering Save the Galápagos?:::::On September 25, 1835, during the HMS Beagle's sojourn to the Galpagos archipelago, Charles Darwin first set foot on what was then known as Charles Island.He found a colony of 200 to 300 inhabitants, nearly all political exiles sent there by Ecuador, aka the Republic of the Equator, after a failed coup attempt.The lowlands did not much impress Darwin, with their leafless thickets, but after trudging four miles inland and upward to a small, impoverished settlement in the highlands, he found a green and thriving vegetation, cultivated with bananas and sweet potatoes, along with a group of islanders who, although complaining of poverty, obtain, without much trouble, the means of subsistence.That was mainly because of the tens of thousands of giant tortoises that once prowled these islands.In the woods, Darwin noted, almost as an afterthought, there are many wild pigs and goats.On the morning of August 25, 2017, Karl Campbell bounded off a twin-engine motorboat and onto the dock of that same humble island.Now known as Floreana, the island has 144 residents, half as many as in Darwin's time, and Campbell seemed to know them all.Dressed down in a baseball cap, blue jeans and gray T-shirt that read Island Conservation, he ambled up to Claudio Cruz, at the wheel of a local bus (a converted truck with benches in the back), and exchanged some banter.He waved hello to Juanita and Joselito, who manned the Ecuadorian government's biosecurity checkpoint on the dock.He shouted out another Hola to the postmaster, popped his head into the community center to greet Myra and Holger, a farmer, and paused to catch up with Carmen, the woman who monitors the public bathrooms near the landing.His path up Floreana's one paved road was interrupted by salutations, chitchat, short jokes and the one-cheek kisses that are the custom in Ecuador.Campbell, a 42-year-old Australian who has lived in the Galpagos Islands for 20 years, is a gregarious and outgoing fellow, with a tendency to begin conversations with All good, mate?But the cheery demeanor and bonhomie he displayed that morning is an essential part of a massive scientific undertaking.Campbell has a Ph.D. in vertebrate pest management from the University of Queensland in Australia, and in 2006 he began working as an animal removal specialist for Island Conservation, an organization based in Santa Cruz, Calif., that is devoted to preserving biodiversity and preventing extinctions by removing invasive species from islands throughout the world.Campbell has been working on eradications in the Galpagos since 1997, including a 2006 campaign to remove all the feral goats and donkeys from Floreana.A decade later he's a project manager with Island Conservation, and the most ambitious project on its agenda is once again on Floreana: to eradicate every single rat and mouse on the island.There are hundreds of thousands of islands in the world.You can't work on all of them, Campbell says.Conservationists, according to Campbell, are currently able to do 10 to 20 islands a year to rid them of mice.So which are the ones you should be working on most urgently?We basically draw up a list of places where we should be working to prevent extinctions.Topping that list, he says, is Floreana.Floreana has one of the highest endemicity rates in the Galpagos, the highest rate of extinctions due to the invasive species here and the highest rateby farof critically endangered species, which makes it one of the highest-priority targets not just in the Galpagos but in the world, Campbell says, in a spiel that has the polish and urgency of countless recitations to funders, journalists and probably every one of Floreana's residents.Floreana is at the limit of feasible projects using current eradication tools.The island is large (17,253 hectares, or about 46,600 acres), and it is inhabited, which complicates the task enormously.It means having to explain the logistics and consequences of the entire projectnot least of which is a plan to dump 400 tons of rodent poison all over the island.That is why, since 2012, Campbell and his colleagues, such as Carolina Torres and Gloria Salvador, have been visiting Floreana almost once a month, enduring the bumpy two-hour boat ride from the main island of Santa Cruz to meet with residents, describe their proposed project, and figure out the massively complicated steps needed to protect adults, children, livestock, water and endangered species from the effects of the poison.Such eradications require almost military-scale logistics and precision, which is why Campbell has been desperately seeking an alternative to the blunt-force tools of current techniques.One of the most appealing, to his mind, is a controversial new form of genetic manipulation known as gene drive.Compared with the frustrations he endures every day on the Floreana project, he likens the technology to a magic wand out of Harry Potter.The basic strategy of using gene drive in the conservation setting would be to tinker with the DNA of mice, using either the new gene-editing tool CRISPR or other tools of genetic manipulation, in such a way as to tilt the odds of sex inheritance; one example would be to produce offspring that would be exclusively male, eventually producing a daughterless population of mice.The elimination of females, of course, would create a reproductive dead end for that invasive species.Gene drive is far from a practical technology at this point, but Island Conservation has been working with molecular biologists in the U.S. and Australia to create these genetically modified mice, and Campbell has made no secret of his enthusiasm for the approach at recent scientific meetings.And that, in turn, may be why the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, in a 2016 analysis on the potential benefits and risks of gene drive, included the example of daughterless mice among a series of potential scenarios where the technology might be applied.As the report noted, Perspectives on the place of human beings in ecosystems and their larger relationship to natureand their impact on and manipulation of ecosystemshave an important role in the emerging debate about gene drives.That debate, in a sense, has already begun on Floreana, where residents have been weighing the benefits and risks of a massive, albeit nongenetic manipulation of their precious ecosystem for the past five years.Brown rats (1) are a primary target of a massive invasive-species eradication effort planned for the island of Floreana, where donkeys (2), cattle (3) and many other nonnative species have been introduced over the centuries.On neighboring Isabela Island, feral goats denuded the landscape of a giant Galpagos tortoise stronghold (4).Credit: Krystyna Szulecka Alamy (1 and 3); Wolfgang Kaehler Getty Images (2); Tui de Roy (4) Campbell is the first to acknowledge that the Galpagos will not be the first or best place to test gene drive in the field.But it may be the best place to think about the implications, good and bad, of gene drive in the context of species preservation.If, as a global community, we value the preservation and protection of biodiversity in the Galpagos (a value ratified by its selection as among the first World Heritage sites by the United Nations agency UNESCO), we also have to come to terms with the complexities and paradoxes of invasive species eradication, which legitimizes the local elimination of certain animals for the benefit of other speciesnot least humans.As Campbell likes to point out, No one comes to the Galpagos to see rats and goats and cats.I.Red in tooth and claw If the Galpagos Islands have become synonymous in the public imagination with ecological harmony and thrillingly pristine biodiversity, the reality is somewhat different.Yes, the massive tortoises are stunning, but where thousands of them once bulldozed the highlands of Floreana, there are now about two dozenall imported from other islands because the local species went extinct.Yes, the fearless finches are charming and beautiful, but the Floreana mockingbird disappeared from the island around 1880, one of 13 species that have gone locally extinct.Yes, the sea turtles languorously swimming off La Lobera Beach are magnificent, but their eggs have been relentlessly poached by indifferent predators.All those iconic Galpagos species have been ruthlessly threatened by invasive species.There is a darkness to the Galpagos paradise, and it has been there a long time, perhaps since Toms de Berlanga, then the bishop of Panama, went off course and discovered the islands in 1535.The first true invasive mammals on the islands were the pirates who frequented them in the 17th century, followed by sailors from whaling ships in the 18th century.These mariners brought in tow a malign ark of mammalian deplorables they introduced to islands that had been largely unperturbed for millions of years.If you want to be provocatively precise about it, the very first documented resident invasive species on Floreana was an Irish sailor named Patrick Watkins, marooned around 1805.He reportedly grew vegetables, which he bartered to visiting ships in exchange for rum (he was the model for a story by Herman Melville).Three years before Darwin's arrival, a zoo's worth of invasive species had become entrenched on Floreana.It is no accident that in the scientific literature, the earliest date for many invasive species is 1832.That's when General Jos de Villamil, the first governor of the Galpagos Islands, arrived on Floreana to organize the penal colony.As Cruzfarmer, amateur historian, sometime bus driver and the largest landowner on Floreanaputs it, He brought everythinggoats, donkeys, cows, mules, horses, dogs, pigs, rats, everything.Similar animal importations occurred on other islands in the Galpagos during the 19th century, with devastating consequences on the local flora and fauna.Villamil brought the mules and donkeys to haul tortoises down from the highlands.At the time of his visit, Darwin reported that a previous ship visiting Floreana had loaded up on 200 tortoises in a single day (other ships reportedly collected as many as 700 apiece, according to Darwin).Invasive mammals have wrought havoc on the ecosystem, in direct and indirect ways.Donkeys destroy tortoise eggs when they roll on the ground to cleanse themselves.Feral cats devour seabird chicks and snack on baby lava lizards, as do mice.Feral goats, in buzz cut fashion, chew through the native vegetation, removing the food that sustained the tortoise population for centuries and clearing the way for invasive plants such as guava, which has spread throughout the highlands.The Galpagos racer, once a common snake?Gone.More than 750 alien plant species and almost 500 alien insects have taken root in the Galpagos.As much as the islands have been a global classroom on evolution, they are also a reminder that nature is not static and that conservation sometimes alters nature to preserve it.Credit: Mapping Specialists It has been the same story throughout the archipelago, though with some very odd chapters.In a 2012 compendium of alien vertebrates on the Galpagos, R. Brand Phillips, David A. Wiedenfeld and Howard L. Snell, all then affiliated with the Charles Darwin Research Station in Puerto Ayora on Santa Cruz, catalogued a rogue's gallery of 44 uninvited guest species, nearly half of them establishing feral populations.They ranged from obvious interlopers (goats, pigs, cattle, black rats) to an unwelcome menagerie of exotic animals.The Nile tilapia, a freshwater fish, turned up on the island of San Cristbal in 2006; tree frogs have been spotted on two islands.Over the years nonnative visitors have included the mourning gecko, domestic ducks, cattle egrets, parakeets, peafowls and grackles.Three monkeys, of uncertain species, turned up on Floreana in the 1930s, and in 1937 one local entrepreneur tried to establish an ocelot colony on the island of Santiago.Ocelots!Humans don't get a waiver from these waves of invasion, and their impact is increasing, too.In 1984 only 6,000 people total lived on five of the 129 islands and islets; more than 30,000 do today.And tourists?Three decades ago there were 20,000 a year; in 2016 there were 218,000.Just as more people began to come to the Galpagos to marvel at the local biodiversity, that biodiversity became increasingly threatened by the invasive species.The Galpagos National Park Service, which controls 97 percent of the land in the archipelago, first attempted to eradicate goats on Pinta Island in 1971an undermanned campaign that proved the adage in the eradication business that a 99 percent success is a 100 percent failure.Only 10 goats remained on the island after the eradication program, recalls Victor Carrion, a former national park service official who participated in many eradication efforts.Within 10 years the number had climbed back up to 2,000.The problem, Carrion says with a shrug, was the final stage.The Galpagos National Park Service began to develop more effective eradication plans in the late 1990s.Around this time, Campbell, then 22 years old and trying to decide what to do with his life, turned up in the archipelago.He had no particular affinity for the Galpagosexcept, perhaps, that as a teenager back in Brisbane, he kept hundreds of pet birds in aviaries he built himself.In August 1997 he served as a volunteer on a goat-eradication project on the island of Isabela.Within a decade he would play a leading role in some of the most ambitiousand controversialisland eradication projects in the world.II.The devil we know Eradication is an ugly, euphemistic business.In 2004 the national park service and the Charles Darwin Foundation initiated a more systematic campaign to eradicate goats from the northern, uninhabited part of Isabela, the largest island in the archipelago.Two helicopters were used for aerial hunting; two or three hunters in each helicopter shot goats from the air, using semiautomatic 12-gauge shotguns and semiautomatic.223-caliber AR15 rifles.After the first aerial sweep, ground hunters with specialized dogs went into heavily vegetated parts of the island to flush out goats that had survived the initial onslaught.In the final phase, beginning in March 2005, the eradication team deployed some 700 Mata Hari goats and Judas goats.Campbell's Ph.D. project was the development of the Mata Hari goata variation on the Judas goat, which was developed in the 1980s.Judas goats are outfitted with radiotelemetric collars.The animals are very gregarious, so hunters use goats wearing a wire, if you will, to find other goats.Mata Hari goats take the gambit one step furtherthey are female goats outfitted with hormonal implants that induce a permanent state of estrus, so that they seek and attract male goats.Mata Hari goats, needless to say, were not cooked up in the evolutionary hot pot of the Galpagos.Indeed, Campbell trained local hunters to perform field surgery on female goatstying their fallopian tubes, terminating any pregnancies and inserting hormonal packs so that they were in constant heat, after which they were outfitted with radiotelemetry transmitters on collars so they could be traced.Once released, the Judas and Mata Hari goats tracked down the last holdouts.When all was said and done, Project Isabela killed 62,818 goats, at a cost of about $4.1 million.To hear Carrion tell it, the main complaint of the locals was that they didn't get any of the meat.They said, We're hungry, and we need the food!he recalls.Even 100 percent success, in this case, wasn't enoughon at least nine occasions, according to Carrion, disgruntled locals deliberately reintroduced eradicated species, in part to protest local fishing regulations.Black rats (1), which came to the Galpagos on ships as early as the 17th century, devour eggs laid by native reptiles and birds.To fight back, biologists have resorted to baiting the nesting areas of the Galpagos storm petrel (2) and other species with rat poison.Credit: Tui de Roy (1); Pete Oxford Getty Images (2) But the magnitude of the eradication campaigns in the Galpagos is staggering: 79,579 goats removed from Santiago, 41,683 from Pinta, 7,726 in San Cristbalin all, 201,285 goats have been removed from 13 islands (and you know it's a grisly business when euphemisms such as removed are used instead of killed).It's a pretty good bet that the tourists who flock to the Galpagos to swim with the sea turtles and follow the graceful arc of its storied birds are unaware that the islands have been turned into killing fields over the past two decades to preserve their famous biodiversity.Even a modest rodent-eradication campaign illustrates just how tricky the traditional approaches can be.In 2012 the Galpagos National Park Service and collaborators began applying the rodent poison brodifacoum on the small, uninhabited island of Pinzn to eliminate rats, which had ravaged the eggs and hatchlings of giant tortoises for decades.The eradication was successful, and substantial numbers of tortoise hatchlings were reported on the island for the first time in a century.But the poison made its way into lava lizards, which in turn were eaten by endangered Galpagos hawks, resulting in at least 22 deaths because of brodifacoum poisoning (even though many of the hawks had been protected by captive holding for two weeks).In one instance, researchers found extremely high levels of rat poison in an owl carcass more than two years after the baiting.And that brings us to the most ambitious island eradication in the Galpagos and perhaps anywhere in the world, an endeavor that everyone on Floreana refers to simply as the Proyectothe Project.III.The devil is in the details There is one store in Floreana and one main road.As elsewhere in the Galpagos, the houses are simple cinder block constructions with corrugated metal roofs.If you go to one of the few restaurants in the island's single town, you better tell them ahead of time that you are coming: otherwise, they won't have enough food for you.The residents of Floreana are quiet-spoken, generous, subtly good-humored and deeply principled.Several years ago, when an entrepreneur from another island stiffed local workers out of their pay, no one on the island would serve him food, no one would rent him a room to sleep in and no one would speak to him.The entrepreneur's project collapsed.The island's quirky politics and fierce independence make such an endeavor socially daunting.As Campbell says, It gets complicated real fast.A recurring mantra in the recent National Academies report on gene driveand, indeed, in almost every official white paper about genetic engineering in the past four decadesis the need for public engagement.But that bloodless phrase does not begin to capture the passion and complexity of real projects in real circumstances.If eradications in general are hard, eradications on inhabited islands are really hard.That became clear to Campbell several years ago, during a small meeting with members of the Floreana community to discuss the Proyecto.One resident, adamantly opposed to the idea of having to remove livestock from the island, looked straight at Campbell and said, in unprintable language, If you do this, Im going to kill you.Campbell recalls the moment as very conflictive.The intensity of emotion does not seem entirely inappropriate, given the magnitude of the disruption.Since 2012 authorities in the Galpagos, with Island Conservation, have been formulating what they consider to be the most complex eradication plan of an inhabited island to date.It's not just the contentious adults on Floreana who make it complicated.It's children, pets and livestock, in addition to endangered birds and lava lizards.Floreana giant tortoises were once thought extinct, but recent genetic research identified related species living on nearby Isabela.Biologists are breeding the tortoises and reintroducing them to Floreana.Credit: Tui de Roy Consider the staggering environmental risks of a traditional, nongenetic eradication.To eliminate every rat and mouse from Floreana, the project calls for helicopters to drop some 360 million one-gram (0.035-ounce) pellets of brodifacoumin Campbell's words, Basically, systematically paint the whole islandnot just once but two times in the lowlands and three in the highlands, over a period of two months.To minimize potential health and environmental risks, the plan calls for extreme precautions.Water resources must be protected.Children may have to be removed from the island for up to six weeks.Pets will either need to be removed or restricted to domiciles or cages.Large agricultural livestock, such as cattle, pigs and horses, will have to be restricted in corrals (after the farmers of Floreana made clear that sending animals off the island for six months was not an acceptable option).Chickens will have to be housed in new covered coops built specifically for the project.Giant Galpagos tortoises in the Asilo de la Paz refuge will have to be temporarily restricted.Endangered birds will be trapped and held in specially built aviaries during the aerial baiting.In places off-limits to aerial baiting, such as buildings, homes or other structures, the eradication team will deploy traps and bait stations (the location of each bait station, in each home, has to be specified, and Carolina Torres, the lawyer for Island Conservation, is now drawing up a written agreement for each and every household).A single pregnant female, or a single area missed, is a failure, Campbell says.You need to get into every building, in every house, in every crawl space, in every closet, under every fridge to get every mouse.The people from Island Conservation have taken the idea of public engagement to a new level.On a recent trip, Torres brought chocolates for Ericka Wittmer, a matriarch of one of the island's oldest families, and paid house calls to several island farmers to explain a legal issue involving contracts with the tenants who worked on parcels of their land.The organization recently provided paint for local homeowners to beautify their cinder block houses.When one resident expressed interest in starting a restaurant, Campbell and Torres encouraged her and promised to be customers.The organization has enlisted architects to design new chicken coops for the island's farmers; each unit will cost about $22,000.Campbell has learned the hard way that one-on-one relationship building is the best way to involve people in the decision-making process on such a delicate project.If you do a town hall type of thing, theyll absolutely butcher you, he says.Two or three people dominate the conversation, you don't know what other people think, and then afterwards, you have to spend a lot time dealing with the misinformation.Despite initial reservations, Campbell says, most residents on Floreana support the eradication plan.In the highlands, Holger Vera, the farmer, stands amid a grove of orange trees, pineapple plants and other crops, lamenting the rapaciousness of the local rodents.They eat fledgling corn plants, he says; they devour pineapples; they eat the tubers of yucca.Now they are even eating the sugarcane, he complains.They are eating everything.But if we get rid of them, we can grow everything.Vera was initially skeptical about the Proyecto, Torres says, but he now sounds enthusiastic.Even if he has to board his seven dogs?Yes, yes, he replies.Similarly, Cruzwho owns 80 cows, 130 pigs, more than 200 chickens, 10 horses and two dogsagrees with the plan and the way it has been discussed with residents of Floreana.We feel we are on the same page in terms of what's going on, he says.Essentially we have verbal agreements from nearly all the residents, Campbell says.The plan still awaits final approval from Galpagos authorities.He believes the project could have been launched this year if funding had been secured in a timely fashion.(Costs are expected to be $20 million overall, but funding hiccups have now delayed it until at least 2020; Campbell estimates that each year of delay costs $1 million.)Despite funding uncertainty, the reality of the Proyecto recently sunk in when seven orange, 20-foot shipping containers arrived in Floreana in mid-July.They are intended to store uncontaminated livestock feed, or silage, for use during the rodent eradication; some farmers have already begun to store animal feed in the containers.Pulling off a project this complicated is like managing a bureaucratic ecosystembalancing the regulatory piece, the public engagement piece, the logistical piece, the funding piece, the poison mitigation piece.That's why Campbell thinks the Floreana project is maxing out the capability of traditional eradication tools.And that is why, not infrequently, he will say, If we engaged the gene-drive technology, the conversations would be simpler, and the answers would be much more pragmatic.IV.The devil we don't know Campbell first became intrigued by the possibilities of gene drive in 2011, when he sat in on a conference call between biologists at North Carolina State University and officials of the U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service to discuss a possible genetic approach to control a runaway mouse problem on Southeast Farallon Island, about 20 miles west of the California coast, near San Francisco.John Godwin, a North Carolina State neurobiologist who studies animal behavior, had learned of the Farallon issue while skimming the Internet in 2011.He happened to be at a university with an established infrastructure dedicated to experimenting withand considering the ethical implications ofgenetic manipulation.Two of his colleagues, Fred Gould and David Threadgill, were already discussing the possibility of tinkering with the mouse genome in an attempt to create mice incapable of producing female offspring.Two other colleagues, Jennifer Kuzma and Jason Delborne, became deeply involved in how to engage the larger world of stakeholdersgovernment regulatory agencies, animal management officials, bioethicists and, of course, the general publicin considering the prospect of releasing genetically altered animals into the wild.Kuzma and Gould serve as co-directors of the Genetic Engineering and Society Center at North Carolina State.To make a long story short, Island Conservation joined forces in 2016 with other international groups to launch the GBIRdGenetic Biocontrol of Invasive Rodentsprogram.GBIRd scientists are cautiously investigating genetic tools to preserve island ecosystems.The advent of the gene-editing tool CRISPR boosted efforts to develop an alternative approach to eradication.Those efforts gained traction in July, when the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency gave the North Carolina State group $3.2 million to pursue gene drives for mouse eradication on islands.The basic idea of gene drive seems counterintuitive to anyone raised on the notion of Gregor Mendel's pea plants and the random inheritance of genes from parents.You usually have a 5050 chance of inheriting a gene from one parent or the other.In rare instances, however, certain genes are favored, or selfishthey are inherited at much higher rates than random sorting would suggest.One such gene (technically, a region of the genome) exists in mice on chromosome 17; it is called the T-complex, and it is inherited at a rate of 95 percent.It might theoretically serve as a smuggler's bible, allowing a second gene to be quickly introduced in a population.In an eradication scenario, researchers could theoretically attach a second piggybacking gene to the T-complex and essentially drive that second trait into the majority of offspring.One such mouse gene, known as SRY, determines male gender, so stitching it to a selfish gene would create more and more males (and fewer and fewer females) in each generation, until a mouse population would be daughterless.One of the basic requirements of gene drive is that the time between generations in the target animal is short; mice certainly qualify because their time between birth and reproductive maturity is 10 weeks.If the mice in the lab can be manipulated to pass along a desired gene, such as one to produce a single gender, and if those mice are reproductively successful in the wild, that gene could be rapidly driven into a population.That's a lot of ifs, but Threadgill, now at Texas A&M University, has been pursuing precisely that strategy in mice.This so-called daughterless breed could eliminate a native mouse population without environmental poison, without offshore animal relocations, without all the logistical nightmares entailed by the Floreana project.Paul Thomas, a biologist at the University of Adelaide in Australia, has been exploring the use of CRISPR to inactivate genes related to female fertility in mice, an approach that could be adopted to produce a population of entirely infertile females.In addition, Godwin, the neurobiologist, is testing whether an engineered mouse will pass sexual muster with wild mice (he is currently working with a batch transplanted from Southeast Farallon).Floreana lava lizards are easy prey for the feral cats that stalk the island.Credit: Tui de Roy Species eradication is by no means the only application of gene drive.Target Malaria is an attempt to engineer mosquitoes so that they are incapable of transmitting malaria; the group, with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has already begun community outreach efforts in Africa in anticipation of a field test.Kevin Esvelt, a biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is pursuing a project to engineer white-footed mice on Nantucket to make them immune to the bacteria that cause Lyme disease.In the gene drive game, the rule of thumb is that islands are the best place for a field test; smaller islands are better than larger ones, and uninhabited islands are better than inhabited ones.Campbell suspects the first field test of gene drive will involve mosquitoes and adds that the U.S., Australia or New Zealand would probably be the most appropriate venue because their regulatory infrastructures are sophisticated enough to assess new hot-button genetic technologies.Eradications are controversial, genetic modification even more so.There is no safe way to experiment with these technologies in the wild, says Dana Perls, senior food and technology campaigner at Friends of the Earth.Jane Goodall, Fritjof Capra and other conservationists called for a moratorium on the research in an open letter published last September.Firing a shot across the bow of Island Conservation, the signatories said they were alarmed that some conservation organizations have accepted funding for and are promoting the release of engineered gene-drive organisms into the wild.The great fear is unintended consequencesthat something unexpected and bad will happen.There is no question that gene drive, as the National Academies put it, may have harmful effects for other species or ecosystems, and that alone warrants cautious and prudent development.But in previous public debates over genetic technologies, such as the battle over recombinant DNA in the 1970s, it was often difficult to separate legitimate concerns from exaggerated fears.Back in the real world, during an excursion into the highlands of Floreana, Campbell and Torres led me to a freshwater springnot far from the cave where the island's first settler, the drunkard Watkins, allegedly slept off his hangovers.As part of the project, the entire area surrounding the spring, which is already fenced off, will be covered with a tent, and special filters will be placed on the pipes to make sure no rodent bait gets into the systemeven though brodifacoum is not water-soluble.Part of public engagement, Campbell said, is dealing with perceptions as well as legitimate fears.Youre working with people's perception of toxicants, he explained.It's challenging to change people's perceptions of this, because they don't.One more reason, Campbell continued, that the genetic approach was more appealing.Then suddenly he changed the subject.Here we are, he said quickly, pointing to a rustle of vegetation inside the chain-link fence.You see it?A rat!A pair of shiny, dark eyes briefly appeared amid the leaves.Campbell identified it as Rattus rattusthe black rat, which is known to eat the eggs and hatchlings of Galpagos petrels and giant tortoises.Like rats everywhere, it disappeared quicklya sentinel of an inevitably larger population and a larger covert threat to what Campbell calls species on the brink.V. The stranger's craft or power Every stroll in the Galpagos is a nature walk, and each living creature tells a conservation storysome with happy endings, some not.During our last day on Floreana, a number of these stories began when Campbell's keen eye alighted on the animals that make this landscape so belovedand beleaguered.During breakfast, a cactus finch stalked our table.Its strong black and yellow beak had evolved to be larger and stronger, Campbell explained, to crack the unusually large and hard seeds of the local Opuntia cactus on Floreana; the cactus, in turn, is evolving even larger and tougher seeds to thwart this poachinga reminder that evolution is not a textbook concept but an ongoing process.Moments later Campbell spotted a mouse darting behind a hunk of lava.As we finished our meal, another invasive species made an appearancethe sleek, black, smooth-billed ani (pronounced Annie).An example of old-school unintended consequences, farmers introduced the bird to the Galpagos in the 1960s in the belief that it could control ticks that afflicted cattle; it did not live up to its billing, so to speak, but it has exploded in numbers as an invasive species.Later, on a walk to La Lobera Beach, Campbell pointed out fresh tracks of feral cats in the sand; they devour juvenile marine iguanas and lava lizards.(The small ones have zero chance of getting away, he said.)Near the head of the beach, he indicated the gnawed-off limb of one of the Opuntia cacti.When rodents chew down the cacti, he explained, the plants fail to flower or bear fruiteliminating a crucial source of sustenance for tortoises and mockingbirds, especially in the dry season, and depriving finches of nesting sites.And we paused to admire several magnificent sea turtles temporarily trapped in a lagoon during low tide.Their eggs and hatchlings, too, provide tasty meals for rats and cats.It was Darwin's 20th-century bulldog, Richard Dawkins, who revived poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson's phrase Nature, red in tooth and claw to describe the noir side of natural selectionnature's game is not always pretty, and the postcard-perfect ecology of a place like the Galpagos often conceals a darker, more unsentimental interaction of predator and preyan interaction whose delicate balance humans have repeatedly perturbed, whether by introducing invasive species or by attempting to atone for those ill-conceived introductions with literally toxic remedies.And now, on the horizon, we may have to decide whether to use futuristic techniques of genetic modification to restore the islands to an earlier, more pristine state.For what it is worth, a small sampling of opinion on Floreana did not betray much local concern about the potential applications of gene drive, although it is not clear how well understood these technologies (and their potential risks) are.Vera shrugged off any worries and said he would have no problem with a genetic solution to the rodent problem.Ingrid Wittmer, another descendant of one of the earliest families on Floreana, shook her head no when asked, instead expressing concern about the fate of the short-eared owl once its main food source, mice, was eliminated during the Proyecto.Cruz, whose father emigrated to the island in 1939, when the population numbered 11, offered a farmer's perspective to the idea of daughterless mice: It's like artificial insemination in cattle, he said.If you want females, you use the semen for females.It's the same thing.For me, these are issues we've created, and to sit back and do nothing, there's going to be grave consequences, Campbell said.We know where things are heading.To actually not do something is ... is just irresponsible.If you have the tool, and you don't use it, you're culpable.We don't have the tool yet.But if the craft of molecular biology eventually captures the power of gene drive, and it is used to manage invasive species in the Galpagos or any island, it is worth remembering that almost every ecological catastrophe visited on the planet's living laboratory of evolution has come at the hands of humans.The goats, the donkeys, the rats, the cats, the pigs, the mules, the mice and, yes, even those short-lived ocelots arrived with human help, on human boats, through human agency.In a wry observation that resonates nearly two centuries later, Darwin remarked in his journal that while birds in England had developed a well-earned distrust of humans, the birds in the Galpagos have not learned [such] a salutary dread.He went on to offer what might serve as cautionary words about 21st-century science and gene drives in particular.We may infer from these facts, Darwin wrote, referring to the lack of fear in birds, what havoc the introduction of any new beast of prey must cause in a country, before the instincts of the indigenous inhabitants have become adapted to the stranger's craft or power.
Astronomers Spy Planet-Spawning Vortex around Young Star:::::In some respects, making a solar system might seem childishly simple.A cloud of gas and dust collapses under its own gravity, forming a whirling protoplanetary disk of debris that has a star at its center.Despite its name, though, a protoplanetary disk is a challenging environment in which to form worldsat least, according to theorists who model the process.Now, however, new observations are revealing surprising details of how planets emerge from disks: the first worlds to form can give rise to whirlpool-like vortices, which create subsequent generations of planets.The findings were reported this month in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.Stefan Kraus, an astronomer at the University of Exeter in England, led the team that observed a pair of vorticesas well as spiraling density wavesin a protoplanetary disk around a star more than a thousand light-years from Earth.Both features are likely due to an unseen planet, and the teams models suggest they could boost further bouts of planet formation within the disk.For a long time, theoretical astrophysicists have struggled to create models that accurately predict the outcomes of planet formation.Planets are made in protoplanetary disks: turbulent environments filled with blobs and streams of gas and dust, which jostle against each other while spinning around a still-forming star.The exact dynamics of planetary birth in such places are messy and not fully understood.To make things even harder, planet-formation theorists are stuck in a field that is, right now, severely lacking observations.Observation tells you what reality is, says Wladimir Lyra, a theorist at California State University, Northridge.But you need theories to explain what's happening.We feed the observations to our models in order to build theories and explain the observations.It's this synergy that advances science.The trouble is that observations of the innards of protoplanetary disks are hard to come by; the gas and dust in a disk block most of the light that would otherwise show the planet-forming action as it happens.But millimeter and sub-millimeter radio waves emanating from cold dust in the disks outer regions can escape relatively unscathed, offering astronomers a way to look inside.Arguably the best facility in the world to perform such observations is the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observatory, a network of radio telescopes in Chiles Atacama Desert that came fully online in early 2013.Before ALMA, Lyra explains, astronomers had an incomplete view.The latest study from Kraus and his team used ALMA to peer deep into the protoplanetary disk of V1247 Orionis, a young star around 1,044 light-years away.ALMAs radio eyes revealed curious vortices spinning among density waves that revolved around the star, a little like the spiral arms around the Milky Way.The teams subsequent simulations suggest that these features arose from an unseen planetand that they could give rise to more worlds.In this scenario the birth of just one planet in a disk could spawn new features, such as vortices, which would catalyze further planet formation.A vortex is simply a swirling mass of fluid rotating around itself.Jupiters Great Red Spot, a storm that is wider than Earth and has persisted for hundreds of years, is perhaps the most famous planetary example of a vortex.Earthly examples include whirlpools in Earths oceans and tornados in the atmosphere.Vortices can form spontaneously in any turbulent fluid, but in protoplanetary disks they can also arise as the direct consequence of a planets motion as it carves out a turbulent wake.The spiral arms in the ALMA images of V1247 Orionis are probably a planets wake, spinning out vortices like small eddies in the wake of a speeding motorboat.According to Anders Johansen, a theorist at Lund Observatory, the study is particularly notable because it is the first to use ALMA to match the observation of a vortex structure in a protoplanetary disk to a simulation [of planet formation].That is, it offers a robust link between theory and observation that has, until now, eluded researchers.The first theories of planet formation lacked detailed treatments of vortices and other complex features that modern approaches include.Yet those early theories still managed to nicely replicate the observed architecture of our solar system, with its inner retinue of rocky worlds and outer realm of giant planets.This layout mirrors basic understandings of protoplanetary disks, which are hotter near their centers and cooler at their edges.Far enough from young stars, ices would contribute substantially to planet growth, leading to larger worlds.Closer in those ices would evaporate, leaving limited amounts of rocky material that could only form modest-sized planets.Problems with this overly simplistic model developed when astronomers began discovering an abundance of exoplanets like hot Jupitersmassive, close-in worlds that, according to prevailing theories, should not exist.In the early theories, in the sixties and seventies, Kraus says, they thought it was a relatively straightforward process.Now, he and other researchers realize that its much more complicated than we originally thought.In order to build planets, a fledgling system first needs to make planetesimals: mountain-sized building blocks that smash together to form full planets.We can see leftover planetesimals in our own backyardthey constitute the bulk of our solar systems supply of asteroids and comets.To make planetesimals, dust must form and somehow stick together within the protoplanetary disk long enough to build these kilometer-scale objects.However, to do this dust has to overcome a major obstacle called the radial drift problem.This problem arises when dust grains experience a drag from gas in the disk.This drag should cause the particles to lose momentum and rapidly spiral inward like water down a drain, eventually falling into the star and leaving nothing in the disk from which to make planets.Because planets obviously exist, something must be missing from this picture.Vortices, this latest work suggests, might be that missing something.[Vortices] gather material, Lyra says.Its like tea leaves in a teacup.As you stir tea leaves in a teacup, the tea leaves will concentrate in the center of a cup.Through this process dust can reach the critical densities required to gravitationally collapse to form a planetesimal.Once planetesimals form, the rest of the process is straightforward: the planetesimals clump together to form protoplanets that are somewhere between the moon and Mars in size, and these in turn coalesce into full-sized planets.Lyra describes this as a planet formation factory, a conveyor belt for making planets containing upwards of 10 Earth masses of material.In this model, vortices not only manufacture planetesimals to be used to make planetsthey can also make fully fledged planets themselves.Based on its age, he says, our own Mars may have formed in a vortex.Once a planet forms and leaves a vortex, it frees [the vortex] to form another planet, Lyra explains.We modeled this process, and we get hundreds of moon-sized and dozens of Mars-sized planets that later coalesce to form a couple of Earth-sized and super-Earth-sized planets.To fully verify this model, the unseen planet needs to be found.Kraus and his team are already pursuing follow-up observations to do just that.The hope is that this future work will finally reveal the planet, completing their picture of the system and providing crucial evidence for a key step in planet formation.Its like several pieces of a puzzle just fitting together really nicely [so] you can see the picture, Kraus says.But the one puzzle piece where the planet should be is still missing.
Could a Machine Identify Suicidal Thoughts?:::::Despite decades of effort, it has proven frustratingly difficult to predict who is most at risk of dying by suicide.Relying on patients to reveal their intentions doesnt work.Nearly 80 percent of those who die by suicide hide their suicidal thoughts from doctors and therapists during their last visits.Yet suicide rates are increasing among middle-aged Americans and it is the second-leading cause of death for young people.Thats why researchers have been urgently searching for a reliable biological predictor of suicidal thoughts and behavior.A report published this week in Nature Human Behaviour suggests an intriguing new possibility.The study combined neural imaging with machine learning to explore whether the brains of suicidal people respond differently to positive and negative words related to life and death.It turns out they do, says co-author Matthew Nock, a clinical psychologist at Harvard University.We can predict with a pretty surprising degree of accuracy whos had thoughts of suicide and who hasntand even among those with thoughts of suicide, who has made an attempt and who hasnt.Although the study was small, the findings are remarkable, says Barry Horwitz, chief of the Brain Imaging and Modeling Section at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, who wrote a commentary that accompanies the study.Horwitz was particularly impressed by the techniques ability to correctly classify the nine out of 17 suicidal subjects who had made attempts at taking their own lives, a group experts say are as difficult to find as needles in a haystack.Its hard to imagine any other method or risk factor allowing you to make that kind of distinction, Horwitz says.Earlier this year, machine learning was reported to detect suicide risk based on health records with 80 to 90 percent accuracyconsidered an encouraging result.But this new study stands out because it reveals a potential biological marker for suicidal thinking.Its not just a reported behavior, says co-author Marcel Just, a cognitive neuroscientist at Carnegie Mellon University, we get the actual thoughts they have about suicide, and we see how theyre altered.The study joined two separate lines of research.Nock had previously used implicit association tests to determine suicide risk.For example, he paired words related to death and life with like me and not like me.Suicidal people were about three times more likely to respond more quickly than controls when death and me were paired.That result has been replicated repeatedly, and has proven to be a relatively strong predictor of suicidal thoughts and behavior compared to other approaches such as medical assessments.Meanwhile, Just has been using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look inside the mind.We can see the pattern that corresponds to thoughts, he says.His technique, known as neuro-semantics, recognizes not words but concepts.In response to the sentence the old man threw a stone into a lake, for example,brain activation patterns indicate that a person is involved, that movement occurs, and that theres an outdoor setting in the visualized scene.In separate studies, Just asked subjects (they were method actors) to conjure up emotions such as anger and jealousy, and found recognizable patterns for each.Emotions have neural signatures, Just says.We have an archive of them on our computers.When Just read about Nocks research, he wondered if he could see the thoughts of suicidal people in his scanner.First, the researchers asked a machine learning classifier, which tries to find predictive measures for specific outcomes, if it could distinguish between 17 subjects who had thought about suicide and 17 who had not.Inside the fMRI scanner, participants were asked to think about a series of words related to suicide and specific positive and negative thoughts and feelings.(The most significant proved to be death, trouble, carefree, cruelty, praise, and good.)After measuring the neural patterns of response, the researchers trained the machine on data for 33 out of 34 subjects.They then asked the machine to determine whether the mystery subject was suicidal or not.The classifier accomplished this task with 91 percent accuracy, correctly identifying 15 out of 17 suicidal subjects and 16 out of 17 controls.In a second phase of the study, the researchers used Justs archive of emotional signatures to assess how much of each of four emotionsanger, shame, sadness and pridewas associated with each word.The classifier could tell whether someone was in the suicidal or the control group by how much of each emotion was evoked, says Just.Death evoked more sadness and shame among the suicidal ideators.The classification based on these emotional neural signatures was 87 percent accurate in predicting suicidal thoughts.In response to death-related words, suicidal people activated more areas of the brain associated with self-referential thinking.That was consistent with previous findings, Nock says.But the emotional response to words like carefree or trouble, was a surprise.People who think about suicide have patterns that suggest less pride when the word carefree was shown, and more shame when the word death was shown, says Nock.Theres this emotional component about how people are thinking about themselves that we hadnt identified before.Other suicidologists say the idea of using neural signatures to predict suicide risk is promising, but stress how preliminary the study is.These results leave open many questions about the mechanisms at work and the clinical implications given the intensive nature of the task and the expense of fMRI, says Alexis May, a clinical psychologist at the University of Utah, who was not involved with the research.The studys authors agree.They hope first to replicate the study and then to investigate the techniques clinical viability, perhaps through adopting another technique, electroencephalography or EEG, which monitors brain electrical activity.While its clearly of scientific interest to better understand the brains of suicidal people, it remains to be seen if the method is realistically useful.If you can get good prediction using a three-minute behavioral test, why spend a thousand dollars to put someone in a scanner?Nock says.What were doing is seeing if these approaches give us a different piece of the puzzle.
Conservative Hunters and Fishers May Help Determine the Fate of National Monuments:::::This past spring Pres.Donald Trump ordered a review of more than two dozen national monuments, calling the protected status of these lands an egregious abuse of federal power.The review included New Mexicos Rio Grande del Norte, Katahdin Woods and Waters in Maine and the controversial Bears Ears in Utah.The usual environmental organizations and many Democrats excoriated Trump, of course.But this time some of the fury is coming from a less-expected quarter: hunters and anglers.Sportsmen and sportswomen dont tend to fit the tree-hugger stereotype that many conservatives ridicule; a plurality of them lean right in the voting booth.Yet many strongly support preserving wilderness areas so they can use them to hunt and fish, and public lands such as national monuments often grant access to thriving wildlife.Hunting and fishing groups have become increasingly politically active in recent yearsan important development, since many of their members make up a significant part of the Republican base.Now that Republicans control Congress and the White House, hunting and fishing enthusiasts ideas about conservation may start to shape environmental policy more than in the past.So what does their influence look like in the Trump era?And could they sway issues like the national monuments review?Hunters and anglers in the U.S. can trace their conservation ethic back more than a century.Sport hunting was an elite activity, and the elite enforced hunting regulations to cut down on the game killed [commercially], and to set up preserves for themselves, explains Thomas Dunlap, a professor emeritus of environmental history at Texas A&M University.Hunters were important, though not the only factor, in the development of conservation.Their modern-day counterpartsincluding U.S.Interior Secretary Ryan Zinkeoften evoke the memory of Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican whom many consider the conservation president.A lifelong hunter, Roosevelt established protections for about 230 million acres of public land during his tenure in office from 1901 to 1909.He also signed into law the Antiquities Act, which gives presidents power to create national monuments.Today many of the more than 40 million hunters and fishers in the U.S. still believe in this ethicand many of them also identify with the political right.Our ranks are traditionally conservative, says Land Tawney, leader of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers.According to a national poll, 42 percent of hunters and fishers are Republicans, versus 32 percent as independents and 18 percent as Democrats.In terms of ideology, 50 percent consider themselves conservative, 37 percent moderate, and 10 percent liberal.The poll, conducted for the National Wildlife Federation, also found that most sportsmen and women see themselves as conservationists.Even for the most hardcore duck hunters, I still think the conservation mission drives them, says Rogers Hoyt, president of Ducks Unlimited.Hunters and fishermen are true environmentaliststhey enjoy using the resource, and believe in taking care of the resource.Tawney says his organizations efforts are all aimed towards an end goal: having access to our public lands, and fish and wildlife habitat once you get there.Hunting and fishing enthusiasts spend significant amounts of money and effort on conservation as well.Hoyt points to initiatives such as the Federal Duck Stamp program, which have long brought in revenue to protect wildlife and habitats, as have revenues from other hunting and fishing licenses and taxes.According to the U.S.Fish & Wildlife Service, hunters pay for the majority of wildlife conservation efforts in most states through stamps, tags, and licenses.Many sporting organizations devote substantial funds to promoting environmental issues as wellDucks Unlimited, for example, has spent millions of dollars conserving wetlands.What's more conservative than stewarding our resources so we have them when we need them?That's planning today for tomorrowthat's fundamentally conservative, says Steve Kline, a Republican and hunter who works for the non-profit Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership (TRCP).We are in a place now where conservation issues have become incredibly partisan, and I think that's unnecessary.Other conservative hunters and fishers echoed these views.The best word is stewardship, says Andy Rasmussen, a lifelong Republican and fisherman, and a field coordinator for Trout Unlimited in Utah.Its a conservation ethicyou need to be able to have these [public resources and public lands] managed sustainably, so that future generations can use them.John Cornell, a Republican, hunter and New Mexico field representative for the TRCP, sees such an outlook as an inherent part of what he does.Ive always been a sportsman, and have always been a conservationist by being a sportsman, he says.After Trump announced his administrations review of national monuments, several major hunting and fishing and conservation groups sent a joint letter to the president, asking him not to repeal any of the monument designations.And as Zinke worked through the review this summer, those same groups and others waged a public campaign against changes to the monument designations.They sent letters, voiced their support for monuments on social media, ran ads critical of the review and met with Zinke about the issue.National monuments matter deeply to many hunters and fishers.A country-wide poll by TRCP and research firm Public Opinion Strategies found that 77 percent of Republicans and 80 percent of Democrats supported preserving the existing national monuments that allow hunting and fishing.Nearly all of the monuments in Zinkes review currently offer access to both.Sporting organizations say monument designations are important because they safeguard those lands from future mining, oil and gas drilling, and other forms of development.Despite this rare but solid patch of common ground, conservative hunters and fishers still tend to see themselves as fundamentally different in their philosophy than the standard liberal environmentalistmany support natural resource development and view themselves as active managers of the land, rather than preservationists.There are not a lot of sportsmen who want to preclude oil and gas development [in general], Rasmussen explains.A lot of workers out in the oil fields are hunting and fishing in their time off.Yet national monument lands and other conserved public lands are largely seen by sportsmen as off-limits to development.Sportsmen want to make sure that within the monument, habitat is protected, says Cornell, who hunts in the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument in New Mexico (one of the monuments reviewed by Zinke).We dont want to see those areas opened up to industry.But of course, they say that any national monument designations must also guarantee access to hunting and fishing.The hunting and fishing community is especially concerned that if the Trump administrations review rescinds or shrinks the boundaries of any national monuments, it will set a dangerous precedent.Currently U.S. presidents use the 1906 Antiquities Act to designate national monuments; it remains unclear whether this act gives them the power to undo such protections ordered by past presidents.Hunting and fishing organizations fear that if this administration does so it will open a door for future ones to do the same.An attack on one monument is an attack on them all, Land Tawney says.Even though hunters and anglers make up a large voting bloc, it has not always translated to the policy they want to see.The problem is that our community hasnt been necessarily well represented by our elected leaders, says Whit Fosburgh, president and CEO of the TRCP.Everybody likes to pay lip service to [us].The reason, he explains, is that the hunting and fishing community has not typically held politicians accountable when they vote against its interests.Our community is to blame for it, he says.Id say [the community] has a lot of power, but it is [largely] untapped, Tawney says.We could be getting more done if people were more aggressive.But its a sensitive subject, how politically active you should be.Cornell thinks this is changing.We have to be more political than weve been, or well lose ground, he says.It used to be enough to buy a license and find a place a place to hunt, but now weve had to up our game.Rasmussen agrees.For so long, these groups just didnt play in the policy arena, he says.[Now] sportsmen have a growing political influence.He notes that eight years ago, Trout Unlimited didn't have anybody in state legislaturesbut in 2017 the organization had dedicated representatives in every western legislature, working directly with them.Thats [now] typical across the board for sportsmen's groups, he says.TRCP says that people who hunt or fish also tend to turn out to vote more than the average American, making them a potentially more influential force in electionsfor Republicans in particular.Just last February Rep. Jason Chaffetz (a Republican from Utah) withdrew legislation to transfer millions of acres of federal land to state ownership after facing immense opposition to the move, including from the hunting and fishing community.In an Instagram post showing Chaffetz in the woods, dressed in camo and holding his dog, he wrote, I'm a proud gun owner, hunter and love our public lands, adding that groups I support and care about fear [the bill] sends the wrong message.Chris Wood, president and CEO of Trout Unlimited, says his group has seen similar successes in states including Utah, Wyoming, and Nevada.Our members were able to help convince legislators that [transferring public lands] was a bad idea, he says.When it comes to the national monuments, though, not all hunting and fishing groups have decided to enter the political fray.Ducks Unlimited has declined to take a stance.And not all hunters and fishers support national monuments; some believe the land could be conserved in a better way, without government involvement.Sportsmen arent a monolith, says John Freemuth, a professor of public policy at Boise State University, who specializes in public lands.The number one thing that concerns sportsmen is access.Many of them are environmentalists, but some of them aren't.This August Zinke sent Trump a report of his national monuments review.At first only a general summary of the report was made public, without Zinkes specific recommendations for the president.But the report acknowledged that when the Interior Department invited public input on the review, the majority of the 2.8 million comments it received favored keeping existing monuments as they are.Shortly afterward, a draft of Zinkes detailed report to the president was leaked to the media.It revealed that the Interior Secretary had suggested cutting boundaries or reducing restrictions on seven of the land-based monuments and three of the marine monuments: Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante in Utah; Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks and Rio Grande Del Norte in New Mexico; Oregons Cascade-Siskiyou; Nevadas Gold Butte; Katahdin Woods and Waters in Maine; Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument; Pacific Remote Island Marine National Monument; and Rose Atoll Marine National Monument.Various hunting and fishing organizations expressed deep disappointment in Zinkes recommendations.But those recommendations are not finalthe president will ultimately decide what happens to these monuments.Outdoor organizations do not know what to expect next, since Trump is notoriously unpredictable.But, says Chris Wood of Trout Unlimited, it seems like so far they're not paying attention to what we care about.Just last month, Rep.Rob Bishop (a Republican from Utah) introduced a bill to overhaul the Antiquities Act, which would significantly limit the presidents power to designate national monuments.And last Friday, Trump reportedly told Sen. Orrin Hatch (also a Utah Republican) that he would shrink the boundaries of Bears Ears National Monument.Whether conservatives in Congress and the White House realize it or not, these may turn out to be risky moves.Since many hunters and fishers count themselves as part of the Republican base and number in the tens of millions, [they are] a huge voting bloc, and something that politicians and the administration need to pay attention to, Tawney says.Wood puts it more bluntly: We will ensure the voices of sportsmen and sportswomen are heard throughout, he says.They ignore us at their political peril.
AI Scans Twitter for Signs of Opioid Abuse:::::As opioid abuse tightens its grip on the U.S., a team of medical researchers is combing social media for clues to better understand this major public health problem.Using artificially intelligent software they developed to analyze tweets and related geographic information, the researchers found Twitter to be a particularly reliable data source for pinpointing where the situation is at its worst.With about 500 million messages posted to the microblogging site daily, such an approach could help alert local health officials so they can gather funding or other resources to tackle the issue.Drug overdoses (most involving illegal heroin and prescription opioids) killed more than 64,000 people in the U.S. in 2016, up 21 percent from the previous year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (pdf).Deaths attributed to the abuse of fentanyl (the painkiller blamed for pop star Princes overdose death last year) more than doubled from 2015 to 2016, and more sobering data is expected after health organizations have time to gather it.That lag time in collecting information is one of the major factors that make opioid abuse particularly hard to address.The researchers wanted to know whether analyzing tweet text could help them estimate the location and relative prevalence of prescription opioid misuse as accurately as established epidemiologic studiessuch as the National Survey on Drug Usage and Health (NSDUH)in a fraction of the time.Traditional medical research like the NSDUH can take years to complete and publish.But the team thought Twitter messages might provide an early warning system that could prompt more immediate action, such as localized public health campaigns.We found that our estimates agreed with [NSDUH] data, suggesting that social media can be a reliable additional source of epidemiological data regarding substance use, says Michael Chary, a resident physician in emergency medicine at New YorkPresbyterian/Queens Hospital.We can analyze social media to canvass larger segments of the general population and potentially yield timely insights.Charys research team comprised medical professionals in New York City, New Jersey and Brigham Young University in Utah as well as a Brigham computer scientist.Publicly searchable Twitter, in particular, offers several advantages for digital epidemiologythe incidence, distribution and possible control of health threatsaccording to the study (pdf), published recently in the Journal of Medical Toxicology.Twitter users tend to write frequent, short messages on a wide variety of topics, and they often indicate their location and other demographic information.Theres a confessional effect, Chary says.People may discuss or reveal things on social media that, when directly asked, they may not.There may be a level of candor there thats not present in the emergency room or internists office.The researchers developed custom software to analyze tweets for possible references to drug use or abuse.The software relied on AI to quickly search more than 3.6 million tweets, and to identify words and phrasesincluding dope, percs, white, TNT and Captain Codylikely referring to opioid consumption.Further examination of the tweets revealed additional details: for example, that fentanyl can go by the term dummies.Codeine translates into syrup or Tango and Cash.Armed with this knowledge of the softwares algorithms, the team then identified word-use patterns that distinguished tweets referring specifically to drug misuse from those describing, say, breakfast (in the case of syrup).The tweets most likely referring to a substance abuse problem were flagged.The researchers validated the softwares ability to distinguish by comparing word use in those messages with a list of opioid-related keywords curated by a medical toxicologist and an emergency physician.The studys findings were similar to NSDUH state-by-state estimates of prescription opioid misuse, especially among people 18 to 25 years old.That is likely because, according to Pew Research Center, 36 percent of Twitter users are between the ages of 18 and 29.Following established medical research protocols, the researchers kept the data they collected anonymousindividual tweeters could not be identified.That worked well for the purposes of their study, although they acknowledge it would not be difficult to trace a tweet back to a particular Twitter user profile if a government or law enforcement agency wanted to conduct a similar study.Twitter data is high-volume and the content is short-form, brief statements [that] are easier to classify than very long and complex statements, says Michael Gilbert, a Portland, Ore.based epidemiologist and social media researcher not involved in Charys research.The combination of the volume of data and the format of the data makes Twitter suitable for machine-learning tools.Are people talking about getting high, controlling pain or some other motivation that is underlying a common behavior?People are more likely to share certain types of information with their peers than they will with their health care providers.Chary and his team are not the only researchers studying opioid abuse who have used machine-learning techniques to study Twitter.A group led by Tim Mackey, director of the University of California, San Diegos Global Health Policy Institute, examined the social media site for five months in 2015 to identify entities illegally selling prescription opioids online.Their software detected 1,778 posts marketing the sale of controlled substances90 percent included hyperlinks to online sites for purchase.The American Journal of Public Health published their findings earlier this month.Still, despite the familiarity and openness that Twitter offersor perhaps because of itthe platform is not always a reliable source of data.Conversations on Twitter cover so many topics that identifying messages relevant to a particular study can be challenging.This kind of research is still nascent, says Nikki Adams, an assistant research scientist at the University of Maryland, College Parks Center for Advanced Study of Language.Tweets are short, and this does impact the quality of machine learning.Theres not much context.If you are investigating one topic, you might have a lot of noise around your data.Chary acknowledges Twitters shortcomings as a data source, including the large amount of irrelevant data that must be analyzed to get to anything meaningful as well as the demographic limitations of the platforms user base.This work is most useful in capturing trends, he says.We all agree there is a problem with opioid use.Its very difficult to conduct these federal surveys at any scale with the frequency needed to say, Over the last three months drug use in this particular location is going up.Whats going on here?The clues are therewhats needed are the right tools to find them.
Magnificent Microscopy: Capturing the Hidden Beauty of the “Microenvironment”:::::Hidden within the world we see are many others we cannot.Every year scientists, photographers and hobbyists capture enchanting stories that secretly unfold among seemingly mundane objects in the microenvironment for the annual Nikon Small World photomicrography competition.Out of this years 2,000-plus photo entries from 88 countries, Nikon recently announced the top 20 winners, along with 10 honorable mentions and 58 images of distinction.Participants could submit photographs of anything from green algae to credit cards, as long as they were taken with some form of light microscope such as phase contrast, confocal or fluorescence.The judges based their picks on originality, aesthetics, technical skill and informational content.The first place winnerwhich netted a $3,000 prizeis a photo of a fluorescently glowing human skin cell.Other winners give us an idea of what it might be like to shrink and perch atop a flower or capture what looks like an aerial view of roads: a neural network paved to support our racing thoughts.The following slide show features a selection of images that either won prizes or was given honorable mention in the contest.
Confronting Sexual Harassment in Science:::::If anyone thought scientists were somehow different from ordinary peoplenobler, more ethical, more purethen events over the past two years have been a sharp wake-up call.As with just about any area of human endeavor where men hold the lions share of power, the world of science and technology is plagued by sexual harassment.Women in STEM fields have long known this, of course.But just as in Hollywood, where the predatory behavior of producer Harvey Weinstein was long whispered about but never discussed openly, the phenomenon of professors and researchers hitting on undergrads, grad students, postdocs and colleagues has mostly been hushed upnot only by victims fearing retaliation but also by institutions determined to keep their good name untarnished and their superstars happy.But thanks to a handful of (mostly) female scientists who have been brave enough to speak out and name names, the conspiracy of silence has become impossible to ignore in this publicity-driven age.A sea change has swept through sciences highest ranks, forcing institutions across the country to take more visible and aggressive actions to crack down on unacceptable conduct, push for improvements in the classroom and the workplace, and encourage victims of harassment to come forward.Ive asked myself, Why did it take until now for all of this to come out?I find it totally appalling that it has taken this long for all of these women to feel comfortable coming forward, says geophysicist Marcia McNutt, the first woman president of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.In one of the strongest statements to date on the seriousness of such behavior, the 60,000-member American Geophysical Union adopted an updated 33-page Scientific Integrity and Professional Ethics policy in September that for the first time defines harassment as scientific misconduct.This puts it on equal footing with fabrication, falsification and plagiarism in a research environment, AGU President Eric Davidson, President-elect Robin Bell and past-President Margaret Leinen said in announcing the new policy.We have broken new ground that takes this issue to a new level of importance.It is already having a ripple effect in terms of broadening the discussion in the scientific community, Davidson added in an interview The AGU is also part of a new collaborative research project, funded by a $1.1-million, four-year grant from the National Science Foundation Foundation, that will update the teaching of research ethics by addressing sexual harassment as scientific misconduct.Led by University of WisconsinMadison researcher Erika Marn-Spiotta, the project will produce more effective training materials in Earth, space and environmental sciences that may serve as a model for other STEM fields.This includes development of tested bystander intervention workshops to help academic leaders respond to and prevent sexual harassment.There is limited data on the effectiveness of existing training programs and a sense that many were designed primarily to meet legal liability concerns.These efforts are among a host of recent efforts to combat sexual harassment in science, including major revisions of sexual harassment and ethics policies at universities and other scientific institutions; more research documenting the extent of the problem; and, hardest of all, the ongoing challenge to create a more welcoming culture for women in male-dominated research disciplines.One of the most prominent efforts is a two-year study under way for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, which provides guidance to public and private institutions on issues of critical importance to science.A 21-member committee is examining the impact of sexual harassment in academia on the career advancement of women in the scientific, technical and medical workforce.It has commissioned research to conduct detailed interviews with women science faculty who have experienced sexual harassment and has also held a series of workshops around the country.The committee expects to issue a comprehensive report by mid-2018 The cause clbre for sexual harassment in science was the revelation two years ago of shocking charges against world-renowned University of California, Berkeley, astronomer Geoffrey Marcy, whose pioneering exploration of exoplanets was considered Nobel Prizeworthy.An October 9, 2015, investigative story in the online media outlet BuzzFeed News reported that a leaked report of a six-month university investigation revealed four female students alleged Marcy had repeatedly engaged in inappropriate physical behavior between 2001 and 2010, including unwanted massages, kisses and groping.The controversy forced Marcy to step down from his university post (Marcy wrote an open letter apologizing for his actions).It also led to disclosure of other sexual harassment cases at Berkeley, changes in leadership and pressure for more aggressive action at not only Berkeley but throughout the U.C.system.Weve made a lot of progress over the past two years, U.C.Berkeley Chancellor Carol T. Christ, the first female to hold the post, said in an interview.Were setting a tone at the top that there is zero tolerance for sexual harassment in the workplace, classroom, or in the laboratory.Christ, a former president of the all-women Smith College, named a special faculty adviser, reporting directly to her, to lead campus efforts against sexual violence, sexual harassment and gender-based discrimination.Earlier a 15-member university task force drew up recommendations that include a streamlined investigation process, more transparent monitoring and accountability, improved training and better care for survivors.The Marcy revelations had a domino effect across the country, triggering widespread publicity about other alleged cases of sexual harassment by well-known male scientists in numerous fields including a California Institute of Technology astrophysicist, a University of Chicago molecular biologist, a University of Washington microbiologist and an American Museum of Natural History paleoanthropologist..More recently, Boston University has been investigating formal complaints by two former graduate students that geologist David R. Marchant allegedly abused and belittled them, physically and verbally, on research expeditions at a remote Antarctic field research site starting two decades ago, according to Science Magazine, which broke the story in early October.Major media outlets such as The Boston Globe, Washington Post, and the Atlantic have since covered the story.One of the complainants, Geologist Jane K. Willenbring, now a Scripps Institution of Oceanography associate professor, reportedly waited to file her October, 2016 complaint until after she got tenure, fearing professional repercussions.But she has now gone public, including tweets (@jkwillenbring) on media coverage of sexual harassment scandals in science and the entertainment industry.When asked to comment for this story, Marchant replied by email: "As you know, Boston Universitys investigation into these allegations is ongoing.I have cooperated fully in that investigation.I do not wish to compromise the integrity of that investigation by making any comments before the investigation has been completed."A prominent case at the University of Rochester in New York state, meanwhile, involves sexual harassment complaints filed in late August with the U.S.Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) by eight current and former members of the universitys Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences.They accused T. Florian Jaeger, a professor in the department, of a long pattern of sexually predatory behavior and also contended the university has retaliated against Jaegers accusers.Two earlier university investigations concluded the allegations against him did not violate the law or university policy.Mother Jones broke the story in September and local and national media outlets like The New York Times followed up.Widespread publicity, reaction among alums and campus protests, including a students hunger strike, spurred the Universitys board of trustees to take action.It appointed a committee to oversee an independent, comprehensive investigation into the EEOC complaints and the universitys sexual harassment procedures.Jaeger is on administrative leave pending the outcome.According to the Times, Jaeger told the Rochester faculty that his accepting the leave was in no way an admission of guilt with respect to the allegations publicized about me.These big stories in science have served to increase public awareness of this problem.Its not as if the problem didnt exist before, says BuzzFeeds prize-winning science reporter Azeen Ghorayshi, who broke the initial Marcy story and has tenaciously pursued numerous sexual harassment cases since then.After the Marcy revelations, it snowballed and more people came forward, in part because they felt let down by their institutions, Ghorayshi says.THE PREVALENCE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT Vindicating the experiences of many women scientists, studies across a variety of settingsfrom campuses to companiesconfirm the prevalence of sexual harassment of all forms is high.Research presented at a two-day workshop of the National Academies Committee on Women in Science, Engineering and Medicine found that somewhere in the range of 40 to 70 percent of women had experienced sexual harassment during their careers or as students.This range of prevalence was strikingly consistent across different studies.Self-reporting in anonymous surveys makes it difficult to quantify sexual harassment with any certitude; only a small percentage of victims report sexual harassment, largely because of embarrassment, fear of not being believed and concern about retaliation by superiors.Sexual harassment is generally defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that tends to create a hostile or offensive work environment.It is worse when it is the boss, a faculty supervisor or teacher because a quid pro quo arrangement may be offered or implied.In the U.S. workplace discrimination, including sexual harassment, is prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which affects any federally funded education program or activity.(The Trump administration announced it is pulling back from Obama-era sexual harassment guidelines.)While not all individual complaints violate the law, many may violate workplace or academic codes of conduct.Most victims are female and perpetrators male, but sexual harassment also affects LGBTQ individuals and men victimized by women or other men.Cultural norms and individual perceptions also affect whether a given behavior is interpreted as unwelcome or hostile.DANGER ZONES IN SCIENCE To my mind, there are still bad neighborhoods ripe for sexual harassment.Dramatically tilted sex ratios in some fields signal a potential problem, says senior research social scientist Christopher Krebs of RTI International.Potential sexual harassment danger zones include field research; remote science sites such as observatories; isolated or smaller laboratories; professional travel and meetings; medical training; and predominantly male fields, according to research and interviews with scientists, graduate students and science educators.Double jeopardy.A recently published, internet-based survey of 474 astronomers and planetary scientists found women of color in this sample faced the greatest risk of feeling unsafe in their workplace due to gender (40 percent) and race (28 percent).Nearly 20 percent of women of color and 12 percent of white women scientists said they skipped professional events because they felt unsafe.Anthropologist Kathryn Clancy of the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign and colleagues concluded: Never has awareness of hostile workplace behaviors in the sciences been so strong, and the possibility for change so great.Field research.Another internet-based Survey of Academic Field Experiences (SAFE) conducted by Clancy reported widespread sexual harassment of students or trainees working in anthropology, archaeology and life science field research sites.Nearly two thirds of 666 field science respondents, mostly American women, said they had experienced sexual harassment, inappropriate or sexual remarks, or jokes about physical beauty and cognitive sex differences.More than 20 percent reported they had been sexually assaulted.Trainees were particularly vulnerable to harassment by senior managers or scientists.Medical training and practice.Nearly one in three women in medicine say they have experienced sexual harassment, compared with 4 percent of men, according to a 2016 study in JAMA The Journal of the American Medical Association.A 2015 compilation of surveys in Australia, the U.K., Sweden, Canada and the U.S., published in the The Medical Journal of Australia, found that sexual harassment in training or practice ranged from one quarter to three quarters of respondents.Fields with lower numbers of women.A University of Washington study in the journal Psychological Bulletin concluded that large gender gaps in disciplines such as computer science, engineering and physics may be related in part to more masculine cultures that signal a lower sense of belonging to women than men.Scientific travel and conferences.The informal atmosphere at professional meetings, particularly larger conferences with an ample supply of alcohol-fueled social gatherings, is another danger zoneparticularly for students and younger researchers looking for jobs.Scientific meetings have increasingly featured sexual harassment sessions for students, early-career scientists and senior professional leaders.A recent AGU meeting featured prominent anti-harassment signs, Safe AGU buttons, and a #SafeAGU social media campaign.If its unwanted, its harassment warn red-and-white signs posted at meetings of the American Astronomical Society (AAS), which recently strengthened its code of ethics and anti-harassment policies.Novel efforts such as Astronomy Allies have also provided a volunteer network of scientists to mentor or advocate for individuals who encounter sexual harassment.Whatever the setting or field of science, the modus operandi of sexual predators is often the same.One former Harvard University science graduate student recalled being hit on at a social event by a distinguished male scientist.After some initial research talk, the elder scientist began to say some inappropriate stuff, such as youre really smart and beautiful.I want to know more about you and, at one point, he hugged me.It was very uncomfortable, she recalled.SOME QUESTIONS GOING FORWARD The challenge ahead is how to move beyond rhetoric and individual cases to implement more effective strategies to combat sexual harassment and hasten womens advancement and equality in science.Success in doing so will be measured by how well the scientific community writ large responds to tough questions those on the front lines of anti-harassment efforts are asking.They include: Will publicity and punishment in egregious cases have a deterrent effect?Will stepped up efforts by professional science societies help shift the culture toward zero tolerance for sexual harassment?Will mandatory sexual harassment reporting to federal science funding agencies be instituted?Will federal funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation take more aggressive action by terminating funding to institutions that do not comply with Title IX nondiscrimination regulations?Will there be more transparency about sexual harassment cases, to the degree possible under privacy laws, to discourage job-hopping by sexual harassers who do not disclose their history to future employers?Will development and implementation of better training programs help prevention and reporting of sexual harassment?Will colleges and universities greatly improve their formal and informal systems for reporting and acting on sexual harassment complaints?Will more female scientists in leadership roles change the dynamics and add more clout in terms of preventing and handling sexual harassment in the workplace?Will more family-friendly policies help women in science move up the career ladder in academia, research or business?Will changes at the bottom create a female-friendly climate for science students in male-dominated fields that will help keep more women in science?Frustrated at the pace of change, three generations of women scientists are pushing hard to speed up efforts to reduce sexual harassment and gender discrimination in science.You get discouraged.You know the hill you are climbing is going to be steeper, says one 20-something Yale University physics graduate student.Says another, Its a cycle.We need more women, but we need to create a better environment to do that.Im inherently an optimist.On the one hand, theres been tremendous progress.But we clearly have not done enough, says Yale astrophysicist and former AAS president Meg Urry, a longtime champion of women in science.People feel the momentum right now.With more public attention to this issue, there are a huge number of radicalized people ready to move, ready to be loud, to change policies on sexual harassment, University of Illinioiss Clancy says.Accelerating efforts to combat sexual harassment takes on more urgency, given the national need to recruit and retain a diverse STEM workforce in the 21st century.To do so, the message to end gender discrimination and sexual harassment may indeed need to go viral to keep media attentionand public pressureon both individuals and institutions to create a more welcoming climate for women and minorities in the global science community of tomorrow.
We Are Still In: Local US Reps Stand for Climate Action in Bonn:::::This story originally appeared on the Guardian and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.Deep schisms in the US over climate change are on show at the UN climate talks in Bonnwhere two sharply different visions of Americas role in addressing dangerous global warming have been put forward to the world.Donald Trumps decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement has created a vacuum into which dozens of state, city and business leaders have leapt, with the aim of convincing other countries at the international summit that the administration is out of kilter with the American people.The counter-Trump movement in Bonn is being spearheaded by Jerry Brown, the governor of California, and Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York.Brown, in particular, has assumed the role of a de facto US leader, scheduling more than two dozen events to agitate for renewable energy and emissions cuts to combat what he has called an existential crisis.A US Climate Action Center has been set up for delegates in Bonn, representing the climate change priorities of several thousand US cities, states, tribes and businesses.Corporate giants Mars, Walmart and Citi are expected to push for action on climate change.The center is in lieu of an official US presencefor the first time, the US government wont have a pavilion at the annual UN climate summit.At the razzamatazz opening of the alternative US centre on Thursday, California state senator Ricardo Lara told the audience: Greetings from the official resistance to the Trump administration.Pausing for cheers and applause, he said: Lets relish being rebels.Despite what happens in DC, were still here.Guests were served free jelly donuts and coffee.Its the least we can do after Trumps announcement that we are leaving, said one US activist.At 2,500 square meters, the alternative US domewhich is marked with the hashtag #wearestillinis the biggest pavilion at the climate talks.Organizers say it is probably the biggest for any US group in the history of climate conference.Its nice that its hard to miss.This is big because our movement is big, said one of the organisers, Lou Leonard of WWF.Here we show energy, momentum and confidence.It would slow negotiations down if people in the halls were thinking the US is not with them.Following recent decisions by Nicaragua and Syria to join the Paris pact, the US stands alone as the only country in the world to oppose the deal.The US is now split and world opinion is going with the state and local players, rather than the federal player, said Jonathan Pershing, who was the US governments special envoy on climate change until last year.The US is at odds with every other country in the world and yet we see it represented by a federal government as well as competing governors, mayors and members of Congress.It reflects an enormous tension in the US political system over climate change.The Trump administration has sent a delegation to Bonn, with the US still officially engaged in implementing the Paris deal until it is able to exit in 2020.Thomas Shannon, an experienced state department diplomat who has previously voiced concern about climate change, is leading the US delegation, assisted by Trigg Talley, who was Pershings deputy.The White House has confirmed that the US will promote the efficient use of coal, nuclear energy and natural gas as an answer to climate change in a presentation to delegates in Bonn.Trump has vowed to revive Americas ailing coal sector but this message is likely to to provoke outrage on the global stage.It will raise hackles, said Pershing.Its not an argument that people will accept internationally.Differences may sharpen next week when countries start to discuss financing plans, but so far observers say it has mostly been business as usual.We are seeing 196 parties trying to move forward and put the Paris accord into effect.They dont want to let the US impede that progress, said David Waskow of the World Resources Institute.But participants from other nations said the change is already apparent.Its as though the US negotiators have been dipped in aspic, said one delegate.They are scared stiff of upsetting the White House.They try to be constructive, but they dont want that known.Another delegate said: We have lost the leadership the US used to provide.They have the best negotiating team and they are usually put forward strong arguments, but in talks this year, they have been quiet.You can feel they are a little lost.It must be so hard for them now.I sympathise.I think its all going to be a little awkward, said Sue Biniaz, a former state department official who was the lead US lawyer at climate negotiations for two decades.In the past the US was the leader and brought a lot of ideas to the table.That will be a loss.But other countries, rightly or wrongly, think the US may stay in under some circumstances so I wouldnt expect too much hostility.A coalition of 14 US states, including California and New York, have said they are on track to meet the US target of a 26 to 28 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, compared to 2005 levels.The goal was set by Barack Obamas administration as part of the Paris agreement between 195 nations to avoid dangerous global warming of more than 2C.Brown has raised his profile in recent months by meeting Chinas leadership to discuss clean energy technology and becoming a special adviser for states and regions during the Bonn talks.On Tuesday, he met EU leaders in Brussels as a prelude to talks on how to link Californias cap and trade emissions system with the similar emissions mechanism used by the 28-state bloc.California has a legislated goal to cut its emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.We are truly facing a challenge unprecedented in human history, Brown said in a speech to the European parliament.We have to completely transform to a zero-carbon world.We have to do it faster than most people are probably thinking about.2050 is too late.In a nod to the clout of large US states, Brown later included two of them when naming countries that could do more on climate change the United States, Texas, California, Russia, India.European leaders welcomed Browns words.The approach of Mr. Trump is not necessarily as helpful as it might be.But we are delighted to have Governor Brown here because it shows there is a strong commitment from the US, said Antonio Tajani, the president of the European parliament.However, governors such as Brown or Andrew Cuomo, his New York counterpart, cannot officially take the place of the US president in UN climate talks.Their emissions pledges do not supersede the official US position and, in any case, the 14 committed states only have influence over around half of total US emissions.Analysts have warned that without national leadership, the US is in danger of missing its emissions reduction goals and will jeopardize international efforts to stave off 2C of warming, which would lead to elevated sea level rise, intensified droughts, heatwaves and wildfires.Brian Schatz, a Democratic senator from Hawaii who is attending the Bonn talks, said members of Congress, including Republicans, were concerned over how the withdrawal has hurt Americas standing in the world.If you show up at a climate conference to talk about coal, youre likely to be ignored, he said.I think the We Are Still In delegation will get more attention than the executive branch.Weve gone from the indispensable leader to being the only country not engaged in climate change.Many people in Congress are troubled not only from a climate standpoint but a geopolitical standpoint.China is happy to take that leadership from us.
How Andy Weir Scienced the Lunar Colony in His New Book Artemis:::::In Elon Musks fever dreams, were already looping around the moon in spaceships.And possibly even vacationing in an elaborate lunar colony like the one Andy Weir imagines in his new novel, Artemis.Being Weirhe of the meticulously researched space-survival thriller The Martianyou know he just had to science the shit out of it.On picking a setting thats more realistic than Mars: I wanted to choose the most likely location for the first off-Earth settlement.You can have shipping and trade with the moon, as well as tourism.Traveling there would be like going from Europe to North America in the 1800s: Its a trek, but realistically the journey only takes about a week.On oxygenating the Artemis colony: Eighty-five percent of the rocks on the surface of the lunar highlands are anorthite, which contains aluminum as well as a massive supply of oxygen.Smelting aluminum in the quantities necessary to construct and maintain Artemis would produce so much excess oxygeneight atoms for every two of aluminumthat they would be constantly venting it.On travel costs: Lets say, based on my calculations, it costs $7,020 to get a human body to the orbital space station, including luggage.But for every kilogram of payload, you need an additional 3.73 kilos of fuel.So a one-way ticket to the moon comes out to about $33,000.On moon food, since potato farming isnt practical: If all food had to be imported from Earth, theres no way low-income workers could afford to eat.So my solution was gunk.Gunk is primarily chlorella, an algae that can be grown in baths.Its nutrient-rich and grows by doubling.Not necessarily delicious, though, so I created different flavorings, like tandoori chicken.This article appears in the November issue.Subscribe now.
Get Lost in This Visualization of Interconnected Global Issues:::::The best sources of information are organized according to what you want to know and how you wish to know it.Want some fresh perspective on humanity's place in the tree of life?I recommend the Hillis Plot, a circular map of evolutionary relationships between thousands of animal, botanical, and microbial species.If it's straight news you crave (RIP Google Reader), I use Feed.ly, personally, but I hear good things about Flipboard.Wikipedia is the place for overviews and preliminary research.Transformation Maps, a new platform developed by the World Economic Forum is a completely different sort of visualization, one that Ive never seen before.The Swiss nonprofit calls it a "dynamic knowledge tool," and it charts the interactions between dozens of industries, countries, and issues that shape the world.Climate change is on there.3D printing is, too.Social media, global governance, gender parity, cybersecurity, space, Chinathese and more than 100 other "insight areas" form the nodes in a responsive web of interconnections.Select "Artificial Intelligence and Robotics" from the forum's list of mapped insight areas, and watch the visualization spring to life.Your choice appears in the middle, the sun at the center of a hyper-nerdy solar system: World Economic Forum Orbiting it are a handful of related sub-topics the WEF has deduced are driving its change: machine learning and predictive systems, smart sensors and autonomous robotics, machine cooperation and coordination, and so on.Click any of the nodes on this inner ring to see how your original selection connects to nodes along an outer ring of other WEF-curated topics.Selecting a node from that outer ring generates an entirely different solar system, with your new topic at its center.Through this process of clicking, inspecting, and reshuffling, one comes to grok that shared resources/challenges/agendas/what-have-yous exist between urbanization and healthcare delivery, or cybersecurity and human rights, or blockchain technology and environmental sustainability.It's all rather stunning, visuallyreally fluid and engaging.The WEF wants users to play around with it to better understand the complex forces shaping the world in the early stages of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and to encourage people to think about solutions to the worlds problems.The effect on most users is likely to be more pseudo-philosophical: Can't you see everything's connected, man?But there's more to Knowledge Maps than pretty diagrams.In fact, the tool's utility becomes clear when you explore its less-mesmerizing features: a series of summaries and content feeds curated partly by humans and partly by machines.Paired with the topic at the center of each socio-political techno-nomic star system is a summary prepared by the WEF in collaboration with experts from around the world.(Nearly 1,000 sub-topicsthe nodes along the inner circlesget overviews, too.)The WEF composed the summaries on human rights, for instance, in collaboration with University of Oxford legal professor Miles Jackson; civic participation with the dean of UC Berkeley's school of public policy; and humanitarian action with members of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.World Economic Forum "A lot of companies have offered to help us curate issues, but we've made a conscious effort to only work with academic institutions, foundations, and international organizations," says WEF chief information and interaction officer Jeremy Jurgens, who oversees the forum's Knowledge Map platform."These obviously have biases, too, but at least they're not commercial biases."These experts also help the WEF curate news feeds tailored to each insight area.These include not only media outlets (like WIRED), but also peer-reviewed journals, law reviews, and think tanks like the Brookings Institution.An algorithm vets each source and its subject matter before deciding whether to feature its content, and which feed to put it in."So if youre the Journal of Infrastructure and Construction and you publish something on infrastructure, that'll pass straight through to the infrastructure feed.But if you're the Journal of Infrastructure and Construction and you write on artificial intelligence, the algorithm will tag it for review by an editor," Jurgens says.(On the day I speak with him, the tool's backend algorithms have reviewed more than 950 articles, generated a brief summary for each of them, and placed them all in their relevant feeds.)Unfortunately, the WEF has withheld some of the tool's coolest featuresincluding a "Dynamic Briefing" button that generates a multi-page dossier on a given subjectfrom the public release, although Jurgens says some of these may be available to paying users in the future.But even without these features, the WEF's Transformation Maps mix expert insight with smart visualization to produce what feels like a new and useful hybrid of existing knowledge repositories.They're holistic, like a Hillis Plot; extensive and human-curated, like Wikipedia; and up-to-the minute, like Flipboard.Or enthralling and illuminatinglike spying on the RSS feed of a polymathic friend with graphic design chops.
A Zombie Gene Protects Elephants From Cancer:::::Elephants and other large animals have a lower incidence of cancer than would be expected statistically, suggesting that they have evolved ways to protect themselves against the disease.A new study reveals how elephants do it: An old gene that was no longer functional was recycled from the vast genome junkyard to increase the sensitivity of elephant cells to DNA damage, enabling them to cull potentially cancerous cells early.Quanta Magazine About Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.In multicellular animals, cells go through many cycles of growth and division.At each division, cells copy their entire genome, and inevitably a few mistakes creep in.Some of those mutations can lead to cancer.One might think that animals with larger bodies and longer lives would therefore have a greater risk of developing cancer.But thats not what researchers see when they compare species across a wide range of body sizes: The incidence of cancer does not appear to correlate with the number of cells in an organism or its lifespan.In fact, researchers find that larger, longer-lived mammals have fewer cases of cancer.In the 1970s, the cancer epidemiologist Richard Peto, now a professor of medical statistics and epidemiology at the University of Oxford, articulated this surprising phenomenon, which has come to be known as Petos paradox.The fact that larger animals like elephants do not have high rates of cancer suggests that they have evolved special cancer suppression mechanisms.In 2015, Joshua Schiffman at the University of Utah School of Medicine and Carlo Maley at Arizona State University headed a team of researchers who showed that the elephant genome has about 20 extra duplicates of p53, a canonical tumor suppressor gene.They went on to suggest that these extra copies of p53 could account, at least in part, for the elephants enhanced cancer suppression capabilities.Currently, Lisa M. Abegglen, a cell biologist at the Utah School of Medicine who contributed to the study, is leading a project to find out whether the copies of p53 have different functions.Vincent Lynch, a geneticist at the University of Chicago, has shown that part of what enabled elephants to grow so big was that one of their pseudogenesa broken duplicate of an ancestral genesuddenly acquired a new function.Courtesy of Vincent J. Lynch Yet extra copies of p53 are not the elephants only source of protection.New work led by Vincent Lynch, a geneticist at the University of Chicago, shows that elephants and their smaller-bodied relatives (such as hyraxes, armadillos and aardvarks) also have duplicate copies of the LIF gene, which encodes for leukemia inhibitory factor.This signaling protein is normally involved in fertility and reproduction and also stimulates the growth of embryonic stem cells.Lynch presented his work at the Pan-American Society for Evolutionary Developmental Biology meeting in Calgary in August 2017, and it is currently posted on biorxiv.org.Lynch found that the 11 duplicates of LIF differ from one another but are all incomplete: At a minimum they all lack the initial block of protein-encoding information as well as a promoter sequence to regulate the activity of the gene.These deficiencies suggested to Lynch that none of the duplicates should be able to perform the normal functions of a LIF gene, or even be expressed by cells.The eminent biologist Richard Peto, now at the University of Oxford, pointed out in the 1970s that elephants and other large-bodied animals ought to be at great statistical risk for cancer.Cathy Harwood But when Lynch looked in cells, he found RNA transcripts from at least one of the duplicates, LIF6, which indicated that it must have a promoter sequence somewhere to turn it on.Indeed, a few thousand bases upstream of LIF6 in the genome, Lynch and his collaborators discovered a sequence of DNA that looked like a binding site for p53 protein.It suggested to them that p53 (but not any of the p53 duplicates) might be regulating the expression of LIF6.Subsequent experiments on elephant cells confirmed this hunch.To discover what LIF6 was doing, the researchers blocked the genes activity and subjected the cells to DNA-damaging conditions.The result was that the cells became less likely to destroy themselves through a process called apoptosis (programmed cell death), which organisms often use as a kind of quality control system for eliminating defective tissue.LIF6 therefore seems to help eradicate potentially malignant cells.Further experiments indicated that LIF6 triggers cell death by creating leaks in the membranes around mitochondria, the vital energy-producing organelles of cells.To find out more about the evolutionary history of LIF and its duplicates, Lynch found their counterparts in the genomes of closely related species: manatees, hyraxes and extinct mammoths and mastodons.His analysis suggested that the LIF gene was duplicated 17 times and lost 14 times during the evolution of the elephants lineage.Hyraxes and manatees have LIF duplicates, but the p53 duplicates appear only in living and extinct elephants, which suggests that the LIF duplications happened earlier in evolution.Elephants are closely related to large animals such as manatees (left), but also to smaller ones like hyraxes (right), aardvarks and armadillos.Elephants only began to develop their immense size about 30 million years ago.Jim P. Reid, USFWS / Bjrn Christian Trrissen Lynch found that most duplicates of the LIF gene are pseudogenesold, mutated, useless copies of genes that survive in the genome by chance.The exception, however, is the LIF6 gene sequence, which unlike the others has not accumulated random mutations, implying that natural selection is preserving it.We think that LIF6 is a refunctionalized pseudogene, Lynch said.That is, the elephant LIF6 re-evolved into a functional gene from a pseudogene ancestor.Because it came back from the dead and plays a role in cell death, Lynch called it a zombie gene.Although manatees and hyraxes also have extra copies of LIF, only modern and extinct elephants have LIF6, which suggests that it evolved only after the elephants branched away from those related species.And when Lynchs group dated the origin of LIF6 by molecular clock methods, they found that the pseudogene regained a function about 30 million years ago, when the fossil record indicates that elephants were evolving large body sizes.Lucy Reading-Ikkanda/Quanta Magazine Refunctionalizing a pseudogene is not something that happens every day, explained Stephen Stearns, an evolutionary biologist at Yale University, in an email to Quanta.Being able to show that it happened at roughly the same time that elephants evolved a large body, he wrote, supports, but does not prove, that the refunctionalizing of the gene was a precondition for the evolution of large body size.Evolving protections against cancer would seem to be in the interest of all animals, so why dont they all have a refunctionalized LIF6 gene?According to the researchers, its because this protection comes with risks.LIF6 suppresses cancer, but extra copies of LIF6 would kill the cell if they accidentally turned on.Theres a bunch of toxic pseudogenes sitting there in the genome, Lynch explained in an email.If they get inappropriately expressed, its basically game over.There also appears to be a trade-off between cancer suppression mechanisms and fertility.A study published in 2009 suggested that LIF is critical for implantation of the embryo in the uterus.Because LIF activity is controlled by p53, LIF and p53 jointly regulate the efficiency of reproduction.When the same set of genes has two functions (such as reproduction and cancer suppression), it is possible that those functions will be in direct conflicta phenomenon that geneticists call antagonistic pleiotropy.The elephants may have solved the problem of antagonistic pleiotropy by duplicating p53 and LIF and splitting up those functions, according to Maley.Some copies of p53 and LIF are doing whats necessary for fertility, while other pairs of LIF and p53 are doing whats necessary for cancer suppression, he said.Maley speculated that the gene duplicates allowed the elephants to get better at cancer suppression and still maintain their fertility, which would allow them to grow a larger body.That hypothesis, however, still needs to be tested, he said.Bats are not large animals, but some species live for decades.Scientists are investigating whether they have their own protective adaptations against cancer.Ann Froschauer, USFWS Evolving extra copies of p53 and LIF may have helped elephants overcome Petos paradox, but that cant be the only solution: Other large animals like whales have only one copy of p53 and one version of LIF.Lynch and his team are currently exploring how whales and bats solve Petos paradox.Although not large-bodied, some bat species live up to 30 years, and the longer-lived ones might have evolved cancer suppression mechanisms that the shorter-lived ones lack.Maley is also working on how whales solve Petos paradox.Even though whales dont have extra copies of p53, he said, we do think there has been a lot of selection and evolution on genes in the p53 pathway.Maley believes that understanding how diverse large-bodied animals solve Petos paradox may have applications in human health.That is the end goal, he said.The hope is that by seeing how evolution has found a way to prevent cancer, we could translate that into better cancer prevention in humans.Every organism that evolved large body size probably has a different solution to Petos paradox, Maley said.Theres a bunch of discoveries that are just waiting for us out there in nature, where nature is showing us the way to prevent cancer.Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.
Space Photos of the Week: Jupiter Takes One Hell of a Selfie:::::The Juno spacecraft recently completed its ninth orbit around Jupiter and returned images of the planets cloudy, cyclone-studded southern hemisphere.Saturns moon Enceladus is well known for its active plumes, and scientists just got a little closer to understanding what might be fueling them.A loose, porous core could be the answer.Gravity tugs at Enceladus as it orbits the ringed planet, creating friction and heat in its core that could power hydrothermal activity at the moon's surface.This series of images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope shows the "light echo" left behind by an exploding white dwarf.The white ring is light leftover from the star that is bouncing off a cloud of interstellar dust some 300-1600 light years away from site of the explosion.The pockmarked moon Pandora orbits Saturn near the planet's F-ring, creating small kinks in its shape.This was the final photo taken of Pandora by the Cassini spacecraft before it plunged into the planet on September 15th.Last week NASAs Solar Dynamics Observatory spotted a rare circular filament protruding from the sun.These filaments are made up of charged particles that are tethered to the star by a magnetic field, and usually take the shape of long strands.Circular filaments like this one have only been spotted a few times before.The dust surrounding stars like W Hydrae, seen here in an image taken by the ALMA Observatory in Chile, is richer in aluminium oxide than that surrounding other stars.In a recent study, scientists hypothesize these metallic particles may trigger rushes of solar wind.
All the Experiments Aboard Saturday's ISS Resupply Mission:::::At 7:37 am Eastern time on Saturday, a Cygnus cargo ship jam-packed with over three tons of crew supplies and hardware will blast toward the International Space Station atop Orbital ATKs Antares rocket.ISS resupply missions arent just about making sure astronauts never run out of toilet paper.(Those folks keep a six month stockpile of all necessities anyway, which is why it isnt a huge deal when the cargo ships ferrying their food and spacewalking equipment occasionallyor really, semi-regularlygo kaboom.)Where things really get interesting is in the research payloadsthe science catching a ride on an otherwise logistical launch.Deciding what gets to hitch a ride when requires ultra-careful preparation.Remember, cargo ship runs are like a giant game of space Tetrisexcept you have to control for three dimensions and mass.For non-essentials like research, cargo choices require NASA-wide deliberation.We have teams from every space agency that work to balance the flow of science to the International Space Station, says NASA spokesperson Dan Huot.They prioritize based on nuts and bolts like hardware availability, and squishier metrics like their relative importance in a given field.What bumps you up the pecking order?Directly addressing a human health concern, or a major technology demonstration, Huot says.Which doesn't mean that you have to be curing cancer to get onboard.(Although it helps.)Two of the experiments blasting off Saturday were designed by kids, part of a program that has high school and middle school teams compete for research space on the ISS."Inevitably, you do have some kids saying, 'We're going to cure cancer!'"says Michelle Lucas, founder and president of Higher Orbits, the non-profit running the program."But we focus on making sure they get really good science back."This time around, both winning teams focused on studying the impact of microgravity on small life forms: the middle schoolers on mealworm life and reproductive cycles, and the high schoolers on biological nitrogen fixation in microclover.(Admit it, you're impressed.)Adult projects range from enabling better DNA-monitoring aboard the ISSsee, cancer againto setting up a VR camera for a National Geographic special.But the real scientific heavy hitters of this launch are technology-demonstrating CubeSat missions, including two designed by the Aerospace Corporation.The first is the Optical Communications and Sensor Demonstration, which will demo CubeSats' laser communication capabilities.Lasers can be more tightly focused than radio frequencies, so you can transmit a whole lot more data100 times more, actuallywith the same amount of power and mass.It's a perfect match for tiny, economical CubeSats.The tricky part (besides developing the laser itself) was designing a system for highly accurate laser pointing."You can get high data rates by using a narrow beam, but if you miss the target, you're not going to see anything," says Richard Welles, senior scientist at Aero's Space Science Applications Laboratory.The Aerospace Corporation's second CubeSat leverages Welles' targeting system for an entirely different application."Rich and I came up with a concept of putting three very small commercially available cameras together to act as a little miniature weather satellite," says Dee Pack, a researcher in Aero's Remote Sensing Department.Thanks to that fancy targeting system, the camera array should be able to see things like wildfires, oil fields, and city lights at night with greater resolution than NASA and NOAA's VIIRS (that's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) sensorseven while it's flying by at about 7 kilometers per second.CubeSats won't be replacing VIIRS anytime soon, though: NOAA will be beefing up the system by adding a new weather satellite due to launch Tuesday.If everything goes according to plan, Saturday's launch will only be the first leg of the CubeSats' journey; they'll stay aboard the Cygnus transport while it's docked with the ISS, and then get boosted up to higher orbit once the cargo ship takes its leave in a few weeks.But for now, the CubeSat teams are just happy NASA's filling the gaps in its cargo ships with experiments rather than extra rolls of TP.
Tug, the Busy Little Robot Nurse, Will See You Now:::::Robots seem so far away.Were so many years from Jetsons-esque machines that live among us and wash our dishes and fold our clothes.But the reality is the robots have arrivedyoure just not noticing them.Take a robot called Tug, for instance.No, Tug can't talk philosophy with you, and Tug can't do your laundry.But Tug is a pioneer.Because in hospitals around the world, this robot is helping nurses and doctors care for patients by autonomously delivering food and drugs, shouldering the burden of time-consuming mundanity.And now, it's rolling more and more into hotels, so get ready to see more of Tug.If were being honest, Tug isnt much to look at, unless youre particularly fond of boxes on wheels.But really, its a self-driving car for the indoors.It navigates like a robocar would, using lasers to detect its surroundings and avoid obstacles.Step in front of it and it halts.Push an IV stand in its way and it routes around it.Like a self-driving car, Tug sees its world by spraying it with lasers.That tech is called lidar, the same algorithmically intense stuff at the heart of the dispute between the self-driving car programs of Uber and Google's Waymo.By bouncing lasers off its surroundings, Tug builds a highly detailed 3-D map.Supplementing that is a more traditional map of the hospital in Tugs head.So it starts at a known point and uses geometry to position itself as it makes its way through the corridors.It can even call elevators to get to other floors.Sure, sometimes it gets stuck and needs human help if, say, a large cart is blocking its path.But for the early days of this kind of technology, Tug is surprisingly sophisticated, navigating a human world with relative ease.But that doesnt necessarily mean it puts humans at ease.Hospital administrators need all the help they can get, but can they trust a robot to work alongside doctors and nurses?The good news is Tug cannot go rogue.In a Pittsburgh office park, technicians at Aethon, which makes Tug, keep a watchful eye over robots all around the worldhelping unstick them, for instance, if a human isnt around to help.That's because Aethon didn't have the luxury of waiting for culture to change to the point where people hurriedly adopt autonomous vehicles.So we built this back into the system where we can make customers comfortable that [the Tugs] were being watched," says Peter Seiff of Aethon, "even though they made the leap of faith with us that they could have autonomous vehicles running within their facility.This is the fascinating frontier of human-robot interaction.The robotic revolution is as much about getting the machines to adapt to us as it is about us adapting to the machines.So while Tug is designed to not run over toes, humans have to meet it halfway.That means treating these kinds of robots like your grandparents.Seriously.The idea is you help them when they get stuck or, heaven forbid, fall over.And generally speaking, you just get the hell out of their way.That new kind of interaction can be a bit of a psychological trip.We humans have this way of anthropomorphizing sophisticated machines, granting agency where there is none.Tug has code, not consciousness, but its easy to feel affection for a machine that rolls around on its own and calls elevators and delivers drugs.It seems silly, I know, but when I first met Tug, it actually upset melargely because its competence made my incompetence look all the more incompetent.And get ready to interact with these machines on a regular basis.Tug is rolling through more and more hospitals, and is making its way into hotels to make room deliveries.That might seem like an easier environment to conquer, what with there being very few urgent emergencies in hotels to complicate Tug's operations.But each new environment will come with its own challenges.Hotels are home to rather more drunk people, for instance, who may not necessarily give Tug the respect that it gets in hospitals.Its not just Tug that's conquering the world.Autonomous machines are increasingly infiltrating our lives, be they companion robots or robots that help us do our jobs.Getting along with them means coming to terms with a new kind of relationship humans will form with what is essentially an invented species.I, for one, welcome our new robotic grandparent overlords.
Yuri Milner and the Fellowship of Silicon Valley Science Influencers:::::Who are we?That impossible question opened the 2015 public letter announcing a well-heeled SETI project called Breakthrough Listen.Dozens of peoplescientists, astronauts, and also a producer, a chess champ, and a sopranosigned the note, which kicked off a $100 million effort by Russian billionaire Yuri Milner to catch signals from alien civilizations.That quest, Milner and the signatories hoped, would answer that existential query.With cooperation and commitment," the letter continued, "the present century will be the time when we graduate to the galactic scale, seek other forms of life, and so know more deeply who we are."This wasnt Milners first foray into science funding.In 2012, his foundation set up the Fundamental Physics Prize, which passes $3 million and red-carpet accolades to promising researchers.The next year, he set up the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, and the year after that came an award in math.Milner has also started a program to send a missive to aliens (Breakthrough Message), to develop technology to find Earth-like planets nearby (Breakthrough Watch), and to send tiny spacecraft to Alpha Centauri (Breakthrough Starshot).Together, Listen, Message, Watch, and Starshot are called the Breakthrough Initiatives.Milner, who has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Silicon Valley companies Facebook and Twitter, isnt alone in his scientific ventures.Joining him on Breakthroughs boards and bank accounts are some of the tech worlds other heavy hitters, like Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg, Alphabet's Sergey Brin, and Alibabas Jack Ma.In a time when scientists have to scrounge for every last penny of grant money, these philanthropic efforts seem like lifesavers, helping keep a select few afloat while others continue to flounder.HOTLITTLEPOTATO But last Sunday, investigations into the Paradise Papers revealed that some of the money Milner had invested was connected to the Russian state.That blurs the nature of the wealth backing the various Breakthroughs, and has caused some scientists to question the ethics of accepting these prizes and participating in these projects.Beyond that whole authoritarian government thing, too, is the question of why all these internet moguls are so deep in on scienceand just how deep in they are.The context for techs participation in Breakthrough Stuffspecifically, the alien-focused Initiativesgoes back decades.Silicon Valley's interest in alt-life started in earnest in the '70s, says SETI pioneer Jill Tarter.In 1971, NASA published the Project Cyclops Report, which laid out how humans could systematically search for radio signals from ET.The project was co-directed by Hewlett-Packard R&D lead Barney Oliver.Once Barney got the bug, he button-holed everyone he knew in the first generation of Silicon Valley engineers and bent their ear about Cyclops and SETI, says Tarter.TechnologistsHewlett, Packard, and Paul Allen in the '90s and early aughts, Qualcomm's Franklin Antonio more recently, and Milner latelyhave been seeding alien-seeking ever since.Breakthrough's web of web entrepreneurs is tangled upwith itself and with federal space science.The intertwining starts, interestingly, at NASAs Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Californiajust over eight miles down from Facebook HQ and around three from Google, and a hop-skip down the hill from Yuri Milners $100 million house (who knew finding a suitable place to live cost as much as finding aliens?).Starting in 2006, scientist Pete Worden acted as director of Ames.That year, in an entrance interview with Space News, he laid out a vision: "We would like to be a template for working with the private sector," he said.Under Wordens leadership, Ames's private partnerships flourished, and he brought the private sector's attitudedo it fast, do it cheapto space missions, making Ames a leader in smallsat development.At the campus's NASA Research Park, companies and non-profits could pay rent for space, from which they could collaborate closely with industry, academic, and government partners.Among the current park partners is the Breakthrough Prize.Another company affiliated with a Breakthrough board memberin this case, Sergey Brinalso leases part of Ames.In 2014, an Alphabet tentacle called Planetary Ventures, LLC, signed a 60-year lease at the NASA center (this after a smaller-scale Google lease of 42 acres in 2014).Planetary Ventures now has rights to 1,000 acres on Ames, acreage that includes historic hangars just a couple parking lots over from the Research Park.Ames declined to comment on either Breakthroughs or Googles recent leases.In February 2015, Worden retired from Ames.He wanted "to pursue some long-held dreams in the private sector," he said in his announcing email.Those dreams perhaps became clearer to the outside world after the Breakthrough Listen letter came out just a few months later: Worden, newly chairman of the Breakthrough Prize Foundation, would lead the Breakthrough Initiatives.Worden is flanked, on the Breakthrough Initiatives board, by Milner and Zuckerberg.That pair of billionaires also sits on the board of the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, which the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative funds.Now add two more tech goliaths to the Breakthrough Prizes: Alphabets Sergey Brin and online commerce group Alibabas Jack Ma.(Google and Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment).All four executives are listed as founders of the prizes.Thats a lot to follow, but the point is this: The people whose wealth and/or leadership determine what breaks throughthe scientists who receive money and notoriety through the Prizes, and the research efforts funded through the Initiativesare all wrapped up in search, social media, shopping, and each other.So whats in it for them?
Twenty Years after His Death, Carl Sagan Is Still Right:::::Twenty years ago I called Carl Sagan to ask him why people believed crazy stuff.Saganastronomer, creator of the golden record messages to any aliens who might find the Voyager space probes, creator and host of Cosmos, novelist, arguably one of the best-known scientists of the 20th centurywouldve been 83 years old today.Me, I was a fact-checker on the science desk at Newsweek, which meant I mostly did reporting for other peoples stories.In mid-1996 the magazine spun up a cover on the paranormal, and I was on the team.Sagan had written a book called The Demon-Haunted World, about science as a way of understanding the universe and freeing people from fears of the supernatural.And he had famously once said of the paranormal that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.So I blasted through Demon-Haunted Worldand, nervous as any other Cosmos fan wouldve been, I called Sagan at Cornell.I dont remember if he was gracious or merely tolerant of my dopey questions.But I have the notes.When UFOs became a popular subject and I was in early high school or something, it seemed to me great.We were just reaching out into space, and why not a much more advanced civilization reaching out to us?Sagan said.It seemed so heady and promising, such an interesting future.But as I learned a little bit more about the properly skeptical attitudes of science and how often we deceive ourselves, I began to look at this with much more skepticism.Eventually Sagan would come to think of UFOism as more of a religion than anything else.It was the Cold War, Sagan said, and people were in their heart of hearts worried that the human species would not pull through.What more comforting belief that aliens would come down and intervene?But just because an idea is comforting doesnt mean anyone should believe it.Merely because on an issue of this importance we must demand very high standards of evidence, and the proffered evidence is fantastically thin, Sagan said.Why would we commit belief when the evidence is so meager?Commit belief.That struck me as profound then and it still doesthe idea that belief is an action you have to commit, an action so powerful that it requires an infrastructure of truth before you turn the key.The point, thoughthe big pointis that humans had the ability to do this.We could figure things out.Nothing was unknowable.Who is in a position to set limits on what we will know?Unknowable is a deep failure of the imagination, he said.Unknown?Who would doubt that there are an enormous number of things that are unknown?There was Sagans faith, I think, to the extent he had any.Much remains unknown; nothing stands unknowable.Right now is a tough moment for science.Internal corrective measureslike the push for greater reproducibility and statistical power in fields from psychology to biosciencehave to expose weaknesses before they can rebuild strength.The underrepresentation of women and people of color in research diminishes outcomes and builds power dynamics that allow harassment and abuse.Externally, political nominees to science-heavy policymaking positions have no problem dismissing the scientific consensus that human beings are changing Earths climate.Otherwise sensible people refuse to vaccinate their children, exposing entire populations to the spectre of epidemic.Political interest groups use religious goals to influence policy decisions about everything from health care to bathroom signage.Science is an enterprise of human beings, so there are all sorts of jealousies and rivalries and unwillingness to admit mistakes, Sagan said.But the great advantage is that the culture of science is opposed to these frailties, and the collective enterprise of science undoes them.We give our highest rewards to those who disprove the contentions of our most revered figures.That means, he said, that science as a practice was worth defending.We must convince the most dedicated skeptics, even if there are those who are craven before authority, secular or scientific, Sagan said.Even if there are those who believe in the absence of evidence.Sagan was no Vulcan; he didnt hope to replace whatever demons he exorcised from the world with spreadsheets.The other half of science is a well-honed sense of wonder, and that is uplifting and is spiritual, he said.But it cant be that what feels good is what we should believe, because all sorts of deception lies down that road.It has to be whats true is what we believe, and the only way humans have figured out to find out whats true is science.I talked to Sagan one more time that year, when it seemed that scientists had found evidence of ancient life on Mars.He was, as youd expect, skeptical.Its important to be cautious, because we could be fooled, he said.Four months later, in December of 1996, he died.Hed been right to be cautious; the life-on-Mars thing turned out to be wrong.These truths arent self-evident.Thats what makes them difficult.They can be hard to understand, or contravene intuition or closely-held, ancestral beliefs.But Sagan knew that didnt make them less true, and it makes them even more important.
Container Ships Use Super-Dirty Fuel. That Needs to Change:::::This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.The platform overlooking the Panama Canals Pacific exit is buzzing with energy on a muggy October afternoon.Tourists cram together, jostling for the best views of the blue container ship gliding by in the gray-green water below.The ships crewmembers wave from aboard the 690-foot-long vessel, smiling as they end their eight-hour, 48-mile journey.An employee brandishing a wireless microphonethe canals hype manleads the crowd in a series of cheers, his voice as bombastic as a sports announcers.Lets give them a round of applause!he booms in Spanish and then English.The visitors heartily oblige, clapping for the sailors aboard the Greek ship named Em Corfu.Next in line is a colossal Japanese carrier that just unloaded cars on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States.Its blue metal sides block out the sky.Behind that comes a red tanker hauling liquefied natural gas produced in the United States to terminals in Mexico.Watching ships pass through the century-old Panama Canal offers a glimpse into our modern economy.Every day, vessels converge here to move billions of dollars worth of food, fuel, cars, clothing, raw materials, and electronics to the far corners of the world.Its awe-inspiring.But its also fairly alarming.About 90 percent of everything we buy will travel on ships like these at some point.And all of these behemoths burn fossil fuel, contributing significantly to the warming atmosphere and shifting climate patterns.Onlookers await the arrival of the Greek ship Em Corfu as it enters the Panama Canal in early October.Maria Gallucci Many cargo ships still use bunker fuelthe sludgy dregs of the petroleum refining process.The noxious blend is dirt-cheap, making it possible to charge next to nothing to ship goods internationally.All of which means our unbridled consumerism hitches a ride on some of the dirtiest vehicles on earth.(At least they hold tons of stuff, right?)The industrys reliance on high-carbon fuel poses a major stumbling block for global efforts to rein in pollution.A few companies are ramping up investment in pilot projects that use renewable fuels and cleaner technologies.And a vocal minority within the industry is clamoring for a maritime climate policy to spur more innovation.But on the whole, theres widespread reluctance to adopt meaningful change.Clean shipping advocates plan to spotlight the sectors emissions at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which opened on November 6 in Bonn, Germany.Known as COP23, the gathering marks two years since the world agreed in Paris on a landmark climate accordone that the Trump administration plans to abandon.The agreement, however, excluded pollution from international shipping and aviation in its targets to limit global warming.Officials had argued that those industries dont easily fit into national or regional emissions schemesand so they were left to regulate themselves.More on Climate Change Could San Francisco Get the Oil Industry to Pay for Climate Change?More Evidence Exxon Misled the Public About Climate Change Thanks, Climate Change: Heat Waves Will Keep on Grounding Planes Experts say regulatory action and big, bold investments will be essential to curbing the shipping industrys contribution to global warming.Left unchecked, its carbon footprint is expected to soar in coming decadesjust as emissions from cars and power plants flatline or decline.That means shipping could cancel out progress in other sectors.The International Maritime Organization, the industrys main regulator, suggests that carbon emissions from shipping could shoot up as much as 250 percent by 2050 as the worlds population grows and economies expand.At that point, the European Parliament estimates the industry could produce 17 percent of global emissions, up from less than 3 percent today.But Tristan Smith, a leading shipping researcher at University College Londons Energy Institute, notes companies still have little reason to spend their time and money building a greener cargo fleet.A very large proportion of the sector is really not interested in doing anything until the very last minute that the regulation hits, he says.From the Panama Canal, a string of heavily congested highways leads to Panama Citys glitzy downtown core.At a high-rise convention center in early October, hundreds of seafarers, naval officers, and industry officials have gathered for an IMO-sponsored event.Jorge Quijano, administrator of the Panama Canal Authority, tells the crowd the canal is doing its part to bring about a sense of responsibility with our planet.In January, he explains, it launched a program to reward shippers that meet high energy-efficiency standards or use low-sulfur and lower-carbon fuels, including cleaner-burning liquefied natural gas.Companies that do so can boost their standing in the canals ranking system for determining who gets priority access to the waterway.Tristan Smith of University College Londons Energy Institute says that, without a major regulatory push, shipping will never change its polluting ways.International Transport Forum The industry finds initiatives like these, which encourage upgrades but not drastic overhauls, generally palatablethey promote good behavior without overtly punishing status quo ships.But shipping executives like John Lyras bristle at the notion of setting ambitious sector-wide targets for reducing shipping emissions and total fuel consumption.Such efforts, he argued earlier this fall, wont make any sense until cleaner maritime technologies actually exist at commercial scale.If we really want to reduce CO 2 emissions to zero today we can do it in two ways: We can stop trading, or we can go back to sail, the Greek shipowner said while speaking on a panel at the International Chamber of Shippings conference in London.The pushback from executives like Lyras comes as more progressive voices are increasingly clamoring for the introduction of so-called zero-emissions ships, which dont directly produce any greenhouse gas emissions.A research consortium comprised of major shipping companies and academic institutes asserts such vessels must start entering the mainstream cargo market by 2030.By 2050, the group says, nearly all operating cargo ships must generate zero emissions in order to fall in line with the Paris agreement goal of keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels.Proponents say it can happen if the industry doesnt drag its feet.Were not saying you have to decarbonize right now, says Smith of University College London.You just have to start the process of figuring it out.Over the next two weeks in Germany, UN negotiators and thousands of other participants will gather to discuss not only promising ship technologies but also strategies to convince an old-fashioned industry to embrace new ideas.Diane Gilpin, whos helping organize a pro-climate shipping event that will take place on the cruise ship Rhine Fantasy, tells Grist about the sectors reluctance to go green.Gilpin once worked to introduce mobile devices to British corporations.Now, shes leading an effort to build a 100 percent renewable cargo vessel.She says the shipping industrys apprehension reminds her of the late 90s and early 2000s when many people saw the cell phones theyre now wholly consumed by as frivolous and costly.Because we never had cell phones before, we didnt think we needed them, she explains.Gilpin describes her current work trying to change the shipping industry as a human challenge in having people accept change.The most prominent options for powering a ship without fossil fuels include hydrogen, batteries, sustainably produced biofuels, and wind-assisted technologies that can reduce fuel use.All of these are being used or tested in small-scale vesselsprimarily passenger ferries or supply boats that keep close to shore.But if any are going to gain favor in the mainstream shipping industry, todays reigning championultra-cheap bunker fuelwill need a price tag that reflects its true environmental cost.According to a recent report by the global shipping services company Lloyds Register and University College London, about 75 percent of companies agree that forcing shippers to pay for carbon emissions is required to make a zero-emissions fleet a reality.The IMO would likely oversee such a program, and it plans to adopt an interim strategy for reducing greenhouse gases caused by shipping in April 2018.But the regulatory body doesnt expect an agreement on actual pollution targets until 2023. International Maritime Organization Secretary-General Kitack Lim speaks at the International Transport Forums 2016 summit on Green and Inclusive Transport in Leipzig, Germany.International Transport Forum The IMO is made up of 172 member countries.Getting all of them, as well as the worlds top shipping groups, to sign on to a set of goals would undoubtedly be a hard-fought and controversial process.Take as proof the latest round of IMO talks in October, which included discussion of slashing carbon emissions by 2100.A group of Pacific island and European nations pushed for drastic cuts by mid-century, while Saudi Arabia, India, Brazil, and the International Chamber of Shipping proposed a far less aggressive approach.As country representatives went back and forth, InfluenceMap, a nonprofit that tracks corporations impact on climate policy, published a report accusing shipping lobbying groups of holding unmatched power over IMO decisions.Those groups resoundingly denounced the report, and IMO Secretary General Kitack Lim defended the organizations neutrality.But one shipping executiveAndrew Craig-Bennett, who works for the UK subsidiary of Chinese shipping giant Coscostirred the pot even further in a widely shared opinion piece.We can feel nothing but contempt and disgust at the prostitutes employed by our racket to try to put one over on the general public, he wrote with a sailor-worthy flourish.Ultimately, the most effective driver for steering shipping away from its high-carbon path may come from outside the industry.The customers who place their goods on the ships are likely the best lever for forcing the sector to go green.Thats the solution Maurice Meehan sees as a key way forward.Meehan is director of shipping operations at the Carbon War Room, a nonprofit founded by Virgins Richard Branson to promote business-oriented climate solutions.He previously worked with shipping giant Maersk.As he explains, companies that produce all the T-shirts, smartphones, sneakers, and goods that are shipped around the world have substantial leverage with their logistics providers.If climate-conscious companies push their shippers to do more about reducing vessels carbon footprints, the industry would have to change.Dirtier ships would face a competitive disadvantage if manufacturers got serious about slashing supply-chain emissions.Thats a great approach, Meehan says by phone from Copenhagen on a call in September.Now youve got shipping going, Whoa, wait, if we dont have plans to meet the target our customer has set, were not going to be in the market in a few years?Meehan says his team is talking with big users of cargo ships, such as apparel companies, to help them target shipping-related emissions.As part of that, Carbon War Room is developing tools to make it easier for companies to choose vessels with lower emissions and better efficiencyor at least ensure their products arent loaded onto the worst offenders.But this approach is still in its early days, Meehan says.Most brands and shipping companies alike remain reluctant to do anything that would raise the cost of transporting goods or the final price tag.Thats largely because end usersyou and mestill prefer buying a lot of cheap stuff.
The Subtle Art and Serious Physics of Subway Surfing:::::I can't help myself.When I'm out in the real world and I see something cool, I have to turn it into a physics problem.It's just what I do.In this case, I was changing planes in the Atlanta airport.Like many other airports, Atlanta has a mini subway to take you between terminals.You walk in, the doors shut and then it accelerates up to some traveling speed.At some point it slows down and stops so that you can get off and catch your plane.But what about the physics?The first thing to do is to collect some data.This isn't too difficult to do in the world of smartphones.Just about every phone has an accelerometer that lets you record acceleration in three different directions.There are many apps out there that record this data, but right now I like phyphoxit runs on both Android and iOS.So here's what I did.In between terminals, I put the phone down on a rail so that it would be stationary.Then I recorded the acceleration.Here is the data for the acceleration in the direction of the subway (the other two directions are mostly boring).From this data, you can see that at the start, the subway has a maximum acceleration of about 1.2 m/s2.During the stopping motion, the subway has a maximum acceleration of about -1.5 m/s2.Now for some physics questions.How difficult is it to hold on during acceleration?These subways only have a few seats.Just about everyone stands up and holds on to a pole or a loop hanging from the ceiling.Suppose that you just grab the vertical pole and hold on during the acceleration.How much grip strength do you need?If you want to stay on the car, you have to have the same acceleration as the subway.In order to accelerate a human, there must be a force on the human in the direction of the acceleration.The magnitude of this force will be equal to the product of the mass of the human and the acceleration.For a 70 kg human, this would be a force of 84 Newtons.Just for comparison, the weight of that same human is 686 Newtons.That means the force the human exerts on the pole (and the pole exerts on the human) would be 12.2 percent of the weight.That's not too tough.What if someone doesn't hold onto the pole?Some people think they are just too cool for hand rails.Instead of using a pole to exert a force to accelerate, they will just use friction.The magnitude of this friction force would have to be the same as the force from a pole, if that is what was being used.But would this floor be able to provide a large enough frictional force?Although friction can be pretty complicated, it can be modeled as a force with a maximum value proportional to the amount the floor pushes up on an object.As an equation, it looks like this: In this expression, s is the coefficient of static frictiona value that depends on the two types of surfaces rubbing together (in this case, a shoe and the floor).The N is called the normal force.This is the magnitude of how hard the floor pushes perpendicular to its surface.Since the human is standing on a flat surface and not accelerating vertically, the magnitude of the normal force is just equal to the person's weight (the human's mass multiplied by the gravitational field with a value of g = 9.8 N/kg).Since this frictional force must be equal to the product of the mass and acceleration (from the car), I can solve for the minimum coefficient of friction.Using an acceleration of 1.2 m/s2, the minimum coefficient would be 0.122.With a stopping acceleration of 1.5 m/s2, you would need a minimum coefficient of friction with a value of 0.153.That shouldn't be too difficult to get coefficients of friction higher than that.Even leather on wood has a coefficient of 0.3 (according to this table).So, yes.You could possibly just stand there and pretend you are cool.Will you tip over?Yes.If you aren't careful and you are just standing there in a subway you could easily fall over.Why?Suppose you are in an accelerating car while standing up straight and not holding on to the rail.Here is what a force diagram would look like in that case.Everything looks fine, right?No, not right.Here's the problem.Suppose you put a pencil on a flat table and then push the eraser at an angle perpendicular to the pencil.The pencil will do two things: It will accelerate in the direction of the push (at least a little bit) and it will start to rotate.That's exactly what happens here with the person in the elevator.The frictional force at the feet will exert a net torque on the person and cause a rotation.We typically call this kind of rotation "falling over."Of course there are two ways to not fall over.Both of these methods need to do something about the total torque on the human.The first method is fairly simplestand sideways and stand with feet wide apart.In this case, the back foot can exert a greater upward force than the front foot.This means the back foot also produces more torque about the center of mass than the front foot and this torque should be enough to counter the torque from friction.Yes, you won't look as cool.The second method involves leaning in the direction of the acceleration.If the car is accelerating, it's almost as if there is a fake force pushing you in the opposite direction (yes, this is a fake force).In this reference frame of the accelerating subway, the frictional force does not exert a torque since it's applied at the point of rotation (the feet).However, the fake force does exert a torque.If you lean in the direction of the acceleration, you can create another torque from the gravitational force.When the torque from the fake acceleration force and the gravitational force are equal, you don't tip over.Yes, this method also has a problem.The acceleration isn't constant so you have to keep changing your lean angle.But in the end, you will either look cool, or fall over.
Scientists Save a Kid By Growing a Whole New Skin For Him:::::The baby was still in diapers when the first blister appeared, ballooning red and angry from his pale, newborn skin.Soon, they became a regular feature on the map of his body, along with deep creases in his face when he howled out in pain.A doctor told the parents his LAMB3 gene had a glitchhis body wasnt making enough of a protein to anchor the outer layer of his skin to the inner ones.For seven years they kept the blisters at bay.But by summer of 2015, the wounds were winningand the boy had lost 60 percent of his skin.In June, the child arrived at the burn unit of the Ruhr University Childrens Hospital in Bochum, Germany, hot with fever and septic from a strain of staph.His doctors began pumping him full of antibiotics and painkillers, bathing him in iodine, and dressing the wounds with ointments.Nothing worked.The father gave his son skin from his own body.It didnt take.After five weeks in the intensive care unit, the boy was dying.But there was one more thing left to try.A genetic experiment never attempted before.The doctors snipped out a tiny square of the boys skin and shipped it to a laboratory in Modena, Italy.Scientists there used a virus to inject a functioning LAMB3 gene into all the cells that made up that patch of skin, including some stem cells.Then they grew them and grew them and grew them until there were enough to seed onto nine square feet of gauze and protein gel.An adult-sized skin suit would take about 22 square feet, but for a kid, it was more than enough.In October, the Italians sent the new skin back to Germany, and the boys doctors carefully laid them into areas theyd scoured of any dead or infected flesh, first to his arms and legs.When another batch arrived in November they did his chest and back.In January they touched up any spots theyd missed.Seven and a half months after he was admitted, the boy walked out the hospital doors, wound-freethe recipient of the largest-ever infusion of transgenic stem cells.A few weeks later he returned to elementary school.Today, the boy spends his free time playing soccer and bruising like a normal kid.His new skin has never seen a blister.Gene therapy to treat a skin disease.News & Views Stem cell and gene therapies hold great promise, but technical and regulatory obstacles have often blocked the path from petri dish to hospital bed.The tale of the German boy with Italian-grown skin, which was published today in the journal Nature, tells a different story.It demonstratesalbeit for a sample size of onethat you can safely treat an incurable disease using genetically corrected stem cells.For the first time outside of the hematopoietic system weve been able to show that a transgenic stem cell can permanently regenerate an entire tissue, says Michele De Luca, director of the Center for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, and first author on the paper.The cells made all the right proteins to attach to the underlying dermis.And that tissue developed all the things skin should havehair follicles and sweat and oil glands.Most importantly, the transgenic cells appear to be self-replenishing.Most of the cells in the initial culture turned over in the first few months, just like normal skin sloughs off and regrows.But a few of the lab-grown stem cells stayed alive, replenishing those new skin cellsall of which had the correct version of the gene.Now, thats not to say that this can be called gene correction, or gene editing, points out Paul Knoepfler, a biomedical researcher at UC Davis who also writes a policy blog on stem cell science.The faulty gene is still present all over the boys body, from his heart to his lungs to his esophagus.But the presence of the non-mutated LAMB3 gene in the transgenic skin cells covering the outside of his body are enough to make them functionally healthy.The therapy essentially turned the child into a chimera.Still, he says the paper is nothing short of groundbreaking.The extent of the successful epidermal replacement is remarkable, Knoepfler says.But dont get too far up that hype curve.De Luca and his co-authors were quick to point out that their intervention was incredibly aggressive, and nothing they would recommend for someone whose life wasnt in grave danger.They plan to monitor the boy for the next few decades to see how robust the transgenic stem cells arecan they resupply the skin indefinitely, or will they poop out over time and require more grafts?They also need to keep an eye on whether or not his new cells are more prone to cancer than the ones he was born with.The method they used to introduce the correct version of LAMB3 inserts the gene effectively, but at a random place in each cells DNA.They havent yet seen any toxicity or adverse effects, but there are concerns that the genes placement could turn on cancer pathways.Because of that, De Lucas team is beginning to consider newer systems, specifically Crispr/Cas9, to tackle other forms of the genetic disease.In this case, the risk-benefit calculus was easy because without treatment the boy would die.Vats of gene-edited stem cells are a long ways away from being a cure-all.But at least for one boy, they were a cure.
Grad Students Are Freaking Out About the GOP Tax Plan. They Should Be:::::Amanda Coston was preparing for a meeting with her advisor Monday afternoon when her friend, another first-year PhD student in Carnegie Mellon's machine learning department, knocked on her door.Had she seen the email?A few minutes earlier, the university's Graduate Student Assembly had sent a Google Doc to department representatives across the university, and those reps had forwarded the document to their grad students.That document, which you can see for yourself here, details the devastating impact the GOP's recently unveiled tax-reform plan could have on the university's PhD candidates.Buried in that plan is a proposed repeal that would cause graduate students' tuition waivers to be counted as incomemaking them subject to taxes.The document analyzes how the repeal would affect graduate students in colleges across Carnegie Mellon.It's pretty bleak.The annual stipend for a PhD student in Carnegie Mellon's school of computer science is about $32,400.The university covers the student's $43,000 tuition, in exchange for the research she conducts and the courses she teaches.Under current law, the government taxes only a students stipend; the waived tuition is not taken into account.But under the GOP bill, her annual taxable income would rise from $32,400 to $76,234.Even factoring in new deductions also included in the proposal, the CMU document estimates her taxes would amount to $10,209 per yearnearly four times the amount under current law.That would slash her net annual stipend by 25 percent, from $29,566 to $22,191."It was just such a shock," says Coston, who expects her degree will take another five years to complete.If the repeal were to become law, it would take effect in 20182019."It really changes the calculus on my finances.This suddenly makes a lot of things like rent, car payments, groceries, all that stuff, no longer affordable."And not just for her.Current and would-be graduate students fear that, were the bill to pass, getting a PhD in the US could become financially impossible."I monitor all legislation at the state and federal levels that could affect graduate and professional students, and this is justthis would have the greatest negative impact of anything I've seen," says Samantha Hernandez, legislative director of the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students."It would be devastating."For years, PhD candidates have "paid" for their educations almost exclusively through research and teachingworking in labs, TAing courses, hosting office hours.It works like an apprenticeship: Trade five years of your life learning and working in a field that interests you in exchange for a meager, but livable, salary."The point is to be stressed about class work and researchnot finances," Coston says.Fewer than 10 percent of PhD candidates in STEM fields rely primarily on their own money to pay for grad school; and in 2015, more than three-quarters graduated with no debt.(At least from their graduate programs; plenty of graduate students complete their PhDs burdened with debt from their undergrad years.)But removing the promise of a living wage would dramatically affect people's ability to pursue a graduate degree."I think we'd see a shift in who even starts such a program," says UT Austin computational biologist Claus Wilke, who also blogs on the subject of professional development in academia.A graduate education would quickly become something you pursue only if you can pay for it.That's a bad message to send to anyone driven to learn and innovate.You want talented people to study and contribute to what they're passionate aboutnot what they can afford."The people who were doing it for the love of science, or who were excited about going into teaching, or even because they have a lucrative career in mindthey may just decide they can't do it," Wilke says.The GOP's plan would also affect what PhDs do once they leave their graduate programs.PhDs are already less likely to go into academia than they once were, and a tax burden could compound the trend.Academic gigs can't compete with industry jobs on salary, and they have a reputation for being less stable, Hernandez says, which leads people to pursue what she calls "alternative academic routes."In other words: The more debt students graduate with, the less likely they are to pursue relatively low-paying or financially risky jobsin academia and elsewhere.That means fewer educated people teaching, experimenting, and innovating at research institutions, sure, but in other places, too."Right now you can graduate debt free and work for the government, non profits, start your own companyyou get to choose.But if youve accumulated a lot of debt, most students are going to look at high paying jobs thatll let them pay off debt," Coston says.Many academics fear the tax burden would waylay efforts to increase social and intellectual diversity at their institutions."You have to advocate for folks who are coming down the pipeline," says UCLA neuroscientist Astra Bryant.She says that's especially true of women and underrepresented minorities."I mentor two underprivileged undergraduate women, and my concern for them is that an increased tax burden would make it financially impossible for them to afford to pursue a PhD."And what's bad for grad students is bad for universities.PhD students are a linchpin of the undergraduate education model.When they're not conducting research, they're teaching classes, grading tests, and holding office hours."And to be frank, at this point, they're cheaper than adjunct professors," Hernandez says."You start removing them, and innovation, research, educationall of those things start to slow down.So there's a huge impact on higher education as a whole."Not all PhDs would be affected equally.1 "Tuition waiver" is not a legal term but a colloquial one used to describe several scenarios outlined in Section 117 of the US tax code.That section treats scholarships and fellowship grants (described in subsections ac) differently from tuition reductions (described in subsection d).The GOP's tax plan would leave the first three subsections alone but repeal the provision on tuition reductions.An estimated 145,000 graduate students benefit from these reductions, some 60 percent of them in STEM fields.Furthermore, a document similar to the one circulated by Carnegie Mellon's GSA is making the rounds at UC Berkeley, a public institution.That document estimates that the GOP's proposal would increase tax burdens for students at public schools by 30 to 60 percent, compared to the several-hundred-percent increase seen by private school students who pay higher tuitions.Public or private, the response from scientists is the same: "Its been taking science Twitter by storm," Bryant says."Im looking at my Twitter feed right now, and more and more people are chiming in to say this would be an unmitigated disaster."But Coston says it will take more than tweets to derail the GOPs proposal."There's a call-your-congressperson event scheduled for tomorrow, and I plan on going.That's the immediate action item," she says.1.UPDATE 11/09/2017 15:00 ET: This post has been amended with additional information on the subsection of US tax code the GOP's proposal would affect and its potential impact on graduate students.
Want to Really Teach a Robot? Command It With VR:::::Do me a favor and grab and object near you.Anything will do.Even if its something youve never handled before, odds are your brain automatically worked out how you should grasp the thing and with what force.Its the kind of clever dexterity that makes you human.(You are human, I hope?)Ask a robot to do the same and youll either get a blank stare or a crumpled object in the cold, cold grasp of a machine.Because robots are good at repetitive tasks that require a lot of strength, but theyre still bad at learning how to manipulate novel objects.Which is why today a company called Embodied Intelligence has emerged from stealth mode to fuse the strengths of robots and people into a new system that could make it far easier for regular folk to teach robots new tasks.Think of it like a VR videogameonly you get to control a hulking robot.If you want to teach a robot to do something like pick up a wrench, you can do it one of several ways.The first is to just brute-program it with all the movements it needs to grip the thing.Lines of code, one after the other.Very dull and very laborious.(L-R) The Embodied Intelligence Founding Team: Peter Chen (CEO), Pieter Abbeel (President and Chief Scientist), Rocky Duan (CTO), Tianhao Zhang (Research Scientist).Embodied Intelligence A newer, more sophisticated technique is called reinforcement learning.At UC Berkeley, the lab that spun out Embodied Intelligence employs a robot named Brett, which can teach itself to put a square peg in a square hole by guessing.Each time it makes a random movement that gets the peg closer to the hole, the AI receives a reward.Try after try, the robot inches closer and closer to its goal until boom, its taught itself to master a childrens game over the course of 10 minutes.So brute-programming is inflexible, and reinforcement learning from scratch is time consuming for the robot.This, after all, is a physical machine bound by the laws of the physical universe, so it can only make so many attempts in a given amount of time.(Using reinforcement learning in a simulation is far speedier, since the virtual trials and errors can happen much more rapidly.)A more precise technique is called imitation learning, in which an operator demonstrates for a robot how to put a square peg in a square hole.Thats as easy as joysticking the robots arms aroundbut that robot won't be able to teach itself novel tasks.What Embodied Intelligence has dreamed up is a hybrid system of imitation and reinforcement learning.Using a VR headset and controllers, a human can teleoperate the robot to do a certain task.This creates a more natural kinetic connection between the operator and robot, as machine learning algorithmstrained to match what the human doesguide the robot's motions.Then the reinforcement learning kicks in, refining the robots movements with trial and error until it's even better at its job than the human taught it to be.Typically you want your robots to be superhuman, you don't want them to be just as good as the human who demonstrates, says Pieter Abbeel, co-founder and president of Embodied Intelligence.You want them once they've acquired a skill to make that skill even faster, more accurate, more reliable through their own trial and error without humans continuously in the loop.Because humans won't be able to demonstrate motions that are as fast as a robot could in principle move.Imagine, if you will, the factory of the future.Instead of some poor programmer coding each robot to do a different task on the assembly line, they would instead demonstrate the movement in VR.The robots may be a bit awkward at first, but over time theyll use their AI to hone their motions.And as researchers build better and better learning algorithms, the robots might take one particular task a human has taught them and use it to teach themselves how to accomplish something different.Still, this system is in its very early days.At the moment it's working on a PR2 research robot, which is relatively slow and clumsy.And any modern robot is nowhere near as dexterous as a human, so even though this thing is great at replicating an operator's movements, it can't replicate fine grasping.But if Embodied Intelligence has its way, manufacturers could soon stock factories with robots that learn from humans, then supercharge those powers by teaching themselves.And just imagine what more than one robot can achieve with this kind of system.If youve got 100 machines talking to each other in the cloud, and one learns something particularly useful, it could then distribute that knowledge to its compatriots.Now were talking about a potentially powerful hive mind.And the robots dont even have to be of the same shape and size.Researchers have already figured out how to get this knowledge to translate between different types of machines.In the nearer term, the idea is to not only make robots smarter, but to make them easier for people to teach.Programming Brett in the lab takes a lot of time and also something called a PhD, neither of which most people have.What we are seeing here instead is anyone who can use a VR headset can teach a robot new skills quickly, says Peter Chen, co-founder and CEO of Embodied Intelligence.This is the kind of democratization that will make roboticstraditionally far less accessible a field than software, which anyone with a computer can tinker withreally take off.Will this in turn make it easier for robots to replace people in the workforce?Sure, maybe.But more and more were seeing robots working alongside humans, taking over tiresome, repetitive tasks and freeing up workers to do uniquely human tasks that require a keen sense of touch, for instance.And if we want any hope of making this a fruitful relationship, well need our robotic coworkers to learn quickly, lest they become a burden instead of a blessing and hit us on the head with wrenches.
The Physics of When, Exactly, Star Wars Takes Place:::::WHEN Episode IV, opening scene WHERE The galaxy CHARACTERS Before their time PHYSICS CONCEPTS Gravity, big bang theory When watching a Star Wars film, you have to suspend your disbelief.Characters use magic brain powers to move things around, lightsabers are a thing, and there are civilizations spread over an entire galaxy.Despite all of these fantastical things, its easy to think about this happening in our universe somewhere.This couldnt be our universe, though, could it?Excerpted from The Physics of Star Wars: The Science Behind a Galaxy Far, Far Away by Patrick Johnson.Adams Media BACKSTORY From the beginning of A New Hope, we are told that Star Wars occurred A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away Despite it being a long time ago, the galaxy displays signs of being very mature.It has billions of stars that have already formed.It has hundreds of intelligent species with interstellar transportation capabilities.But when is a long time ago in the history of the universe?Could the Star Wars universe be a parallel universe?Or maybe the whole saga predates the big bang altogether.Is that even possible?THE PHYSICS OF STAR WARS The best theories that we have indicate that our universe is about 13.7 billion years old.Assuming the Star Wars galaxy is in our universe, we need a few indicators to determine when in our universes history Star Wars could occur.The first galaxies were formed around a billion years after the big bang, so that cuts out a billion years.The films depict many star systems with mature planets and intelligent life.It took the solar system about 500 million years to form, and it formed 4.6 billion years ago, so its reasonable to assume that Star Wars is about 5 billion years after the formation of the first galaxy1.There are also fully formed multicellular creatures of many different shapes and kinds.It took about 2 billion years for single-celled organisms to evolve into multicellular organisms, and another billion years before those took the form of life that we could recognize as creatures.about the author Patrick Johnson, PhD, is currently in his dream job as an assistant teaching professor at Georgetown University, primarily teaching introductory physics.One of his life goals is to bring accessible discussions of science to the world.Although it took billions of years for life to evolve on Earth, that does not mean the process would always take billions of years.The first eukaryotic cell is thought to have formed from a bacterium entering a prokaryotic cell and living symbiotically rather than being destroyed by its host cell.This was a random fluke that took millions of years to happen.If that event had happened on the first day of prokaryotic life, it could have shaved off a significant chunk of time for evolution.Altogether, this means that Star Wars needs to be at least 9 billion years after the big bang.This leaves plenty of years before the current time (about 4.7 billion to be precise), so it could still count as a long time ago, but it is certainly closer to now than to the big bang.Figuring out where the Star Wars galaxy is in the history of the universe is harder than trying to pinpoint planets in the history of their development.For instance, we see many terrestrial (rocky) planets and a few gas giants.A planet such as Mustafar is very volcanically active and has lava flowing all over its surface; Mustafar is probably in its earliest stages of development.In a similar fashion, Hoth could be an Earth-like planet in the heart of an ice age.Its more likely that it is just a cold planet far from its star, but Earth did undergo several ice ages.Planet Earth was once a volcanic mess like Mustafar.Early terrestrial planets with a molten core go through a Mustafar-like phase.These planets need to dissipate heat, especially in early life.Volcanic eruptions aid in that goal and incidentally help create an atmospheremolecules outgassed via these eruptions are trapped inside a collapsing sphere of dust (that is present from the collisions involved in planet formation).Eventually, the heat and dust clears out and the volcanism settles down.So a long time ago is feasible, but if Star Wars does take place in our universe, why dont we find all the fictional elements such as collapsium, tibanna, and baradium?There are two possible explanations.Either they are not atomic in nature or they are larger, as yet undiscovered, elements.As of 2016, 118 elements have been discovered, and none of them are tibanna.If these elements exist, they have to be heavier than the heaviest discovered elements.It is possible, though, that they are not atomic at all.We think of atoms as the building blocks of everything, but there are a whole host of particles that fall outside this definition.Tibanna could be a type of subatomic particle that is awaiting discovery.THE PHYSICS OF REAL LIFE The idea that tibanna and company are actually just heavy elements (i.e., elements with larger atomic numbers) that have yet to be discovered is unlikely.To explain why, we need to discuss radioactive decay.Some elements have unstable arrangements of subatomic particles, which leads to loss of such particles in a process called radioactive decay (which results in less of the element in its original form existing).Unstable atoms with larger atomic numbers tend to decay more rapidly.Uranium (element 92 on the periodic table) is the largest element not discovered through laboratory synthesis and it has a half-life of sixty-nine to four and a half billion years (a half-life is how long it takes for half of a substance to decay; it can be a range of values depending on how the subatomic particles of the element are arranged).As you go up in number on the periodic table, atoms have significantly shorter half-lives.For instance, one element much larger than uranium has a half-life of about 0.7 milliseconds.So, tibanna would likely have a very small half-life and thus wouldnt stick around long enough for anyone to mine it (like they do on Cloud City).Still, the idea isnt completely impossible.In the 1960s Glenn Seaborg proposed an island of stability in larger nuclei, which could give new life to the undiscovered elements theory.Seaborgs idea relates to a concept in nuclear physics known as magic numbers.Just as electrons have shells that they can occupy while they orbit the nucleus, there are energy shells for the protons and neutrons inside the nucleus.Just as there are a certain number of electrons in a shell, which leads to a less reactive element (because the electrons have filled a shell), there are magic numbers of protons or neutrons that cause a nucleus to be extraordinarily stable.Although additional numbers have been proposed, the accepted magic numbers are 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126.This means that the not-yet-discovered element 126 could turn out to be very stable.It would be in the metal range of the periodic table, so it is unlikely to be tibanna gas, but who knows?Maybe it will be baradium.Its also possible that Star Wars occurs in a parallel universe.Some interpretations of quantum mechanics indicate that our universe is just one of an infinity of universes.The idea of a multiverse is often explained by considering a block of Swiss cheese.Each universe is one of the holes in the cheese expanding outward.Unlike Swiss cheese, though, the multiverse itself is also expanding so none of the universes will ever collide with each other.In these other universes things could be identical (as far as the laws of physics are concerned) to our universe.Other theories indicate that perhaps in all of these other universes, fundamental constants such as and the speed of light are actually different numbers.This could lead to wildly different behaviors than what we observe in our universe.It is also possible that Star Wars took place in a time before the big bang.This may sound like an impossible suggestion, but the big bang just marks a point in history when our current laws of physics didnt work.It is possible a universe existed before the big bang; it would have been very hot and dense and collapsed upon itself.In this scenario, all of space and time were crumpled up together in an unrecognizable fashion.This is not science fictionsome theories suggest this.The biggest downside to these theories is that they will never be directly measurable unless we can travel to one of these universes or our universe collides with another universe.Excerpted from The Physics of Star Wars: The Science Behind a Galaxy Far, Far Away by Patrick Johnson.Copyright 2017 Adams Media, a division of Simon and Schuster.Used by permission of the publisher.All rights reserved.1Update 4:00pm Eastern, 11/7/17: This story has been updated to accurately reflect the formation of the solar system;

After the Texas Mass Shooting, We Can't Afford to Wage War on Science Any More:::::In the aftermath of the massacre of 26 people in a small-town Texas church, you might have seen that the killer used a gun called an AR-15.Its a popular weaponrelatively easy to use, endlessly customizable, military in appearance.How popular?Its the same gun that a killer used in the massacre of 58 people at a Las Vegas concert last month, and by the killer who murdered 49 people in a nightclub in Orlando, and the one at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.And the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado.And the party in San Bernardino, California.Oh, but wait: Its also the gun, apparently, that someone in Texas used to shoot back at the killer at First Baptist Church, accurately enough to pinpoint places his tactical vest didnt protect.We keep hearing that ARs are useless for self-defense, that theyre simply weapons of war, useful only for mass killing.This is simply not true, writes David French at The National Review.He didnt save lives inside the church, French goes on to say, but this straight-from-the-gun-advocate-storybook good guy with a gun did stop the shooter and prevented him from harming anyone else.He did so with exactly the kind of weapon that the gun control lobby would like to deny to law-abiding Americans.Well, OK. Good question then.Is it possible that the AR-15 isnt just an overpowered long gun beloved by the National Rifle Association but a necessary component of civilian defense in the absence of armed authorities?Somebody should figure this out, right?Except you cant.The government doesnt keep track of how many AR-15s are out there or who owns them.Only through painstaking excavation of crime reports could anyone even begin to figure out which crimes involved AR-15s or when AR-15s stopped crimesmuch less where those ARs came from, how they were stored, or how they were modified.That data is either off-limits or simply doesnt exist.If we had easy access to the kind of data we have on motor vehicle crashes for firearm violence, we would be able to answer much more clearly a whole host of questions about gun policyabout which state laws are working, which storage practices work, which guns are riskier than others, what ammunition sizes and magazines matter.I could go on and on, says Jon Vernick, codirector of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research.Were already in a world where science is questioned, in particular the role of science in policymaking.No one whos realistic thinks science is sufficient for good policymaking.But its clearly necessary.You see that lackor rather dont see it, I guesswith guns.It comes up with every mass shooting and more rarely when people talk about the epidemic of suicides and accidental gun deaths in the United States.But that data void is growing like the ozone hole in the 1980s, an encroaching Big Nothing.Washington Post politics reporter Philip Bump has been updating a list of things President Trump has undone in office, and an eye-popping number are numbers: oil and gas company payments to foreign governments, corporate salaries organized by race and gender, employer records of workplace injuries, government contractor labor law violations, health effects of mountaintop-removal mining, safety issues at chemical plants, visitors to the White House.Did you want to know any of those things?You cannot.No one whos realistic thinks science is sufficient for good policymaking.But its clearly necessary.Jon Vernick, Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research Would you like detailed information about arrests, homicides, and gang murders in 2016?Well, the FBI isnt giving it to you anymore.How about melting Arctic ice?Nope; Congress is dismantling a satellite that was supposed to update the aging monitor network.Climate change?Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, doesnt think human beings cause it and, more importantly, doesnt really think you can measure anything to find out.The weather?Forget it; the National Weather Service is coming apart at the seams.How many people live in the United States, data critical to determining political representation and funding priorities?Yeah, nothe 2020 Census is shaping up to be an epic disaster.Its hard to imagine a good argument for knowing lessabout anything, really, but especially about difficult problems with profound policy implications.The government is supposed to base policy on the best data possible, along with political concerns, budget concerns, social priorities ... the usual warp and weft of running a country.Yet the Trump administration is running in the other direction.Any data that has even the faintest whiff of potential contradiction goes right out the window.Of course, these folks aren't the first people in power to succumb to a fear of data.They do, however, seem to have found a profound expertise in the practice of eliminating it.Dataphobia chills them to the bone, I suspect because they hope to undermine not only some truths but all truth.David Roberts at Vox has written about what he calls an epistemic crisis in America, the idea that certain rulers and rich people hope to take away the basic idea of knowledge.If nobody can know anything, why bother to try to regulate anything?Its government-by-ignorancea shrugocracy.Assaults on data have come before.Its the same reason an oil company doesnt want research on climate change or a tobacco company doesnt want research on the relationship between tobacco and cancer, Vernick says.Maybe they argue those researchers have an agenda and thatll allow them to cook the books, but thats an absurd argument.The worst thing you can do is cook the books.That is the way to guarantee the science is not used as part of policymaking.Throw in the way the automotive industry resisted safety regulations and the sugar industry in the 1960s shifted blame for health problems onto fats instead of sweets, ensorcelling nutrition research for half a century, and you have a pretty good accounting of the ways business interests have twisted, biased, and otherwise hammered science into behaving like a corporate drone instead of a defender of truth.When it comes to guns, the data dearth goes back decades.In the mid-1990s, the National Rifle Association persuaded congress to prohibit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from funding firearm violence research.That chilled the entire federal science funding structure.The agency that regulates firearms now doesnt even share with researchers all its data on what guns are traced to what crimes.While there were interests that were committed to obfuscating the situation or making it more difficult to conduct the work, the magnitude of the effect probably is unique to firearm violence, says Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at UC Davis.Theres no doubt in my mind that there are hundreds of thousands of dead people who would now be alive had the work been allowed to proceed.Now, though, even more stands at risk.This isn't just about undermining data anymore.It's about abandoning its collection.Ive called it an undercurrent, and Im not even sure its an undercurrent anymore.Theres clearly an assault on science that worries me quite a bit.Its climate denialism when weve suffered three catastrophic hurricanes, one that put my city underwater.In my state of Texas, more than 50,000 kids are not getting vaccinated for totally phony reasons, says Peter Hotez, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.Its starting to affect our quality of life, and important policy decisions that are being made that need to be made correctly.I might disagree with Hotez, thoughbecause hes not going far enough.The attack is on the idea of science, on the notion that science is a good way to know stuff.You observe the world around you, formulate an idea for why the world might be that way, develop a test that isolates that one factor and tests it, and then operate on the data you collect to figure out if it bears out your original idea.And then you pummel that idea with all the ways it might be wrong.If it survives, hey, awesome, you misunderstand the universe slightly less egregiously than you did before all that work.The night is a little less dark.Abdicating on the collection of data cuts that method off at the knees.It plants ignorance where there might have been knowledge, and worse makes science look weak through induced failureas if, like some propagandists say of the press, its irredeemably biased by leftist researchers and cant be trusted.Not only does the night stay dark, but people stop believing in daylight, and anyone who suggests it's real must have a daylight-based agenda.Thats the epistemological crisis.Since the Enlightenment people have relied on science to be, in some senses, the referee to help make difficult calls.That was especially true in Americaone of the preeminent scientists of his time, Benjamin Franklin, was literally in the room for the creation of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.And now that's changing.Undermine that science, and things dont just seem unknown but unknowable.According to the information warfare expert Molly McKew, the Russian government is practicing something called the Gerasimov Doctrine, threading chaotic, contradictory, often false, always divisive information throughout the global mediamainstream, alt, social, whatever.The point isnt to make any one person believe any one thing.Its to make all the people believe none of the things.As Roberts wrote in Vox, policymaking becomes nothing more than a contest of raw power tribal epistemology, as he calls it.Here, then, is the real danger.As a practice, science (and, Ill add out of a perhaps naive romanticism, journalism) are supposed to be the arenas to which a non-practitioner can turn for knowledge and clarity.Confronted with its own crisisin the reproducibility of its findingsthe institutions of science turned in part to data hygiene, making complete datasets public, as is the practice at the journal Hotez edits.If the president and his corporate allies choke the life out of data, the shrugocracy turns into a shrugpocalypse.From the point of view of people attempting to obstruct the acquisition of knowledge, making the substrate from which knowledge is acquired unavailable, hard to get, or of lower quality yields many benefits, Wintemute says.There are adverse effects to the rest of us, but benefits to the people who are doing the obstruction.That might be most vexing to the scientists themselves, the ones best trained in acquiring knowledge in the field and with the most faith in their methods and justifications.I see patients in the emergency department, and because I took an oathand for much deeper reasonsI believe strongly in using my life to help relieve suffering, Wintemute says.I will make use of whatever tools are available or whatever tools I can fashion on my own, but that is the work I will continue to do.Its frustrating.I could do more with better tools.But that fact is no argument against doing what I can with what I have.Knowledge will always be power, and no one ever gives up power willingly.Sometimes you have to take it.
Artificial Intelligence Is Putting Ultrasound on Your Phone:::::If Jonathan Rothberg has a superpower, its cramming million-dollar, mainframe-sized machines onto single semiconductor circuit boards.The entrepreneurial engineer got famous (and rich) inventing the worlds first DNA sequencer on a chip.And hes spent the last eight years sinking that expertise (and sizeable startup capital) into a new venture: making your smartphone screen a window into the human body.Last month, Rothbergs startup Butterfly Network unveiled the iQ, a cheap, handheld ultrasound tool that plugs right into an iPhones lightning jack.You dont have to be a technician to use oneits machine learning algorithms guide the user to find what they might be looking for.With FDA clearance for 13 clinical applications, including obstetric exams, musculoskeletal checks, and cardiac scans, Rothberg says the new device is poised to disrupt and democratize the medical imaging industry in the same way the Ion Torrent, his DNA sequencer, once made inroads against genomics giant Illumina.So how did a guy who floats around the Connecticut coast on a $40 million yacht named Gene Machine miniaturize ultrasound devices to the size of a postage stamp?It starts with a search for the beginnings of the universe.Butterfly Network In the summer of 2010, Rothberg went to hear a physicist named Max Tegmark speak at MIT about an exciting new way to image the cosmos.To do it, he had to tether together tens of thousands of telescopes (not literally, but with algorithms) to measure energy coming from far-off stars.But getting a whole bunch of antennas to talk to a whole bunch of computers turned out to be a massive computational bottleneck.So Tegmark and a grad student named Nevada Sanchez had come up with a method to split up the work in an efficient way.They called it the Butterfly Network.As Rothberg sat in the audience, he realized he could use their algorithms to solve a totally different kind of problem: networking thousands of ultrasonic speakers on a silicon chip to make crisp, three-dimensional images of the human bodys insides.It's something hed wanted to do ever since sitting through his oldest daughters endless doctors visits, for a disease called tuberous sclerosis that causes dangerous cysts to grow in her kidneys.At the end of the lecture, Rothberg introduced himself to Tegmark, gave him his pitch, and asked for permission to steal the physicists best student.A year later, Rothberg co-founded Butterfly Network with Sanchez, planning to reinvent the clinics most popular imaging test.Despite ultrasounds lo-fi reputationthe grainy images have got nothing on the clarity of an MRI or CT scanthe tech is surprisingly complicated.It works on the same principle that bats use to find prey and not run into thingssend out a sound, receive the echo, calculate the distance.For the last 40 years, almost all ultrasound machines have used compressed charged crystals or ceramics to do that.When electric current is applied to the crystals, they rapidly change shape, which sends out vibrations.When those sound waves bounce back, the crystals emit electrical currents.But each one has to be individually wired together, then attached via cables to a separate machine for processing.Plus, the crystals have to be tuned to produce the right type of ultrasonic wave for imaging at a particular depth.Youve got one probe for the heart, and another for the stomach, and another for the uterus.A typical system with multiple wands and a display screen cost upwards of $100,000.Butterfly Network Getting around these limitations was a two-step process.First, Butterflys engineers replaced the crystals with rows and rows of teeny tiny drums, also known as capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers, or CMUTs.You can think of them like a metal plate suspended between two electrodes.Run some current through them and the plate vibrates, and you tune the frequency by changing the power of the electric field.They had help from Stanford professor Pierre Khuri-Yakub, who made the first CMUT back in 1994.His research got companies like General Electric, Philips, and Samsung interested in a new way to do ultrasound.But they never figured out how to make them function reliably at scale.This is a high-powered, electric field-based device, says Khuri-Yakub.Its like a Mustang.If you can control it, it will be good to you.If you cant, it will be your downfall.His engineering and Sanchezs math completed the redesign.They did away with the wiring and bonded the CMUTs directly to a semiconductor layer containing all the necessary amplifiers and signal processors to turn sounds into pictures.Its a ton of data; the chip is processing about 20 copies of Wonder Woman on DVD every second.If the old version of ultrasound is a straw, this is a fire hose, says Rothberg.But the company can take advantage of the progress in mass-market fabrication techniques perfected for computer chips to bring the cost down.Rothberg says they plan to start shipping units next year, for $2,000 a pop.They hope to outfit each device with deep learning software that's been trained on hundreds of thousands of ultrasound images, so it knows the difference between a high-quality and poor-quality shot of different body parts, pending a separate FDA approval.And while the device isn't on the market yet, it has already saved a life.In July, Butterflys chief medical officer, John Martin, was at a hospital in Denver, doing a set of validation studies on the device.Hed had a cold and some stiffness in his neck, but he figured it was just an overactive lymph node.Since they were testing it anyway, he smeared some gel on his throat, and ran the probe over it.A dark, 3.4 cm mass loomed into view.Thats not a lymph node, he thought.It wasnt.Under his tongue squamous cell cancer had been growing for months.He got in to see a specialist, and after a five-and-a-half hour surgery was tumor-free.Hes now undergoing radiation therapy, which makes his voice prone to breaking as he speaks.He says he probably wouldnt have sought out a doctor for something as small as a lymph node, and hopes the technology will help other people who might make the same mistake, or not have access in the first place.Thermometers once lived only inside hospitals.And blood pressure cuffs, and defibrillators, Martin says.The sooner we can put smart technologies in the hands of people at home, the sooner the right diagnosis can be made.Ive yet to find a disease state where earlier detection didnt lead to better outcomes.And Im living proof of that.
A Malaria Breathalyzer? It's Closer Than You Think:::::Seated before a table covered in a knit blue cloth, a researcher hands a young girl a peculiar device.Attached to one end is a small cardboard tube; to the other, a large clear bag.The child grasps the rig with her left hand, places her lips around the cardboard, and lets out a long, slow exhale.Good, good, good, coos the researcher.Can you do one more?The girl leaves her lips around the mouthpiece, inhales through her nose, and lets another breath go.The bag, which someone has labeled 269 in Sharpie, crinkles as it swells with air.Good!OK, all done, says the researcher as she stoppers the collection device and sets it aside.Inside the bag, hundreds of molecules are swirling aroundsome of which might just clue scientists into an infection.To find out, theyll pass her expired air through a narrow metal cylinder packed with a compound-trapping molecular sieve, seal the vessel at both ends with a twist of a wrench, and ship it from the pediatric care center in Lilongwe, Malawi to a laboratory at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.There, analytical chemists are dissecting these samples in search of a breathprinta distinctive set of compounds that could serve as the world's first breath-based test for malaria.A Malawian child practices breathing into an early version of the breath-collection device used in the study.Later versions were attached to large, clear bags that were easier for children to inflate.Indi Trehan Today, every malaria diagnosis begins with blood.In the gold standard test, doctors spread a drop on a glass slide, stain the sample, and inspect it beneath a microscope.If the parasite is present, itll show up purple against a pink backdrop of blood cells.These "blood smears" are relatively straightforward to perform, but tough to implement in rural, resource-starved parts of the world.So-called rapid diagnostic tests are an increasingly common solution.They're cheap, easy to use, and accurate.Trouble is, RDTs work by detecting a protein called HRP2, and a growing number of reports suggest Plasmodium falciparum (the deadliest malaria-causing species) is learning to not produce the molecule."It's a very tricky parasite," says Washington University microbiologist Audrey Odom John, the infectious disease expert who led the Malawi study."And now we're literally losing one of the most effective tests that we have."Fortunately, nature may have provided a workaround.Malaria is not airbornethe sickness spreads by way of mosquitoesbut researchers have started to suspect that respired air may carry clues to its transmission.Various studies suggest malaria may actually alter the molecular content of human exhalations, enticing mosquitoes to feed on infected humans and accelerating the parasites spread.But malarias capacity for mosquito mind-control could also make it a prime target for breath-based diagnosis.Back in Odom Johns Washington University laboratory, she and her team compared the molecular compounds in the breath of two groups of kids: one with malaria, the other without.They found six compounds whose concentrations varied dramatically between the groups.They were the diagnostic markers the researchers had been looking for.(Odom John declined to identify the compounds by name, as her team's study is currently under review for publication.)By summing the relative abundance of each compound, the researchers came up with a diagnosis for each child.They were right 83 percent of the time.Children at a pediatric care center in Lilongwe, Malawi practice the breath-collection procedure by inflating examination gloves.Indi Trehan That's not as accurate as blood smears or RDTs, which give correct diagnoses more than 90 percent of the time, and this first experiment tested just 35 subjectsbut it's a promising initial result.And those six compounds weren't all the researchers found.Also floating around in the breath of children with malaria were high concentrations of compounds known as terpenes.Typically associated with the aroma of plants like pine trees, terpenes are a known mosquito-attractant.That they were showing up at elevated levels in the breath of malaria patients suggests the odor may attract mosquitoes to infected humans, facilitating the parasite's spread.Its very exciting, because they've made what seems like two major discoveries in a single piece of work, says University of Alberta microbiologist Stephanie Yanow, a malaria expert and assistant scientific program chair for the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygienes annual meeting, where Odom John and her team are presenting their work this week.At the same time, she says, the terpene finding is sobering.Its showing us how clever this parasite really is.Not to mention deadly.Malaria kills upwards of 400,000 people a year, most of them children in sub-Saharan Africa, where new diagnostic methods are needed most."I'm used to seeing patients out in the middle of nowhere, where 90 percent of kids live and die," says Washington University pediatrician Indi Trehan, who has conducted clinical research in Malawi since 2007 and led the breath-collection portion of the study.A malaria breathalyzer, in a rural context, would be tremendous.Especially places where HIV is common, and there's a lot of fear surrounding blood and needles."The next steps, says Odom John, are to repeat the study in more patients and refine the diagnostic process into a device that can analyze a patient's breath on the spot.(She says her team is currently collaborating with engineers on an "eNose" similar to one under development for the diagnosis of tuberculosis.)Right now, the collection step is cheap, low-tech, and simple, requiring little more than some tubing, a cardboard mouthpiece, and a large, clear bag.Then they'll have to bring down the cost of analysis.If mosquitoes can tell whos infected with malaria, says Odom John, we should be able to, as well.
How to Build a Robot That Won't Take Over the World:::::Isaac Asimovs famous Three Laws of Roboticsconstraints on the behavior of androids and automatons meant to ensure the safety of humanswere also famously incomplete.The laws, which first appeared in his 1942 short story Runaround and again in classic works like I, Robot, sound airtight at first: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.Of course, hidden conflicts and loopholes abound (which was Asimovs point).In our current age of advanced machine-learning software and autonomous robotics, defining and implementing an airtight set of ethics for artificial intelligence has become a pressing concern for organizations like the Machine Intelligence Research Institute and OpenAI.Christoph Salge, a computer scientist currently at New York University, is taking a different approach.Instead of pursuing top-down philosophical definitions of how artificial agents should or shouldnt behave, Salge and his colleague Daniel Polani are investigating a bottom-up path, or what a robot should do in the first place, as they write in their recent paper, Empowerment as Replacement for the Three Laws of Robotics.Empowerment, a concept inspired in part by cybernetics and psychology, describes an agents intrinsic motivation to both persist within and operate upon its environment.Like an organism, it wants to survive.It wants to be able to affect the world, Salge explained.A Roomba programmed to seek its charging station when its batteries are getting low could be said to have an extremely rudimentary form of empowerment: To continue acting on the world, it must take action to preserve its own survival by maintaining a charge.Quanta Magazine About Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.Empowerment might sound like a recipe for producing the very outcome that safe-AI thinkers like Nick Bostrom fear: powerful autonomous systems concerned only with maximizing their own interests and running amok as a result.But Salge, who has studied human-machine social interactions, wondered what might happen if an empowered agent also looked out for the empowerment of another.You dont just want your robot to stay operationalyou also want it to maintain that for the human partner.Salge and Polani realized that information theory offers a way to translate this mutual empowerment into a mathematical framework that a non-philosophizing artificial agent could put into action.One of the shortcomings of the Three Laws of Robotics is that they are language-based, and language has a high degree of ambiguity, Salge said.Were trying to find something that is actually operationizable.Quanta spoke with Salge about information theory, nihilist AI and the canine model of human-robot interaction.An edited and condensed version of the conversation follows.Some technologists believe that AI is a major, even existential threat.Does the prospect of runaway AI worry you?Im a bit on the fence.I mean, I do think there are currently genuine concerns with robots and the growing influence of AI.But I think in the short term were probably more concerned about maybe job replacement, decision making, possibly a loss of democracy, a loss of privacy.Im unsure how likely it is that this kind of runaway AI will happen anytime soon.But even an AI controlling your health care system or what treatment options youre gettingwe should start to be concerned about the kind of ethical questions that arise from this.How does the concept of empowerment help us deal with these issues?I think that the idea of empowerment does fill a niche.It keeps an agent from letting a human die, but once youve satisfied this very basic bottom line, it still has a continued drive to create additional possibilities and allow the human to express themselves more and have more influence on the world.In one of Asimovs books, I think the robots just end up putting all the humans in some kind of safe containers.That would be undesirable.Whereas having our abilities to affect the world continuously enhanced seems to be a much more interesting end goal to reach.You tested your ideas on virtual agents in a video game environment.What happened?An agent motivated by its own empowerment would jump out of the way of a projectile, or keep from falling into a hole, or avoid any number of situations that would result in its losing mobility, dying or being damaged in a way that would reduce its operationality.It just keeps itself running.When it was paired with a human player that it was supposed to empower as well as itself, we observed that the virtual robot would keep a certain distance so as not to block the humans movement.It doesnt block you in; it doesnt stand in a doorway thats then impossible for you to pass through.We basically saw that this effect keeps the companion sticking close to you so it can help you out.It led to behavior where it could take the lead or follow.For example, we also created a scenario where we had a laser barrier that would be harmful for the human, but not harmful for the robot.If the human in this game gets closer to the laser, suddenly there is more and more of an empowerment-driven incentive for the robot to block the laser.The incentive gets stronger when the human stands right next to it, implying, I want to cross this now.And the robot would actually block the laser by standing in front of it.Did the agents engage in any unintended behavior, like the kind that emerges from the three laws in Asimovs fiction?We initially got good behavior.For example, the virtual robot takes out enemies that are trying to kill you.Once in a while it might jump in front of a bullet for you, if this is the only way to save you.But one thing that was a bit surprising to us, at the beginning, was that it was also very afraid of you.The reason for this has to do with its local forward model: Basically, it looks at how certain action sequences two or three steps into the future affect the world, for both you and itself.So as a first, easy step, we programmed this model to assume that the player would act randomly.But in practice, that meant that the agent was essentially acting under the assumption that the human player is kind of a psychopath, and so at any point in time that human could decide to, for example, fire at the agent.So the agent would always be very, very careful to be in positions where the human couldnt kill it.We had to fix this, so we modeled something we call a trust assumption.Basically, the companion agent acts under the assumption that the human will only choose those actions that will not remove the agents own empowerment which is probably a more natural model for a companion anyway.The other thing we noticed in the game was that, if you had, say, 10 health points, the companion wasnt really concerned with you losing the first eight or nine of theseand would even shoot you once in a while just for laughs.There, again, we realized that theres a disconnect between the world we live in and the model in a computer game.Once we modeled a limitation of ability resulting from health loss, this problem went away.But it also could have been dealt with by designing the local-forward model in a way that makes it able to look further into the future than just a few steps.If the agent were able to look really far into the future, it would see that having more health points might be helpful for the things to come.Whereas if the loss of spare health points doesnt make a difference to my empowerment right now The agent basically goes, Oh, I could not shoot him, or I could shoot him.No difference.And sometimes it shoots you.Which of course is a problem.I do not condone the random shooting of players.Weve added a fix so the virtual robot cares a bit more about your empowerment than about its own.How do you make these concepts precise?If you think about agents as control systems, you can think in terms of information: Stuff happens in the world, and this somehow affects you.Were not just talking about information in terms of things you perceive, but as any kind of influenceit could be matter, anything flowing back and forth between the world and you.It might be the temperature affecting you, or nutrients entering your body.Any kind of thing that permeates this boundary between the world and the agent carries information in.And in the same way, the agent can affect the outside world in numerous ways, which also outputs information.You can look at this flow as a channel capacity, which is a concept from information theory.You have high empowerment if you have different actions you can take that will lead to different results.If any of these capabilities become worse, then your empowerment goes downbecause the loss of capability corresponds with a quantifiable reduction in this channel capacity between you and the environment.This is the core idea.How much does the agent need to know for empowerment to work?Empowerment has the advantage that it can be applied even if your knowledge isnt complete.The agent does need a model of how its actions are going to affect the world, but it doesnt need a complete understanding of the world and all its intricacies.In contrast to some approaches that try to model everything in the world as best they can and then try to figure out what their actions actually mean, here you only need to figure out how your actions affect your own perception.You dont have to figure out where everything is; you can have an agent that explores the world.It does things and tries to figure out how its actions affect the world.As this model grows, the agent also gets better at figuring out how empowered it is.Youve tested this in virtual environments.Why not the real world?The main obstacle to scaling this model up, and why were not putting this on any real robot yet, is that its hard to compute the channel capacity of an agent and a human far forward in time in a rich environment like the real world.There are a lot of initiatives under way to make this more efficient.Im optimistic, but currently it is a computational concern.Thats why we applied the framework to a computer game companion, which of course is a much more simplistic form, making the computational issues easier to solve.It sounds as if empowerment, ideally, would make our machines act like really powerful service dogs.I actually know some roboticists who are deliberately modeling companion behavior after dogs.I mean, having robots treat us like our dogs treat us is probably a future we can all live with.Original story reprinted with

Green Bank Observatory Embraces Its Alien-Hunting Future:::::Its a fallish day in the Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia, the rural home of Green Bank Observatory and the worlds largest fully steerable telescope.Rippled clouds hang low over the sites hulking 100-meter radio dish, itself undergirded and overhung by bright white scaffolding.The browning leaves are nearly gone.And the visitor center director, Sherry McCarty, has agreed to give me the astronomy centers new SETI tour ($40, reservations required).McCarty leads us toward a Jeep Libertydiesel, so spark plugs wont create radio waves that interfere with the telescopes observationsand hands me a hard hat.Learning about the history of alien hunting is risky business, after all.Soon, were driving toward the US GOVERNMENT PRIVATE PROPERTY gate, beyond which radio-blasting cell phones are totally, 100 percent prohibited.I check my back pocket to make sure I left my phone behind.Highlighting SETI history is kind of a departure for Green Bank, which has tried, if not to distance itself from extraterrestrial excitation, then to emphasize its work in more traditional radio astronomy: gas clouds, galaxies, supernova remnants, black holes, and other staid stuff.When I taught students here between 2010 and 2012, I sometimes led the regular site tours.People would often ask me, So have you found aliens yet?Each time, Id let out a silent scream.Of course that would have come first in my spiel and also in all other conversations everand besides, the observatory didnt even really do SETI work at the time.Like me, most comms people at the observatory spoke of SETI as more of a comma than an exclamation point in Green Banks history.Harrison Shull/Getty Images But that changedquickly, dramaticallyin 2016, when the billionaire-backed Breakthrough Listen project bought a bunch of time on the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope.Now, a significant fraction of the observatorys funding and sky-scanning time do go toward looking for extraterrestrial intelligence.That was the reason for the tour, says McCarty.We could finally say we were looking.Of course, that means Green Bank has to abandon some astronomical objects of interestin favor of alien-hunting.Most of Green Banks science projects have, historically, happened through a kind of democratic process.Under a National Science Foundation policy called open skies, anyone can submit a proposal outlining what theyd like to do with the flagship telescope.A committee ranks those ideas according to scientific merit, doling out telescope time starting at the top of the list.But in 2012, the NSF began to talk about divesting itself from Green Bank, and spending its money instead on newer telescopes.With an ever-decreasing budget from the NSFdown to 60 percent of operating costs in 2017, and just 30 percent in 2018the observatory needed alternative funding.So when entrepreneur Yuri Milners Breakthrough Listen came to town with millions of dollars and 10-year backing, Green Bank bit (according to investigations of the Paradise Papers, first released Sunday, Kremlin money helped back Milner's lucrative investments in Twitter and Facebook).Today, Breakthroughs SETI work uses (and pays for) about 20 percent of the telescopes time.But even moonshot-scale funding cant magically create more hours in a day.That 20 percent had to come from somewhere.And it came from partially closing the skies.
Half of US adults have high blood pressure in new guidelines:::::New medical guidelines lower the threshold for high blood pressure, adding 30 million Americans to those who have the condition.That means now nearly half of U.S. adults have it.High pressure has long meant a top reading of at least 140 or a bottom one of 90.That drops to 130 over 80 in advice announced Monday by major heart groups.WOMAN IN NEED OF SECOND DOUBLE-LUNG TRANSPLANT CELEBRATES DREAM WEDDING The change results in an additional 14 percent of U.S. adults with high pressure, but doctors say only 2 percent of these newly added people need medication.The rest are urged to try healthier lifestyles first.High blood pressure raises the risk for heart disease, stroke and other problems.The guidelines were announced at an American Heart Association conference in Anaheim, California.
Can your tongue tell you if you're sick?:::::Hows your tongue feeling today?That question might sound silly, but your tongue can actually tell you a lot about your health.Chances are that you hardly notice it half the time, but it might change colors or hurt a little if somethings not quite right.Take a look at a few health problems that your tongue might be telling you about.First of all, a healthy tongue will have a light pink color to it and be covered with tiny bumps called papillae.PARENTS OF 10-MONTH-OLD BOY WHO WEIGHS AS MUCH AS A 9-YEAR-OLD SEEK HELP You wont usually see a strong color or spots and dots coating a normal tongue, and you definitely shouldnt feel tingling, burning or pain.If you do, these could be signs of a health problem that youll want to look into.Common Tongue Problems: Fortunately, tongue problems have specific characteristics that help you zero in on the true health issue.You might see: Strawberry Red What it means: Unless you just ate a carton of strawberries or a lollipop, a bright red tongue is not a normal color.Theres a few possibilities that might be causing it.Vitamin deficiency Your tongue might be turning a shiny red because its losing taste buds.This happens when youre not getting enough of certain vitamins, namely B-12, folic acid or iron.Youll need to supplement or eat more foods that contain these vitamins to solve the problem.Scarlet fever If youre red tongue is accompanying a high fever, you should get checked for this bacterial condition.You might see scarlet fever pop up with strep throat.Chronic dryness If you have an overly dry mouth, you might see an abnormal red.In this case, youll just need to take care of the symptoms with over-the-counter or prescription medications.White All Over What it means: If youre noticing what looks like a lumpy blanket of white all over your tongue, you may have a yeast infection (or oral thrush).Most of the time, oral thrush happens because too many good bacteria are killed by antibiotics, letting yeast take over instead.You do need to see your doctor for prescription anti-fungal medication.White patches What it means: You might notice a painless white patch on or underneath your tongue, a spot called leukoplakia.For the most part, you dont have anything to worry about.5 SUBTLE SIGNS OF KIDNEY CANCER However, especially if youre a smoker, these white spots can be a form of pre-cancer, warning you to take precautions.Be sure to get any abnormal patches cleared by a doctor.Cracks or wrinkles What it means: Concerned about deep cracks in the middle or sides of your tongue?What about wrinkles or ridges?You shouldnt fret over these pesky ridges that often get more pronounced with age.In themselves, theyre usually harmless.However, you may develop infections if you dont clean thoroughly enough and if the ridges are deep.Get any abnormal symptoms checked out, such as a foul smell or tongue pain.Painful sores What it means: If you have a painful sore in your mouth, its likely a canker sore, or mouth ulcer.Theyre usually round, shallow and mostly white with a red rim.If left alone, they usually heal themselves within two weeks, but youll want to stay away from spicy or acidic foods until then.Experts dont know exactly why canker sores happen, but many think that theyre related to stress or damage to mouth tissue.Red bumps What it means: Sometimes, you might notice red bumps forming underneath your tongue or on the top or sides.While bumps on the top may be an inflammation of the papillae, red bumps that dont go away could be a sign of oral cancer.Treat them seriously and schedule a medical evaluation.Black or brown hair What it means: Are you worried that your tongue is turning into a hairy monster?The black or brown fuzz is actually not hair.It happens when cells on your tongue multiply before your body can shed them, and then they trap in bacteria from food or drinks more easily.At the same time, the bacteria growth is likely due to poor hygiene but sometimes signifies poorly managed diabetes or antibiotic overuse.Make sure that youre brushing your tongue and your teeth several times per day to get rid of the problem.IS IT BROKEN OR SPRAINED?WHEN TO SEEK HELP Your tongue says a lot about your health and can signal you of underlying problems like infection or poor hygiene.Normally, you wont notice anything out the ordinary, but you might see a change in color or feel some pain if somethings wrong.The next time youre brushing your teeth, take a look at your tongue in the mirror and hear what it has to tell you about your health.Your tongue says a lot about your health and can signal you of underlying problems like infection or poor hygiene.Normally, you wont notice anything out the ordinary, but you might

Bogus pain creams are costing taxpayers millions -- and their lives:::::A Mississippi doctor was hit last month with a 16-count indictment for allegedly defrauding a government health care program of more than $2.3 million by prescribing unnecessary and highly suspect compound pain creams to patients he never examined.The details in Albert Diazs indictment highlight the growing scams carried out by medical professionals and pharmacists to hock phony pain ointments that only function to bilk taxpayers of millions of dollars and, in some cases, leave patients dead.In numerous ploys reminiscent of 19th century snake oil salesmen, pharmacy owners and marketers are bribing or giving kickbacks to doctors for writing spurious prescriptions to Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare patients for costly, dangerous and unneeded pain and scar creams.These compounded ointments many of which have been found to contain a powerful anesthetic and sedative known as ketamine have led to at least two deaths and can cost the government up to $28,000 per cream container.The snake oil for the 21st century is currently being peddled by compounding pharmacies with claims of miraculous pain creams, wrote Carol Crisci, an attorney at Chartwell Law Offices.If these creams worked, and actually reduced patient reliance on oral narcotics, the high price might be warranted.The problem is that there is little evidence that the creams or many of their expensive ingredients actually work when rubbed into the skin.Once the predominant form of pharmacy in the U.S. before the advent of mass drug manufacturing in the 1950s, compounding pharmacies mix medications and ingredients based on a doctors prescription for strength and dosage.While this allows pharmacists to specifically tailor a medication for patients who may have an allergy to certain ingredients or need a higher or lower dosage than produced, it can also lead to scams and abuse like the fraudulent pain creams.After more than 50 people died from fungal meningitis and another 680 were sickened after receiving injections in 2012 of a contaminated steroid made by the New England Compounding Center, the Food and Drug Administration investigated and found 30 compounding pharmacies across 18 states with numerous unsafe practices.In the case of the pain cream schemes, which have been unearthed from New Jersey to California, all follow a similar pattern, with doctors and compound pharmacies working hand-in-hand to prescribe patients these bogus ointments and reaping the financial benefits when the government paid the tab.Pharmacists also have been known to change the ingredients and exploit the narrow legitimate medical uses of the creams to keep ahead of the law."The snake oil for the 21st century is currently being peddled by compounding pharmacies with claims of miraculous pain creams."- Carol Crisci, attorney at Chartwell Law Offices In two active cases in Texas, pharmacies allegedly defrauded the government of more than $180 million.In one case, the Dallas Morning News reported that Fort Worths Ability Pharmacy spent $15 to make a container of cream and charged $28,000 to the government, with federal prosecutors claiming the pharmacy took in $1 million a day on these compound medications alone.There was no difference in any of the creams given to different patients and many of the patients prescribed the ointments did not have any pain or scars to treat.This is yet another shocking example of how unmitigated greed can spawn a fraud so brazen that it almost takes your breath away, John Parker, the U.S. attorney in Dallas, told the Dallas Morning News.I would suggest that the costs of playing these games far outweigh whatever short-term gains are realized, no matter their size.More nefarious than the financial fraud behind the schemes is the sometimes deadly consequences of taking these creams and ointments.A baby in California died in 2012 after accidently ingesting her mothers compound cream, which was ultimately linked to a shady kickback scheme.Two years later, Desiree Ford, a 22-year-old Houston woman, died only hours after applying a pain cream to her skin.The Harris County medical examiner ruled that her death was caused by the toxic effects of two drugs in the pain cream.Fords father, Richard, is suing the pharmacy that supplied his daughter with the cream, while the doctor who prescribed it without having talked to or examined her surrendered his medical license.Theyre just terrible people, Ford said.They make so much money off this, it could be their full-time job.
Sammy Sosa unrecognizable in tweets showing baseball great with lightened skin:::::Baseball legend Sammy Sosa sent Twitter into a tizzy last week, after photos of the former Chicago Cubs slugger appearing several shades lighter surfaced during his trip to London.Sosa, who has been plagued by skin bleaching rumors in the past, once told Univision post-retirement that he uses a skin-softening cream each night that also whitens his skin.Its a bleaching cream that I apply before going to bed and whitens my skin some, Sosa, 49, told Univision in 2009.Its a cream that I have, that I use to soften [my skin], but has bleached me some.Im not a racist, I live my life happily.At the time, Sosa said the cream, along with the bright TV lights, made his skin appear lighter than it is.He did not specify why he was using the cream, but it came at a time when many were linking his changing looks to steroid use.I dont think I look like Michael Jackson, he said.PARENTS OF 10-MONTH-OLD BOY WHO WEIGHS AS MUCH AS A 9-YEAR-OLD SEEK HELP While hes yet to address the latest photos, Sosa previously revealed the cream was purchased in Europe, but did not mention it by name.Over the summer, fans went wild after he made a brief appearance during ESPN Deportes coverage of the home run derby wearing a pink outfit with noticeably lighter skin.The Dominican Republic native did not address speculation about his skin color then, either.While some were quick to make light of Sosas latest looks and compared him to cartoon characters and other celebrities accused of bleaching their skin, others questioned his mental health status.Can I just say that the stuff where people make fun of Sammy Sosas lighter-skinned appearance makes me deeply uncomfortable?Not even from a racial perspective, but mostly from a health/mental health perspective.Lay off, Twitter user Brett Taylor tweeted.Idk what Sammy Sosa is going thru at this point in his life but this picture is terrifying, Twitter user Brandom Williams wrote.
Parents of 10-month-old boy who weighs as much as a 9-year-old seek help:::::A 10-month-old boy who weighs as much as a typical 9-year-old child is potentially in danger of dying as his parents scramble to raise money for potential treatment.Luis Manuel Gonzales, who weighs around 62 lbs., is thought to have Prader-Willi syndrome, Metro.co.uk reported.His parents fear that if the diagnosis is confirmed, they will not be able to afford the proper hormone treatments, causing their son's weight to continue to balloon with the potential to cause death.The genetic condition causes an insatiable appetite, which leads to chronic overeating and obesity.It can also cause intellectual impairment and learning disabilities, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.WOMAN IN NEED OF SECOND DOUBLE-LUNG TRANSPLANT CELEBRATES DREAM WEDDING The family, of Tecoman, Mexio, said Luis was born weighing about 8 lbs., and that they began noticing his rapid weight gain when he was about one month old.Initially, his mother suspected that it had to with him being breastfed.After only one month we noticed that clothes did not fit him and we had to dress him in clothes for a 1-year-old, and even a 2-year-old, Isabel Pantoja, the babys mother, told Metro.co.uk.We saw our baby gain weight so fast.Sometimes he could not sleep because he felt like he was suffocating due to his weight.Luis would be the first recorded case of Prader-Willi syndrome in the city, and his parents worry what it would mean for his future.In some cases, kids have died because of a heart attack due to being so overweight, Mario Gonzales, Luis father, told the news outlet.
Woman in need of second double-lung transplant celebrates dream wedding:::::Just one week after being told that she wasnt a good candidate for a double-lung transplant, 27-year-old Caleigh Haber scratched plans to celebrate her engagement to Bryan Takayama, and instead married him in a ceremony focused on making the most of the time that they have together.Neither of us wanted to waste a day alive not being all in with one another, Haber, who has cystic fibrosis, told KTVU.Harber has already undergone a double-lung transplant, but has spent the past several months fighting as her body rejects the donated organs.About a week ahead of the planned Oct. 28 engagement party, Haber had met with her transplant team to discuss her options and was told that she wasnt a good candidate for a second surgery.It was then that she and her fianc, Bryan Takayama, decided to forego the party and get married instead.In an Instagram post honoring the day, Haber, who has over 72,000 followers, reposted part of their vows in which she promised to stick by Takayama even when the Ohio State Buckeyes lose, and apologized for not being able to be in his life forever.WIDOW CLAIMS 9/11 TOXINS GAVE HER TEACHER HUSBAND CANCER Im sorry, my love, that you wont always have me in your life, but I promise you every minute Im alive I will dedicate myself to you, Haber said.I will never stop fighting to stay alive.You inspire me to fight harder, to put myself through struggle, to look past chaos, to drink ensures and to take my medication.As the pair, who met last year at a friends wedding, scrambled to make arrangements, others stepped forward to cover the cost of a venue, food, Habers dress, hair and make-up, KTVU reported.They shared their first dance as husband and wife while Jason Mrazs Im Yours played.It was a chance for us to intimately share a few moments to a song that holds true importance to us and just for us to be us, Takayama told KTVU.Haber said she was having trouble breathing near the end of the song, so Takayama picked her up and held her until the end.A GoFundMe page was set up to send the newlyweds on a honeymoon to Hawaii, which was approved by Habers doctor as long as a medical team is on-call for the duration of the trip.She is also meeting with other high-risk transplant centers to discuss other therapies that will prolong her lifespan.Right now I cannot accept that possibly a second transplant wont happen, Haber told KTVU.
Police officers visit Massachusetts boy with brain cancer:::::Police in a Massachusetts town paid a special visit to their number one fan a 2-year-old boy battling brain cancer.Sandra Cordero says her son, Edison, loves the police.She says she went to the Chelsea Police Department on Sunday hoping just one officer would stop by their home.WIDOW CLAIMS 9/11 TOXINS GAVE HER TEACHER HUSBAND CANCER Patrol cars filled her street just a few minutes later.Cordero says the entire day shift showed up to bring Edison gifts.Police officers let Edison sit in a cruiser and talk over the radio.WBZ-TV reports Edison's father Frank Cordero thanked the officers, saying his son was "so happy" when they showed up.
Widow claims 9/11 toxins gave her teacher husband cancer:::::The widow of a retired Stuyvesant HS chemistry teacher who died of a rare brain cancer in 2006 says exposure to toxins from the World Trade Center site killed her husband.He died from 9/11.My goodness, of course!said Drewann Rodney, the wife of late Stuyvesant teacher Robert Rodney.The chemistry teacher was only 58 when his health declined rapidly and it was discovered he had inoperable cancer in the lining of his brain.He died on Feb. 24, 2006 less than five years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.The Post on Friday reported that at least 12 former students who attended schools near Ground Zero half from Stuyvesant now say they are battling 9/11-related cancers and lung diseases after being exposed to toxins in and around their classrooms.Lawyer Michael Barasch, who represents the graduates, said they are an emerging cancer cluster.A disturbing number of faculty members at Stuyvesant also have gotten sick or died of cancer, retired economics teacher Gary Brandwein told The Post.In an unverified tally, he claims as many as 25 have died of cancer one of them being Rodney.I think 9/11 was the trigger for Robert Rodneys cancer and passing, Brandwein said.Drewann Rodney recalls her husband driving back to their New Jersey home after the attacks and seeing his Nissan Maxima covered with white dust.Robert cleaned the car himself.I said, Bob, please take the car to the car wash, she said.But Drewann said Rodney rarely talked about 9/11 and its aftermath.Click for more from the New York Post.
Women less likely than men to receive CPR from passerby, study says:::::If you suffer cardiac arrest in public, just being a woman means youre less likely to receive potentially life-saving CPR from a passerby, according to a new study.One theory to explain the discrepancy: Strangers may be reluctant to undo a womans clothing and touch her breasts, even if it means they can save her life, says a lead researcher on the study.This is not a time to be squeamish, said Dr. Benjamin Abella of the University of Pennsylvania, who urged strangers to get over their inhibitions and help in an emergency.Because it's a life-and-death situation, he said."This is not a time to be squeamish.Because it's a life-and-death situation."- Dr. Benjamin Abella, University of Pennsylvania Only 39 percent of women suffering cardiac arrest in a public place received CPR versus 45 percent of men, and men were 23 percent more likely to survive, the study found.The study involved nearly 20,000 cases around the U.S. and was the first to examine gender differences in receiving heart help from the public versus professional responders.It can be kind of daunting thinking about pushing hard and fast on the center of a woman's chest" and some people may fear they are hurting her, lead researcher Audrey Blewer, also of the University of Pennsylvania, said.Abella said would-be Good Samaritans need not worry about touching the cardiac patient inappropriately.You put your hands on the sternum, which is the middle of the chest.In theory, you're touching in between the breasts, he said.The study was discussed Sunday at an American Heart Association conference in Anaheim, Calif. Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops pumping, usually because of a rhythm problem.More than 350,000 Americans each year suffer one in settings other than a hospital.About 90 percent of them die, but CPR can double or triple survival odds.Researchers had no information on rescuers or why they may have been less likely to help women.But no gender difference was seen in CPR rates for people who were stricken at home, where a rescuer is more likely to know the person needing help.The findings suggest that CPR training may need to be improved.Even that may be subtly biased toward males practice mannequins are usually male torsos, Blewer said."All of us are going to have to take a closer look at this" gender issue, said the Mayo Clinic's Dr. Roger White, who co-directs the paramedic program for the city of Rochester, Minn.He said he has long worried that large breasts may impede proper placement of defibrillator pads if women need a shock to restore normal heart rhythm.The Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health funded the study.The Associated Press contributed to this story.
Target pulls 2 fidget spinners amid lead concerns:::::Target pulled two models of fidget spinners from store shelves and its website over the weekend after a public advocacy group said it found high levels of lead in the popular products.Fidget Wild Premium Spinner in brass and metal, sold by Target and distributed by Bulls i Toy, LLC, were pulled from store shelves starting Friday, USA Today reported.A Target spokeswoman said in a statement to Fox News that the products followed all U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission guidelines, but were removed based on the concerns raised.While these two products comply with all CPSC guidelines for fidget spinners, based on the concerns raised, were removing them from our assortment, the spokeswoman said in a statement.Additionally, were working closely with our vendors to ensure all of the fidget spinners carried at Target meet the CPSCs guidelines for childrens products.The fidget spinners were not available on Targets website as of Sunday.U.S. PIRG, a public advocacy group, released a report on Thursday detailing the amount of lead in the toys and demanding Target and Bulls i Toy remove the products and issue a public statement on the alleged high levels of lead in the toys.The group said tests conducted showed the items contained between 520 parts per million and 33,000 ppm of lead.The federal requirement for children's toys states that lead content cannot exceed 100 ppm.U.S. PIRG said when it alerted CPSC about the lead discovery, the agency said the fidget spinners were considered general use products, not toys.The spinners were not required to meet federal lead standards.U.S. PIRG argued that though the fidget spinners were marketed for people 14 or older, Target also said on its website that it was available for children 6 or older.The items were also found in the aisles of several stores, according to the report.The CPSC guidelines state that some fidget spinners could be childrens products.U.S. PIRG said in a statement on Saturday that it was pleased Target removed the fidget spinners from store shelves.Now, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CSPC), Target and its supplier Bulls i Toy need to ensure that the products are recalled, so that people who have already purchased the products wont suffer any health consequences from playing with these toxic toys, the group wrote on its website.
She Took On Colombia’s Soda Industry. Then She Was Silenced.:::::But public health organizations, including the W.H.O., cite soda taxes as one of the most effective policy tools for cutting consumption of what nutritionists call a liquid candy that has contributed to an epidemic of obesity and related health conditions around the world.Dr. Kathryn Backholer, an expert on the issue at Deakin University in Australia, said taxes on soda were low-hanging fruit in the fight against obesity, diabetes and other weight-related diseases because such drinks are easily categorized to tax and sensible to target because they have little or no nutritional value.Dr. Backholer and other experts said the turning point for soda tax proponents came in 2014, when Mexico Coca-Colas biggest consumer market by per capita consumption approved a 10 percent tax.Mexico also showcased how dirty the fight could get.Last year, numerous advocates of a proposal to double Mexicos tax to 20 percent received strings of upsetting and fraudulent texts from unknown numbers.One man got a message saying his daughter had been seriously injured; another found a text saying his wife was having an affair; a third received a link to a funeral home.Spyware was found on the phones.The proposal failed.Elsewhere in the world, soda companies have assiduously worked their government connections and economic clout.In internal company emails leaked to an American watchdog group last year, Coke executives described strategies for winning over government ministers and other officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, Portugal, and regions of Spain.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Australian Beverages Council wrote in its 2016 annual report that fighting a soft drinks tax has been consuming vast amounts of resources, and that our learnings from other markets through our international network tells us that these types of threats must be constantly challenged before they get before a parliament for debate.In Colombia, where soda is often cheaper than bottled water, the soda-tax fight took place in a key market for beverage makers.Sales volume of carbonated drinks here has climbed more than 25 percent over the past 15 years; during that same time in the United States, it fell 12 percent, according to Euromonitor, a market research firm.Coke and Pepsi were far less visible in the Colombia battle, leaving the big national beverage company, Postobn, in the spotlight.Postobn, a drinks maker and distributor for Pepsi, is part of a huge conglomerate that includes sugar cane growers, sugar mills and the countrys biggest media company, RCN Televisin, which helped disseminate the anti-tax message.Postobn and RCN declined interview requests.The stage was set for a clash between a powerful industry and a stubborn public advocate.Showdown Over an Ad In early 2016, Colombia, a nation of 49 million, was facing the unfamiliar prospect of stability and peace.After decades of civil war and narco-terrorism, Colombians were enjoying the fruits of an aggressive United States-backed military campaign that had largely decimated the countrys drug cartels.Unemployment was near historic lows, the poverty rate was dropping and millions were hopeful about the possibility of lasting peace with the countrys main rebel group, the FARC.In March 2016, the countrys health minister, Alejandro Gaviria Uribe, proposed a 20 percent tax on soda and sugar-sweetened beverages the equivalent of about 10 cents on a liter bottle that became part of a larger tax overhaul backed by Colombias president and the Ministry of Finance.For the first time in our lives, we thought we might become a normal country and be able to deal with issues other than violence, said Diana Guarnizo, a lawyer with Dejusticia, a rights group that helped promote the soda tax.Here we were, an organization that had dealt with peace, violence, land reform and gross injustice, and suddenly we had the luxury to talk about what mothers are putting in their childrens lunchboxes.The measure was designed to inject $340 million a year into Colombias chronically underfunded national health care system, but Mr. Gaviria had a larger goal: to dampen soda consumption in a country with an obesity rate that had tripled since 1980 to 19 percent of adults.The fastest growth had occurred among Colombian youth from ages 5 to 17.Each year, 4,000 people age 30 to 70 die from obesity-related illnesses like heart disease and diabetes, the Health Ministry said.
Under New Guidelines, Millions More Americans Will Need to Lower Blood Pressure:::::If Americans act on the guidelines and lower their blood pressure by exercising more and eating a healthier diet, or with drug therapy, they could drive an already falling death rate from heart attacks and stroke even lower, experts said.Now, high blood pressure will be defined as 130/80 millimeters of mercury or greater for anyone with a significant risk of heart attack or stroke.The previous guidelines defined high blood pressure as 140/90.(The first number describes the pressure on blood vessels when the heart contracts, and the second refers to the pressure as the heart relaxes between beats.)Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death among Americans.The new criteria, the first official diagnostic revision since 2003, result from growing evidence that blood pressure far lower than had been considered normal greatly reduces the chances of heart attack and stroke, as well as the overall risk of death.Recent research indicates this is true even among older people for whom intensive treatment had been thought too risky.That finding, from a large federal study in 2015, caught many experts by surprise and set the stage for the new revision.That calculation must be individualized, and experts are recommending that patients use a calculator developed by the guidelines committee at ccccalculator.ccctracker.com.Nearly half of all American adults, and nearly 80 percent of those aged 65 and older, will find that they qualify and will need to take steps to reduce their blood pressure.Even under the relatively more lenient standard that had prevailed for years, close to half of patients did not manage to get their blood pressure down to normal.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Is it going to affect a lot of people, and is it going to be hard to meet those blood pressure goals?asked Dr. Raymond Townsend, director of the hypertension program at Penn Medicine.The answer is a pretty significant yes.According to the new guidelines, anyone with at least a 10 percent risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next decade should aim for blood pressure below 130/80.But simply being age 65 or older brings a 10 percent risk of cardiovascular trouble, and so effectively everyone over that age will have to shoot for the new target.Younger patients with this level of risk include those with conditions like heart disease, kidney disease or diabetes.The new standard will apply to them, as well.People whose risk of heart attack or stroke is less than 10 percent will be told to aim for blood pressure below 140/90, a more lenient standard, and to take medications if necessary to do so.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If there is any good news for patients here, it is that nearly all the drugs used to treat high blood pressure are generic now.Many cost pennies a day, and most people can take them without side effects.In formulating the guidelines, the expert committee reviewed more than 1,000 research reports.But the change is due largely to convincing data from a federal study published in 2015.That study, called Sprint, explored whether markedly lower blood pressure in older people lower than researchers had ever tried to establish might be both achievable and beneficial.The investigators assigned more than 9,300 men and women ages 50 and older who were at high risk of heart disease to one of two targets: a systolic pressure (the higher of the two blood pressure measures) of less than 120, or a systolic pressure of less than 140.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In participants who were assigned to get their systolic pressures below 120, the incidence of heart attacks, heart failure and strokes fell by a third, and the risk of death fell by nearly a quarter.Those patients ended up taking three drugs on average, instead of two, yet experienced no more side effects or complications than subjects in the other group.Some experts in geriatrics had expected many more complications among older patients receiving more intense treatment, especially increased dizziness, falls and dehydration.Instead, the benefits for older people were impressive.With a lower risk of heart attacks and strokes, they were more likely to maintain their independence.They had half the rate of disability, said Dr. Jeff Williamson, head of the Sticht Center on Aging at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center and the only geriatrician on the committee drawing up the new guidelines.But more intensive drug treatment in so many more patients may increase rates of kidney disease, some experts fear.In the Sprint trial, the incidence of acute kidney injury was twice as high in the group receiving drugs to reduce their systolic pressure to 120.Although the lower goal was better for the heart, it wasnt better for the kidney, said Dr. Townsend of Penn Medicine, who is a kidney specialist.So yeah, Im worried.While agreeing that lower blood pressure is better, Dr. J. Michael Gaziano, a preventive cardiologist at Brigham and Womens Hospital and the VA Boston, worries about having doctors and patients fixating on a particular goal.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its true, he said, that doctors ought to be more aggressive in treating people at high risk.But, he added, If a patient comes in with a blood pressure of 180, I will not get him to 130.Lifestyle changes like diet and exercise can help many patients lower blood pressure.But many of the newly diagnosed are likely to wind up on drugs, said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale University.This is a big change that will end up labeling many more people with hypertension and recommending drug treatment for many more people, he said.The current treatment strategy has not been so successful for many patients, he noted.How they tolerate drugs, whether they want to pursue lower levels, are all choices and should not be dictated to them, said Dr. Krumholz.Or we will have the same situation as today many prescriptions that go unfilled and pills untaken.
The Secret to Long Life? It May Lurk in the DNA of the Oldest Among Us:::::The full genetic sequences of Ms. Michelson, Mr. Harris and Ms. Morano are among some three dozen genomes of North American, Caribbean and European supercentenarians being made available this week by a nonprofit called Betterhumans to any researcher who wants to dive in.A few additional genomes come from people who died at 107, 108 or 109.If unusual patterns in their three billion pairs of As, Cs, Gs and Ts the nucleobases that make up all genomes can be shown to have prolonged their lives and protected their health, the logic goes, it is conceivable that a drug or gene therapy could be devised to replicate the effects in the rest of us.I hope you find something that does someone some good, said Clarence Matthews, 110, who allowed his blood to be drawn as a final contribution to the database last year at his Indian Wells, Calif., home while I watched at his side.One in Five Million Photo The rare cache of supercentenarian genomes, the largest yet to be sequenced and made public, comes as studies of garden-variety longevity have yielded few solid clues to healthy aging.Lifestyle and luck, it seems, still factor heavily into why people live into their 90s and 100s.To the extent that they have a genetic advantage, it appears to come partly from having inherited fewer than usual DNA variations known to raise the risk of heart disease, Alzheimers disease and other afflictions.That is not enough, some researchers say, to explain what they call truly rare survival, or why supercentenarians are more uniformly healthy than centenarians in their final months and years.Rather than having won dozens of hereditary coin tosses with DNA variations that are less bad, scientists suggest, supercentenarians may possess genetic code that actively protects them from aging.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the effort to find that code has been challenged, as a group of leading longevity researchers put it in a recent academic paper, in part by the difficulties in acquiring supercentenarian DNA.The New England Centenarian Study, one of a handful of longevity research groups around the world focusing on supercentenarians, now turns down prospective DNA donors under age 103: We tell them theyre too young, said Dr. Thomas Perls, the studys director.The DNA sequences being released this week were acquired almost single-handedly by James Clement, 61, the founder of a company advised by the prominent Harvard geneticist George Church.A professed citizen-scientist, Mr. Clement collected blood, skin or saliva from supercentenarians in 14 states and seven countries over a six-year period.Many were still gardening, arguing, driving and flirting.Ms. Michelson, for one, was fond of reading and reciting Shakespeare.The usefulness of such a small group for a genetic study is unclear, which is one reason Mr. Clements company, now defunct, has turned into a crowdsourcing project.Complex traits like height, body mass index and disease risk phenotypes, as they are known in genetics-speak typically arise from a combination of hundreds of places in the genome where the DNA alphabet differs between individuals.Zeroing in on which variations affect which phenotypes requires the statistical power of tens of thousands of DNA samples almost certainly a dealbreaker when it comes to supercentenarians, whose verified number, worldwide, hovers at around 150.On large swaths of the planet, where birth records are sketchy or nonexistent, identifying verified supercentenarians is virtually impossible.In the United States, researchers say supercentenarians account for about one in five million people.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Amateur genealogists dedicated to validating the ages of the worlds oldest people estimate that even the unverified total comes to only about 1,000.Still, some researchers hope that despite the limited number of available genomes, it will be possible to identify the secret sauce of supercentenarians with methods used to uncover the genetic basis for other rare conditions.No one quite knows how many genomes might be necessary.This is what we call an extreme phenotype, said Dr. Church, who ultimately arranged for the genomes to be sequenced so that Mr. Clement could release them through a nonprofit.The farther out you go on the bell curve, the more likely you are to find something, even with a small sample size.As the goal of slowing aging to extend human health span has gained traction in the scientific mainstream, research has largely been limited to animal studies.A secretive Google spinoff called Calico, for California Life Company, is said to be scrutinizing the genome of the naked mole rat, celebrated for a life span 10 times longer than that of most of its rat cousins.Federally funded scientists are testing a drug on monkeys based on an experiment that doubled the lives of roundworms.And in laboratories across the world, the markers of age in over-the-hill mice, rats and turquoise killifish are, sometimes, being reversed.But what works in shorter-lived organisms often does not translate to humans, whose average life span in developed countries is approaching 80 years.So despite the limitations of Mr. Clements database, several prominent researchers have already expressed interest in it.This could show the utility of starting a bigger collection, said Paola Sebastiani, a longevity researcher at Boston University.Advertisement Continue reading the main story An account of what Mr. Clement calls the Supercentenarian Research Project offers a glimpse at what that might entail, including perseverance, compassion and a sense of humor that trends toward dark.Life or Death It was an inauspicious start, Mr. Clement admitted in an email to a friend in January 2011.The first supercentenarian Mr. Clement had lined up to visit, Mississippi Winn, had died at 113 before he could get from his home in San Jose, Calif., to hers in Shreveport, La.Photo RIP Miss Winn, he posted on the Facebook page that family members had set up for Ms. Winn, believed to be the last living child of African-Americans born into slavery.Such condolences would become a familiar refrain.Of the 70,000 or so Americans who live to be 100, only some two dozen are typically alive at 110.Once that milestone is reached, as Mr. Clement quickly learned, the chance of dying within the next year is roughly 50 percent.After 113, the odds are closer to 66 percent.The oldest person on record, Jeanne Calment, was 122 when she died in 1997; only one other person is known to have lived beyond age 118.Even while youre packing the car, the person may fall ill and say theyre not up to it, Mr. Clement said, after the first of several plans for me to observe a DNA donation was abruptly canceled.Mr. Clement could extract DNA from post-mortem samples, with permission from the family and assuming he could reach the funeral home in time.Exhumation is also possible, in theory, to obtain samples.But for understandable reasons, he said, family members most often ended communications with him at the time of a supercentenarians death.To improve the odds of getting samples and the gender balance, since supercentenarians are nearly all women he lowered his target age from 110 to 106.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Its better to get there when theyre alive, he said.Guided by the Worlds Oldest People email list, whose moderator, Robert D. Young, verifies ages on behalf of Guinness World Records and tracks supercentenarians for the Gerontology Research Group, Mr. Clement placed decal dots designating the locations of prospective participants on a map pinned to the wall of his home office.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He created Google alerts for the phrases 109th birthday, 110th birthday, and 111th birthday, and for the obituaries of known supercentenarians.Unlike so-called blue zones, where centenarians are said to cluster, there is no geographical shortcut for netting supercentenarians.So he called, emailed and sent Facebook friend requests to whatever contacts he could find, wherever he could find them.A Birthday Invitation There was, nominally, the prospect of making money.But with a business plan that, even to some of his investors, sounded more like a research project, Mr. Clement seems to have undertaken the task largely because it provided the chance to act on a longstanding interest in human longevity, including his own.A self-described transhumanist who eats mostly low-glycemic vegetables and nuts and walks seven miles a day, Mr. Clement has accumulated an eclectic rsum that

possessed of an apparently genuine conviction that longer lives would make humans more humane.Photo My hat was off to someone who was willing to take the time out of his life to go get these precious specimens, said Dr. Church, the Harvard geneticist, who has devoted a portion of his laboratory to research into the reversal of aging.The kind of ultrarare mutations that supercentenarians might harbor, Dr. Church believed, were not likely to be detected with standard techniques, which scan only the places in the genome where DNA is already known to vary between individuals.To look for as-yet-uncataloged variations would require sequencing all of the supercentenarians six billion genetic letters, a far more expensive procedure.When he and Mr. Clement first discussed the idea in 2010, the cost was about $50,000 per genome.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the price was falling.And with the financial support of a handful of like-minded wealthy individuals who agreed to invest in the exploratory phase of the project, it just seemed, Mr. Clement said, like something I could do.Even with the Harvard name as a calling card, several of the families he contacted over the next few years did not respond to his inquiries.A few, Mr. Clement knew, had already been approached by laboratories at Stanford and Boston University, which were collecting their own stashes of supercentenarian DNA.She already did her DNA donation, Paul Cooper, the grandson of Besse Cooper, a 116-year-old former suffragist, told Mr. Clement, who had driven several hundred miles to her Monroe, Ga., nursing home in 2012.Walter Breuning, of Great Falls, Mont., one of just a handful of men known to have lived to 114, replied in late 2010 that it was his preference not to risk winter meetings.He died early the next spring.An invitation to the 111th birthday party of James Sisnett in Barbados finally served as Mr. Clements entree in February 2011.He died two years later.Mr. Sisnett, who grew his own food until he was 105, was still fascinated by seeing a nice-looking backside when he was in his 110s, his daughter, Everine Carter, 88, recalled in a telephone interview.Losing Precious Samples The best time to get DNA from a supercentenarian, Mr. Clement found, is midmorning.By lunchtime, they would prefer to be eating.After lunch, they might be groggy or napping.Most, like Dorothy Peel of London, then 108, had sharp minds.Ms. Peel inspected the informed consent form through her reading glasses and peppered him with questions about other supercentenarians he had met.Photo Crisscrossing Europe in 2011, Mr. Clement hit his collecting stride.But there were some bumps.He had ordered an inexpensive kit that allowed him to prick a supercentenarians finger and deposit a drop of blood on a card to preserve it, often used by geneticists in the field.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Within a few months he had blood drops from 15 donors, including Ralph Tarrant of Sheffield, England, who at 108 completed the London Times crossword puzzle every afternoon.Not until he had switched to hiring a phlebotomist to perform blood draws with a needle did he learn that the cards with the original 15 samples were defective.We could not detect any DNA, read a 2011 email from the laboratory.Mr. Clement confessed the news to Dr. Church in a meeting at his Harvard office.You didnt test the cards?the geneticist asked him gently.Still, Mr. Clement had 23 good samples in hand, and the cost of sequencing by this time had fallen to some $15,000 per genome.With his remaining funds, he sequenced 15, leaving the rest in cold storage.Photo Mr. Clement quickly discovered 2,500 differences between the supercentenarian DNA and those of controls.But even with help from graduate students in Dr. Churchs lab, it was hard with such a small group to know which, if any, were significant.So over the next few years, Mr. Clement, working without a salary, collected samples whenever he could, adding another dozen from supercentenarians across the United States.In the spring of last year, a company Dr. Church had co-founded, Veritas Genetics, announced that it would sequence human genomes for $1,000 each.Dr. Church told Mr. Clement that Veritas would sequence the remaining samples, and so he set out to collect a few more.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advice From Americas Oldest Man Photo In July 2016, I was invited to accompany Mr. Clement to Mr. Matthewss home in California.As much as I

The Growing Toll of Our Ever-Expanding Waistlines:::::From 2005 to 2014, the C.D.C.reported in October, there was a 1.4 percent annual increase in cancers related to overweight and obesity among people aged 20 to 49, and a 0.4 percent rise in these cancers among people 50 to 64.Nearly half of all cancers in people younger than 65 were associated with overweight and obesity, C.D.C.experts reported in JAMA.And they predicted that given the current high prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults, children and adolescents, going forward there will be additional increases in weight-related cancers and cancer deaths among Americans.The experts called upon clinicians who treat children and adults to do their due diligence and spend more time assessing body mass index (B.M.I.)and counseling patients about how to avoid or reduce excess weight.The payoff in terms of health, life and dollar savings would likely far outweigh the costs of society-wide professional and public health measures to curb Americas expanding waistlines.Of course, it is not just cases and deaths from cancer that such an effort could prevent.Overweight, and especially obesity, are major risk factors for Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, gout, gallbladder disease, and respiratory disorders like sleep apnea and asthma.However, even when the costs of weight assessments and counseling are fully covered by insurance, it seems they are rarely done.In November 2011, the Obama administration offered free weight-loss counseling to obese seniors on Medicare, with no co-payment or deductible for those with Medicare Part B insurance.The benefit, which is still available, applied to the approximately 30 percent of Medicare beneficiaries with a B.M.I.of 30 or more.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Yet in the first three years, only about 120,000 seniors, representing less than 1 percent of those on Medicare, took advantage of this benefit, a result weight-loss specialists have called very disappointing and a huge lost opportunity.The free coverage includes weekly counseling for the first month, a session every other week for months two through six, then monthly sessions for another six months for those who lose at least 6.6 pounds by the sixth month.Participants who fail to hit the six-month target can get a second chance six months later, with no limit to how many times they can take advantage of this benefit if their B.M.I.is still 30 or higher.To be sure, many of those with serious weight problems have probably tried and failed to lose weight and keep it off, leading them to think theres little hope that yet another effort will bring success.But it is worth noting that for most people who managed to quit smoking, it typically took anywhere from eight to 30 attempts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The fault with weight-loss failures may lie almost as much with health care practitioners as with their patients.Many primary care doctors have little to no training in how to counsel patients who need to lose weight.Some have told me that they are afraid patients wont come back if they focus on a need to lose weight.And patients are often turned off by what they perceive to be their health care providers negative attitudes toward people with weight problems.An online survey by researchers at Yale Universitys Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity revealed that people considered terms like obese, fat and morbidly obese to be stigmatizing and blaming language used by doctors.Nearly one participant in five said they would avoid future medical appointments, and 21 percent said they would seek a new doctor, if they felt stigmatized about their weight.The Medicare opportunity notwithstanding, there is a growing need to tackle weight issues much earlier in life.Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health reported in JAMA in July that 23 percent of women and 13 percent of men gained 44 pounds or more between the ages of 18 and 55.And Dr. William H. Dietz of the C.D.C., who noted in an accompanying editorial that obesity-related cancers in both men and women were associated with moderate weight gain during adulthood, added that efforts to prevent and control obesity in young adults should be accorded a high priority.Dr. Dietz also pointed to a doubling in the prevalence of obesity between the childhood ages of 6 to 11, now at 17 percent, and young adulthood ages of 20 to 29, now at 34 percent.Why are so many young Americans seriously overweight?The prevalence of high-calorie snacks and fast foods and cutbacks in physical activity both within and outside of school are not the only reasons.The problem can start as soon as babies are weaned and able to eat solid foods.Too often parents and caretakers, in the interest of keeping youngsters subdued, ply them with snacks all day long, creating in some a lifelong oral drive linking comfort and food.And, for too many, Im afraid, an increased risk of developing and dying from cancer.
Trump Health Agency Challenges Consensus on Reducing Costs:::::In September, the department released an outline of a new direction for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, set up by the Affordable Care Act to test models aimed at improving medical care and reducing costs.While the Obama administration had pushed large, mandatory experiments to test new models of pay, the Trump administration wants to encourage smaller, voluntary programs and has asked the doctors to help design them.Clearly a great big foot has been put on the brake, said Donald Crane, the chief executive of CAPG, a group of doctors and hospital administrators that, unlike many in the profession, has pushed to tie physician pay to quality measures rather than the old model of fee for service.Mr. Crane was referring specifically to the scaling back of the cardiac and joint replacement programs by Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon and Republican former congressman chosen by Mr. Trump as secretary of health and human services.Mr. Price, who resigned in September over his use of expensive private jets, had accused the Obama administration of trying to commandeer clinical decision-making by forcing doctors to participate in experiments that test new ways of paying for care.Mr. Trump is said to be close to appointing a successor possibly Alex Azar, a former pharmaceutical company executive who worked in the Department of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush and doctors groups will be watching carefully to see if the agency continues in the same direction.Already, other administration officials have signaled support for protecting doctors and giving them more say.The agencys Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, led by Seema Verma, has suggested it will accept more recommendations than it did in the past from a committee of doctors formed by the American Medical Association on how much Medicare should pay for services and procedures essentially letting doctors set their own pay.Ms. Vermas agency also issued the call for changing the direction of the innovation center.The formal request for information proposed, among other potential changes, allowing doctors and hospitals to contract directly with Medicare patients.This would allow doctors and other providers to propose their own prices, moving toward a long-held Republican goal of so-called premium pricing.Research has shown that the traditional model of paying doctors, known as fee for service, often results in unnecessary or inappropriate care.The federal government has been slowly moving away from it since 1983, when Medicare changed some of its payments to hospitals.But the changes now pushed by H.H.S.are a renunciation of the Obama administration in particular.It had sought to shift 30 percent of fee-for-service Medicare payments to alternative payments based on quality or value by 2016 a goal it achieved and 50 percent by 2018.To do so, it required doctors and hospitals in many regions of the country to adopt those new payment models.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Canceling mandatory bundled payments for cardiac and orthopedic procedures was a pet project for Mr. Price, who had fought against what he saw as unnecessary government intervention since his days as a surgeon in the suburbs north of Atlanta.Mr. Price defended the old model in front of thousands of doctors and medical administrators gathered in June for the annual meeting of CAPG, the group pushing for new payment models, arguing that the health care system in the United States the finest, he said, in the world had developed around it.So we ought to recognize, he told the group, that fee for service may not be the end of the world.Photo Many in the health care field criticized some of the rules issued by the Obama administration as overly prescriptive and welcomed the departments effort to review them.Many experiments that the Obama administration launched were overly micromanaged, said Grace-Marie Turner, an opponent of the health law and president of the Galen Institute, a research center that advocates free-market health policies.Innovation has to percolate up from the bottom.The Obama administration tried to drive it from the top.Even with Mr. Prices departure, the department still has numerous people who have advocated strongly for doctors and industry in the past.They include senior staff members who have worked representing medical device makers, pharmaceutical and hospital supply companies, the nursing home industry and physician specialty groups.The acting secretary of health and human services, Eric Hargan, is a former lawyer for the law and lobbying firm Greenberg Traurig who served as a deputy secretary at the agency during Mr. Bushs tenure.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Miranda Franco, senior policy adviser at the law firm Holland & Knight, has closely tracked the changes.She said it appeared the administration was using the innovation center to further its priorities of more provider-friendly approaches, more voluntary models.Ms. Verma, the administrator of the centers, seemed to confirm that when she wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed: Providers need the freedom to design and offer new approaches to delivering care.Our goal is to increase flexibility by providing more waivers from current requirements.Last month, Ms. Verma also announced a plan to re-examine and streamline all the ways the federal government has been measuring the quality of the care doctors provide, saying in a speech, We want to move to a system that pays for value and quality but how we define value and quality today is a problem.The goal, she said, was to relieve doctors of excessive regulatory burdens and make sure payment policies are guided by those on the front lines serving patients.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Gail Wilensky, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid in the first Bush administration, said she heard many complaints from doctors who felt that during the Obama presidency the agency was not listening to any of their ideas for how to move toward payment based on quality rather than quantity.Its hard for me to believe that physicians will do any better than they would have done, having Tom Price there, Ms. Wilensky said.From their point of view, this was about as good as it was going to get.But Tim Gronniger, a deputy chief of staff at the centers during the Obama administration, argued that there was little demand from hospitals or physicians to cancel the bundled payments, or to delay the merit-based payments.In fact, many doctors are still subject to the rules of the merit-based system, which passed with bipartisan support in Congress in 2015.And other value-based programs are continuing.Theyve confused people, said Mr. Gronniger, now a senior vice president at Caravan Health, which helps health care providers shift to value-based payment models.The risk that H.H.S.and Tom Price created is that some physicians incorrectly read the press release or hear from their colleagues that Medicare is canceling value-based purchasing and think all of thats over.Physicians and hospitals need to be engaged in this work, he added, and exempting them doesnt do them any favors.Although little has changed since Mr. Prices departure, there are signs that the agency is still trying to figure out the best way to proceed, said Michael Chernew, an economist at Harvard Medical School who supports moving away from fee for service.Mr. Chernew said he was cautiously hopeful about H.H.S.continuing to promote alternative payment models, pointing out that Medicare rates under fee for service will remain flat over the next decade anyway under the payment law that Congress passed in 2015.My general sense, and Ive met with them, is that they genuinely want to try to have a better set of payment models, Mr. Chernew said of Ms. Verma and those working for her at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.They dont just want to try to blow everything up.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He added, If you take all the politics out of it, the right thing for them to do is move ahead.
If You’re Sick, Stay Away From Work. If You Can’t, Here Is What Doctors Advise.:::::Nobody tries to convince you to go home because they knew in that situation theyd be doing the same thing, she said.Some people might read her account as a tribute to hard work and selflessness.Others might be aghast that she had risked exposing others to illness.Its clear on which side doctors come down: They say workers with the flu or a cold should use sick days far more often than they do.Though millions of Americans dont get paid time off when theyre sick, those who do have the option often dont take it.If its bad enough that youre wondering if you should stay home, you should probably stay home, said Dr. Pritish K. Tosh, an infectious diseases researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.When, and how long, should you stay home?Remember: Its not just about you.Even if you can battle the flu by enduring a miserable week, it can be deadly for others, especially pregnant women, young children and older people.And no matter how many precautions you take, theres no way to eliminate risk to people around you.As a general rule, Dr. Tosh suggested people stay home until they are fever-free for 24 hours.He said he stayed out of work for three or four days the last time he had the flu.People can be infectious even before they start to have symptoms, but most of the time that theyre going to be most infectious is going to be when they are sickest, especially if theyre having fevers, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Infectious germs are spread most frequently by airborne respiratory droplets from sneezing and coughing.The flu virus can last for up to 24 hours depending on the surface, Dr. Tosh said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.By coughing or sneezing into your hands, or wiping a runny nose, your hands can spread the germs to everything you touch including surfaces many other people touch, such as door knobs, elevator buttons or shopping carts.Youre never truly not contagious until all of those symptoms are resolved, said Dr. David Shih, executive vice president of strategy, health and innovation at CityMD, which runs a chain of urgent care centers in New Jersey, New York and Washington.How can you limit the exposure to others?Lets say youre ignoring the doctors and going out into the world anyway.Youre not alone: A CityMD survey in August found that 69 percent of Americans with the flu or flulike symptoms said they went to the drugstore or a pharmacy, 43 percent said they went to the grocery store and 39 percent said they went to work.Millennials (76 percent) were far more likely than those 35 or older (56 percent) to have left the house the last time they were sick.Though you cant eliminate the risk of infecting others, there are steps you can take to minimize it: Get in the habit of coughing and sneezing into your elbow, not your hand.Children are being taught to cough like Dracula.Limit your interaction with other people as much as possible.If youre going to work, consider skipping nonessential meetings.Avoid physical contact with other people, especially shaking hands.Wipe surfaces down after touching them.Use hand sanitizer or wash your hands after coughing or sneezing.Wear a mask to limit the respiratory droplets.Take medication to reduce your symptoms.Oh, by the way, get your flu shot.What about people who dont have sick days?Stay-at-home parents scoff at the idea of sick days, as do millions of other workers whose jobs dont offer paid time off.Advertisement Continue reading the main story For people who are living paycheck to paycheck or have significant debt, the risks of staying home and losing pay or potentially losing their job are far too great, said Vicki Shabo, vice president for workplace policies and strategies at the National Partnership for Women and Families.Low-income earners and part-time workers are especially likely to work while sick, including those at restaurants and hospitals.Ms. Shabo and advocates like her are pushing for laws mandating paid sick days, which are in place or will be soon in eight states, 30 cities and two counties.Its important from a public health perspective, and a workplace morale perspective, that people can take the time they need to recover, she said.
No Excuses, People: Get the New Shingles Vaccine:::::This really looks to be a breakthrough in vaccinating older adults, agreed Dr. Jeffrey Cohen, a physician and researcher at the National Institutes of Health.Whats causing the enthusiasm: Shingrix, which the pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline intends to begin shipping this month.Large international trials have shown that the vaccine prevents more than 90 percent of shingles cases, even at older ages.The currently available shingles vaccine, called Zostavax, only prevents about half of shingles cases in those over age 60 and has demonstrated far less effectiveness among elderly patients.Yet those are the people most at risk for this blistering disease, with its often intense pain, its threat to vision and the associated nerve pain that sometimes last months, even years, after the initial rash fades.Almost all older Americans harbor the varicella zoster virus that causes shingles; they acquired it with childhood chickenpox, whether they knew they had the disease or not.The virus stays dormant until, for unknown reasons, it erupts decades later.The risk rises sharply after age 50.Shingles is hardly a minor menace.A million cases occur in the United States each and every year, Dr. Schaffner said.If youre fortunate enough to reach your 80th birthday, you stand a one-in-three to one-in-two chance of shingles.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Preventing the great majority of these cases along with the risk of lingering and debilitating nerve pain, called postherpetic neuralgia would represent a major advance in public health.So while the old vaccine will remain on the market, the C.D.C.committee voted to make Shingrix the preferred vaccine and recommended it for all adults over age 50 a group younger by a decade than those earlier encouraged to get Zostavax.The committee also recommended Shingrix for adults whove previously gotten Zostavax, since a smaller study in people over age 65 demonstrated effectiveness and safety in those already vaccinated.The Food and Drug Administration approved Shingrix last month.Once the C.D.C.s director endorses the committees recommendations, and the agency publishes them, insurers including Medicare and Medicaid will start covering the vaccine.By early 2018, it should be broadly available to consumers in the U.S., said Dr. Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GSK Vaccines.(Canada has also approved Shingrix; it awaits approval in Australia, Japan and Europe.)What makes the new vaccine so promising, especially for older adults?* It provides better protection against shingles from the start.Though Zostavax, introduced in 2006, can reduce shingles cases by about half (and postherpetic neuralgia by two-thirds), that overall rate conceals big differences by age.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.That vaccines effectiveness drops from 64 percent for people in their 60s to 38 percent among those over age 70, and falls still lower for people in their 80s.But the new vaccine protects nearly as well in older groups as in the middle-aged.Shingrix racked up a 97 percent effectiveness rate in adults over age 50 and, in a separate study of people over age 70, prevented 90 percent of shingles in those 70 to well past age 80.In groups such as the elderly, who often dont maintain vigorous responses to vaccines, this represents extremely strong disease protection, said Dr. Kathleen Dooling, an epidemiologist at the C.D.C.Advertisement Continue reading the main story * Shingrixs protection appears to last longer.Among seniors, the effectiveness of Zostavax wanes with disappointing speed.After 11 years, the protection was close to zero, Dr. Harpaz said.Regulators dont yet have 11 years of data on Shingrix, but in some samples, it remained effective for six years or longer, according to GSK.That should greatly reduce the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia, too, assuming the 42 million people in their 50s start getting vaccinated.* The new vaccine may protect people with compromised immune systems.A substantial number of older Americans have suppressed immunity because theyre undergoing chemotherapy or transplants, have H.I.V.or take steroids.For them, the previous vaccine was off-limits because it was made with a weakened live virus.Yet immune suppression itself leaves the people vulnerable to shingles.Shingrix, a recombinant vaccine made from a glycoprotein and a combination of immunity boosters called adjuvants, doesnt pose the same danger.The C.D.C.committee held off on recommending Shingrix for the immunocompromised, because GSK is still running trials with these patients.But since the F.D.A.did not declare Shingrix contraindicated for them when approving it, they can get the vaccine once its available.Public health advocates do foresee a couple of potential problems.First, Shingrix requires two doses, administered at least two months apart.Prodding the older population to get a single shot has proved tough: barely 31 percent of those over age 60 have been vaccinated against shingles.How much harder will it be to persuade people to get two Shingrix injections?Further, it tends to be a bit of an ouch-y vaccine, Dr. Schaffner cautioned.In studies, most older recipients said theyd experienced pain, redness or swelling in their upper arms for a day or two after the shot, and 8.5 percent of those over age 70 deemed those symptoms uncomfortable enough to interfere with normal activities.About half of those over age 70 reported more systemic side effects like fatigue, fever or aching joints, lasting one to two days.Physicians and pharmacists should prepare people for such reactions, Dr. Schaffner said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story If people anticipate it, theyll cope with it better.Theyll take a couple of Tylenol and not worry that something is seriously wrong.They may feel pocketbook pain, too.Zostavax is the most expensive adult vaccine, and at $140 for each dose (plus the cost of administering the injection), Shingrix will be pricier still.The 50- to 65-year-old cohort, many of whom have coverage under employee health plans, may not find that much of a barrier.At older ages, cost matters more.Medicare will cover Shingrix under Part D (like its predecessor), not under Part B like the flu vaccine.That complicates reimbursement for those seeking vaccination in doctors offices, so Medicare patients will probably find it simpler to head for a pharmacy.But not all Medicare recipients have Part D, and those that do could face co-payments.Still, its no contest: The hazards of shingles and its complications dwarf any problems yet reported with Shingrix.Compared to shingles, a little arm pain for a day or so is a small price to pay, Dr. Schaffner said.If you know people whove had this illness, youll be first in line for this vaccine.
Ending Medical Tax Break Could Be a ‘Gut Punch’ to the Middle Class:::::This bill helps Americans keep more of the money they earn for expenses that arise throughout their lives such as medical bills rather than providing a myriad of provisions that many Americans may only use once in their lifetimes, and only if they go through the hassle and frustration of itemizing, said Lauren Aronson, a spokeswoman for the House Ways and Means committee.Photo According to an analysis in January from the Joint Committee on Taxation, most taxpayers who claim the deduction have incomes below $100,000, with about 40 percent below $75,000.More than half of those who claim it are older than 65, according to AARP, the lobby for older Americans.They often face staggering medical and long-term care costs.The deduction also helps younger families struggling to pay the enormous cost of caring for children with chronic conditions or disabilities, and couples going through costly fertility treatments like in vitro fertilization.In interviews, some who claimed it said the deduction is the difference allowing them to afford mental health care, new chemotherapy drugs, or cancer surgeries by doctors who fall outside insurance networks.I understand that in order to get tax reform through there need to be some pay fors, but getting those revenues from families who have been hardest hit by high cost medical conditions like autism or cancer seems a bit like targeting hurricane victims as a potential source of revenue, said John Rodakis, 48, of Dallas, who has a son with autism and runs a nonprofit foundation devoted to autism research.The Joint Committee estimated that the deduction for medical expenses would cost the federal government $10 billion next year, if it were not eliminated.That is far less than the two big deductions the Republican bill would preserve: one for interest paid on home mortgages is expected to cost $63.6 billion, and one for charitable donations, $47.8 billion.Most taxpayers claiming those deductions have incomes above $100,000.Taxpayers claimed a total of $87 billion in medical costs through the deduction in 2015, according to the Internal Revenue Service.An increase in the standard deduction would not nearly make up for that, tax experts said.The average Medicare beneficiary, for example, pays $5,680 a year in out-of-pocket costs, according to AARP.Last year Heather Block, 54, deducted $9,349 in medical expenses.For most of her career as a freelance international aid worker, she carried two health insurance policies.Before she got breast cancer six years ago, she said, it wouldnt have dawned on me that people had these medical expenses.Photo Her cancer is now stage 4.One month this year, she said, oral chemotherapy alone was $4,000.I feel like Ive had a running contest since I got cancer, she said, Am I going to use up my savings and go bankrupt or am I going to die first?Advertisement Continue reading the main story While the Affordable Care Act expanded coverage to millions more Americans and limited out-of-pocket costs, many, like Ms. Block, still face large expenses that insurance does not cover.Its like a backstop, and until such time that we have a health care system that covers everybody for everything, were going to need that backstop, said Alexandra Thornton, the senior director of tax policy at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress.Thats the thing with deductions, they recognize that sometimes people are in a situation where its harder to pay their taxes.Some are harder to defend, but this is one of the easier ones.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Lisa and Peter Witzlers second son, Jackson, was born with spina bifida, a defect caused when the spinal cord does not close in the womb.By his fifth month of life, hed spent three months in the hospital six weeks in neonatal intensive care and his parents had spent the money they had planned to put toward day care.Doctors had recommended private nursing because Jackson had severe sleep apnea and would repeatedly stop breathing and turn blue.But

would help rebuild the emergency savings that she and her husband have spent on fertility treatments this year.Advertisement Continue reading the main story To go after this is a gut punch, she said.Robert Graboyes, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said the plan to eliminate the deduction was part of a larger deal where one way you pay for broad tax cuts for a large part of the population is by ending a variety of small ones.My guess is they needed some revenue and this was a way to do it.But eliminating the deduction could hasten the speed at which some older Americans spend down their savings and have to go on Medicaid, a far greater expense for the federal government.Already Im having to dip severely into whatever Ive saved, said Jennifer Clark, 76, of Falls Church, Va. She has multiple sclerosis and a form of blood cancer, and while insurance covers her chemotherapy and other medications, she pays out of pocket for part-time aides, dental care, a portion of her physical therapy, some of her medications and the continuing care retirement community she lives in.If I lose this and the ability to deduct my state income taxes, Ms. Clark said, we are talking wiped out.
A Link Between Alcohol and Cancer? It’s Not Nearly as Scary as It Seems:::::Lets stipulate that there may be a correlation between light or moderate drinking and some cancers.We still dont know if the relationship is causal, but lets accept that theres at least an association.For breast cancer which is the cancer that seems to be garnering the most headlines light drinking was associated with a relative risk of 1.04 in the announcement.Relative risk refers to the percentage change in ones absolute (overall) risk as a result of some change in behavior.(And 1.04 is a 4 percent change from 1.0, which represents a baseline of no difference in risk between an experimental group and a control group.)A 40-year-old woman has an absolute risk of 1.45 percent of developing breast cancer in the next 10 years.This announcement would argue that if shes a light drinker, that risk would become 1.51 percent.This is an absolute risk increase of 0.06 percent.Using whats known as the Number Needed to Harm, this could be interpreted such that if 1,667 40-year-old women became light drinkers, one additional person might develop breast cancer.The other 1,666 would see no difference.Of course, moderate or heavy drinking might increase the risks further.The absolute risks for that 40-year-old would go to 1.78 percent from 1.45 percent for the moderate drinker, and to 2.33 percent for the heavy drinker.Those numbers are still not that scary.But maybe any increase in risk is too much for you.Thats fine.If youre one of those people, though, you have to acknowledge that you cant look at any one cancer in a vacuum.A person can get almost any cancer.The large meta-analysis upon which this announcement was based looked at 23 types of cancer with respect to alcohol consumption.It found a harmful relationship between three of them and light drinking.But it also found protective relationships meaning a decreased risk of cancer between six of them and light drinking.Im not arguing that you should engage in light drinking to avoid those six cancers.Im merely pointing out that cherry-picking allows you to come to different conclusions.With respect to moderate drinking, there were harmful relationships with seven cancers and protective relationships with three.The announcement focused on the former, not the latter.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.A 2013 meta-analysis in the Annals of Oncology that looked at all cancers found that, over all, light drinking was protective; moderate drinking had no effect; and heavy drinking was detrimental.Its even cherry-picking to focus only on cancer, though.A person can get any number of diseases, and this fact makes the dangers of light and moderate drinking even muddier.Advertisement Continue reading the main story If you accept the methodology of case-control and cohort studies, from which many of the links between alcohol and cancer arise, you have to accept the results of similar studies of other diseases.For instance, a cohort study of about 6,000 people found that those who drank at least once a week had better cognitive function in middle age than those who didnt.A 2004 systematic review found that moderate drinkers had lower rates of diabetes (up to 56 percent lower, although thats a relative risk reduction).Randomized controlled trials of alcohol (they do exist) show that light to moderate drinking can lead to a reduction in risk factors for heart disease, diabetes and stroke.These protective factors may be greater than all the other negative risk factors (even cancer) that might be associated with light or moderate drinking.More women die in the United States of heart disease than cancer.So do more men.Moreover, dire warnings have consequences.I know far too many people who now throw up their hands at every news story because it seems as if everything causes cancer.These stories rarely acknowledge an alternative point of view.The absolute risks of light and moderate drinking are small, while many people derive pleasure from the occasional cocktail or glass of wine.Its perfectly reasonable even if a risk exists and the overall risk is debatable to decide that the quality of life gained from that drink is greater than the potential harms it entails.This is true for many, many foods, not just alcohol.What can we do about this?We could make simple changes to have a better understanding of risk so that each new proclamation doesnt send us into a tizzy: 1) Consider the absolute risks.A 30 percent increase in risk sounds scary, but an increase from 1 percent to 1.3 percent absolute risk does not, though these are the same things.Likewise, we should be more concerned about a 5 percent risk increase to 21 percent from 20 percent than about a 30 percent increase to 1.3 percent from 1 percent.2) Dont give too much weight to observational data.This is especially true when causal data are available.3) Dont focus on any one disease while ignoring others.Something may be harmful regarding one disease while beneficial regarding another.4) Dont cherry-pick.That is, dont focus only on some studies, or only on some results.Review all the evidence for the most holistic picture possible.5) Acknowledge the harms, as well as the benefits, of recommendations.Consider both cost and joy.These rules may not make for exciting headlines.They may, however, lead to happier, and perhaps healthier, lives.
Trillions of Flies Can’t All Be Bad:::::Her life among flies involves both museum work and field research.For her, this is a dream job.She recalled the first time she went behind the scenes at the museum, as a student, before she actually worked there.Id been let into a building that had 34 million insects.I said, Oh hello, I quite like you.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. McAlisters fascination began in childhood.I used to catch the fleas off the cats, she said, inspecting them with a microscope her parents had given her.But she soon gravitated toward more gruesome insects.Decomposing carcasses of small creatures, also courtesy of the cats, were treasure troves of maggots, which she still delights in.I quite like the darker side of nature, she said, just before discussing the lives of spider-killing flies.The larvae hurl themselves at spiders in order to land on them and burrow into the abdomen.They then eat the spider from the inside out.But if the spiders are immature, the larvae may go to sleep for a few years until the spider grows into a bigger meal.Photo One of her few disappointments: Ive yet to get my own botfly.She means that despite spending time in the tropics, no adult botfly has laid an egg on her arm or leg so that the larva could burrow under her skin and develop into the notoriously painful, itchy worm before it emerges.Many flies do an enormous service for us and the planet by cleaning up all sorts of the biological worlds detritus, from dead wood to the slime in drainpipes.Drain flies, or sewer gnats, are actually cleaning up human mess.Occasionally, however, they may have a population boom that sends the adults into the air, which is annoying; if the bodies disintegrate into tiny particles in the air, they are potentially harmful to human health.And, of course, there are the flies that feed on dead bodies the 1,100 different species of blow flies, favorites of forensic detective shows.The maggots of these flies, like the very attractive bluebottle larva, devour corpses of mice and men and everything else.Knowledge of which species lay eggs at which stages of decomposition can help determine how long ago a person turned into a body.(If its Tuesday, it must be a bluebottle.)Photo Within science, flies are one of the great subjects of laboratory study.Or rather, the fly: Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as the fruit fly, although Dr. McAlister points out it actually belongs to a group called the vinegar flies.Advertisement Continue reading the main story They are easy to work with and share the same basic DNA as all life.Historically, they have provided much of the foundation for modern genetics.And now they may provide deep insights into neuroscience and other fields.On Thursday, scientists at the Salk Institute reported that their studies of how the fly brain works can improve internet search engines.At the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Janelia Research Institute in Virginia, the search is on to develop a wiring diagram of the fly brain, and then figure out in the greatest detail how they think.Inviting Flies Into the Newsroom The Timess James Gorman recently took reader questions on Facebook Live with Erica McAlister, a curator of flies at the National History Museum, London.And they do think, according to Vivek Jayaraman, who runs a lab there, in the sense that flies dont just react instinctively.Their brains make decisions based on several different inputs smell, memory, hunger and fear, for instance.And that whole process is what he hopes to decipher, neuron by neuron.You can go end to end, potentially, in the fly, he said.Dr. McAlister admits the importance of Drosophila, although a bit reluctantly.She is really interested in the countless other fly species, from the Antarctic to the Arctic, from predators that kill dragonflies on the wing to the tiny fungus gnats.There are 160,000 known species of fly, and entomologists can only guess at the number we dont know its somewhere between hundreds of thousands and millions.Photo Marlene Zuk, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Minnesota, as well as a decidedly pro-insect scientific popularizer, couldnt agree more.Dr. Zuk, whose chosen study subject is a cricket, also studies a parasitic fly that lays its larvae in them.I called her to talk flies.Wow, she said, you never get asked what your favorite fly is.Dr. Zuk quickly came up with an unfavorite.Flies are always cursed by Drosophila, she said.But flies are unbelievably diverse.She mentioned the value to research of the blowfly and referred to a classic paper, and later a book, on hunger in the blowfly, by Vincent G.

Former Eli Lilly Executive Is Trump’s Choice for Health Secretary:::::Critics mocked the selection by a president who promised to drain the Washington swamp of lobbyists and has complained about RIPOFF DRUG PRICES on Twitter.Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, said that instead of draining the swamp, he has set the fox to guard the henhouse.Senate Democrats vowed to scrutinize Mr. Azars record in the Bush administration and as a drug company executive.I am also interested in how, given Mr. Azars professional background, he believes he can fairly execute any significant effort to lower drug prices for patients, said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington.Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said Mr. Azar had the qualifications and experience to get results and promised to promptly schedule a hearing on his nomination.In addition to his experience as a pharmaceutical executive, Mr. Azar brings to the job impeccable credentials as a conservative lawyer.A graduate of Yale Law School, he was a clerk for Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court in the early 1990s and spent two years as a young lawyer working for Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton.If he is confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Azar would be returning to a sprawling agency where he served as general counsel and deputy secretary before spending a decade in the pharmaceutical industry.He resigned from Eli Lilly, which makes Cialis, Humulin and Trulicity among other popular and profitable drugs, in January.Mr. Leavitt dismissed concerns that Mr. Azars work at Eli Lilly would interfere with his ability to seek lower drug prices.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.To solve the problems within the pharmaceutical industry, you have to understand the way the distribution system works, Mr. Leavitt said.Alex understands that as well as any person in the country.If he were to be confirmed, Mr. Leavitt added, Alex doesnt work for the drug industry he works for the president of the United States.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Kathleen Sebelius, who succeeded Mr. Leavitt as health and human services secretary under Mr. Obama, said Mr. Azars knowledge of how the department worked would be a valuable asset if he was confirmed.But she said she had no doubt Mr. Azar would use that expertise to reverse the health care changes that she helped put in place.He may be the only secretary in modern history other than Tom Price to be given the job to take away peoples health care, Ms. Sebelius said.Alex is a smart guy.He clearly has watched the last year or so.I assume his agreement to come in means that hes O.K.with enforcing or trying to promote the presidents agenda.Mr. Trumps choice of Mr. Azar continues a pattern in which the president has put former industry officials in charge of regulating their former colleagues.At the Department of Health and Human Services, it would fall to Mr. Azar to follow through on the presidents threats to confront drug prices, many of which are manufactured by Mr. Azars former company.Eli Lilly, where Mr. Azar worked for almost a decade, is one of three manufacturers of insulin whose prices have skyrocketed in recent years.The price increases by the three drug makers Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi have happened in near lock step and prompted outcries from patient groups.This year, a lawsuit filed by patients accused the companies of fixing prices.Lilly again raised prices on two of its insulin products, Humalog and Humulin, by nearly 8 percent in May.The company has previously noted that many patients do not pay the list price for insulin because they benefit from rebates negotiated with insurers, and it offers discounts of about 45 percent off the list price for people without insurance.When Mr. Trump nominated Dr. Scott Gottlieb to be the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in March, Democrats sharply criticized the selection, saying he could not be objective because he had earned hundreds of thousands of dollars as an investor in and consultant to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.But since taking office in May, Dr. Gottlieb has put pressure on drug companies to hold down prices and has taken steps to increase competition in the prescription drug market by speeding the approval of lower-cost generic products.No patient should be priced out of the medicines they need, Dr. Gottlieb said in June.And he followed up with several steps last month.If consumers are priced out of the drugs they need, he said, thats a public health concern that F.D.A.should address, within the scope of its mandate and authorities.John C. Rother, the executive director of the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing, a coalition of consumer, labor and physician groups concerned about high drug prices, said Mr. Azar is competent and knows a lot about health policy and the operations of the Department of Health and Human Services.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Even with his drug background, its hard to say anything negative about him, Mr. Rother said, adding, We sincerely hope that he will follow through on the presidents commitment to achieve lower drug prices.
Taking Care of the Physician:::::Its not that physicians are burned out and so dont care, its that they care deeply, said Dr. David Schonfeld, a developmental behavioral pediatrician at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles.You cant experience compassion fatigue if youve not had compassion.Medical faculty members have been shown to have burnout rates ranging from 20 to 49 percent.And the hard-won reductions in resident work hours do not seem to have satisfactorily reduced burnout or depression among residents, perhaps because hospitalized patients are sicker on average than they used to be, perhaps because patient loads are higher (if you reduce work hours but dont increase the number of doctors, well, you can do the math), or perhaps because of the increasing frustrations and time pressures connected to the electronic health record and documentation, which can take up more than half of some doctors time, often squeezed in at night or by coming in early.Another statistic often cited in the physician wellness conversation is the suicide rate.Physicians are at approximately twice the relative risk of suicide compared to people in other professions, Dr. McClafferty said.Women physicians especially are at a significantly higher risk of completed suicide than matched female controls in other professions, she said.An estimated 300 to 400 physicians commit suicide every year.If this were happening in any other high-profile industry, Dr. McClafferty said, I cant imagine people wouldnt be rallying round, saying this is unacceptable, it has to stop.There is a clear link between physician depression and medical errors.In one study of pediatric residents at three high-powered training programs, those who were depressed made more than six times as many medication errors as those who were not.This study and others also found that residents experiencing burnout were more likely to perceive that they were making more errors, even if they were not.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.We place physicians in situations where they are detecting problems, often connected to social conditions or poverty, Dr. Schonfeld said, but then dont give them the support they need to address those problems.And we dont adequately teach the skills in medical training that doctors will need to deal with the realities of taking care of patients.There are more advanced skill sets, how to deal with conflict, how to deal with negotiation, how to deal with the distress of patients, he said.We just send trainees in, the training focuses on medications, pathophysiology, genetics, not the skills they need to be able to deal with those broader issues.So we might look to changes in the ways we train residents, not just limiting work hours but looking more closely at what the content of those work hours is like, and at the skills we teach, and at what we do and do not discuss.Because of organizational structures and competing responsibilities theres less time, and physicians are really sad about this, and we need to struggle as a society to make it different, Dr. Serwint said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Studies are just beginning to be done of workplace interventions that address such issues as time pressure, workplace chaos, and a doctors sense of control, but the evidence supports the idea that its more effective to make changes at the level of the institution, rather than just telling the doctors to shape up in the wellness department.The solution is not to weed out the ones who dont care, but to support the large number of physicians who are deeply invested and have the capacity to provide excellent care, but lose that capacity over time, Dr. Schonfeld said.Physicians enter medical school deeply committed to the field, they come with the desire to be empathic and compassionate, if we just create a system that nurtures what they come with then we will have less burnout and higher quality care.It should not be the doctors responsibility to feel that if Im just more mindful, if I just exercise more or do it better or more consistently, all will be well, and I shouldnt be feeling burned out or exhausted, Dr. McClafferty said.The fact that nearly half of physicians and over 50 percent of trainees experience burnout at some point shows that it is not predominantly an individual deficit, but an organizational and system problem, Dr. Schonfeld said If youre my physician, Dr. McClafferty said, I want you to be in good shape mentally, physically and emotionally, so you can be really successful at helping me.
In Africa, Rural Clinics Entice Pregnant Women With ‘Baby Pictures’:::::The medical charity Bridge to Health Medical and Dental tested the concept in the highlands of southwest Uganda in 2014.Their study, published by PLOS One this year, found that when doctors set up temporary clinics in rural villages, six times as many pregnant women visited when free ultrasounds were advertised, compared with the turnout in villages where the ultrasounds were not offered or were advertised only by word of mouth.Women who previously had seen only traditional healers were nine times more likely to show up if the ultrasounds were advertised.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Its magic to be able to see your unborn baby, said Dr. Michael S. Silverman, an infectious disease specialist at Western University in London, Canada, and a study co-author.The ultrasound scanners in the study cost $10,000 new or $2,500 refurbished, said Dr. William Cherniak, the executive director of Bridge to Health and another co-author.They are battery-powered, do 40 scans per charge, and can survive bouncing along rutted dirt roads.The group hopes to test inexpensive new scanners that plug directly into smartphones; the technician can view the fetus on the phone and transmit the image to a radiologist anywhere in the world, Dr. Cherniak said.The women in the study could see their fetuses only on monitors, but Bridge to Health has since added a printer so the women can take home pictures.We even diagnosed acute appendicitis in an older woman who came in even though she wasnt pregnant, Dr. Cherniak said.These machines have lots of uses.
Do Pesticides Get Into the Flesh of Fruits and Vegetables?:::::Photo Q.Do pesticides get into the flesh of conventional fruits and vegetables like cantaloupe, apples and cucumbers?A.Pesticides sprayed on fruits and vegetables accumulate on the outer peel or skin, but the skin does not form an impermeable barrier, and some pesticides are actually designed to be absorbed into the tissue of the fruit or vegetable to protect it from pests that penetrate the skin to suck out the liquid inside Thicker peels may be more effective at keeping pesticides out of the flesh of some fruits like cantaloupe, said Lili He, an assistant professor in food science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who studied the best methods for washing chemical pesticide residues off apples.If youre trying to prioritize which fruits and vegetables to buy organic, check the Environmental Working Groups list of the so-called Dirty Dozen and the Clean Fifteen, as well as Consumer Reports Always Buy Organic list.Both make recommendations based on tests of pesticide residues on fruits and vegetables, done by the United States Department of Agriculture after the produce has been washed.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Cantaloupe is on the Clean Fifteen list, meaning it has relatively low levels of pesticide residues.
Are Honey Nut Cheerios Healthy? We Look Inside the Box:::::I had a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios recently.Itd been awhile.Regular Cheerios are more my thing.But sometimes I finish my box faster than my kids do and find myself straying to their side of the cupboard.Honey Nut is Americas best-selling breakfast cereal, and by a comfortable margin.Roughly 151 million boxes and other containers of various sizes were sold over the past year, well ahead of the second best-selling breakfast cereal, Frosted Flakes, according to IRI, a Chicago based market research firm.I had no idea.The only thing I could think about when I ate it again for the first time in years was how incredibly sweet it is.I looked at the back of the box and could see why.Three of the top six ingredients are sweeteners: sugar, brown sugar and honey.Previously, I assumed Honey Nut Cheerios was a slightly sweeter Cheerios, but you learn things when you finally get around to reading the back of the box.It actually has about nine times as much sugar as plain Cheerios, per serving.An Environmental Working Group analysis of a number of popular cereals a report that linked sugary cereals to the nations childhood obesity epidemic put Honey Nut Cheerioss sugar content second only to Fruity Pebbles.The same group found that one cup of the cereal had more sugar than three Chips Ahoy!cookies.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I asked General Mills about this, over a period of several days.They did not come to the phone, but responded with a series of communiqus.
Kathy Griffin’s Wild Show: Defiant, Shaken, Then Fainting:::::As a result of this tasteless photo, Ms. Griffin didnt just receive death threats, lose gigs and sponsorship money, and get fired as a host of CNNs annual New Years Eve special.She was also put on the no-fly list and became the subject of a Secret Service investigation for, she says, conspiracy to assassinate the president.When she asked the federal agent why the government was going to such extremes, the woman pointed upward, indicating, Ms. Griffin interpreted, that this came from the president himself.Onstage, in front of red block letters spelling out her first name, Ms. Griffin wore the blue dress from the fateful photo, and appeared defiant one moment, shook up the next.She singled out stars who sent their support, fired back at celebrities who criticized the photo (look out, Alyssa Milano and Debra Messing), and got emotional about others, like Anderson Cooper, her co-host on New Years Eve, who tweeted his disapproval.You know what Cher said?Ms. Griffin said onstage, shifting into an impression of her friend.Well, you wanted to be famous, bitch.The entire episode showed her to be the outsider she always said she was, skewering the famous while somehow being obsessed with them at the same time.In this regard, shes a perfect match for Mr. Trump, whom she has known for nearly two decades, dating to an episode of the 1990s sitcom Suddenly Susan on which both appeared.She remembered the moment on Wednesday: When he greeted her with Call me The Donald, she responded, Call me The Kathy.Mr. Trump may come from Queens and Ms. Griffin from suburban Chicago, but for some time now, they have both lived on Planet Celebrity.Though Ms. Griffin spent years making fun of Kim Kardashian, she moved next door to this reality TV star, and when not mocking the Trump family on Wednesday (she called his older sons Eddie Munster and Date Rape), Ms. Griffin spilled secrets about the home life of Kanye West and Ms. Kardashian: They drive around in a Rolls-Royce golf cart and keep the mannequin of Taylor Swift from his Famous video in their house.Sometimes, late at night, I can hear them printing money, she quipped.Ms. Griffin does not write taut jokes; she emerged from the West Coast alt-comedy scene of the 1990s, when comics were reacting against the machine-gun-joke style of comedy clubs and building acts on digressive stories and conversational riffs.Even then, Ms. Griffin relied on highly personal revelations, often shameless and sexual and sprinkled with celebrity dust.If she slept with Jack Black, she talked about it onstage, then wrote about talking about it.She is famous for frivolity, derided by some peers for her obsession with boldface names.But its not fair to chalk up Ms. Griffins success to our cultures lust for scandal and stardom, though thats certainly part of it.I will be your guilty pleasure, she wrote in her best-selling 2009 memoir, Official Book Club Selection.Ms. Griffin, who reveres Joan Rivers, belongs to a glorious show-business tradition of hard-working, mouthy survivors with ambition to burn, an instinct for self-promotion and a chip on the shoulder.If she ever cared about alienating someone famous to get a laugh whether a network executive, a commander in chief or garden-variety actors doing their best she doesnt anymore.I have a lot of female hostility, she said Wednesday, pivoting from earnest to glib.Its very trendy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some of that hostility is directed toward Harvey Levin, the TMZ founder, and Andy Cohen, the host of Watch What Happens Live and her replacement on the New Years Eve show.After Mr. Cohen pretended that he didnt know who Ms. Griffin was in a video on TMZ, Ms. Griffin responded with a 17-minute video of her own in which she criticized both men for misogyny.She also revealed Mr. Levins phone number and claimed that Mr. Cohen offered her cocaine twice (he has denied it).Onstage she took shots at both of them again, but the variety of insults she leveled, some more thinly supported than others, made it seem as if she were just tossing out the kitchen sink, and not to funny ends.Ms. Griffin often veered off-course, and when she referred to being in the United Kingdom, she was startled by the angry reaction of the Dublin audience.The packed crowd of die-hard fans turned on her, hissing and booing.She seemed thrown off-balance, and had trouble returning to her story, not for the last time.Some forceful directorial guidance could hone this wandering series of stories into a more refined show that sticks to a theme and a through-line revolving around Mr. Trump.But this messy, indulgent production instead gives us Ms. Griffin unfiltered, which has the benefit of seeming like a backstage gossip session, albeit one that lost steam as it headed past the 60-minute mark and she dabbed sweat from her forehead.After more than two hours, Ms. Griffin started telling a story about Mariah Carey when she froze, looked down and slumped, suddenly silent.She leaned into the microphone and said: Randy, Im going down.Her boyfriend hurried onstage and grabbed her.Before he escorted her offstage, she said, Ill be back.The crowd gasped and waited in the dark for minutes, until he helped Ms. Griffin back to the microphone, when she muttered something hard to hear over the cheers.What was clear was that the show was over.She later apologized in a video, saying she fainted.It was a shockingly anxious end to the evening, revealing perhaps the toll this sprawling tour (or her recent controversies) has taken on her.But counting out a force of nature like Ms. Griffin is a mistake.Just as the condemnation of her Trump photo fueled this new show, her collapse just added more drama to an evening that did not lack for it.As she exited with assistance, she turned to the crowd and scrunched her face into a self-mocking grimace that seemed to say: How ridiculous is this?
From Brussels to Arkansas, a Tough Week for Monsanto:::::Taken together, the decisions reflect an increasing political resistance to pesticides in Europe and parts of the United States, as well as the specific shortcomings of dicamba, whose tendency to drift has given pause even to the Trump administrations Environmental Protection Agency, which has otherwise largely acceded to the wishes of the chemical industry.Dicamba has damaged more than 3.6 million acres of soybean crops in 25 states, roughly 4 percent of all soybeans planted this year in the United States.In a statement, an industry trade group known as the Glyphosate Task Force, which includes Monsanto and Syngenta, called the European decision discriminatory and unacceptable, adding that delays of this nature which are evident during the final stages of the process simply expose acute politicization of the regulatory procedure.But Nicolas Hulot, the French environment minister, tweeted after the vote: Thanks to our opposition glyphosate is not reauthorized for 10 years, nor 5 years.The effort to get out of pesticides continues!Regarding the decision in Arkansas, Scott Partridge, vice president of global strategy for Monsanto, said in a statement on Wednesday that the company was disappointed that state regulators voted to put Arkansas farmers at a disadvantage, but well continue to follow the process to help those growers have greater choice next season.The European Unions decision followed years of haggling and delay.Policymakers largely brushed aside the opinions of two of the blocs science agencies, which had found that glyphosate was not a carcinogen.But glyphosate, which accounts for about a quarter of the global market, has been plunged into controversy since the International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization, declared it a probable carcinogen in 2015.The finding, which has been disputed by a number of other government agencies, has made the weedkiller a magnet for controversy.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Glyphosate is also at the center of a federal case in the United States over claims that it causes cancer, and California has declared it a carcinogen, following in the footsteps of the international cancer agency.Use of glyphosate has soared in the United States and other parts of the world over the last two decades, after Monsanto introduced crops that were genetically engineered to be resistant to the chemical.That meant key crops like corn, soybeans and cotton could be sprayed with the herbicide after they emerged from the ground.During that time, the presence of glyphosate in human urine increased 500 percent, according to a recent study by the University of California San Diego School of Medicine and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Europe, by contrast, has largely shunned genetically modified crops, but glyphosate is still the Continents biggest seller.In Britain and Germany, it is used on as much as 40 percent of agricultural land, according to an industry trade group.But political sentiment in Europe has been turning against Monsanto, the American company that has become the face of the agrochemical industry, even though it is in the process of being acquired by Bayer, a German chemicals giant.The European Parliament voted last month to ban glyphosate, a step that was nonbinding.And in September, the Parliament made Monsanto the first company to be barred from lobbying the chamber.The science around glyphosate has become a muddle of allegations and counterallegations.Environmental activists have accused national regulators of hewing too closely to Monsantos wishes, while the industry has been exasperated that European politicians are overruling their science agencies.The litigation in the United States has only muddied the waters further, with evidence emerging that Monsanto ghostwrote both journalism and academic work, eroding trust in a company that had long been a lightning rod.But the latest major study, published Thursday by researchers at the National Institutes of Health, observed no associations between glyphosate use and overall cancer risk.With dicamba, the industry received warnings years ago that the weedkiller was prone to drifting on crops and vegetation it was not intended to treat.Dicamba is supposed to be used with soybeans that are genetically modified to resist its effects.Steve Smith, a member of an advisory panel set up by Monsanto, warned as far back as 2010 that widespread use of dicamba is incompatible with Midwestern agriculture, according to congressional testimony he gave that year.Even the best, the most conscientious farmers cannot control where this weedkiller will end up.Monsanto has argued that drift is occurring when dicamba is sprayed improperly or when unapproved versions are used.Many farmers and weed scientists say it can also turn into a gas and drift in certain weather conditions.Environmentalists called for federal action by the Environmental Protection Agency on dicamba.Its long past time the agency heed independent science and protect farmers by prohibiting the use of this hazardous weedkiller, said Bill Freese, a science policy analyst at the Center for

add another to the mix, and the planning becomes all-consuming.Jarrett and I met as pre-med freshmen in chemistry lab and became fast friends, laughing over the flame of a Bunsen burner as we set up experiments.We were soon inseparable, playing endless games of Dr. Mario on my Nintendo between study sessions.Sometimes, after a night of fraternity hazing, he would come to my dorm room and profess his love for me.I initially laughed it off, reminding him that he was my best friend.But by the spring of freshman year, our relationship had changed.We felt that we were beshert meant to be.Driven by love and mutual goals, we started planning.We managed to get into residency programs in the same city and moved from New York to Chicago, two newly crowned M.D.s flush with excitement from the perfectly executed wedding that had sent us off.But working a combined 160 hours per week was tough on our marriage.My once cheerful, thoughtful husband was becoming increasingly moody and distant.I confronted him: Was he having an affair?No!Did he not love me anymore?No.Was he gay?Silence.I think I might be, he said.With those words, everything changed.We stayed up for nights on end, talking in circles.We withdrew into our own world, me retreating into the closet along with him.We love each other, we can fix this, we told ourselves.But it eventually became clear that this was not a fixable problem.I gradually confided in my family and friends, putting aside my own reluctance to out him; Jarrett came to do the same, finally accepting this long-hidden part of himself.He moved out and we finished the latter half of our residencies newly single, plunging into the world of online dating, both in the market for thirtysomething men.I learned to live without him.I matched again, and planned to move on in Philadelphia a new start.The next hiccup in my plans was a cough.At first, it was mostly after my near-daily four-mile run, but soon it was constant.At the time, I was reading When Breath Becomes Air by Dr. Paul Kalanithi, a neurosurgery resident who learned he had stage IV lung cancer at age 36.I had a fleeting moment of panic, and I shared my fear with a co-resident who was reading the same book.She confessed similar thoughts, and we reassured each other of course neither of us had lung cancer.It was winter; we worked in a hospital; everyone was coughing.I was still wearing hospital scrubs when I went to get a chest X-ray.Maybe thats why the technician spoke to me in an unusually direct way: Im no radiologist, but there is definitely something there.Despite our best plans to start over after our divorce, Jarrett and I had both ended up in Philadelphia for our fellowships.I had seen him only once since the move, when our eyes had met across the sweaty room of a spin studio.I had resolutely decided not to interact with him any more than was necessary.It now seemed necessary.I knew very few people in my new city.It suddenly seemed beshert that my ex lived and worked right next door.Jarrett was the first person I called from the doctors office and there he was, immediately by my side to resume his abandoned duties as my best friend.I spent the following days in the hospital, my family now beside me, balancing on a wobbly tightrope that separated me as a doctor from me as a patient.My medical team would come in and relay information in the complicated jargon that is often more familiar to me than lay English.I found myself translating everything back to my terrified parents, as if they were my patients and I was trying to soften the blow of bad news.Right inferior mediastinal mass encasing and occluding the right inferior pulmonary vein became I have something that looks like a tumor in the middle of my chest.Favored to represent lymphoma became, I probably have a type of blood cancer, but I can get through that.Other unusual primary lung malignancies can occur in a patient of this age, but are considered much less likely became dont worry, I dont have lung cancer.The morning the oncologist came in to my hospital room and told me that I had lung cancer, I had just been laughing with my parents.Its not that I was expecting good news, I wasnt.But I was just as unprepared to hear lung cancer as I had been to hear Jarrett say Im gay.I felt myself begin to tip from my tightrope and tried to grab back on, terrified to begin the long descent toward the patient side.As I wavered, I could hear my mother in the background trying to assure me that wed get through it.The oncologist, her voice cracking, explained to my parents in plain English that some cancers are not curable.Mine is stage IV.I still tried to translate, but this time I could barely get the words out.That means that I am not going to live a long life.As a physician, I have been trained to be observant, to pick up on subtle clues.I sometimes think that I was so determined to stick to my plan that I neglected to see what was right in front of me.But then I consider that many men like flowers and it does not mean that they are gay, and many 32-year-olds get a cough in the winter and they do not have lung cancer.I have now been living with cancer for a year.Treatment has, at times, left me feeling sicker than I could have ever imagined.I have felt deeply angry, profoundly sad and all-around terrified.But for the first time, I am also learning to enjoy the here and now instead of focusing on the later.I might never see the finish line of fellowship graduation, but I am still a doctor; I am lucky enough to be learning every day and can still make my own patients lives better.My years of education and training have allowed me to build a supportive community of friends and colleagues throughout the country.I have a family who has stayed by me through all of it.And, for better or worse, I have a gay ex-husband who is here for me, always.Danielle Peress is a second-year fellow in maternal fetal medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.Sign up for the Well Newsletter Get the best of Well, with the latest on health, fitness and nutrition, delivered to your inbox every week.SEE SAMPLE Please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.* Required field You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times products and services.You are already subscribed to this email.Sign Up
Election Results Invigorate Medicaid Expansion Hopes:::::Neither does Kansas, where the Republican-controlled Legislature voted to expand Medicaid earlier this year but failed to override a veto by Gov.Sam Brownback.Mr. Brownback is awaiting confirmation to an ambassador at large position in the Trump administration, but Lt. Gov.Jeff Colyer, a fellow Republican who would replace him, has also indicated he would resist expansion.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Still, David Jordan, who leads the Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, an advocacy group, pointed out that if Mr. Colyer becomes governor, he will face re-election a year from now in a state where polls have found resounding support for expanding Medicaid.Yesterdays results in Virginia and Maine should send a message to him, Mr. Jordan said.It could become really tough to go against this wave.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But for many Republican politicians, the idea of expanding Medicaid remains hard to love.Providing government insurance coverage to poor adults who are not disabled is anathema to many.They view such help as discouraging work, though data suggests most new Medicaid recipients have jobs and states that expanded did not see reductions in employment among low-income people.Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the program, told state Medicaid directors on Tuesday that her department would begin approving state plans to condition Medicaid coverage for non-disabled adults on work or volunteer hours.Believing that community engagement requirements do not support or promote the objectives of Medicaid is a tragic example of the soft bigotry of low expectations consistently espoused by the prior administration, Ms. Verma said.Those days are over.Several states have asked Ms. Vermas office for permission to impose work requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries.Matt Salo, the executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said that he thought work requirements might make expansion more acceptable to some state legislatures, like Floridas, that have been reluctant in the past.You can rebrand that, he said.You can do that very effectively.The federal government paid the entire cost of expanding Medicaid for the first three years of Obamacare, but that changed this year.States now must pay 5 percent of the new beneficiaries medical bills, a proportion that will increase to 10 percent by 2020.So any state that expands now will need to find some funding to pay for its share.States that expanded Medicaid expect to spend $8.5 billion from their own funds on expansion in the 2018 fiscal year, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers.Every political decision is about value, and the value is whats the return for the money, said Tony Keck, a former director of South Carolinas Department of Health and Human Services, a state that has not expanded.Mr. Keck, now a hospital executive, said that legislators there thought it was more important to invest in existing populations of Medicaid beneficiaries than to expand the program to cover childless adults.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In Utah, a newly formed political committee called Utah Decides Healthcare just concluded seven required public hearings around the state and hopes to soon start gathering the 113,143 signatures needed to get an expansion question on next years ballot.The Republican-controlled legislature could interfere if the initiative were to pass, but RyLee Curtis, the campaign manager for the Utah effort, said she doubted it would because Gov.Gary Herbert and the State Senate had tried to expand Medicaid in the past.Jonathan Schleifer, the executive director of the Fairness Project, a left-leaning group founded in California that donated nearly $700,000 to the pro-expansion campaign in Maine, said the group was eager to help the efforts in Utah and Idaho and scout out other states where ballot initiatives might work.Grassroots groups in other states were waiting to see what happened last night and now they know whats possible, said Mr. Schleifer, his voice hoarse from whooping at a victory party in Maine on Tuesday night.In the next couple weeks well be able to start talking about what other states have the ability to run these initiatives and the grassroots enthusiasm to do that.
Are Mass Murderers Insane? Usually Not, Researchers Say:::::Ditto for Dylann Roof, the racist who murdered nine African-American churchgoers in South Carolina in 2015, and Christopher Harper-Mercer, the angry young man who killed nine people at a community college in Oregon the same year.Nor does anything in these criminals history including domestic violence, like Mr. Kelleys serve to reliably predict their spectacularly cruel acts.Even if spree killers have committed domestic violence disproportionately more often and this assertion is in dispute the vast majority of men who are guilty of that crime never proceed to mass murder.Most mass murderers instead belong to a rogues gallery of the disgruntled and aggrieved, whose anger and intentions wax and wane over time, eventually curdling into violence in the wake of some perceived humiliation.In almost all high-end mass killings, the perpetrators thinking evolves, said Kevin Cameron, executive director of the Canadian Center for Threat Assessment and Trauma Response.They have a passing thought.They think about it more, they fantasize, they slowly build a justification.They prepare, and then when the right set of circumstances comes along, it unleashes the rage.This evolution proceeds rationally and logically, at least in the murderers mind.The unthinkable becomes thinkable, then inevitable.Researchers define mass killings as an event leaving four or more dead at the same place and time.These incidents occur at an average of about one a day across the United States; few make national headlines.Advertisement Continue reading the main story At least half of the perpetrators die in the act, either by committing suicide (Mr. Kelley is said to have shot himself in the head) or being felled by police.Photo Analyzing his database, Dr. Stone has concluded that about 65 percent of mass killers exhibited no evidence of a severe mental disorder; 22 percent likely had psychosis, the delusional thinking and hallucinations that characterize schizophrenia, or sometimes accompany mania and severe depression.(The remainder likely had depressive or antisocial traits.)Among the psychotic, he counts Jared Loughner, the Arizona man who shot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, and 18 others in 2011.By most accounts, including his own, Mr. Loughner was becoming increasingly delusional.Adam Lanza, who in 2012 killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., exhibited extreme paranoia in the months leading up to his crime, isolating himself in his room.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But what to make of John Robert Neumann Jr., who in June shot and killed five former co-workers at a warehouse in Orlando before turning the gun on himself?Mr. Neumann was not overtly psychotic, as far as anyone knows, and this is far more typical of the men who commit mass killings generally.The majority of the killers were disgruntled workers or jilted lovers who were acting on a deep sense of injustice, and not mentally ill, Dr. Stone said of his research.In a 2016 analysis of 71 lone-actor terrorists and 115 mass killers, researchers convened by the Department of Justice found the rate of psychotic disorders to be about what Dr. Stone had discovered: roughly 20 percent.The overall rate of any psychiatric history among mass killers including such probable diagnoses as depression, learning disabilities or A.D.H.D.was 48 percent.About two-thirds of this group had faced long-term stress, like trouble at school or keeping a job, failure in business, or disabling physical injuries from, say, a car accident.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Substance abuse was also common: More than 40 percent had problems with alcohol, marijuana or other drugs.Looking at both studies, and using data from his own work, J. Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist who consults with the F.B.I., has identified what he believes is a common thread: a paranoid spectrum, he calls it.At the extreme end is full-on psychosis of the Loughner variety.But the majority of people on this spectrum are not deeply ill; rather, they are injustice collectors.They are prone to perceive insults and failures as cumulative, and often to blame them on one person or one group.If you have this paranoid streak, this vigilance, this sense that others have been persecuting you for years, theres an accumulation of maltreatment and an intense urge to stop that persecution, Dr. Meloy said.That may never happen.The person may never act on the urge.But when they do, typically theres a triggering event.Its a loss in love or work something that starts a clock ticking, that starts the planning.Mental health treatment might make a difference for the one in five murderers who have severe mental disorders, experts say.Prevention is also possible in a few other cases for instance, if the perpetrators make overt threats and those threats are reported.But other factors must be weighed.In my large file of mass murders, if you look decade by decade, the numbers of victims are fairly small up until the 1960s, said Dr. Stone.Thats when the deaths start going way up.When the AK-47s and the Kalashnikovs and the Uzis all these semiautomatic weapons, when they became so easily accessible.
Maimed but Unbowed, He Understands What Lies Ahead for Gordon Hayward:::::In the gruesome tradition of quarterback Joe Theismann, whose football career ended when a sack snapped his right leg on Monday Night Football in 1985, Sosa has accepted his place as a 21st-century emblem of horrifying leg injuries.Before Kevin Ware (2013), before Paul George (2014) and before Hayward (2017), there was Sosa.Anytime something like this happens, he said, my Twitter blows up.As Hayward begins the long process of rehabilitating from a dislocation fracture of his left ankle, Sosa, 29, is the rare athlete who understands the hard road ahead.He has lived out an answer to the question: How does an elite athlete come back from such a mangling?Every injury is different, of course, and Haywards path forward has extra complexity because a dislocation involves torn ligaments.Photo At a news conference last week, Hayward said that he was still susceptible to dark thoughts I have a lasting image in my mind of rolling over and looking at it, he said but that he wanted to attack his rehabilitation.An All-Star forward who signed a four-year, $128 million contract with the Celtics in July, Hayward also said he was relieved that his surgeons did not find any cartilage damage, which would have presented another set of challenges.Im putting zero expectations on myself as far as a timetable, he said.Sosa, who grew up in Upper Manhattan and starred at Harlems Rice High School before playing at Louisville, can relate to it all: the deep desire to recover everything that he lost, the daily bouts with self-doubt, the nightmarish images that linger.I thought my career was over, he said.In September 2011, Sosa was fresh off his first season as a pro and it had been a good one.Playing for a team called Angelico Biella in Italys top league, Sosa had averaged 14.1 points and 4.5 assists a game.Based on that body of work, Sosa said, the New Orleans Hornets had invited him to attend their training camp.But that was still a few weeks away when Sosa joined the Dominican Republics national team for the FIBA Americas Championship.In the late stages of blowout win against Panama, John Calipari, who was the Dominican Republics coach, urged Sosa to stay aggressive.Heeding Caliparis advice, Sosa drove to the basket and absorbed contact as his defender looked to draw a charge.When Sosa fell, his leg buckled under him.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He immediately knew that something was very wrong: His right shin had broken in half.The lower part of his leg simply dangled, as if the long sock that he wore was all that kept his ankle and foot attached to the rest of his body.Orlando Antigua, one of the teams assistants, rushed to Sosas side and shooed away a camera operator.Sosa can remember screaming but not because he felt physical pain.Instead, his mind raced.He thought about his future.He thought about the N.B.A.He thought the worst.After spending two days at a hospital in Argentina, Sosa was flown to the Dominican Republic, where surgeons put a titanium rod and several screws in his leg.Then came the hard part.Unlike Hayward, who will have a small army of specialists caring for him, Sosa was essentially unemployed.The Dominican national team covered the cost of his surgery, he said, but he returned home to New York without health insurance.He had only his savings from the season in Italy and a bonus from the national team as support for his indefinite future.Photo Knowing that his rehabilitation would be a do-it-yourself project, Sosa became a self-taught expert on compound fractures.Ive never read up so much on anything in my life, he said.Robinson Frias, his personal trainer and a childhood friend, found books on the topic.They made the Vanderbilt Y.M.C.A.on East 47th Street their unofficial headquarters.Sosa began spending six hours a day there, six days a week.(Every day except Sunday, he said.)He swam.He lifted weights.He got massages.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.We just took the mind-set that if you feel better today than you did yesterday, or you can do something this week that you couldnt do last week, then youre doing it right, Sosa said.After two months on crutches, he graduated to a walking boot.After four months, he wore sneakers again.But he had hang-ups.Walking down staircases terrified him.For weeks months, even he was afraid to put weight on his right foot.So he would grip the railing on both sides and hop down the steps.It was all mental, Sosa said.After six months, Sosa took his first tentative steps back onto a court and attempted some set shots.Frias suggested that Sosa take a dribble before shooting.Advertisement Continue reading the main story No, Im not ready, Sosa recalled telling him.Come on, man, Frias said.Just try it.Sosa found the courage to take a pull-up jumper.He landed.And nothing happened, he said.If that was a huge milestone, Sosa experienced setbacks, too.About nine months into the process, he was still having trouble flexing his right ankle.So surgeons removed two screws from the base of the titanium rod, which seemed to help.By July 2012, some 10 months after breaking his leg, Sosa had returned to competition for the Dominican Republic.But then, while bringing the ball upcourt in an exhibition against the United States, he planted and felt a sharp pain in his left foot.Photo Chris Paul might have been putting a little pressure on me, but nothing crazy, Sosa said.And then I just felt like, Yo, what the hell?And Im on the floor.Sosa had fractured his fifth metatarsal, the long bone on the outside of the foot that connects to the little toe.He suspected that it had happened because he had overcompensated for lingering effects of the injury to his right leg.His plan to play for the Sacramento Kings summer league team?Gone.At that time in my life, I was just out of it, Sosa said.I decided not to get surgery.I was tired of surgery.I was tired of seeing doctors.And he was tired of rehab, but he stuck with it.By 2013, he was back (again), playing for professional teams in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.A few months later, he secured a contract with Ratiopharm Ulm of Germanys Basketball Bundesliga.He was thankful.They gave me an opportunity, he said.I was able to get my career back on track.Sosas career has since taken him to Iran, back to Italy and now to New Zealand, where he leads his team in scoring.And as the Celtics hoped for the best with Hayward, Horford said he took some solace in Sosas comeback.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It does make me feel good about Gordon, Horford said in an interview.I think his whole thing is just to make sure he doesnt try to get ahead of himself.If he does the rehab process the right way, he should be able to come back and be ready to go.Sosa has never summoned the nerve to watch the entire video of his fall.He can watch the first part, as he leaves his feet, he said, but then he has to turn away.He also cannot help but wonder how his life might have been different had he not gotten hurt.He once dreamed of the N.B.A.I try not to think about it, he said.I speak about it with my family and theyre like, You know, it was part of Gods plan.But I felt like I was so close.Still, Sosa said he was grateful to be playing at all.He runs and jumps and hardly remembers his injury, he said.Just last week, he drained a game-winning 3-pointer to lift the Breakers to a last-second win against the Cairns Taipans.After a tough break, his game is whole.
Congress Weighs Repeal of Tax Credit for Rare Disease Drugs:::::No matter what happens, some experts welcomed a discussion about a political issue that was once considered untouchable because opponents risked being labeled coldhearted toward people with serious medical conditions.I think it opens up the debate on the orphan drug tax credit, which we think is a flawed incentive, said James Love, director of the consumers group Knowledge Ecology International.And I think thats a positive thing.Under current law, companies that develop drugs for rare diseases can receive a tax credit for half of the cost of their clinical trials and they are also granted seven years of exclusivity, when the drug is protected from competition.Companies are not required to disclose the amounts of the tax credits they receive.Mr. Love said he favored replacing the tax credit with direct government subsidies of clinical trials for rare-disease treatments.In public, the pharmaceutical industrys largest lobbying groups have not said much about the credit.The Biotechnology Innovation Organization, whose members include smaller companies, praised the overall tax plan in a statement last week, but disagreed with the elimination of the tax credit.The other major trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, whose members are generally large public companies, said in a statement that it was pleased that Congress has taken up a tax overhaul and, without mentioning the tax credit, encouraged policymakers to maintain incentives for research into rare-disease treatments.Big drugmakers in particular stand to benefit more from the proposed lower corporate tax rate than from the loss of a tax credit that some companies do not use.And like other major corporations, the industrys opposition may be coalescing far more against a proposed excise tax that could penalize companies for manufacturing their products overseas.These days, many drugs are made outside the United States.Companies that make drugs to treat rare diseases and their lobbyists are already marshaling forces to retain the tax credit.Tactics include enlisting patient-advocacy groups many financed by drug companies and members, whose life-threatening and debilitating diseases often have more of a compelling effect than pharmaceutical executives on lawmakers and the public.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We didnt have any prior warning, said Paul Melmeyer, federal policy director for the National Organization for Rare Disorders, or NORD.We look at that just utter lack of therapies for our patient populations.There could be even 33 percent fewer than what we have, going forward, and that is really what our concern is.Over the last decade, the number of new drugs to treat rare diseases has proliferated, in part because of advancements in scientific research and in part because drug companies have found new ways to profit from diseases that were once seen as unworthy of corporate investment.In 2016, nine of the 22 new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration were for rare diseases; in 2015, 21 of the 45 drugs approved fell into that category.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Despite the investment, advocates note that of the 7,000 rare diseases that have been identified, only about 5 percent have an approved therapy.About 30 million Americans have a rare disease, or about a tenth of the population.While many rare-disease approvals bring advances for patients, companies have also been seen to be taking advantage of the program by seeking the designation for drugs that would be profitable anyway.The drugmaker AbbVie has won multiple approvals for rare-disease uses for Humira, the worlds best-selling drug, ranging from a form of juvenile arthritis to an eye disease, uveitis.Many new cancer approvals also receive orphan-drug designation because they are targeted at a narrow slice of the population.With the coveted exclusivity granted by their orphan-drug status, companies can charge virtually anything they want for these products, and some manufacturers have set astronomical prices for drugs that have gone on to bring in billions in sales.Soliris, made by Alexion, racked up more than $2.8 billion in sales in 2016 even though it is only approved to treat three rare diseases.In May, three Republican senators, including Senator Hatch, asked the Government Accountability Office to look into possible abuses of the Orphan Drug Act, prompted by an investigation by Kaiser Health News.Mr. Melmeyer said he did not think the request showed a change of heart by Senator Hatch, who is chairman of the Finance Committee that may release its tax plan as early as Thursday.Were very much counting on him to step up and be the champion on this, Mr. Melmeyer said.In 2015, a report commissioned by the biotechnology trade group and NORD estimated that if the tax credit were removed, the number of drugs approved over the next decade would decline by 33 percent.Eric Davis, the executive vice president and general counsel of BioMarin Pharmaceutical, which develops what it describes as ultrarare drugs, said the tax credit is really critical to helping us get over the hump with our investment decisions, and I think thats true for a lot of companies in our space.Philip English, a former Republican Congressman who now lobbies for drug firms, said he believed that his clients were picking up support from Republicans and said he was confident that the tax credit would survive any Senate plan.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I think there is a consensus within the industry and within the advocacy community that the orphan drug credit has been immensely successful in generating innovative investment that has produced a string of successes, Mr. English said.Rachel Klein, the senior director of advocacy and strategy for the EveryLife Foundation for Rare Diseases, which was founded by a drug industry executive, said policymakers need to be careful about tinkering with a program that has been around for decades.What seem like small changes can really have a large impact, she said.Ultimately this could end up doing more harm than good, and that really would be a problem for the millions of people who are relying on these companies to develop new therapies.
‘Tell Your Story to Everyone’: Readers Affected by Mass Killings Offer Advice for Fellow Survivors:::::(Some replies have been edited and condensed for clarity.)Tell your story to everyone that is how you heal.Mandi Burkett, Austin, Tex.Affected by the shooting at Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Tex., in 1999 Photo When I was 16 in Fort Worth, Tex., I lived through a mass shooting at my church.The gunman killed seven and wounded seven before turning the gun on himself.I was in complete disbelief.Church was probably the most safe place outside of your home.I would say it was hard, unimaginable, devastating, but none of those words really describes it.My boyfriend then, now husband, was with me at the time, as were many of our friends.It goes without saying, we were immediately changed forever.I know we all came away with something different, but from the last 18 years, here is what I know: 1.You will never get over it.You will change, and things will get different, but you will think about this (and sometimes relive it) every day of your life.2.I have a strong faith, as do many others I was with that night, but faith alone cannot get you through this.Find a counselor, and go.If someone offers you counseling services, say yes as fast as you can.You will need to work through so many things.3.Dont stay hidden inside.This world is scary, but man, it is also really good.Some days just getting up and moving will be hard, but you will get up and you will keep going.Live your life.It is indeed so precious.4.Dont be scared to tell others what they mean to you.That is one of the biggest things I have learned.Just say it.Text it or write it down.You never know how many more opportunities you will have.Even if you cry the whole time and you stumble on the words, tell them.People need to hear those positive words more than you know, so say them.Speak life into others.5.Keep talking about it.Tell your story to everyone that is how you heal and that is the only way things will change.When you have had time to heal and you can talk about it, then talk about it.We need to put faces and names to this epidemic.We need to be brave and share our stories.Let yourself go through all the emotions.Andie Caputo, Smyrna, Del.Affected by the shooting in Las Vegas in 2017 Photo I was at the concert in Vegas on the night of the mass shooting.I just remember trying to get out and running as far as I possibly could.I cant explain the fear we all had that night, and I dont think its something Ill ever forget.I think the healing process is just starting for my family.They have been my biggest support and are all there for me on my roughest days.My mom has literally been there for every call, text, anything I need to listen and talk me through it.I am going to therapy to figure out how to process this.I would say just try to remember to take everything one day at a time and to let yourself go through all the emotions youre feeling whenever they come up.Ive been trying so hard to just put on a brave face, but when it all builds up and you are feeling angry or upset, let yourself feel that way and then pick yourself up and remember how lucky you are to be here.Love trumps hate.We need to come together and remember theres more good than evil in this world.Dont try to understand why there is no why.Jon Ferguson, Vancouver, Wash.Affected by the shooting in Seattles Capitol Hill neighborhood in 2006 I lost two close friends at what was terribly dubbed the Seattle Massacre, in 2006.It was awful, from the moment I learned about it to this day.I had been at the location of the shooting just a few hours before it happened.I left partly because I had to work the next day.The grief was intense and immediate and lasted for years.I still feel very shaken by it, and my heart aches at the news of each new shooting.I was and am still very fortunate to have many close friends who are in the same boat as me.We support each other.I dont know what I would have done without them.My advice to anyone going through this is to grieve.Dont be afraid of your grief.Dont try to understand why there is no why.It doesnt make sense and it never will.All that anger I felt wasnt hurting anyone but me.Brad Geiger, Logan, Ohio Affected by the shooting in Aurora, Colo., in 2012 Photo A good friend of mine was a victim of the Batman shooting in Colorado, back in 2012.We would go to lunch a few times a week at work.After the shooting, I was so angry at the shooter.Honestly, if given the opportunity, I probably would have flown to Colorado and put a bullet in the back of the shooters head.When the time came for the shooters trial, I kept up with it as much as I could.I remember as the trial drew to its end, I couldnt wait for the verdict.As the verdict was read, at first I was like, How is he not getting the death penalty?Then as the decision for each victim was read, I discovered something.What I had wanted was vengeance; what the shooter was getting was justice.It took a while, but I let go of my anger and thirst for revenge.I realized that all that anger I felt wasnt hurting anyone but me.Now I do things to honor my friends memory.For example, I bought breakfast for a father and his son at a local restaurant.He asked why, and I told him about Matt.When Batman v Superman came out, I went to our local theater to watch it.I made arrangements through the owners wife to purchase 10 tickets for strangers in Matts name.In each instance, I try to let others know a little bit about him.Coping is knowing when to push aside the heartache so its more like background noise.Mary Kay Mace, Petersburg, Ill.Affected by the shooting at Northern Illinois University in 2008 Photo My only child, my daughter, Ryanne (pronounced like the boys name Ryan), was the youngest of the five students murdered in the mass shooting at Northern Illinois University on Feb. 14, 2008.Its been exceedingly difficult to cope.Ive had to adjust how I even define that word.Coping means that I know I will always be sad and feel longing, loneliness and incomplete.Coping is knowing when to push aside the heartache so its more like background noise when I have to focus on something else.I take every opportunity I can to honor Ryannes memory by urging legislators to enact smarter, more enforceable gun safety laws.Its devastating each time I hear about another shooting.Ive been at this for nearly 10 years, and I can say only one thing with 100 percent certainty: It wont be my child who gets killed in the next mass shooting.I take no pleasure in stating that fact because I dont want anybody else to go through this.Always look for the helpers.Dora Totoian, Roseburg, Ore.Affected by the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon in 2015 Photo After the mass shooting in my hometown, Roseburg, Ore., someone very dear to me told me to think of a Mr. Rogers quote: Always look for the helpers.There are always people who are helping.Looking for those people helped in the grieving process because it proved to me that even though theres so much evil and sadness in the world, whenever one of these acts of evil occurs, there are always people working to relieve the pain, even if its hard to see them and focus on them.Knowing that there are people like that is a great comfort.I was a high school senior at the time, and I lost my friend Lucero that day.We werent super good friends, just friends from class, but her passing has affected me a lot.Its the worst kind of pain because its so unexpected.You should know that youll never heal completely and that youll have a new definition of normal.However, you should also know that in these moments you get to see the best of humanity and of your community.Theres generally a hero in these tragedies, and I try to reflect on them.Jonas Nahoum, Santa Fe, N.M.Affected by the shooting in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 Im from Newtown, Conn., and I have friends from high school that lost their daughter.Newtown is a small town so of course I know of others.My parents still live in Newtown.They were extremely emotional and quick to cry in the months after the shooting.We talked about it a lot.Seeing them suffer like that gave me a realization of how far-reaching the effects are.Going home (I live in New Mexico now) was incredibly difficult although people were kinder to each other, there was and still is a dark cloud over Newtown.I find reminders everywhere when I visit.Ive coped with this tragedy by holding my kids tighter when Dec. 14 comes around, and I always read them the book by Steven Kellogg and Patricia MacLachlan, dedicated to the Newtown community: Snowflakes Fall.The kids dont know its references, but its a reminder to me never to normalize what happened and always to remember.I also went to high school with a relative of Vicki Soto, the brave teacher that sacrificed herself to save her classroom of children.I remember her as a positive light during such a dark event, and Im continually inspired by her.Theres generally a hero in these tragedies, and I try to reflect on them rather than on the disturbed individual that committed the act.Like it or not I was a survivor.Barb Cone, Concord, Mass.Affected by the downing of Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771 in 1987 My late husband was killed when a disgruntled, fired airline employee put a gun in a gym bag, flashed his airline ID to bypass security and boarded a flight he knew his supervisor was on.He took the plane down, killing over 40 people.Coping?Maybe.You have two choices in situations like this.Either you survive or you dont.For my part I wasnt sure I wanted to live, but live I did.Often unwillingly, inconsistently, in a daze.Events like these have a way of dividing time into before and after.While I was never the same in all sorts of ways, I was fortunate to have a certain resilience.Like it or not I was a survivor.We have found blessings in new friends who also are coping with this loss.Jolanda Arnold, Lorton, Va.Affected by the shooting in the Washington Navy Yard in 2013 Photo
Alternatives to Opioids for Pain Relief:::::Photo A combination of Tylenol and Advil worked just as well as opioids for relief of pain in the emergency room, a randomized trial has found.Researchers studied 416 men and women who arrived in the E.R.with moderate to severe pain in their arms or legs from sprains, strains, fractures or other injuries.They randomly assigned them to an oral dose of acetaminophen (Tylenol) with either ibuprofen (Advil) or the opioids oxycodone, hydrocodone or codeine.Two hours later, they questioned them using an 11-point pain scale.The average score was 8.7 before taking medicine.That score decreased 4.3 points with ibuprofen and Tylenol, 4.4 with oxycodone and Tylenol, 3.5 with hydrocodone and Tylenol, and 3.9 with codeine and Tylenol.In other words, there was no significant difference, either statistically or clinically, among any of the four regimens.The study is in JAMA.The lead author, Dr. Andrew K. Chang, a professor of emergency medicine at Albany Medical College, said that while any single patient might find opioids more effective, on average, even for the severe pain of fractures, non-opioids worked just as well.Some docs will reflexively give an opioid to anyone with a fracture, Dr. Chang said.But if we can give the non-opioid and show the patient that it works, we can help with this ongoing opioid problem.
Gene Therapy Creates Replacement Skin to Save a Dying Boy:::::Advertisement Gene Therapy Creates Replacement Skin to Save a Dying Boy Image Hassan was saved by gene therapy that created sheets of healthy skin to cover 80 percent of his body.Credit Mirko Wache/Ruhr-University Bochum Doctors in Europe used gene therapy to grow sheets of healthy skin that saved the life of a boy with a genetic disease that had destroyed most of his skin, the team reported on Wednesday in the journal Nature.This was not the first use of the treatment, which adds gene therapy to a technique developed to grow skin grafts for burn victims.But it was by far the most body surface ever covered in a patient with a genetic disorder: nine square feet.The boys disease , junctional epidermolysis bullosa , causes extremely fragile skin that blisters and tears, and is prone to infections and skin cancer.He had been expected to die but has recovered.Two years after the treatment, he continues to have healthy skin and lead a normal life.A video provided by the medical team shows the boy, Hassan, playing soccer with his father.According to news reports, the family is originally from Syria.Epidermolysis bullosa (epi-derm-uh-LY-sis bull-OH-suh) takes various forms, depending on the genetic mutation involved.About 25,000 people in the United States have the condition, and 500,000 worldwide.The severity varies, but some patients spend much of their lives covered in bandages and in severe pain.Brett Kopelan, who has a child with the disease and is executive director of a support and advocacy group, debra , said that the highly specialized dressings his daughter needs cost more than $500,000 a year.The treatment described in the new report offers hope to some patients but not all.Not every mutation can be corrected in the same way as the one in the report.It certainly made an incredible transformation in the life of the boy, said an expert not involved in the case, Dr. Jouni Uitto, the chairman of the department of dermatology and cutaneous biology in the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.Now its just one case, and it sort of remains to be seen whats the general applicability of this approach.The other issue is, whats the cost of this?Dr. Uitto also cautioned that epidermolysis bullosa often involves damage to internal tissue, like the lining of the esophagus and urinary tract, that gene therapy for the skin cannot repair.Image A graphic published with a new study shows how skin cells were taken from the patient, altered to correct a genetic flaw, and grown into sheets of skin for grafting.Gradually, holoclones, colonies that contain stem cells, take over and maintain the new skin.Credit Nature News & Views Dr. M. Peter Marinkovich, an associate professor of dermatology at Stanford University School of Medicine, said he was blown away by a presentation he had seen about the case.Gosh, its just a great advance, he said.Dr. Marinkovich has been conducting similar research and published a report a year ago in JAMA in which his team treated smaller areas of skin in four adults with a different form of the disease.Some improved, but the responses varied and tended to decline after a year.The research is continuing.The new report, he said, has taken it to the next step and has actually used it to treat a large amount of skin.Thats whats really incredible.Other researchers have tried bone-marrow transplants to correct the genetic flaws in the disease, but several children have died from the side effects of that arduous treatment, and results have been mixed in those who survived.The boy in the Nature article had suffered since birth from blisters all over his body, and in 2015, when he was 7, contracted bacterial infections that caused him to lose two-thirds of his skin.His doctors did not know how to treat him, other than keeping him on morphine for the pain.Because burn victims also lose skin, the doctors sent him to the burn unit of the Childrens Hospital at Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany.A photograph of him then shows an emaciated body encased in raw, crimson flesh.We had a lot of trouble keeping this kid alive, Dr. Tobias Rothoeft, of the Childrens Hospital, said during a telephone briefing.Doctors in the burn unit tried everything: antibiotics, bandages, special nutritional measures, a skin transplant from the boys father.Nothing worked.After two months, we were sure we could do nothing for this kid and he would die, Dr. Rothoeft said.The physicians began to discuss just keeping the boy comfortable.But his parents begged them to keep trying.The doctors pored over medical journals and decided to approach Dr. Michele De Luca, the director of the Center for Regenerative Medicine Stefano Ferrari at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in Modena, Italy.Image A sheet of skin created from cultured cells, shown at St. Josef Hospital in Bochum, Germany.Credit Mirko Wache/Ruhr University Bochum, via Associated Press His team had treated smaller patches of skin on a patient with the same disease, and he had expertise in growing large skin grafts, which had been used to treat hundreds of burn victims.He is also renowned in the field for producing corneal grafts that have saved the sight of people with eye injuries.He promised he could give us enough skin to heal this kid, which we then tried, and we were in the end successful, Dr. Rothoeft said.Dr. De Luca described the case as compassionate use of an experimental therapy that is being tested in clinical trials.The doctors removed a sample of the boys skin slightly more than half a square inch and took it to Modena, where they genetically engineered his cells, using a virus to insert the normal form of his mutated gene into his DNA.Then they grew the engineered cells in the laboratory into sheets of skin and transported them back to Germany, where surgeons grafted them onto the boys body.In October 2015, they covered his arms and legs with the new skin, and in November, his back.Ultimately, they replaced 80 percent of the childs skin.Dr. De Luca said that when the bandages were removed, It was spectacular.It was great.We removed the gauze, and saw the epidermis underneath.Everybody was pretty happy.We got the feeling that the body of the kid was recovering, was responding.That was the time where we thought, maybe we can make it.A major concern with any type of gene therapy is that the inserted genetic material could have dangerous side effects, like turning off an essential gene or turning on one that could lead to cancer.Analyses of the patients new skin did not find the added genetic material in any worrisome places, the researchers reported.Tests also showed that just a few long-lived stem cells maintained the new skin, an important finding that underlines the need for careful cell culturing, Dr. De Luca said.The boy was in the hospital for almost eight months, Dr. De Luca said, including more than four months during which he was kept in a medically induced coma to spare him from pain.The drugs were stopped a few weeks before Christmas.When he woke up, Dr. De Luca said, he realized he had a new skin.Order Reprints | Todays Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A 6 of the New York edition with the headline: Gene Therapy Creates New Skin to Save a Dying Syrian Boy Sign up for the Well Newsletter Get the best of Well, with the latest on health, fitness and nutrition, delivered to your inbox every week.SEE SAMPLE Please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.* Required field You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times products and services.You are already subscribed to this email.Sign Up
Can Ketones Rev Up Our Workouts?:::::Inspired by that possibility, some athletes and nutritionists now tout diets that contain almost no carbohydrates and large amounts of fat.Over time, these diets lower the bodys stores of carbohydrates and require it to burn fat almost exclusively.Such diets also result in an abundance of ketones, substances produced by the liver that the muscles and brain can use as fuel.The problem is that it takes weeks or, more commonly, months for the body to adjust to a low-carbohydrate diet.In the interim, athletic performance suffers and most people feel sluggish and unwell, sometimes developing a condition known as ketone flu that resembles food poisoning.So some athletes and their advisers have begun to wonder whether taking ketone supplements might allow athletes to gain the benefits of a high-fat diet without the long, difficult transition time.Various types of these supplements, in the form of powders or drinks, are chemically identical to the ketones made by the body.They are also widely available at many stores and, as of now, legal under international doping regulations.Last year, a much-discussed study conducted by researchers at Oxford University found that a proprietary type of ketone supplement improved cycling performance in a group of trained riders.But that study looked at relatively moderate exercise, not the kind of intense exertion required during competition.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.So for the new study, which was published last month in Frontiers in Physiology, scientists at the Australian Institute of Sport and other institutions decided to create a more real-world test of ketone supplementation.Conveniently, they had a ready-made group of volunteers in the 11 members of a mens professional, world-class bicycling team that were about to begin their preseason training in Australia.The teams members, who had ridden in the Tour de France and other international events, were keenly interested in the possible benefits of ketone supplements, according to Louise Burke, the head of sports nutrition at the Australian Institute of Sport and the studys senior author.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The experiment the scientists concocted was simple.About an hour before a training session, they gave each rider a drink that contained either ketones or a placebo.The drinks looked and tasted much the same.The riders had a second dose of that same drink immediately before starting.(The drink they used is, so far, available only for research purposes and not for sale to the public.)Then the men rode stationary bicycles programmed to recreate on a screen the 31-kilometer (about 19 miles) course of the 2017 road-cycling world championship.The riders virtually raced at the highest pace and power output that they could maintain.Each rider rode after drinking the placebo and, on another day, after swallowing the ketones.The results were unanimous.Every rider performed worse after drinking the ketone supplement.Their times were about 2 percent slower and their power output almost 4 percent less, declines that, in actual competition, would drop them from contention for medals.Every rider also reported some degree of gastrointestinal upset after drinking the ketone supplement.One experienced such prolonged vomiting and dizziness, the scientists reported, that he could not start the time trial.Others had symptoms ranging from dry retching to relatively mild nausea.Not surprisingly, the riders all guessed during which trial they had the ketones, based on their stomachs reactions.But most told the scientists that they thought they were riding faster during that trial, because the pedaling had felt so difficult.Told that their performance in fact had declined, almost all announced that they were no longer interested in using ketones for performance enhancement.This study was very short-term, however.It is possible that the riders and their stomachs might adjust to the supplement over time and perhaps gain benefits, Dr. Burke says.The study also does not show whether stomach upset alone clobbered the riders performance or if other physiological processes were involved.The riders brains could have interpreted the sudden presence of ketones as indicating a metabolic problem, Dr. Burke says, and responded by sending messages to the muscles urging them to slow down.The upshot is that far more research needs to be conducted before experts can make recommendations about ketone supplementation for athletes, Dr. Burke says.Everyone wants simple answers, she says, but the bodys mechanisms are too complex to allow for that, especially during sports.In the meantime, there is one other practical caveat to bear in mind about the currently available supplements, she says.They almost all taste very nasty.
Pesticides Tied to Problems in Assisted Pregnancies:::::Photo Eating fruits and vegetables high in pesticides may lower the chance of successful birth with assisted reproductive technology, according to a new report.Researchers studied 325 women undergoing fertility treatment in Boston.They collected data on medical and lifestyle factors and had the women fill out food frequency questionnaires.Using data from the United States Department of Agriculture, which samples produce for pesticide residue, they calculated the amount of residue on what the women ate.A list of fruits and vegetables and their pesticide residue score appears in the study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine.The 325 women had 228 live births.Women in the highest one-quarter for high-pesticide residue produce consumption had an 18 percent lower probability of pregnancy and a 26 percent lower probability of live birth than those in the lowest one-quarter.The senior author, Dr. Jorge E. Chavarro, an associate professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H.Chan School of Public Health, noted that this is just one study, and it would have to be replicated before firm conclusions can be drawn.Still, he said, If you really want to eat peaches or spinach two of the most contaminated foods on the list it makes sense to switch to the organic version.The literature is not so clear on whether switching has health consequences.This is the first study to my knowledge to suggest that it does.
Cancer Doctors Cite Risks of Drinking Alcohol:::::Yet few adults, when asked, identify alcohol consumption as a risk factor for cancer, even though the vast majority were familiar with other cancer risk factors, like smoking and sun exposure, a recent ASCO survey of 4,016 adults found.Fewer than one in three adults identified alcohol as a risk factor for cancer.(Most also failed to mention obesity as a risk factor.)The doctors group is also calling for new public health initiatives to curb alcohol use, from taxes to restrictions on ads targeting minors, like the new ban on alcohol advertising on New York Citys subways and buses slated to go into effect in January.The group likewise opposes pink washing, in which alcohol companies drape their products in pink ribbon to enhance sales, a practice it opposes given the consistent evidence that shows the link between alcohol consumption and an increased risk of breast cancer.For the statement, ASCO researchers reviewed earlier published studies and concluded that 5.5 percent of all new cancers and 5.8 percent of all cancer deaths worldwide could be attributed to alcohol.The paper stated clearly that alcohol plays a causal role in cancers of the throat and neck, voice box, liver and colon, as well as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and, in women, breast cancer.For women, just one alcoholic drink a day can increase breast cancer risk, according to a report released in May from the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund that was cited by ASCO.That report analyzed 119 studies, including data on 12 million women and over a quarter of a million breast cancer cases, and concluded there was strong evidence that alcohol consumption increases the risk of both pre- and postmenopausal cancer, and that drinking a small glass of wine or beer every day about 10 grams of alcohol increases premenopausal breast cancer risk by 5 percent and postmenopausal risk by 9 percent.The more you drink, the higher the risk, said Dr. Clifford A. Hudis, the chief executive of ASCO.Its a pretty linear dose-response.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Even those who drink moderately, defined by the Centers for Disease Control as one daily drink for women and two for men, face nearly a doubling of the risk for mouth and throat cancer and more than double the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, compared to nondrinkers.Moderate drinkers also face elevated risks for cancers of the voice box, female breast cancer and colorectal cancers.The risk for heavy drinkers defined as eight or more drinks a week for women and 15 or more a week for men, including binge drinkers are multiples higher.Heavy drinkers face roughly five times the risk of mouth and throat cancers and squamous cell esophageal cancers than nondrinkers, nearly three times the risk of cancers of the voice box or larynx, double the risk of liver cancer, as well as increased risks for female breast cancer and colorectal cancer.If you look at these figures, you see alcohol is a contributing factor; certainly it has a causal role, Dr. Hudis said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the World Health Organization, first classified the consumption of alcoholic beverages as carcinogenic to humans in 1987, tying consumption to cancers of the mouth, throat, voice box, esophagus and liver, said Susan Gapstur, vice president for epidemiology at the American Cancer Society.Since then, she said, more and more evidence has accumulated tying alcohol to a broader group of cancers, including colorectal cancer and, in women, breast cancer.A more recent I.A.R.C.report concluded that alcohol is a cause of cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, colorectum, liver and female breast.(The esophageal cancer is largely specific to squamous cell carcinoma.)The story of alcohol has been quite consistent and has been peeled away like an onion over time, and were continuing to learn more about the mechanisms involved, Dr. Gapstur said.We dont have randomized trials, but sometimes when you start looking at the coherence of all the evidence, including the observational epidemiology, the lab studies, the mechanistic studies, you begin to see a picture and get more clarity.One way alcohol may lead to cancer is because the body metabolizes it into acetaldehyde, which causes changes and mutations in DNA, Dr. Gapstur said.The formation of acetaldehyde starts when alcohol comes in contact with bacteria in the mouth, which may explain the link between alcohol and cancers of the throat, voice box and esophagus, she suggested.Dr. Anne McTiernan, a scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who was an author of one of the earlier reports on alcohol and breast cancer, said she was pleased that oncologists were focusing on alcohol.That puts some weight behind this, she said.It shows theyre serious about it and willing to put their name on the line for changes in policy, and willing to say that even small amounts of alcohol can increase the risks of some cancers to a small degree.
Women More Likely Than Men to Die in First Year After Heart Attack:::::Photo Compared with men, women are at significantly higher risk of death in the first year after a heart attack, a new study has found.The generally higher risk of death in women who have heart attacks is well known, but the differences are largely explained by womens older age when the attack occurs, higher rates of other diseases, and types of treatment they typically receive.This new analysis, published in PLOS One, controlled for those variables and others.Researchers studied 802 men and 802 women matched for age, hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, various measures of heart function and the types of treatment and medications they received.In the first year of a five-year follow-up, women were 60 percent more likely to die than their male counterparts.Beyond the first year, mens and womens death rates did not differ.The reasons are unclear, but the authors suggest that higher levels of psychological stress and depression in women may play a role.They did not have the data to assess these factors.We should follow female patients more carefully, said the senior author, Dr. Georg Schmidt, a professor of cardiology at the Technical University of Munich in Germany.As doctors, we should ask our patients about their concerns, and look for opportunities for support beyond drugs and other standard treatments.
Delhi, Blanketed in Toxic Haze, ‘Has Become a Gas Chamber’:::::The situation prompted the states chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, to say on Twitter: Delhi has become a gas chamber.Every year this happens during this part of year.We have to find a soln to crop burning in adjoining states.Imran Hussain, the environment minister of Delhi, said on Twitter in August that he had written to officials in the states of Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh requesting a reduction in agricultural fires, but no action had been taken, a government spokesman said on Twitter on Tuesday.Photo The fires, combined with car exhaust, smokestack emissions and the burning of garbage, contribute to pollution levels that often hover in the severe category, the highest level designated by the Central Pollution Control Board.An article last month in the medical journal The Lancet found that pollution was responsible for up to 2.5 million deaths in India in 2015, more than in any other country.Photo Manish Sisodia, the deputy chief minister of Delhi, said on Tuesday that all options for reducing pollution were being considered.The government has suggested reintroducing an alternate-days limit on the use of private cars, and using helicopters to sprinkle water to help clear the air.At a news conference late Tuesday, Mr. Sisodia announced that classes at primary schools would be suspended on Wednesday, and possibly longer.Last year, the government temporarily closed more than 1,800 schools after a string of especially polluted days.Dr. Sarath K. Guttikunda, an air pollution specialist and the director of the independent research group Urban Emissions, said that keeping children at home could reduce their exposure to air pollution, especially in areas where vehicles emissions are high.But Dr. Kumar, the chest surgeon, said he was unconvinced by the governments approach to curbing pollution.The problem would continue, he added, unless the citys residents put greater collective pressure on politicians to devise sustainable solutions.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The options for Delhi residents are three, Dr. Kumar said.One is to stop breathing.That is not possible.Second is to quit Delhi.That is also not possible.Third is to make the right to breathe fresh air a peoples movement.
Could You Be Allergic to Additives in Food or Drugs?:::::Doctors disagree on whether food additives like dyes, preservatives, stabilizers, emulsifiers and other substances can provoke a true allergic reaction.Medical journals have published case reports of allergic responses to food additives, including anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening reaction that causes the throat to constrict.But many allergists say such reactions are extremely rare, noting that the reports are anecdotal and that rigorous double-blinded studies have not found evidence that allergies to food additives exist.Its very, very rare to see hives from a chemical thats a food additive, because these are small molecules that typically dont trigger allergic reactions, said Dr. Scott Sicherer, a professor of pediatrics, allergy and immunology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.No ones saying it doesnt happen, but the reports in the literature are handfuls theyre not in the thousands.In 1986, however, after more than a dozen deaths were linked to severe allergic reactions to sulfite preservatives used to prevent green vegetables from turning brown, the Food and Drug Administration banned restaurants from using sulfites on raw fruits and vegetables.The agency also requires foods containing yellow dye No.5 to list the color on the label, saying the dye can cause hives in rare cases, estimated at fewer than one in 10,000 people.In recent years, however, as consumer demand for natural foods has risen, food manufacturers have been replacing synthetic additives with natural ones derived from plants, insects and other animal products.These natural substances are more likely to provoke an allergic reaction because they contain proteins that our immune systems might react to, said Dr. Ronald Simon, an allergist and immunologist at Scripps Clinic Carmel Valley in San Diego, who reviewed the literature for UpToDate, a clinical information resource used by doctors.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.These natural additives include substances like a red food dye called carmine or cochineal extract, which is made from insects; a yellow dye made from the fruit of the annatto tree; psyllium, a source of dietary fiber derived from seed husks; and guar gum, which is made from a bean and is used as a binder and emulsifier in food and drugs.All of these have been implicated in rare cases of anaphylaxis.Allergic reactions have also been reported from carrageenin, a thickener derived from seaweed; the jelling agent pectin; gelatin; and Mycoprotein/, a fermented fungus used as a meat substitute and marketed under the brand name Quorn.Our immune system recognizes these natural proteins, Dr. Simon said, because it evolved to protect us against invading organisms and to recognize protein structures in fungi and bacteria or cancer cells.He said the immune system is less likely to recognize a synthetic additive.(Dr. Simon acknowledged he has served as a consultant on food additives for the International Association of Color Manufacturers.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Swerlick, the dermatologist who treated Ms. Eisenberg, agreed that reactions to synthetic additives are rare and not well understood, making them even more difficult to identify.In a 2013 paper, he described 11 patients he had seen over a five-year period, all of whom came in with chronic skin disorders that cleared up significantly when drugs containing coloring were replaced by dye-free medications.(Skeptics say that hives generally come and go and there is no proof that the removal of dyes caused the patients skin to clear.)Each of Dr. Swerlicks cases was slightly different, he said, so it was a bit of detective work.One 61-year-old patient had chronic skin problems on his hand, but the rash flared up suddenly, shortly after he refilled a prescription for diabetes pills and noticed that the color had changed from off-white to dark purple.The new pills, it turned out, contained a blue dye.Another patient, a 42-year-old man, had suffered from a rash for almost a year but noticed it resolved when he went on vacation and left his toothpaste, which contained a blue dye, at home.Many of the patients had a drug allergy list thats 20 drugs long, Dr. Swerlick said.You realize they cant be allergic to all these medications.It must be something common to all of them, like a dye.Thats one of the clues.He said people concerned about dye additives should watch for reactions to items that contain food coloring, such as red velvet cake and drinks like Powerade and Crystal Light.Patients can look up the ingredients in prescription and nonprescription drugs by reading the label or using the online resource Daily Med.Unlike severe allergic reactions to a food, like peanuts, which occur immediately, the reactions to additives tend to be delayed for several hours or even days, making them difficult to trace, he said, and there are no good diagnostic tools for identifying food additive allergies.One hint that you may have an allergy to an additive is if you develop a reaction to a prepared product or a restaurant item, even though you tolerate the same food when you make it at home.Theres reason to be skeptical, Dr. Swerlick said.But I think the allergy community historically has equated absence of proof with proof of absence.
Heatwaves can kill you 27 different ways:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- As global temperatures continue to rise and heatwaves become more common, scientists are working to better understand the impacts on human health.According to a study published this week, the threats posed by heatwaves are surprisingly diverse.In fact, heatwaves can kill humans 27 different ways.Researchers detailed the different fatal mechanisms in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes."We know of many case examples when people have died as a result of heatwaves," lead author Camilo Mora, researcher the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said in a news release."However, why people died is a question whose answer is scattered."Mora and his colleagues identified five physiological mechanisms affected by extreme heat.They determined those five mechanisms can damage seven different organs.The researchers then surveyed the medical literature for evidence the 35 possible mechanism-organ combinations.The literature suggests 27 of the combinations can prove fatal."Dying during a heatwave is like a terror movie with 27 bad endings to choose from," Mora said."It is remarkable that humanity overall is taking such a complacency on the threats that ongoing climate change is posing."During instances of extreme heat, the body's hypothalamus redirects blood to the skin for cooling purposes.This can leave vital organs without sufficient blood supply.The mechanism, called ischemia, can produce toxic chemical compounds.Another mechanism, cytotoxity, describes direct cell damage caused by heat.Both mechanisms can damage the brain, heart, kidneys, liver or digestive tract.The mechanisms can kill a person on their own, or lead to variety of other deadly complications.For example, ischemia and cytotoxity can lead to the breakdown and failure of the intestinal wall, allowing a person's guts to spill into the bloodstream, triggering what's known as systemic inflammatory response syndrome, or SIRS.The inflammatory response recruits white blood cells to battle the infection, but the mechanism can worsen the breakdown of the intestines.This physiological train wreck can trigger another mechanism, called disseminated intravascular coagulation, during which a cascade of overactive proteins cause blood to begin clotting throughout the body, shutting off blood supply to the brain and other vital organs, and leading to fatal hemorrhaging.The final mechanism is triggered when ischemia and cytotoxity are exacerbated by strenuous activity, leading to the breakdown of muscle tissue and the release of myoglobin, which is toxic to the liver, lungs and kidneys.Though the elderly and people with compromised immune systems are most at risk, the latest research is reminder that heatwaves can harm anyone and everyone.Researchers say such risks demand policy makers do what's necessary to prevent further warming.
Nanoshells could deliver cancer drugs directly to tumors with fewer side effects:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Scientists at Rice University are perfecting a novel drug delivery system for treating cancer.The system utilizes gold nanoparticles, which, when zapped with a laser, release a drug inside the tumor cells.In recent lab tests, scientists used gold nanoparticles to smuggle toxic doses of two common cancer drugs, lapatinib and docetaxel, into breast cancer cells.When hit with the laser, the nanoshells successfully released the drug doses.Drugs used to treat cancer are especially toxic and are often rejected by tumor cells.To have an effect on the hard-to-penetrate cells, large doses are required.These large doses cause a variety of harmful, often intolerable side effects.By sneaking small doses into cancer cells, scientists can more accurately target tumors while avoiding the side effects that sicken patients.The latest tests results -- detailed in the journal PNAS -- prove their delivery technology is sound and that the nanoshsells don't release the drugs before being triggered.The nanoparticles -- made of glass, coated in gold and tuned to respond to specific laser wavelengths -- are smuggled into the cancer cells using the Trojan-horse strategy."In future studies, we plan to use a Trojan-horse strategy to get the drug-laden nanoshells inside tumors," Naomi Halas, an engineer, chemist and physicist at Rice, said in a news release."Macrophages, a type of white blood cell that's been shown to penetrate tumors, will carry the drug-particle complexes into tumors, and once there we use a laser to release the drugs."Halas first developed nanoshsells more than 15 years ago and has been slowly improving the technology ever since.In the latest study, she and her colleagues wanted to test the delivery system using two new types of lasers signals.The researchers successfully triggered the drug release using both continuous-wave laser triggering and low-power pulse laser triggering.Halas and her colleagues hope the latest results will translate to other types of cancer drugs."I'm particularly excited about the potential for lapatinib," said Susan Clare, a research associate professor of surgery at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine."The first time I heard about Naomi's work, I wondered if it might be the answer to delivering drugs into the anoxic -- depleted of oxygen -- interior of tumors where some of the most aggressive cancer cells lurk.As clinicians, we're always looking for ways to keep cancer from coming back months or years later, and I am hopeful this can do that."While the most recent tests only featured cancer cells in culture dishes, they expect their next study to test the delivery system on animal models.Scientists at other institutions are working on similar technologies.In a recent study, researchers experimented with drug-carrying polymer nanoparticles capable of changing shape in order to accommodate different types of drugs and target specific cells.
Scientists rejuvenate old human cells, make them look and act younger:::::Nov. 7 (UPI) -- Scientists have found a way to breath new life into old, inactive human cells.As detailed in a new paper published in the journal BMC Cell Biology, the rejuvenation technique had cells dividing within a few hours of treatment.The resuscitated cells also boasted longer telomeres, the chromosome caps that shrink as cells age.Researchers at the University of Exeter found that a group of genes called splicing factors get turned off one by one as cells grow older.Scientists, however, found different chemical concoctions can turn the splicing factors back on, causing cells to look and act younger.To kickstart the rejuvenation process, researchers exposed cell cultures to reversatrol analogues, chemical derivatives of a substance that occur naturally in red wine, dark chocolate, red grapes and blueberries.Aging is linked with a variety of cellular defects, and these degenerative effects increase the likelihood of many chronic diseases, including stroke, heart disease and cancer.The latest discovery could pave the way for treatments that slow down the aging process and prevent such defects, diminishing the risk of aging-related diseases."This is a first step in trying to make people live normal lifespans, but with health for their entire life," Lorna Harries, a professor of molecular genetics at Exeter, said in a news release."Our data suggests that using chemicals to switch back on the major class of genes that are switched off as we age might provide a means to restore function to old cells."Scientists have previously slowed the cellular aging process in lab mice through chemical stimulating, genetic manipulation and caloric restriction, but researchers were surprised to achieve such definitive and rapid results among human cells."When I saw some of the cells in the culture dish rejuvenating I couldn't believe it.These old cells were looking like young cells.It was like magic," said Eva Latorre, research associate at Exeter."I repeated the experiments several times and in each case the cells rejuvenated.I am very excited by the implications and potential for this research."Splicing factors are genetic instructions for a variety of tasks.These factors inform cells how to function and react under a range of circumstances.But as cells age, these splicing factors begin to shut down, leaving cells less adaptable.Every organ features so-called senescent cells, cells that are still alive but that don't function properly.With fewer or no splicing factors, these cells are less able to control their genetic expression, making the cells and organ more susceptible to disease."When you treat old cells with molecules that restore the levels of the splicing factors, the cells regain some features of youth," Harries said."Far more research is needed now to establish the true potential for these sort of approaches to address the degenerative effects of aging."
Making water available to school children at lunch may save $13B in health costs:::::Nov. 7 (UPI) -- A new analysis of data at the University of Illinois suggests that encouraging children to drink water with every meal could prevent child obesity.The conclusions of Dr. Ruopeng An, a professor of kinesiology and community health at Illinois, are based on a proposed nationwide expansion of a pilot program in more than 1,200 New York City elementary and middle schools.Water dispensers placed in school cafeterias tripled students' consumption of water at lunchtime, researchers reported in 2016, suggesting the availability of water lessened intake of food, which was associated with small but significant declines in students' risks of being overweight one year later.A reduction in the number of overweight or obese children, carrying their extra weight into maturity, would result in fewer health problems and decreased costs of medical care, in addition to indirect costs of lowered productivity and absenteeism.An's cost-benefit study, published in the journal Pediatric Obesity, projects that expanding the program to all elementary and secondary school students in the United States would cost about $18 per student but yield a benefit of about $174 per student -- or a total of $13 billion.In adults, being overweight is associated with increased annual medical costs of $350, which increases to $1,500 annually if a person is obese, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has noted.And in a prior study involving adults, An found that additional water intake had some effect on health."The nutrition profile doesn't change much when people increase their plain-water intake, but we do see a significant drop in their saturated fat and sugar intake," An said in a press release."While there might potentially be some problems if children consume less whole milk, I would say those are probably minor in comparison with the costs associated with the skyrocketing rates of childhood overweight and obesity in the U.S."
Sleep deprivation can lead to mental lapses, study says:::::Nov. 6 (UPI) -- Not getting enough sleep?Sleep deprivation disrupts brain cells that can lead to temporary mental lapses that affect memory and visual perception, including causing vehicle accidents, according to a study led by UCLA's Dr. Itzhak Fried."You have to remember not only you are sleep deprived but the brain is sleep deprived," said Fried, the study's senior author, a professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and Tel Aviv University, in a video released by UCLA Health.The research, published Monday in Nature Medicine, is the first to reveal how sleep deprivation disrupts brain cells."We discovered that starving the body of sleep also robs neurons of the ability to function properly," Fried said."This leads to cognitive lapses in how we perceive and react to the world around us."Fried said not getting enough sleep can be as dangerous as drinking too much."Severe fatigue exerts a similar influence on the brain to drinking too much," Fried said."Yet no legal or medical standards exist for identifying overtired drivers on the road the same way we target drunk drivers."In previous studies, he noted sleep deprivation was linked to a heightened risk for depression, obesity, diabetes, heart attacks and stroke.In the new study, an international team of scientists studied 12 people preparing to undergo surgery at UCLA for epilepsy, which can be provoked because of lack of sleep.Electrodes were implanted in their brains to find the origin of their seizures before surgery.Each participant was asked to categorize images as quickly as possible.The electrodes recorded the firing of roughly 1,500 brain cells from all the patients.The scientists focused on neurons in the temporal lobe, which regulates visual perception and memory.As the patients grew sleepier, it became more difficult to perform the task.Brain cells also slowed down."We were fascinated to observe how sleep deprivation dampened brain cell activity," said lead author Yuval Nir of Tel Aviv University."Unlike the usual rapid reaction, the neurons responded slowly and fired more weakly, and their transmissions dragged on longer than usual."This situation can occur when a sleep-deprived driver notices a pedestrian stepping in front of his car."The very act of seeing the pedestrian slows down in the driver's overtired brain," Fried said."It takes longer for his brain to register what he's perceiving."In the study, researchers noticed portions of the brain operated differently."This phenomenon suggests that select regions of the patients' brains were dozing, causing mental lapses, while the rest of the brain was awake and running as usual."The research staff plans to explore the benefits of sleep and why the brain misfunctions because of the lack of sleep.
Blood plasma transfusions show promise as treatment for Alzheimer's:::::Nov. 6 (UPI) -- Blood plasma transfusions achieved promising results as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease in a small clinical trial.Patients in the trial experienced no serious side effects, and some showed signs of improvement.Scientists at Stanford University set out to test the efficacy of blood transfusions on a small number of patients with Alzheimer's disease.Researchers wanted to find out if the results of an earlier Stanford study -- which showed blood from young mice helped older mice rejuvenate brain tissue -- could be replicated in humans.Blood transfusions are commonly used to treat a variety of ailments, so researchers expected the treatment would prove safe for humans.Scientists were more surprised by the early signs of efficacy.The trial included 18 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.The first nine participants were given either plasma from the blood of healthy young adults or a saline placebo infusion every four weeks for three months.After three months, those receiving the placebo were given plasma, and those receiving plasma were given the placebo.The participants were unaware of whether they received a plasma or placebo infusion.The second nine participants were all given plasma infusions and told so.Before, during and after the trial, patients were surveyed about their mood and given cognitive assessments.Researchers also tested each participant's functional ability -- their ability to perform day-to-day tasks, like remembering to take their medicine or fixing themselves a meal.Scientists found patients showed no discernible improvements in their ability to memorize lists or recall past events.Alzheimer's studies usually require at least a year of observations to identify improvements in cognitive ability.The latest clinical trial did, however, reveal slight improvements in patients' functional abilities."That was surprising, to me," Dr. Sharon Sha, a clinical associate professor of neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford, said in a news release."The trial wasn't powered to show efficacy."Scientists presented their work at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease conference held in Boston last week.The study authors suggest additional larger, longer studies are needed to confirm and expand on their results."Our enthusiasm concerning these findings needs to be tempered by the fact that this was a small trial," Sha said."But these results certainly warrant further study."
New colon cancer breakthrough may lead to prevention:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- Researchers at the University of Warwick have found that a natural body process can cause inflammation, increasing the risk of colon cancer and Crohn's disease.The study, published today in Nature Communications, demonstrated a new link between inflammation and a natural cellular process known as autophagy, an essential process where cells break down and recycle damaged elements to keep the body healthy.Researchers have discovered that autophagy can lead to inflammation, which increases a person's risk of developing certain diseases of the gut, including colon cancer, Crohn's disease and other gut-related diseases.The team identified a protein which is regulated by autophagy called Kenny, which contains amino acids that causes it to be broken down by autophagy.The study was conducted on fruit flies by turning Kenny fluorescent to view it.Researchers were then able to observe that the protein was present in the cell where autophagy occurred.Researchers identified fruits and vegetables such as pomegranates, red grapes, pears, mushrooms, lentils, soybeans and green peas that contain natural compounds that can activate autophagy to prevent inflammation and disease of the gut."Understanding the molecular mechanisms of selective autophagy and inflammation will help to use interventions to activate the autophagic pathway to prevent inflammation and promote healthy well-being during the life course," Dr. Ioannis Nezis, of the University of Warwick, said in a press release.
Livestock-associated MRSA found in human MRSA samples:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- A recent survey by researchers identified livestock-associated meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or LA-MRSA, in human MRSA samples.LA-MRSA is a risk for people working in close contact with livestock but not typically the general population, say researchers at the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.The death of four people in 2014 from LA-MRSA CC398 in Denmark attracted media and scientist attention regarding the risk of LA-MRSA in pigs and humans.Researchers worked to reduce the risks by identifying transmission chains to halt transmission from animals to humans.Research showed that wearing face masks when working in pig stables can lower the risk of LA-MRSA transmission by 37 percent.The ECDC received responses from 28 labs located in 27 or the 30 EU/EEA countries as part of a survey initiated in 2014.The labs reported receiving MRSA isolates from 14,291 patients the previous year, 13,756 were typed, and LA-MRSA was identified in 89 percent of the countries with MRSA typing data.Of these, 3.9 percent -- 535 of the samples -- were identified as LA-MRSA.The study, published today in Eurosurveillance, demonstrated the increasing detection and geographical dispersion of LA-MRSA in humans in the EU/EEA since 2007 with reports from 2014 and 2015 from Nordic countries showing an increasing trend of LA-MRSA across Europe."The high response rate for this survey is indicative of the perceived public health importance of LA-MRSA in EU/EEA countries," researchers wrote in the study."This survey documents the increasing detection and geographical dispersion of LA-MRSA in humans in the EU/EEA since 2007, and highlights the public health and veterinary importance of LA-MRSA as a One Health issue.In the light of the increasing spread of LA-MRSA in Europe shown herein, we advocate that EU/EEA countries consider periodically repeating this survey to monitor changes."
Study shows benefits, negatives of a universal flu vaccine:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- University of Rochester Medical Center researchers are working to develop a universal influenza vaccine that would protect against all strains of the flu.The World Health Organization estimates that the flu impacts nearly 1 billion people worldwide, with 3 to 5 million cases resulting in severe infections and 300,000 to 500,000 deaths each year.The research, published Monday in Scientific Reports, aims to target the whole hemagglutinin protein, covering the outside of the flu virus.Current flu vaccines target the head of the hemagglutinin protein, which constantly changes to evade immune defenses.The hemagglutinin protein consists of a head and a stalk, similar to a flower, and the while the head changes, the stalk is relatively constant from one flu strain to another.So researchers believed the stalk was a good target to create an influenza virus with broader protection.However, researchers at URMC New York Influenza Center of Excellence found that the stalk is also capable of alterations.Researchers used supercomputers to analyze the genetic sequences of human H1N1 flu viruses and found variations in the head and stalk."The good news is that it's much more difficult to drive mutations in the stalk, but it's not impossible," Dr. David Topham, professor in the department of Microbiology and Immunology at URMC, said in a press release.Researchers paired H1N1 with human antibodies and found that repetitive exposure to the antibodies caused several mutations in the head, but very few changes in the stalk, showing that the stalk can change in response to influences from the immune system."A universal flu vaccine based on the stalk would be more broadly protective than the ones we use now, but this information should be taken into account as we move forward with research and development," Topham said.
Molecular method shows neuronal basis of brain states:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- Researchers from the National Institutes of Health have revealed brain circuitry that is vital for alertness and vigilance, and brain states conserved through evolution.NIH, NIMH and Stanford University researchers used a neural activity screening technology called Multiplexed-alignment of Molecular and Activity Phenotypes, or Multi-MAP, to see which neurons are activated in an animal during a particular brain state and molecularly analyzed specific neurons to identify the circuits and subtypes involved.Researchers found similar cell types and brain circuits in zebra fish and mice, whose evolutionary ancestors split hundreds of millions of years ago.In studies on zebra fish, the researchers used the Multi-MAP technique to screen the activity of neurons through the transparent heads of genetically-engineered larval and determined vigilance by measuring how long it took the fish to move their tails in response to threatening stimuli.The study, published today in Cell, identified six suspect circuits made up of distinct populations of neurons that modulate neuronal activity.Just one of those was previously linked to vigilance.Similar results were found in mice experiments.The team then used optogenetics, a technique to use light to control neurons, to identify three brain circuits that boost alertness in mice."Vigilance gone awry marks states such as mania and those seen in post-traumatic stress disorder and depression," Dr. Joshua Gordon, director of the NIH's National Institute of Mental Health, said in a press release."Gaining familiarity with the molecular players in a behavior -- as this new tool promises -- may someday lead to clinical interventions targeting dysfunctional brain states."
Biomarkers may aid discovery of lung problems in 9/11 firefighters, study says:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- Researchers say they have identified blood biomarkers that can be used as an early warning system for accelerated loss of lung function in firefighters who responded to the terrorist attack in New York City in 2001.After the Sept. 11, 2001, attack in New York City, fire department personnel were exposed to caustic dust after the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings.Some of the first responders experienced lung damage and excessive loss of lung function, though for many their condition stabilized within a year.Some, however, have continued to lose lung function at an accelerated rate.The new study, published today in the Annals of the American Thoracic Society, aimed to find why some first responders recovered while others went on to continue losing lung function."We have previously observed some of our patients were doing worse than others and performed this study because we wanted to understand factors that increased the risk for excessive lung function loss," Dr. Michael D. Weiden, associate professor of medicine and environmental medicine at New York University and a New York City Fire Department medical officer, said in a news release."These findings could motivate future research to find other treatments for this group with ongoing lung injury."Researchers examined whether the differences came from blood concentrations of eosinophils and neutrophils, types of immune cells that have been implicated in many respiratory diseases.The study showed that 12.7 percent of the 9,434 firefighters in the study had accelerated loss of forced expiratory volume -- FEV1 is the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled in one second -- while 8.3 percent showed improvement in FEV1.Firefighters with accelerated FEV1 decline were more than four times as likely to have airflow obstruction compared to individuals with expected FEV1 decline.In 4,303 firefighters who had blood counts measured before 9/11, a link between elevated eosinophil and neutrophil levels before and after the attack was found as the higher levels before 9/11 were linked to accelerated FEV1 decline afterward."After 9/11, about one in eight firefighters who worked at the World Trade Center had accelerated loss of lung function over the next 15 years," Weiden said."Even in those who had never smoked we found that accelerated loss of lung function increased their risk of airway obstruction and COPD."
Risks ahead for U.S. tax push as disputes linger, Trump returns:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Republicans pushed ahead on Monday on a U.S. tax code overhaul as a Senate panel considered the issue, but risks lay ahead with major intraparty disputes unsettled and President Donald Trump returning soon from Asia as the debate heats up.The Internal Revenue Code books are delivered to a Senate Finance Committee markup on the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" on Capitol Hill this month.REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque While overseas at a leaders conference, Trump tweeted some tax bill suggestions early on Monday that were starkly different from the two Republican plans being considered in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.He called on lawmakers to add a highly risky provision to their tax effort: repealing the individual mandate included in the 2010 Obamacare health insurance law that requires Americans to have health coverage or pay a tax to Washington.Neither of the two Republican plans includes such a politically divisive measure.Efforts by Republicans to dismantle Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, collapsed dramatically months ago.Trump has pushed hard for adding the mandate repeal to the tax-cut package.He tweeted the same suggestion on Nov. 3 just before he departed for his multi-nation Asian tour.In his latest tweet, he also urged slashing the top tax rate for high earners to 35 percent from 39.6 percent, despite criticism from Democrats that the Republican tax bills are deficit-expanding giveaways to the rich and corporations.The House retains the existing top tax rate in its bill, while the Senate proposes cutting it slightly to 38.5 percent.Trump is set to return to Washington on Tuesday.A White House aide confirmed that the president would speak to House Republicans on Thursday ahead of their expected tax bill vote.I am proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.}Were getting close!Trump wrote in his Monday Twitter post.Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further?Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?he added.CLOCK IS TICKING Since taking office in January, Trump has not scored a major legislative accomplishment, while frequently shifting positions and confusing lawmakers on Capitol Hill on various issues.Many Republicans view a win on overhauling the tax code as crucial to avoiding having to go to the voters in 2018s congressional elections with no achievements to show for a year in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress.The clock is ticking for them.The House is expected to vote soon, perhaps on Thursday, on a tax bill approved last week at the committee level.House tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he was confident Republicans had the votes for passage.Brady told reporters in a Capitol hallway that including a repeal of the Obamacare individual healthcare mandate in the tax bill remains under consideration.The Senate tax committee will debate its tax plan all week before heading home for the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday.When both chambers return near the end of November, they will have only 12 legislative days before the end of 2017.In that time span, Republicans hope to iron out differences between the two tax plans over the deduction for state and local taxes, the timing of a corporate tax rate cut and the future of the estate tax on inheritances.Each of the Republican tax plans would add about $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, another issue causing dissension among Republicans.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said he hoped to have a tax bill ready in the week after Thanksgiving.Between now and then, an army of lobbyists will be pressuring lawmakers to protect favored special-interest tax breaks.On Dec. 8, a three-month extension of the spending authority for the federal government expires, requiring congressional action that could divert lawmakers from the tax overhaul.A lengthy amendment introduced on Monday to the Senate tax plan by Republican Orrin Hatch, chairman of the tax panel, would remove a provision that lets working Americans over 50 make tax-free catch-up contributions to their retirement plans.Democrats have kept up steady criticism of the Republican tax bills and how they were drafted.Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate measure was developed in secret by a small group that held no public hearings and ignored Democrats.And the reason for such reckless haste is all too obvious: the product is a wretched one ... it is focused on the wealthy to the exclusion of the middle class, he said in a statement.
U.S. top court to hear fight over California pregnancy center law:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide whether a California law requiring private facilities that counsel pregnant women against abortion to post signs telling clients how to get state-funded abortions and contraceptives violates free speech rights.FILE PHOTO: A general view of the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, U.S., November 15, 2016.REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo The justices will hear an appeal brought by Christian-based non-profit facilities sometimes called crisis pregnancy centers of a lower court ruling that upheld the Democratic-backed 2015 California law.The anti-abortion challengers argue that the law, by forcing them to post the information, violates their free speech rights under the U.S. Constitutions First Amendment.The state should protect freedom of speech and freedom from coerced speech, said Kevin Theriot, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom conservative Christian legal group representing the laws challengers.Information about abortion is just about everywhere, so the government doesnt need to punish pro-life centers for declining to advertise for the very act they cant promote, he added.California argued that the Reproductive FACT Act, passed by a Democratic-led legislature and signed by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, is justified by its responsibility to regulate the healthcare industry and is needed to ensure that women know the state has programs providing abortions and birth control.Democratic California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is defending the law, said the law is intended to ensure women are fully informed about the nature of different facilities.PERSONAL DECISIONS Information is power, and all women should have access to the information they need when making personal healthcare decisions, Becerra said.The crisis pregnancy centers counsel women not to have abortions.These facilities, according to critics, often are located near hospitals and abortion clinics, offer ultrasounds and are staffed by people wearing medical garb.Some are medically licensed facilities, others are not.The law requires licensed healthcare facilities to post a notice saying that the state has programs for immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services ... prenatal care, and abortion for eligible women.For non-licensed medical facilities, an additional notice is required stating that the center has no licensed medical provider who provides or directly supervises the provision of services.The San Francisco-based 9th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld the law.In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up a challenge to a similar law in New York City.The California challengers included the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, an umbrella group for pregnancy crisis centers that said its members include 73 facilities in the state that are medically licensed and 38 that are not.The other plaintiffs are two centers in San Diego County.The court did not act on three other cases brought by other centers making similar claims.The Supreme Court found that women have a constitutional right to an abortion in the landmark 1973 case Roe v. Wade.The court most recently backed abortion rights in 2016 when it struck down a Texas law that imposed strict regulations on clinics that provided abortions.If the court strikes down Californias law on free speech grounds, it could make it harder for Democratic-leaning states to regulate anti-abortion pregnancy centers.But it also could threaten laws passed in Republican-leaning states that impose certain requirements on abortion clinics.In 2015, the justices left in place a lower court ruling that struck down North Carolinas law requiring physicians to perform an ultrasound, display the sonogram and describe the fetus to women seeking an abortion.The court has taken a series of cases involving free speech arguments to which its conservative majority is often receptive.The court on Monday also agreed to hear a conservative groups free speech challenge to a Minnesota law prohibiting voters from wearing apparel adorned with overtly political messages inside polling stations.Another is a case involving a conservative Christian bakers refusal to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, also brought by the Alliance Defending Freedom.The court could also resolve a challenge to Republican-drawn electoral districts in Wisconsin on free speech lines.
Trump taps ex-pharma executive Azar as U.S. health secretary:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday said he is nominating former pharmaceutical executive and industry lobbyist Alex Azar to serve as U.S. Health and Human Services secretary, saying Azar would push to lower the price of medicines.Alex Azar in an undated photo.REUTERS/HHS Republicans as well as the lead lobby groups for drugmakers and health insurers welcomed Azar as an experienced hand who could help overhaul the worlds most costly healthcare system.But several Democratic lawmakers questioned whether he would tackle changes that cut into pharmaceutical profits.If confirmed, Azar also would take the lead in implementing Trumps campaign promise to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obamas 2010 healthcare overhaul that extended health insurance to 20 million Americans.Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings said Trumps pick of a former pharmaceutical executive was like a fox guarding the hen house.Trump, who is in the Philippines on a diplomatic trip, announced the nomination on Twitter by saying Azar would be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices.Trumps first health secretary, former U.S. Representative Tom Price, resigned in September amid a public furor over his use of expensive taxpayer-funded private charter jets for government travel.Azar worked at Eli Lilly (LLY.N) and Co for a decade, including five years as president of its Lilly USA unit, and left the company in January, according to his LinkedIn page.Cummings and Senator Bernie Sanders, a 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, last year called for a federal probe into whether Eli Lilly, Sanofi SA (SASY.PA), Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOb.CO) colluded to set prices on insulin and other diabetes drugs.This is a slap in the face to millions of Americans who are waiting on (the President) to take action to lower drug prices, Cummings wrote on Twitter.He also pointed to Eli Lilly raising drug prices by double digits while Azar was an executive at the company.Azar, though a spokesman, declined to comment.Other Democrats were more cautious in their response to Trumps announcement, with Senator Chuck Schumer calling for the health agency to turn over a new leaf with Azar.Democratic Senator Patty Murray, who has been working on bipartisan healthcare legislation, tweeted, Given Alex Azars professional background, there are concerns on whether he can fairly execute any significant effort to lower drug prices for patients & families.Republicans were supportive with Senate health committee head Lamar Alexander of Tennessee describing Azar as a qualified, experienced nominee.Azar also drew praise from PhRMA, the largest pharmaceutical industry trade group and Americas Health Insurance Plans, the key lobbyist for the insurer industry.Azar served several years on the board of directors of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a drug industry lobbying group, and earlier was general counsel and deputy secretary for Health and Human Services under former Republican President George W. Bush.Patient advocacy organization Public Citizen said Azar has made it clear he is opposed to measures to restrain prescription companies profiteering and limit improper marketing and that he favors weaker safety approval standards.As head of HHS, Azar would have oversight responsibility for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the drug industry including approving new treatments.Azars nomination must be approved by the U.S. Senate, which is controlled by Trumps fellow Republicans.
New blood pressure range means half of Americans have hypertension:::::(Reuters) - Tighter blood pressure guidelines from U.S. heart organizations mean millions more people need to make lifestyle changes, or start taking medication, in order to avoid cardiovascular problems.FILE PHOTO: A photo illustration shows a stethoscope and blood-pressure machine of a French general practitioner displayed in a doctor's office in Bordeaux January 7, 2015.REUTERS/Regis Duvignau Americans with blood pressure of 130/80 or higher should be treated, down from the previous trigger of 140/90, according to new guidelines announced on Monday by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology.At the new cutoff, around 46 percent, or more than 103 million, of American adults are considered to have high blood pressure, compared with an estimated 72 million under the previous guidelines in place since 2003.High blood pressure accounts for the second-largest number of preventable heart disease and stroke deaths in the United States, second only to smoking.The guidelines do not change the definition of normal blood pressure as 120/80 or lower.Potentially deadly high blood pressure can be brought under control with a wide array of medications, many sold as relatively inexpensive generics.The drug classes include angiotensin receptor blockers, such as Novartis AGs Diovan, calcium channel blockers, like Pfizer Incss Norvasc, ACE inhibitors, including Pfizers Altace, and diuretics, such as Merck & Co Incs Hyzaar.But the drugs have side effects and the new guidelines emphasize lifestyle changes including weight loss, diet and exercise as the first tool for combating hypertension.I think this will encourage both patients to adhere to recommendations but also clinicians to be more vigorous in their attempts to prescribe lifestyle changes, said Dr. Pamela Morris, chair of the ACCs committee on prevention of cardiovascular disease.Lifestyle modifications are the cornerstone for treatment, but the guidelines also stress that patients assessed to be at high risk of cardiovascular problems will be started on medication.A large, government-sponsored study of hypertension patients aged 50 and older showed in 2015 that death from heart-related causes fell 43 percent and heart failure rates dropped 38 percent when their systolic blood pressure was lowered below 120 versus those taken to a target of under 140.But patients in the 120 systolic blood pressure group had a higher rate of kidney injury or failure, as well as fainting.Concerns about those side effects, as well as the fact that the close monitoring seen in a clinical trial is hard to replicate, led the AHA, ACC and other groups to select the 130 systolic blood pressure target.The new guidelines also emphasize the importance of accurate blood pressure measurements, using an average of different readings at different times.Adults with blood pressure of 130/80 already have double the risk of heart attack compared to someone in the normal range, said Dr. Paul Whelton, professor at Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine and School of Medicine in New Orleans and lead author of the new guidelines.It doesnt mean you need medication, but its a yellow light that you need to be lowering your blood pressure, mainly with non-drug approaches.
Cost of diabetes epidemic reaches $850 billion a year:::::(Reuters) - The number of people living with diabetes has tripled since 2000, pushing the global cost of the disease to $850 billion a year, medical experts said on Tuesday.The vast majority of those affected have type 2 diabetes, which is linked to obesity and lack of exercise, and the epidemic is spreading particularly fast in poorer countries as people adopt Western diets and urban lifestyles.The latest estimates from the International Diabetes Federation mean that one in 11 adults worldwide have the condition, which occurs when the amount of sugar in the blood is too high.The total number of diabetics is now 451 million and is expected to reach 693 million by 2045 if current trends continue.The high price of dealing with the disease reflects not only the cost of medicines but also the management of a range of complications, such as limb amputations and eye problems.
Chipotle denies link to 'Supergirl' actor's illness:::::(Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc on Monday denied allegations by actor Jeremy Jordan that eating at one of its restaurants landed him in the hospital.Cast member Jeremy Jordan attends the premiere of "The Last Five Years" in Los Angeles February 11, 2015.REUTERS/Phil McCarten Jordan, who plays Winn Schott on TV show Supergirl, posted an Instagram video on Thursday of himself on a hospital bed, saying that food he ate at a Chipotle made him severely sick and that he almost died, according to a People.com report.There have been no other reported claims of illness at the restaurant where (Jordan) dined.We take all claims seriously, but we cant confirm any link to Chipotle, given the details he shared with us, Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold said via email.Chipotle is still recovering from a string of food safety lapses that started in late 2015, including a recent norovirus outbreak at a Virginia restaurant.Jordan, through a spokesman, declined further comment.The Denver-based burrito chains stock has fallen about 60 percent since an E. coli outbreak in 2015.Shares of Chipotle fell as much as 6 percent to a near five-year low of $263.11 on Monday morning, but recouped most losses by afternoon.The stock closed down 0.7 percent.
Novartis launches heart drug counter-offensive:::::ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis plans to plow through doubts over its canakinumab drug by asking regulators this year to approve the medicine as a treatment for a group of heart attack survivors that the Swiss drugmaker says is most likely to benefit.Swiss drugmaker Novartis' logo is seen at the company's plant in the northern Swiss town of Stein, Switzerland October 23, 2017.REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann New analysis of Phase III data shows canakinumab cut risk of another adverse cardiac event by 25 percent in patients whose inflammatory markers fell significantly three months after starting treatment, Novartis said on Monday, adding the group represented 55 percent of those in the so-called Cantos trial.That tops the overall 15 percent risk reduction reported in August for all patients in the six-year trial that included more than 10,000 heart attack survivors.Novartiss trial has been lauded as revolutionary for helping prove fighting inflammation - not merely lowering cholesterol - helps heart attack victims avoid future adverse events or death.Still, some cardiovascular experts have so far concluded canakinumabs benefits are insufficient to justify expanding its existing approvals for rare inflammatory diseases to routine use in cardiac patients.On Monday, Novartis went on the counter-attack at an American Heart Association meeting in California, contending its new analysis underpinned canakinumabs value as a targeted therapy.We are absolutely of the mind that we want this be a targeted medicine, Vasant Narasimhan, Novartiss drug development chief who takes over as CEO in February, said on a conference call.If ... we would not have the opportunity to target this medicine, we would ultimately reconsider whether we would bring this medicine to market.The potential market is immense, with a quarter of the 1.3 million people who suffer heart attacks in the United States and Europe annually likely to have another cardiovascular event within five years.Still, one challenge Novartis faces with canakinumab, also known as Ilaris, is it now costs some $200,000 annually for treating rare inflammatory diseases.Cardiology drugs command a fraction of that.Consequently, Novartis must ensure sufficient eligible heart patients to make a price cut worthwhile, while also establishing a robust benefit profile necessary to convince insurers to pay what will still be a hefty tab.Doubts have plagued new cardiovascular drugs, with ongoing debate over whether new PCSK9 cholesterol-lowering injections are worth their roughly $15,000-per-year price tags.Novartis is keenly aware of heart-drug hurdles, too, after sluggish uptake of its $4,500-per-year Entresto, despite trial results in heart failure that were lauded as stellar.While Basel-based Novartis has highlighted canakinumabs cancer-fighting properties in tumors that thrive on inflammation, Narasimhan acknowledged those preliminary findings would play a limited role with regulators until more studies are completed.We believe well be able to reflect the cancer findings to some extent in the safety sections of the labels for canakinumab, but it wouldnt be in the efficacy section, he said.
New tool could let patients contribute to doctors' notes:::::(Reuters Health) - In theory, patients might be more engaged with their care and better able to inform doctors about any health issues if they could directly contribute to their own electronic medical records, a small U.S. study suggests.For the study, researchers interviewed 29 physicians, nurses, patient advocates and computer experts about the potential benefits and pitfalls of letting patients directly contribute to doctors notes.The interviews focused on OurNotes, a platform that lets patients co-produce medical notes with clinicians.Overall, people expressed mixed feelings.These contributions could improve care, make checkups more efficient and save physicians time, participants said.But its also possible that reviewing what patients add to the notes could encroach on doctors already scarce time without making care any better.Broadly speaking, OurNotes is an open acknowledgement that healthcare (particularly chronic disease healthcare) is continuous, requiring full-time engagement and not completely determined by 15-minute visits 2 to 4 times per year, said lead study author Dr. John Mafi, a primary care physician at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.OurNotes has the potential to improve care directly by allowing patients and families to set their agenda ahead of time and update their past history, potentially saving time during the actual encounter and allowing for a more accurate medical history, Mafi said by email.If not executed thoughtfully, it may unintentionally add workflow to busy clinicians who have to review lengthy non-relevant patient data, and adding to busy clinicians workflow is a nonstarter, Mafi added.Overall, participants were most supportive of the idea of asking patients to review records and contribute new information before upcoming appointments, researchers report online November 13 in Annals of Internal Medicine.Keeping these contributions structured and limited in length would help empower patients to provide critical information without creating a huge burden on providers to sift through an overly detailed account of unessential information, the interviews found.Many participants, however, thought it might not be realistic to get patients to do this work on their own time, outside the context of an office visit.Some patients might be intimidated by the technology or the nature of the questions, or both.And some patients simply might not want to contribute to their records, preferring to discuss their health with clinicians in person.Patient contributions would also only be helpful if reading and responding to this information didnt interrupt clinicians workflow or create extra work.Beyond its small size, another limitation of the study is its non-random selection of participants and its lack of direct patient participation, the authors note.Still, researchers are continuing to test OurNotes in several settings; for example, to get input from patients before primary care checkups.One upside could be making patients feel like doctors value their perspective, which isnt always the case now, said Dr. Monika Safford, author of an accompanying editorial and chief of general internal medicine at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City.A lot of patients dont understand a word the doctor says and are too afraid to challenge them with questions, Safford said by email.This is especially true for the elderly and minorities.Currently, patients dont always prepare questions or complete paperwork before appointments even when doctors ask for this, and physicians may also fail to read any information patients do provide, Safford added.So everyone is not on the same page, so to speak, at the current time, Safford said.Allowing patients to enter their (recent) history and concerns would standardize this process and could possibly increase the number of patients who feel truly engaged in their care.SOURCES: bit.ly/2AE5HKW and bit.ly/2zUuTjJ Ann Intern Med 2017
Poor children benefit when parents have access to healthcare:::::(Reuters Health) - Low-income children in the U.S. whose parents qualified for Medicaid were more likely to receive preventive care, regardless of their own insurance coverage, a new study finds.Researchers called the finding an important spillover effect.Children whose mothers and fathers were enrolled in Medicaid, government insurance for the poor, were 29 percent more likely to receive at least one well-child visit, a just-released Pediatrics report showed.Well-child healthcare visits increase childrens likelihood of being vaccinated and reduce their likelihood of being unnecessarily hospitalized, previous studies have shown.Efforts to expand Medicaid eligibility for low-income parents could promote their childrens receipt of these important services, said lead author Dr. Maya Venkataramani, a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland.Any discussions about restricting Medicaid eligibility for adults should also take into account the potential for impacts on the healthcare use of low-income children, Venkataramani, a pediatrician and internist, said in a phone interview.The Affordable Care Act enlarged the pool of Americans eligible for Medicaid in some states.But many Republican lawmakers have pushed to roll back the Medicaid expansions.Medicaid typically has different eligibility criteria for children and adults, Dr. Matthew M. Davis, pediatrics professor at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago, writes in an accompanying editorial.He estimates that 11 million parents who have no health insurance live in households with children who do have coverage.On the basis of decades of evidence of the benefits of parental coverage for children, he writes, it is time for public programs to offer coverage to parents of children on Medicaid at the same income eligibility thresholds that are applied to their children.If there is bipartisan sentiment that children deserve coverage that safeguards their health and wellbeing, then covering their parents can be an evidence-based way to maximize the value of that coverage, he says.Venkataramani and her team analyzed more than 50,000 pairs of low-income parents and children between 2001 and 2013.Parental Medicaid enrollment affects whether children from 2 to 17 years old got well-child visits regardless of the childrens insurance coverage, they found.The finding surprised Laura Wherry, professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved with the study.When the authors control for a childs health insurance status, their estimates still reveal a significant relationship between parental Medicaid eligibility and the receipt of well-child visits, she said by email.This suggests that there must be other explanations for why parental Medicaid coverage leads to an increased use of preventive care by their kids.It would be great to better understand these other mechanisms, and Id be very interested to see a follow up study looking at this, she said.Despite the well-established benefits of well-child visits, American childrens receipt of this form of preventive care, particularly children in low-income households, has been persistently suboptimal, the authors of the new report write.One third of 3 to 6 year olds and more than half of 12 to 21 year olds covered by government insurance programs for low-income families failed to get an annual well-child visit in 2015, Venkataramani said.The new study demonstrates that the generosity of state Medicaid eligibility policies for parents can have important consequences for their kids, in addition to affecting the parents own health insurance status and well-being, Wherry said.SOURCES: bit.ly/2AFBoEa and bit.ly/2AGwIxS Pediatrics, online November 13, 2017.
Bill Gates makes $100 million personal investment to fight Alzheimer's:::::LONDON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is to invest $50 million in the Dementia Discovery Fund, a venture capital fund that brings together industry and government to seek treatments for the brain-wasting disease.FILE PHOTO: Microsoft founder Bill Gates looks on during a healthcare event in Brussels, Belgium, February 16, 2017.REUTERS/Eric Vidal/File Photo The investment - a personal one and not part of Gates philanthropic Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation - will be followed by another $50 million in start-up ventures working in Alzheimers research, Gates said.With rapidly rising numbers of people suffering from Alzheimers and other forms of dementia, the disease is taking a growing emotional and financial toll as people live longer, Gates told Reuters in an interview.Its a huge problem, a growing problem, and the scale of the tragedy - even for the people who stay alive - is very high, he said.Despite decades of scientific research, there is no treatment that can slow the progression of Alzheimers.Current drugs can do no more than ease some of the symptoms.Gates said, however, that with focused and well-funded innovation, hes optimistic treatments can be found, even if they might be more than a decade away.Itll take probably 10 years before new theories are tried enough times to give them a high chance of success.So its very hard to hazard a guess (when an effective drug might be developed).I hope that in the next 10 years that we have some powerful drugs, but its possible that wont be achieved.Dementia, of which Alzheimers is the most common form, affects close to 50 million people worldwide and is expected to affect more than 131 million by 2050, according to the non-profit campaign group Alzheimers Disease International.FILE PHOTO: Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates talks with a colleague before the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S. May 6, 2017.REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo The DDF, which was launched in 2015 and involves drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Pfizer and Biogen Idec as well as the UK government, has already invested in at least nine start-up companies investigating potential ways to stop or reverse the biological processes that lead to dementia.Gates told Reuters the additional $50 million would be put into start-ups working on some less mainstream approaches to the disease, but said he had not yet identified these companies.The philanthropist, whose usual focus is on infectious diseases in poorer countries, said Alzheimers caught his interest partly for personal reasons, and partly because it has so far proved such a tough nut to crack.I know how awful it is to watch people you love struggle as the disease robs them of their mental capacity ...It feels a lot like youre experiencing a gradual death of the person that you knew, he said in a blog post about the dementia investments.Some of the men in my family have suffered from Alzheimers, but I wouldnt say thats the sole reason (for this investment), he added.Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimers Society charity, welcomed Gates significant personal investment, saying it would speed up progress toward a cure and help reduce stigma around dementia: With Bill Gates now joining all those already united against dementia, there is new hope for advances in the care and cure of dementia, he said in a statement.Through talking to experts in the field over the past year, Gates said he had identified five areas of need: Understanding better how Alzheimers unfolds, detecting and diagnosing it earlier, pursuing multiple approaches to trying to halt the disease, making it easier for people to take part in clinical trials of potential new medicines, and using data better.My background at Microsoft and my (Gates) Foundation background say to me that a data-driven contribution might be an area where I can help add some value, he said.Alongside the $50 million investment in DDF and the additional $50 million planned for start-ups, Gates said he would like to award a grant to build a global dementia data platform.This would make it easier for researchers to look for patterns and identify new pathways for treatment, he said.
Drinking age: oldest evidence of wine-making found near Tbilisi:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Oenophiles take note: 5980 BC was a very good year for wine.A base of a Neolithic jar is seen being prepared for sampling for residue analysis in this handout photo received November 13, 2017.Judyta Olszewski/Handout via REUTERS Scientists on Monday announced the discovery of the oldest-known evidence for wine-making, detecting telltale chemical signs of the fermented alcoholic beverage made from grapes in fragments of nearly 8,000-year-old earthenware jars at two sites about 30 miles (50 km) south of Georgias capital Tbilisi.The findings show that this important cultural achievement occurred earlier than previously known in the South Caucasus region on the border of Eastern Europe and Western Asia.Until now, the oldest wine-making evidence had come from pottery from the Zagros Mountains in northwestern Iran dating to 5400-5000 BC.Alcohol had an important role in societies in the past just as today, said University of Toronto archaeologist Stephen Batiuk, one of the researchers in the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Wine is central to civilization as we know it in the West, Batiuk added.As a medicine, social lubricant, mind-altering substance and highly valued commodity, wine became the focus of religious cults, pharmacopoeias, cuisines, economies and society in the ancient Near East.A Neolithic jar, possibly a Neolithic qvevri used for brewing wine from the site of Khramis Didi Gora south of Tbilisi on display at the Georgian National Museum is seen in this handout photo received November 13, 2017.Judyta Olszewski/Handout via REUTERS David Lordkipanidze, director of the Georgian National Museum who helped lead the research, said large jars called qvevri similar to the ancient ones are still used today for wine-making in Georgia.The researchers performed biochemical analyses to find residual wine compounds the pottery had absorbed.University of Pennsylvania biomolecular archaeologist Patrick McGovern found evidence of tartaric acid, an indication of brewing involving the Eurasian grape, as well as three associated organic acids: malic, succinic and citric.The pottery was found at two Neolithic villages, once home to perhaps 60 people each, consisting of small mudbrick houses.The villagers harvested wheat, raised sheep, goat and cattle, and used simple tools made of bone and volcanic glass called obsidian.The grayish jars, some decorated with simple images of grape clusters and a man dancing, were roughly 32 inches (80 cm) tall and 16 inches in (40 cm) wide.Evidence of wine was spotted in eight jars, the oldest from about 5980 BC.The wine was probably made similarly to the traditional qvevri method in Georgia today, where the grapes are crushed and the fruit, stems and seeds are all fermented together, Batiuk said.This is not the earliest sign of any alcoholic beverage.Evidence previously was found in China of a fermented alcoholic mix of rice, honey and fruit from about 7000 BC.
Eurek-baa: Scientists find sheep can recognize human faces:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Sheep have been trained to recognize the faces of celebrities, including former U.S. President Barack Obama, by University of Cambridge scientists who hope it may help with understanding neurodegenerative diseases.A picture taken from undated video shows a sheep approaching a photo of Emma Watson during a Cambridge University experiment, in Cambridge, Britain.Jenny Morton/University of Cambridge handout via REUTERS In a specially equipped pen, sheep were shown pictures of people on two computer screens, on one side would be an unknown person and on the other would be one of four celebrities.The animal would receive a reward of food for choosing the photograph of the celebrity by breaking an infrared beam near the screen displaying it.If they chose the wrong photograph, a buzzer would sound and they would receive no reward.The sheep eventually managed to identify the familiar face eight times out of every 10.A picture taken from undated video shows a sheep approaching a photo of Barack Obama during a Cambridge University experiment, in Cambridge, Britain.Jenny Morton/University of Cambridge handout via REUTERS The group of celebrities the sheep were trained to recognize included actors Emma Watson and Jake Gyllenhaal, BBC newsreader Fiona Bruce and Obama.Weve shown that sheep have advanced face-recognition abilities, comparable with those of humans and monkeys, Professor Jenny Morton, who led the study, said in a statement.In addition to being shown images of the celebrities facing forward, scientists also tested the animals ability to recognize the faces in photographs taken from other angles.The animals success rate fell by around 15 percent when presented with the faces at a new angle, an amount researchers said was comparable to that seen when humans perform the task.Scientists aim to use the sheep as models to understand disorders of the brain, such as Huntingtons disease, that develop over a long time and affect cognitive abilities.
Wounds sustained at night heal twice as slowly, scientists find:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Body clocks cause wounds such as cuts and burns sustained during the day to heal around 60 percent faster than those sustained at night, scientists have discovered in a finding that has implications for surgery and wound-healing medicines.In a study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine on Wednesday, the scientists showed for the first time how our internal body clocks regulate wound healing by skin cells, and optimize healing during the day.Burns that happened at night took an average of 60 percent longer to heal than burns that occurred during the day, the scientists found.Night-time burns - sustained between 8pm to 8am - were 95 percent healed after an average of 28 days, compared with only 17 days if the burn happened between 8am and 8pm.Body clocks known as circadian rhythms regulate almost every cell in the body, driving 24-hour cycles in many processes such as sleeping, hormone secretion and metabolism.The key to accelerated daytime wound healing, the scientists found, was that skin cells moved more rapidly to repair the wound and there was also more collagen the main structural protein in skin deposited around the wound site.This is the first time that the circadian clock within individual skin cells has been shown to determine how effectively they respond to injuries, said John ONeill, who co-led the research at Britains Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology.We consistently see about a two-fold difference in wound healing speed between the body clocks day and night.It may be that our bodies have evolved to heal fastest during the day when injuries are more likely to occur.Treatment of wounds costs health services worldwide billions of dollars a year - in Britains National Health Service alone, the costs are estimated around 5 billion pounds ($6.56 billion) a year.Experts say this is partly due to a lack of effective drugs to speed up wound closure.John Blaikley, a clinician scientist from Britains University of Manchester, said these new insights into the circadian factors important in skin repair should help the search for better wound-healing drugs.It could also help doctors improve outcomes by changing what time of day surgery is carried out, or when medicines are given, he said.
Exploring Egypt's Great Pyramid from the inside, virtually:::::PARIS (Reuters) - A team of scientists who last week announced the discovery of a large void inside the Great Pyramid of Giza have created a virtual-reality tour that allows users to teleport themselves inside the structure and explore its architecture.FILE PHOTO: Tourists visit the Pyramid of Khufu, the largest of the Great Pyramids of Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt on March 2, 2016.REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh/File Photo Using 3D technology, the Scan Pyramids Project allows visitors wearing headsets to take a guided tour inside the Grand Gallery, the Queens Chamber and other ancient rooms not normally accessible to the public, without leaving Paris.Thanks to this technique, we make it possible to teleport ourselves to Egypt, inside the pyramid, as a group and with a guide, said Mehdi Tayoubi, co-director of Scan Pyramids, which on Nov. 2 announced the discovery of a mysterious space inside the depths of the Pyramid.The void itself is visible on the tour, appearing like a dotted cloud.What is new in the world of virtual reality is that from now on you are not isolated but there are several of us, youre in a group, you can take a tour with your family.And you can access places which you usually cant in the real pyramid.While partly designed as a fun experience, the collaborative immersion project allows researchers to improve the technologies they used to detect the pyramid void and think about what purpose it may have served.The pyramid, built in around 2,500 BC and one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, was a monumental tomb soaring to a height of 479 feet (146 metres).Until the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889, the Great Pyramid stood as the tallest manmade structure for more than 4,000 years.While there are passage ways into it and chambers in various parts, much of the internal structure had remained a mystery until a team from Frances HIP Institute used an imaging method based on cosmic rays to gain a view inside.So-called muon particles, which originate from interactions with rays from space and atoms in Earths upper atmosphere, are able to penetrate hundreds of metres through stone before being absorbed.That allows for mapping inside stone structures.Muon tomography has really improved a lot due to its use on the pyramid and we think that muography will have other applications in other fields, said Tayoubi.But we also wanted to innovate and imagine devices to allow the wider public to understand what this pyramid is, understand it from within.When looking through their 3D goggles, visitors can see the enormous stones of the pyramid as if they were real, and walk virtually along its corridors, chambers and hidden spaces.As they approach the pyramid from the outside, the tour even includes audio of Cairos deafening and ever-present traffic.
Going ape: new orangutan species identified in Sumatra:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists have identified a new species of great ape on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, finding that a small population of orangutans inhabiting its Batang Toru forest merits recognition as the third species of these shaggy reddish tree dwellers.A photo of Pongo tapanuliensis, identified as a new species of orangutan is shown, found on the Indonesian island of Sumatra where a small population inhabit its Batag Toru forest, according to researchers November 2, 2017.Courtesy Andrew Walmsley/Handout via REUTERS Researchers said on Thursday these orangutans boast genetic, skeletal and tooth differences from the two other species of orangutan, meriting recognition as a unique third species.That would bring to seven the number of great ape species worldwide aside from people, alongside Africas eastern and western gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos.Scientists are worried about the future of the newly identified species, one of humankinds closest relatives.They have labeled the species the Tapanuli orangutan, with the scientific name Pongo tapanuliensis.There are no more than 800 individuals remaining across three fragmented forest areas, said conservation biologist Matthew Nowak of the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme.In addition to threats like hunting by humans, Nowak said, Significant areas of the Tapanuli orangutans range are seriously threatened by habitat conversion for small-scale agriculture, mining exploration and exploitation, a large-scale hydroelectric scheme, geothermal development and agricultural plantations.Orangutan means person of the forest in the Indonesian and Malay languages, and it is the worlds biggest arboreal mammal.Orangutans are adapted to living in trees, with their arms longer than their legs.They live more solitary lives than other great apes, sleeping and eating fruit in the forest canopy and swinging from branch to branch.Its pretty exciting to be able to describe a new great ape species in this day and age, said University of Zurich evolutionary geneticist Michael Krtzen, adding that most great apes species are listed as endangered or critically endangered.We must do everything possible to protect the habitats in which these magnificent animals occur, not only because of them, but also because of all the other animal and plant species that we can protect at the same time.Orangutans long were considered a single species, but were recognized as having two species in 1996, one in Sumatra and one in Borneo.The new species lives south of what was the known range for Sumatran orangutans.This population was unknown to scientists until two decades ago.In addition to genetic differences from the other species, the researchers said the skeleton of a Tapanuli orangutan that died after being wounded by villagers showed differences in tooth and skull shape.The research was published in the journal Current Biology.
Cosmic-ray imaging finds hidden structure in Egypt's Great Pyramid:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists using an imaging method based on cosmic rays have detected a large and enigmatic internal structure in the last of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing, the massive Great Pyramid of Giza on the outskirts of Cairo.Researchers announced the discovery on Thursday but said they did not know the purpose, contents or precise dimensions of what they are calling a void or cavity inside the pyramid, built as a monumental tomb around 2560 BC.To peer inside the pyramid, the scientists used an imaging technique called muon tomography that tracks particles that bombard Earth at close to the speed of light and penetrate deeply into solid objects.They said the newly discovered internal structure was at least 100 feet (30 meters) long, and located above a hallway measuring about 155 feet long (47 meters) called the Grand Gallery, one of a series of passageways and chambers inside the immense pyramid.The researchers said it constitutes the first major inner structure found in the Great Pyramid since the 19th century.What we are sure about is that this big void is there, that it is impressive, that it was not expected by, as far as I know, any kind of theory, said Mehdi Tayoubi, president and co-founder of the HIP Institute in France, one of the leaders of the study published in the journal Nature.FILE PHOTO: A group of camels and horses stand idle in front of the Great Pyramids awaiting tourists in Giza, Egypt on March 29, 2017.REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany/File Photo We open the question to Egyptologists and archaeologists: what could it be?added Hany Helal of Cairo University.The Great Pyramid, looming alongside other large pyramids, is a towering achievement, remarkable for its simple beauty and colossal grandeur.The emblem of one of the great civilizations of antiquity, it soars to a height of 479 feet (146 meters), the tallest structure built by humankind until the Eiffel Tower in Paris in 1889, and boasts a base measuring 754 feet (230 meters).FILE PHOTO: Tourists visit the Pyramid of Khufu, the largest of the Great Pyramids of Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt on March 2, 2016.REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh/File Photo It was constructed during the reign of the Pharaoh Khufu, or Cheops.The findings come from a project called Scan Pyramids that relies on non-invasive scanning methods to probe the internal structure of the pyramids of ancient Egypts glorious Old Kingdom period and understand how they were built.We are not doing this mission in order to find hidden cavities, Helal said.Muon particles originate from interactions between cosmic rays from space and atoms of Earths upper atmosphere.The particles can penetrate hundreds of yards (meters) into stone before being absorbed.Placing detectors inside a pyramid can discern cavities within a solid structure.
Fossil footprints reveal existence of big early dinosaur predator:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A trail of fossilized three-toed footprints that measure nearly two feet (57 cm) long shows that a huge meat-eating dinosaur stalked southern Africa 200 million years ago at a time when most carnivorous dinosaurs were modest-sized beasts.Fabien Knoll, Honorary Senior Research Fellow at the University of Manchester, lies next to the exceptionally large carnivorous dinosaur footprints found in Lesotho, Africa in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters October 26, 2017.Fabien Knoll/University of Manchester/Handout via REUTERS Scientists on Thursday described the footprints from an ancient river bank in Lesotho, and estimated that the dinosaur, which they named Kayentapus ambrokholohali, was about 30 feet (9 meters) long.No fossilized bones were found, but the footprints alone showed a lot about the animal.The scientists concluded it was a large theropod -- the two-legged carnivorous dinosaur group that included later giants like Tyrannosaurus and Giganotosaurus -- but that it was more lightly built than those brutes.The theropod group also gave rise to birds.Kayentapus lived early in the Jurassic Period, shortly after a mass extinction that doomed other large reptilian terrestrial predators that lived in the preceding Triassic Period, when dinosaurs first appeared.Our finding corroborates the hypothesis that theropods reached a great size relatively early in the course of their evolution, but apparently not before the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, said paleontologist Fabien Knoll, of the Dinopolis Foundation in Spain and the University of Manchester in Britain.There are no skeletal fossils of meat-eating dinosaurs this large so early in the dinosaur evolutionary history.It lived on the ancient southern hemisphere super-continent of Gondwana.There are other fossilized footprints from Poland that indicate a similar-sized theropod inhabited the northern super-continent of Laurasia around the same time.Theropods of similar size do not appear in the fossil record until 30 million years later, Knoll said.The footprints were found on what was once a river bank, bearing telltale ripple marks and desiccation cracks.It is the first evidence of an extremely large meat-eating animal roaming a landscape otherwise dominated by a variety of herbivorous, omnivorous and much-smaller carnivorous dinosaurs, added paleontologist Lara Sciscio of the University of Cape Town in South Africa.The research was published on Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE.In separate research, other scientists on Thursday described another new dinosaur, a plant-eater called Matheronodon provincialis, that lived 70 million years ago.Its fossils were unearthed in southern France.Matheronodon is distinctive for its large teeth with a chisel-like cutting edge that provided a powerful shearing action like scissors to eat tough vegetation, said paleontologist Pascal Godefroit of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels.That research was published in the journal Scientific Reports.
Mystery space object may be first confirmed interstellar visitor:::::LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A small asteroid or comet that has been spotted racing through our solar system may have come from elsewhere in the galaxy, U.S. space scientists say, possibly marking the first such interstellar visitor observed from Earth.The mystery object, so far known only as A/2017 U1, was discovered earlier this month by a researcher using a sophisticated telescope system at the University of Hawaii that continually scans the universe for such phenomenon.We have been waiting for this day for decades, said Paul Chodas, manager of the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations Center for Near Earth Object Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.Its long been theorized that such objects exist -- asteroids or comets moving around between the stars and occasionally passing through our solar system -- but this is the first such detection, Chodas said.The mass, a quarter mile (400 meters) in diameter, quickly stood out for scientists because of its extreme orbit, coming from the direction of the constellation Lyra, almost directly above the elliptical plane where the planets and other asteroids orbit the sun.It crossed under that plane just outside Mercurys orbit on Sept. 2 before being slung by the suns massive gravity into a sharp turn under our solar system.The closest the object came to Earth was about 15 million miles away on Oct. 14.It is going extremely fast and on such a trajectory that we can say with confidence that this object is on its way out of the solar system and not coming back, NASAs Davide Farnocchia said.Astronomers were urgently tracking A/2017 U1 with telescopes as it makes its journey through our solar system, hoping to use that data to confirm the objects interstellar origins and learn what they can about its composition.If the object is formally established as the first of its kind spotted from Earth, rules for naming it would have to be set out by the International Astronomical Union, NASA scientists said.
Raccoon-sized dinosaur with 'bandit mask' amazes scientists:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A raccoon-sized, feather-clad dinosaur that roamed China 130 million years ago shared a distinctive trait with the furry modern mammal that topples trash cans in North America: a stripe across their eyes resembling a bandit mask.This figure shows the best-preserved fossil specimen of Sinosauropteryx from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota of China and an interpretive drawing of the bones, stomach contents, and darkly pigmented feathers.The scale bar represents 50 mm.Photo courtesy of Jakob Vinther, intrepretive drawing by Fiann Smithwick/Handout via REUTERS Scientists said on Thursday an analysis of fossilized feathers on the dinosaur called Sinosauropteryx revealed a camouflage pattern that included the bandit mask, a light-colored underbelly, dark-colored back and a striped tail.Its color pattern also hinted at the environment Sinosauropteryx inhabited: an open savannah rather than a forest, the researchers believe.This was quite a surprising discovery, paleontologist Fiann Smithwick of the University of Bristol in Britain said of the bandit mask.That feature may have given Sinosauropteryx certain advantages.In birds, the evolutionary descendants of dinosaurs, a bandit mask pattern often obscures the eyes.Predators and prey look for eyes as a giveaway of an animals presence, Smithwick said.The color patterns we found are all known to be associated with camouflage in modern animals, and so it is likely that Sinosauropteryx was under strong predation pressure as well as needing to hide from its own prey.It was likely both the hunter and the hunted, Smithwick added.Sinosauropteryx measured about 3.5 feet (1 meter) long, was two-legged with short arms, large thumbs and a very long tail, and was covered in filament-like feathers.Previous research indicated its dark feathers were brownish-red.It possessed small, sharp teeth, and ate small vertebrates like lizards.It would have looked like a skinny version of a raccoon mixed with a turkey, said University of Bristol molecular paleobiologist Jakob Vinther.Scientists ability in recent years to identify color patterns in fossilized dinosaur skin and feathers has boosted the understanding of these bygone creatures.The camouflage pattern seen on the side of Sinosauropteryxs body is called countershading, which helps animals blend in with the background.Animals inhabiting open environments like savannahs often have a countershading pattern like that of Sinosauropteryx that transitions dramatically from dark to light high on the side of the body, the researchers said.Forest animals typically have countershading that changes from dark to light much lower and more gradually on the side of the body.We know that at least two other dinosaurs had countershading, neither of which were feathered, so it seems that it was a common color pattern, Smithwick said.The research was published in the journal Current Biology.
Earth is fragile, pope tells astronauts who see planet from "eyes of God":::::VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The earth is a fragile thing that could even destroy itself, Pope Francis told astronauts on the International Space Station on Thursday, saying they had an opportunity to see the planet from the eyes of God.Pope Francis attends an audio-video connection with crew members of the International Space Station, ISS Expedition 53, at the Vatican October 26, 2017.Osservatore Romano/Handout via Reuters Francis spent about 20 minutes in a video call to the six crew members on the space station, asking them several questions, sometimes with the gee-whiz wonder of a school boy.Hello ESA (European Space Agency) in the Vatican.This is Space Station.We hear you loud and clear.Good morning or Good evening.Because when one is in space you never know, the pope said from behind a desk with a television monitor in front of him.The pope seemed moved by comments by mission commander Randy Bresnik, one of three Americans on board, who said what gave him the greatest joy in space was to be able to look outside and see Gods creation maybe a little bit from his perspective.People cannot come up here and see the indescribable beauty of our earth and not be touched in their souls, Bresnik told the pope, adding, theres no borders, theres no conflict; its just peaceful.In his response, the pope said Bresnik had managed to understand that the earth is too fragile and it passes in a moment.Pope Francis attends an audio-video connection with crew members of the International Space Station, ISS Expedition 53, at the Vatican October 26, 2017.Osservatore Romano/Handout via Reuters It is a very fragile thing, the atmosphere is thin, so capable of doing harm, of destroying itself, and you have gone to look at it from the eyes of God.Francis, the second pope to phone the space station - Pope Benedict did so in 2011 - has made many appeals for the protection of the Earths environment.Slideshow (3 Images) An encyclical, or major letter, he published in 2015 called for action to reduce the harm from global warming caused by human activity.Sergey Ryazanskiy, one of two Russians on the space station, said he had decided to be a cosmonaut because his grandfather was one of the chief engineers who built Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, which the Soviet Union sent into a low Earth orbit in 1957 during the Cold War.Roots are our hope and our strength.Dont forget roots, Francis replied approvingly of the reference to being inspired by a grandfather.Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli, who acted as translator for his Russian and American crew mates, thanked the pope for coming on board and for taking us higher.Then a voice from mission control announced: Station: We are now resuming normal operational communications.
About half of Americans have high blood pressure, based on new guidelines:::::(CNN) Tens of millions more Americans now have high blood pressure.Almost half of all Americans -- 46% -- are now considered to be in the high blood pressure category based on new guidelines released Monday.High blood pressure should be treated at 130/80 rather than 140/90, according to the new parameters set forth by the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology and nine other health professional organizations.Practicing physicians and the public are "going to be a little bit shocked or taken aback by a diagnosis of Stage 1 hypertension with a blood pressure of 130/80, which historically has been considered a normal, well-controlled blood pressure," said Dr. William White, a professor in the cardiology center at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine."That will involve 50% of men and 38% of all adult women in the US," estimated White, who was not involved in writing the guidelines."So it's a huge number of people."One in three Americans had previously been diagnosed with the condition, but now 14% more Americans will be diagnosed with high blood pressure.The new guidelines will classify 103.3 million people as having high blood pressure, while the previous guidelines placed only 72.2 million Americans in this category, according to the authors of the report.White added that there might also be some confusion on doctors' part about how they should advise patients, because the new treatment guidelines are "an enormous document."Although all patients will be counseled about lifestyle changes, such as exercise, only a small fraction will be prescribed medication, according to the authors.This includes "watching your salt, exercising more regularly, relaxing, getting a proper amount of sleep, eating a little more potassium-rich fruits and vegetables," White explained.Hypertension or high blood pressure is second only to smoking for causing preventable heart disease and stroke deaths, the authors said.What are the guidelines?The new guidelines define normal as less than 120/80.When systolic pressure (the first number) is between 130 and 139 or diastolic (the second number) is between 80 and 89, this will be referred to as Stage 1 hypertension.Stage 2 is when systolic is at least 140 or diastolic is at least 90.Hypertensive crisis is when the top number rises above 180 and/or the bottom number is over 120.At this point, patients will require prompt changes in medication or immediate hospitalization if there are signs of organ damage.The new guidelines eliminate the category of prehypertension, which was used for systolic readings between 120 and 139 or diastolic numbers between 80 and 89.The recommendations also expand the use and frequency of out-of-office blood pressure monitoring for greater accuracy.According to White, there is "a fairly substantial rate of blood pressure variability in doctor's offices from one day to the next, from one week to the next.""It's actually not the most robust measurement," he said."We are sometimes totally shocked when we put a 24-hour blood pressure monitor on a patient, by what the differences are compared to normal activities in normal life compared to what it can be in doctors' office.It can be drastic."Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.He has seen people who register 166/80 in the doctor's office but 128/70 when measured over the course of a day."If that person got treated based on the doctor's office blood pressure alone, they would be grossly overtreated," White said.The authors, who include a panel of 21 scientists who reviewed more than 900 studies, believe the impact of their new guidelines will be greatest among younger and middle-age adults, with prevalence of high blood pressure expected to triple among men under 45 and double among women under 45.Drugs will now be recommended for patients with related health problems coupled with high blood pressure, as defined by the new guidelines."This will cause the greatest amount of controversy with physicians," White said, explaining the new rules take what doctors thought all their lives was a "normal blood pressure" and treating it with drugs."I am a practicing doctor," he added."Patients are going to say 'I don't want to do that.I want to try losing weight first.I want to try, you know, doing more exercise.'"It's going to be a really tough challenge to follow these guidelines in reality," he said.Dr. Tom Frieden, president and CEO of the Resolve to Save Lives campaign, said that "the new guidelines clearly state treatment with medicine should begin if a patient reaches 140/90, an important piece of clarity in an area that has experienced much debate."Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was not involved in the new guidelines."The drugs approved to treat high blood pressure are all generic.For just a few dollars a day, you can save millions of lives," he said.Worldwide, as well as in the US, high blood pressure is "sorely undertreated," Frieden said."This is unacceptable, and we're committed to seeing this change."
Many more children will suddenly be diagnosed with high blood pressure:::::(CNN) More children and teens are likely to be categorized as having abnormal blood pressure during their annual wellness visits, based on new recommendations released Monday by the American Academy of Pediatrics.High blood pressure is mostly a "silent" condition, with no visible symptoms.Yet it can have long-term health consequences, including cardiovascular disease.The new guidelines, aimed at prevention, were published Monday in the journal Pediatrics.They include new diagnosis tables based on normal-weight children.The academy convened a 20-person committee to update the previous guidelines, issued in 2004 , and develop new evidence-based recommendations.As part of its work, the committee reviewed nearly 15,000 articles focused on diagnosis, evaluation and early management of abnormally high blood pressure in children and teens.Obesity and family history An estimated 3.5% of all children and teens in the United States have hypertension, according to the guidelines."The prevalence of 3.5% is based on fairly recent large-scale screening studies," said Dr. Joseph T. Flynn, lead author of the guidelines and a professor of pediatrics at University of Washington.In the past, the percentage of children diagnosed with high blood pressure was lower, he said: "based on previous studies, maybe 1% to 2%."The cause of hypertension depends on the age group."In infants and very young children, we worry about an underlying cause like kidney disease," Flynn said.With older school-age children and teenagers, the cause is more likely to be primary hypertension, sometimes called essential hypertension, "where there's no specific problem," he said."This is like adults.""Obesity does contribute to higher blood pressure," he said.Yet the physiological mechanisms causing high blood pressure are very complicated, and not all kids who are overweight or obese are hypertensive, while some normal-weight kids may be."If, for example, a child is known to have kidney disease or heart disease, then they would be at higher risk for hypertension.Another group would be kids whose parents have hypertension," Flynn said.The guidelines include updated blood pressure tables based on normal-weight children for more precise classifications of hypertension.As a result, more children will be categorized as needing treatment."Untreated, we believe that high blood pressure in a child will lead to high blood pressure when that child becomes an adult, so that would potentially lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life," Flynn said, adding that untreated hypertension can also cause heart and kidney damage.The new guidelines are aligned with those for adults according to Flynn."The blood pressure levels that are concerning in adults would also be concerning in an older teenager," meaning those age 13 and older."It simplifies things for doctors," he said.Takeaways for parents The major thing parents need to know is that their children should have their blood pressure checked when they see a doctor, Flynn said.Also, know that hypertension can be managed with lifestyle change: for example, more exercise or changing the diet.Sometimes, though, the condition requires medication.Another change in the new guidelines is an emphasis on confirmation of the diagnosis."Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a procedure in which the person wears a blood pressure cuff for 24 hours, and their blood pressure is measured periodically over 24 hours," Flynn said."This is very important in children because there's a very high rate of what's called white coat hypertension, where blood pressure is high in the office (due to fear of doctors) but not at home."The new recommendation is that ambulatory blood pressure should become standard practice in children after any abnormal in office reading, Flynn said.Dr. Sophia Jan, director of general pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, said the rationale behind the new guidelines makes sense.With evidence that there may be consequences for kids whose high blood pressure is not treated at lower thresholds, it makes sense to treat them earlier than in the past, said Jan, who was not involved in the new recommendations.What she would tell parents is that "we're not doing anything majorly different.We're still going to check your child's pressure when he or she comes for wellness child visits.That's what we've done always in the past."What's new is that "we may be quicker to recommend that you and your family help your child engage in lifestyle changes if your child's pressure is within a threshold that is lower than in the past."Everyone's loath to put kids on medicines if you don't have to, but we may need to get there a little bit faster than we have traditionally in the past," Jan said.She said that she understood how difficult it is for families to be able to have full control over what their kids eat and how much physical activity they get."This is increasingly a public health problem," Jan said, since schools don't always have budgets that would allow for exercise programs and lots of veggies and fruits in school lunches.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter."As doctors, we recommend these lifestyle changes, yet in reality, it requires partnership with schools and public health agencies," she said."We in the pediatric community did not necessarily appreciate to what degree kids were starting to exhibit what is traditionally thought of as an adult condition.Kids can show early signs of organ damage and increased risk for cardiovascular disease despite the fact that they're young."
Blood pressure guidelines aren't one-size-fits-all:::::(CNN) New guidelines tackle a question many older adults on blood pressure medication face: How low should you go?But finding the right blood pressure might not be so straightforward.The latest guidelines , released yesterday by two physicians' groups, have already drawn criticism for how high they set targets for adults 60 and older, even in light of recent data that some patients, especially those at higher risk for stroke and heart attack, may benefit from lower blood pressures.According to the new guidelines, those with a history of stroke or heart attack should aim for a target systolic blood pressure below 140, the lower limit for what is considered high blood pressure.Otherwise, the majority without these risk factors should be treated to achieve a number below 150.If their numbers fall between 140 and 150, still considered high by many doctors, it may not be worth treating them at all."It's about weighing the harms and the benefits," said Dr. Devan Kansagara, an internist at the VA Portland Health Care System, who co-led an analysis of existing studies , also released yesterday, that provided the basis for these recommendations.On one hand, aiming below 140 or even below 130 may reduce the chance of stroke, heart attack and other cardiac problems in some patients, said Kansagara.But it does not seem to change the overall death rate or quality of life.Increasing medication may also raise certain risks, such as fainting and abnormal kidney function.However, the risks of falls and dementia do not significantly increase, according to the analysis.None of the studies included in the analysis showed any drugs to be more effective, or more risky, than others.Kansagara warned that more research is needed to understand and personalize treatment for patients with high blood pressure."This is really a moving target," said Dr. Nitin Damle, president of the American College of Physicians, which developed the new guidelines with the American Academy of Family Physicians.What's in a number?High blood pressure, or hypertension, affects about a third of adults in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and only about half of them have it under control.Many do not know they have it at all.Adults 60 and older have twice the rate of hypertension as the general population, with two-thirds affected, according to the National Center for Health Statistics (PDF).Blood pressure may increase due to stress, diet, medical conditions and even an anxiety-inducing visit to the doctor.Medication is one of many ways, including exercise and lowering salt intake, that people control chronic hypertension.When it comes to targeting a specific blood pressure, the research is skewed, said Kansagara, who is a member of ACP but did not vote on the new guidelines.The largest share of the data comes from only two clinical trials: the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), and Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD).Both trials, which aimed to push hypertensive patients below 120, showed vastly different results.The SPRINT researchers concluded in late 2015 that lower was indeed better.When the researchers noticed that the patients with lower blood pressures had far better outcomes, they stopped the trial early, a controversial practice that could inflate how effective their methods appeared, said Kansagara.The SPRINT study rattled many doctors who were now faced with the prospect of treating hypertension more aggressively, and with more medication on average, than prior guidelines.It was also a key impetus for Kansagara's review."To go down to 120 overnight is a fairly large change in practice," said Kansagara."We wanted to look at this impactful trial in the context of all of the other evidence."ACCORD, a smaller trial that preceded SPRINT, did not show the same benefit.Though similar in some ways, the trials had different types of patients.For example, ACCORD included only diabetic patients, while SPRINT excluded them.SPRINT targeted certain patients at higher cardiovascular risk, who were also older on average."Apples and oranges," said Damle, an internist in Wakefield, Rhode Island."They are two separate trials that are not totally inconsistent."Damle said that there was only "weak evidence" that the physicians' groups should set the bar lower than they did."Be aware that if you're going lower, that you're risking other side effects," he said.AAFP president Dr. John Meigs added that there is flexibility in the guidelines, stressing the importance of having a relationship with a primary care doctor."It really does help knowing a patient over time," said Meigs, a family physician."I've got patients I've been treating for 35 years."Some of Meigs' patients can add a new blood pressure medication without any issues or side effects, but for others, more medication might be a cost or medical burden.Another study from Johns Hopkins University, published last week, suggested that CT scans may be an additional tool to help personalize targets for patients with moderately high blood pressures."Ultimately, it's the patient's choice," Meigs said.Tightening the cuff The American Heart Association has remained firm on its recommendations to take action for many older adults once their blood pressure hits 140."If I have a blood pressure over 140, I want my physicians to treat me before I get a stroke, not after," said association President Steven Houser, who is not a physician."The data is absolutely clear," he added.Houser is "personally convinced that there's a benefit" to targeting lower numbers.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Houser said that AHA's own recommendations are currently under review, and that the results of that review may be ready this summer.He said that they are "looking at every study" that has come out since their last recommendations, including the SPRINT study."We still have something like 80 million people (in the US) that are still hypertensive," said Houser, adding that each one of those people may have different health needs and goals, a point that AAFP's Meigs agrees with."The guidelines are straightforward," said Meigs."But people are complicated."
How to get blood pressure down to 120:::::(CNN) Doctors have long known that systolic blood pressure below 120 was considered normal and meant a lower risk of heart disease and kidney problems.But they would often only treat patients if that top number crept above 140, the threshold for officially having high blood pressure.The findings, which have not yet been published and are still preliminary, found lower rates of heart attack, stroke and death among people with high blood pressure who brought that top number down to 120.In order to reach that goal, study participants in the 120 group took an average of three blood pressure medications, whereas the 140 group took two medications."This is notable because there (are) a lot of people out there with blood pressure in the 130s that we might previously have left alone, but if the results of this trial (are) as we think they are, it might be reason to try to get them to 120," said Dr. John D.

practice.Like if I have someone in the low 140s, I no longer say that's sort of close....I try to push them down into the mid-130s if they are nondiabetic," Bisognano said.(Although this strategy might also help people with diabetes, Bisognano added, the NIH study only looked at people over 50 who did not have diabetes.)The focus is on the top number in a blood pressure reading because it's a better predictor of heart attack and stroke than the bottom number, the diastolic pressure, Bisognano said.So how can patients take their blood pressure down to 120?If that becomes the new goal, many people will probably need to start a blood pressure medication or add another to their current regimen, Bisognano said.But there are also a number of lifestyle interventions they may be able to tap into instead of taking a new drug.Here are their options: Medicate Many people have to take blood pressure medication just to stay close to the 140 mark, Bisognano said.Some may even run marathons and lead otherwise healthy lives, but just can't get down in the normal range, possibly because they are genetically predisposed to high blood pressure.To get down to 120, these people may have to take more blood pressure medication.The most common, Bisognano said, are the "ABCDs": ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and diuretics.Typically, patients who need more than one medication would take one from each of these classes.Although the ABCDs can lead to side effects, such as dehydration, headache and weakness, most people can tolerate them and the problems are usually not severe, Bisognano said.In addition, "we are in a golden age of hypertension treatment, where almost all of the drugs are cheap," he said.A medium dose of one of these medications usually brings systolic blood pressure down by about 10 points, said Dr. Karen Margolis, director of clinical research at HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research Lose weight Weight loss can lower blood pressure about as much as taking a single blood pressure medication, Margolis said.Research suggests that losing about 9 pounds could reduce systolic blood pressure by 4.5 points, and one study found that maintaining weight loss of about 7 pounds for a year could even bring it down by 11 points.It is not clear why weight loss is so beneficial for blood pressure, Bisognano said.It may lead to changes in circulation, or it may be because of the dietary changes that can accompany weight loss, such as eating less salt."(However) we have to appreciate how difficult it is to lose weight," especially if you are busy, Bisognano said."Sometimes you can do it and sometimes you cannot."Exercise Along with weight loss, exercise is probably the best way to lower blood pressure without the possible side effects of medication, Bisognano said.It makes arteries more flexible and better able to dilate, which directly reduces systolic blood pressure, he said.The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend 2 hours a week of medium intensity physical activity, such as jogging, swimming and dancing.One study found that 10 weeks of moderate exercise, such as walking and cycling, for an hour three times a week reduced systolic blood pressure in sedentary older adults by 5 points.For some people, however, the slog of going to the gym after a long work day may be worse than the side effects of medication, Bisognano said.But even being a "weekend warrior" can help."Then, when your life permits you to do something once or twice a week, you'll be in physical shape to do that," Bisognano said.Scale back the salt One of the most important dietary changes some people can make to lower blood pressure is reducing salt intake , Bisognano said.Many of us consume 9 to 12 grams of salt a day, but the American Heart Association recommendation is 3 or 4 grams.In one study , scaling back daily salt levels from 8 grams to 4 grams was associated with a drop of 6.7 points in systolic blood pressure.But only people whose blood pressure is affected by salt may reap this kind of blood pressure-lowering benefit."If you don't have salt-sensitive hypertension, it will not do much," said Dr. Samuel Joseph Mann, professor of internal medicine at New York-Presbyterian Hospital Weill Cornell Medical College About half of black people and a quarter of white people have salt-sensitive hypertension, and the numbers are higher in older people, Mann said.You can see if your hypertension is affected by salt by reducing your intake for four or five days, such as by cutting out soups and processed foods and not eating out, and measuring your blood pressure at your drugstore before and after, Mann added.Eat more fruits and vegetables The DASH diet is high in fruits, vegetables and fiber, and low in sodium.It may further reduce systolic blood pressure by about 3 points compared with a regular low-sodium diet, according to a trial of DASH.However, a drawback of the DASH diet is that it's high in carbohydrates.This can stimulate the appetite and make it harder for people to lose weight, Bisognano said.If you are trying to lose weight and lower blood pressure, diets such as Zone and South Beach , which balance carbs with protein and fat, may be easier to stick with for six months or so, he added.Snack on chocolate Not every tasty treat is bad for your blood pressure.Research suggests that people who ate more dark chocolate over a period of two to eight weeks had lower systolic blood pressure by about 2 points.Antioxidants in cocoa, called flavanols, may help dilate arteries.Although this reduction in blood pressure is relatively small, it may complement other interventions.However, Bisognano said, "if you have 400 calories of dark chocolate, you don't get to have 400 calories of something else."Don't binge drink High blood pressure is another reason not to binge drink Studies suggest that alcohol reduction interventions can reduce systolic blood pressure by about 4 points among people who consume between 30 and 60 drinks a week.The American Heart Association recommends that women stick to an average of one alcoholic drink a day and men to two.Meditate "We know that transcendental meditation, and other relaxation techniques such as yoga, definitely work if done regularly.The question is, can people do it regularly?"Bisognano said.
'Fat but fit' have higher risk of heart disease, study says:::::(CNN) The idea that you can be overweight or obese yet healthy -- if factors such as your blood sugar, blood pressure or cholesterol levels are normal -- is a myth, according to a new study, and messaging around this should be changed.Carrying those extra pounds can increase risk of coronary heart disease by up to 28% even if your other results appear normal, further disproving the notion that people can be "fat but fit.""We conclude that there is no such thing as being healthy obese," said Camille Lassale, an epidemiologist from Imperial College London's School of Public Health, now based at University College London, who led the research."You are at an increased risk of heart disease."But more recent studies have gone against this belief, showing that people with excess weight still have a greater chance of developing heart disease than those with a normal weight.The latest study, published Monday in the European Heart Journal , confirms that stance.Proving that risk increases with excess body mass Lassale's team conducted the largest study to date investigating the impact on heart health when people are overweight or obese, as well as when they are "metabolically unhealthy," such as having elevated blood pressure, blood sugar, triglycerides (which store fat in your body) and waist size or having reduced levels of HDL cholesterol, the "good" form, which the body needs.These factors combine to cause metabolic syndrome, which increases risk of various heart-related conditions, including heart disease and stroke.The team used data from more than 7,600 adults who experienced coronary heart disease -- when coronary arteries are blocked and can cause a heart attack -- and categorized them by their body mass index as well as by their metabolic health, such as high blood sugar levels.They also used data from 10,000 healthy controls to represent the general health of the population being sampled.People were sampled from the larger European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, which contains data from more than half a million people across 10 European countries.People within the samples were first separated into two groups, healthy and unhealthy, based on whether they had three or more of the markers for being "metabolically unhealthy," followed by separation by BMI to class them as normal weight, overweight or obese.BMI is the ratio between weight and height, with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 considered overweight and over 30 being obese.Those in the metabolically unhealthy group were at greater risk for coronary heart disease, with unhealthy obese people having the highest risk.But the researchers then looked within the group classified as "metabolically healthy" -- without risk factors such as high blood sugar.They found that within this seemingly healthy group, people who were overweight or obese had a greater risk of heart disease than normal weight people: 26% increased risk in those who were overweight and 28% increased risk in those who were obese."Even if you are classified as metabolically healthy, (excess weight) was associated with an increased risk of heart disease," Lassale said."It's another brick in the wall of evidence that being healthy overweight is not true."The risk is much higher in the unhealthy group, Lassale added, but she highlighted the need for those without signs such as high blood pressure not to rest on their laurels."(They) seem to be at an intermediate risk," she said."We saw that they went on to develop (more) heart attacks."But the team members acknowledge that they cannot say with certainty why those carrying extra weight went on to have more heart disease.Healthy now, unhealthy later The larger European study from which these data were obtained collected only information such as BMI, blood pressure and blood sugar at the start of the study.For the 12 years after those data were collected, people were followed up only to identify whether they had experienced aspects of coronary heart disease, such as a heart attack.Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter."We couldn't monitor the evolution of their metabolic health," Lassale said."They probably went on to be metabolically unhealthy."What she does know, however, is that this further emphasizes the need to prevent the burgeoning obesity epidemic."This reinforces the fact that obesity in itself is a risk factor," Lassale said."Every effort should be made by health professionals to advise on lifestyle changes regardless of these metabolic factors."These factors are likely to become abnormal if weight is not controlled, she added."This study provides robust evidence that there is no such thing as 'healthy obesity,' " said Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, who was not involved in the study."The take-home message here is that maintaining a healthy body weight is a key step towards maintaining a healthy heart."Nick Finer, honorary clinical professor at the National Centre for Cardiovascular Prevention and Outcomes at University College London who also was not involved in the study, added that it "supports the ever-pressing need for governments, local authorities, public health bodies and individuals to seriously address the issues leading to our current levels of overweight and obesity."
Bill Gates' newest mission: Curing Alzheimer's:::::(CNN) It's one of the holy grails of science: a cure for Alzheimer's.Currently, there is no treatment to stop the disease, let alone slow its progression.And billionaire Bill Gates thinks he will change that."I believe there is a solution," he told me without hesitation."Any type of treatment would be a huge advance from where we are today," he said, but "the long-term goal has got to be cure."I had the chance to sit down with Gates recently to talk about his newest initiative.He sat in front of our cameras exclusively to tell me how he hopes to find a cure to a disease that now steals the memories and other cognitive functions of 47 million people around the world.For Gates, the fight is personal.He is investing $50 million of his own money into the Dementia Discovery Fund , a private-public research partnership focused on some of the more novel ideas about what drives the brain disease, such as looking at a brain cell's immune system.It's the first time Gates has made a commitment to a noncommunicable disease.The work done through his foundation has focused primarily on infectious diseases such as HIV, malaria and polio.I have interviewed Gates many times over the years, in countries around the world.He was more engaged on this topic of Alzheimer's than I've ever seen before.Today, Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, where a new case is diagnosed every 66 seconds.More than 5 million Americans live with the disease, at a cost of $259 billion a year.Without any treatment, those numbers are projected to explode to 16 million Americans with the disease, at a cost of over $1 trillion a year, by 2050."The growing burden is pretty unbelievable," the tech guru-turned-philanthropist told me.It's something he knows personally."Several of the men in my family have this disease.And so, you know, I've seen how tough it is.That's not my sole motivation, but it certainly drew me in."When he said, "I'm a huge believer in that science and innovation are going to solve most of the tough problems over time," I could feel his optimism.He told me he has spent the past year investigating and talking to scientists, trying to determine how best to help move the needle toward treatment of the disease itself rather than just the symptoms.A disease turns 100 It has been more than a century since the disease was identified by German physician Dr. Alois Alzheimer .He first wrote about it in 1906, describing the case of a woman named "Auguste D." Alzheimer called it "a peculiar disease," marked by significant memory loss, severe paranoia and other psychological changes.But it wasn't until Alzheimer performed an autopsy on her brain that the case became even more striking.He found that her brain had shrunk significantly, and there were unusual deposits in and around the nerve cells.It would take another 80 years for scientists to identify what those deposits were: plaques and tangles of proteins called amyloid and tau.They have become hallmarks of the disease.Both amyloid and tau are naturally occurring proteins that can be found in healthy brain cells.But in a brain with Alzheimer's, something goes haywire, causing parts of amyloid proteins to clump together and block the cell's messaging pathways.Eventually, tau proteins begin to tangle up inside the neurons.All of this contributes to a breakdown of the neural highway that helps our brain cells communicate.These changes in the brain can begin years before anyone starts actually exhibiting any symptoms of memory loss or personality changes.Until recently, it's been a challenge to understand the disease, let alone identify who has it.The only way to definitively diagnose Alzheimer's is still after someone has died and their brain can be examined under the microscope, looking for the telltale amyloid plaques and tau tangles.A new hope "It's gone slower than we all would have hoped.A lot of failed drug trials," Gates told me.And he's right.Since 2002, there have been more than 400 Alzheimer drug trials run and yet no treatments.There are some drugs prescribed to help with cognitive symptoms such as memory loss or confusion but nothing that actually targets Alzheimer's.In the past five years, advanced imaging technology has allowed us to see tau and amyloid in living people.Dr. James Hendrix , who heads up the Alzheimer Association's Global Science Innovation team, believes that this development is a game-changer."You need good tools to find the right therapeutics," he said.By identifying these biomarkers earlier, Hendrix told me, scientists can work on finding ways to prevent the brain from deteriorating."If we can catch the earliest signs of Alzheimer's, then we're treating a mostly healthy brain, and keeping it mostly healthy....It's very difficult to repair the damage once it's done," he explained.Dr. Rudy Tanzi agrees that imaging has been essential in understanding the pathology of Alzheimer's and potential treatments.Tanzi, a professor of neurology at Harvard, has been at the helm of Alzheimer's research, discovering several of the genes associated with the disease.He points out that one of the greatest faults with some of the trials has not been in the treatment itself but in the application: too late in the disease's progression, when symptoms are already occurring."It's like trying to give someone Lipitor when they have a heart attack," he explained."You had to do it earlier."Tanzi said we need to think about Alzheimer's like cancer or heart disease."That's how we're going to beat the disease: early detection and early intervention."Think different Most of the focus in Alzheimer's research has been on tau and amyloid, what Gates likes to call "the mainstream."With his donation, Gates hopes to spur research into more novel ideas about the disease, like investigating the role of the glial cells that activate the immune system of the brain or how the energy lifespan of a cell may contribute to the disease."There's a sense that this decade will be the one that we make a lot of progress," Gates told me.Gates believes that it will be a combination of mainstream and out-of-the-box thinking that will lead to potential treatments in the near future."Ideally, some of these mainstream drugs that report out in the next two or three years will start us down the path of reducing the problem.But I do think these newer approaches will eventually be part of that drug regimen that people take," he said.Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Has looking into Alzheimer's research caused Gates to worry about his own health?"Anything where my mind would deteriorate" is, he said, one of his greatest fears.He's seen the hardship it has caused in his own family."I hope I can live a long time without those limitations."So Gates is now focused on prevention, by exercising and staying mentally engaged."My job's perfect, because I'm always trying to learn new things and meeting with people who are explaining things to me.You know, I have the most fun job in the world," he said with a smile.
After Alzheimer's diagnosis, 'there's still a good life':::::(CNN) When he first sees me, Sandy Halperin always gives a surprised snort and then a cackle of delight.Before I know it, I'm enveloped in a bear hug, snuggled close and patted heartily on the back.If I'm lucky and Sandy remembers that he really likes me, I'll get a back scratch too, a true Halperin hug."What a treat," Sandy says to me with a huge smile each time I visit, throwing his arm across my shoulders and inviting me for a stroll.His ready answer to my question "How are you feeling?"is, unfortunately, heartbreakingly familiar as well."I feel my decline more rapidly right now," Sandy has said many times."Just like a confusion as the day goes on or times when I don't even have thoughts -- I'm awake, but ... what was the question?"Sandy Halperin was a teacher and practicing prosthodontist at Harvard University in 1979.In this photo he is working on his father, Leon's, teeth.In 2010, at the tragically young age of 60, Alexander "Sandy" Halperin, a former dentist and Harvard assistant professor, father of two and grandfather of three, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's.For the past five years, at Sandy's request, my CNN crew and I have been documenting his mental journey into twilight.His goal: to erase the stigma and shame that come with a diagnosis of dementia and to educate the world on how to best care for the growing numbers of people living with cognitive decline."I'm not 'Sandy Dementia'; I'm Sandy the person I always was," he has said with passion, arms waving wide."I'm not missing a limb, but I've got a defect.But it doesn't mean I can't live my life to its fullest with that defect.So, as I decline, please treat me for who I am."What is happening to Sandy is being repeated around the globe in the lives of the more than 47 million people living with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia; over 5.5 million of those are Americans, including about 200,000 under the age of 65.Worldwide, the total number of people living with dementia is expected to rise to 131.5 million by midcentury.It's a frightening reality that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is determined to change.He's investing $50 million of his own money to support cutting-edge research at the Dementia Discovery Fund, in the hope that an innovative approach to curing dementia will strike gold.It was Sandy who was on my mind when I sat down with Gates recently."Any type of treatment would be a huge advance ... from where we are today," Gates told me."The long-term goal has got to be cure."Will those currently living with dementia, like Sandy Halperin, benefit from that research?We can only hope.But while we wait for that big breakthrough, Sandy's story is a powerful tale of what we can do now to help those living with Alzheimer's and their caregivers.Sandy Halperin tells Dr. Sanjay Gupta that dementia is a "whirling-like confusion" with a sensation of cotton stuffed into the front of his brain.'There's cotton stuffed in there' It's a typical tropical afternoon on one of my first visits in 2013 with Sandy and his wife, Gail, at their retirement home in Tallahassee, Florida.Sandy and I swat bugs as we walk and talk."Are you suffering?"I ask."Yeah, I'm suffering a lot," Sandy answers, stopping and gesturing to his forehead."I often feel in the front of my head that there's cotton stuffed in there, and this whirling-like confusion with that sensation in the brain."As a neurosurgeon, I'm fascinated by his description.I ask him to balance on his toes and then his heels, which he does with ease."Neurologically, your balance is good," I tell him."Does it hurt?""No," says Sandy, "It's just like a pressure feeling."Like many people with early-stage Alzheimer's, Sandy looks fine physically.He even acts fine, joking and laughing and carrying on a normal conversation until, suddenly, he doesn't."I just lost my train of thought there, but ... um, I lost my ... where I was."But tell Sandy he seems the same, like so many people do, and you ignite a smoldering flame of indignation, and not just for himself."They're going to say he doesn't have Alzheimer's, that because he's talking to me, he has a brain," says Sandy, voice rising."Well, that's not right!People who have a cognitive impairment, have Alzheimer's, they can still think!They can still have feelings!They can still express themselves!"Pharmacist Leon Halperin, Sandy's father, died of Alzheimer's in 1998.'They don't want people to know' For Sandy, eliminating the stereotypical image of dementia as an elderly person shuffling around in robe and slippers, unbathed, with stringy hair, is critical to bringing attention -- and critically needed funding -- to dementia research and caregiving efforts.Dismissing Alzheimer's as an "old person's" disease, he says, is a huge reason why the American government is spending only $1.4 billion on Alzheimer's research this year, compared with $6 billion for cancer, $3 billion on HIV/AIDS and $2 billion for heart disease.Sandy also believes that stigma is the reason so many people, young and old, hide their early symptoms and forfeit the medications and treatments that might help them slow the disease progression."A lot of individuals don't go see a health care provider out of the stigma of the disease.They don't go for years," he told me in the past."I see it.They're in denial.Their spouse has covered for them.They whisper in their ear.They help them.They don't want people to know."In 2013, Sandy visited Washington to lobby for increased funding for Alzheimer's research.Since his diagnosis, Sandy has advocated across the country on behalf of what he calls Care and Cure for Alzheimer's.Among his many accomplishments: serving on the early-stage advisory group for the Alzheimer's Association, traveling to Washington to lobby Congress for funding and giving a call to action speech on caregiving at the National Alzheimer's Project Act Advisory Council."I cannot look into the eyes of any other person with dementia -- never one -- and tell them everything possible is being done to enhance their lives," he told the council members."Now is the time to act."In his home state of Florida, one of the hardest-hit by Alzheimer's, Sandy has co-founded two early-stage support groups; hosted a fundraiser starring Peter Yarrow of the folk music trio Peter, Paul and Mary; and helped the state of Florida establish a Dementia Care and Cure Initiative.One of its first actions was to designate Tallahassee, where Sandy lives, as the first Dementia Caring Community in Florida, pledging money and services to help those living with cognitive impairment and their caregivers."CNN world, you're listening to me right now....Help!"Sandy said to our camera one day."What are you going to do if you're a legislator, physician, plumber, educator?...It's not about me, Sandy Halperin, it's about the Alzheimer's effort."His wife of 43 years, Gail, and his youngest daughter, Lauren Halperin Crawford, credit Sandy's joie de vivre to his zeal for advocacy and believe that anyone facing a diagnosis of dementia should fight back by finding their own passion."Advocacy got him up and going and with a purpose," Gail has said."So yes, it's helping him.It's giving him a life.""It's just so powerful to me, the fact that he has this attitude," said Lauren, wiping a tear from her eye."He's like, 'You may be in me, but you are not going to take me down.'I am so grateful for that."In honor of all his work on behalf of those living with dementia, in 2016, Sandy was given the prestigious Proxmire Award at the Great Minds Gala , joining the ranks of such greats as musician Glen Campbell and former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.(The committee was kind enough to bestow the award on me and my CNN team as well.)Sandy Halperin says that, at times, his memory loss causes emotional pain."All we really are is our thoughts."But as the years have progressed, so has the disease that is claiming Sandy's mind, and he is finding it harder and harder to do the advocacy he loves."I want to do all that I can do on the advocacy side, but I have to determine where at this point with my abilities -- what I can do, " Sandy told me."It doesn't feel good when you don't know how to -- when you can't finish a sentence.Do I feel that I've helped make an impact?Yes.Is that enough?No.But I have to pass the baton.Right now, it's time for me to do it part-time."It's not just his memory that is changing, he tells me.He's not as social as he was, not as patient.He gets agitated more easily.He will fixate on what he forgets and fret about it until he remembers or gives up in frustration.He fights back against those feelings by trying his best to live in the moment.Sandy Halperin with daughters Karen, left, 4, and Lauren, 2, at their home in Needham, Massachusetts, in 1984.A fresh feast of memories One of the most enjoyable ways he can do that is spend time with his older daughter, Karen Halperin Cyphers, and his precious grandchildren, Madeline, 7, Rebecca, 8, and Emma, 22, who live close by."He keeps saying, 'Do you think my grandkids will remember me?Are they old enough where they're going to remember me?'" Karen shared on one of our early visits."Our brains are our being," explained Sandy."And when you lose your memory, the pain is a different pain.The pain is the emotional pain.And maybe that's why I wrote the grandpa books early, when I could get my thoughts down on paper for my children and my grandchildren as to how I felt about things."Grandpa or "G-Paw" books, as Sandy calls them, are, in my mind, one of his most brilliant accomplishments.Filled with old pictures, mementos (an excised tooth represents his time as a dentist), his unique recipes for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches (he actually adds ham, cheese or salami), his musings on life and his memories of the girls as babies, Sandy's G-Paw scrapbooks paint an undeniable portrait of a caring and quirky father."They talk about formative years.I can only hope that all the love that I have for them will maybe make an impact on their lives from their grandpa," said Sandy wistfully.But the books feed more than a child's memories.As his disease progresses, turning each page gives Sandy a fresh feast of past experiences."Seeing him remember is, like, the best," said Lauren with a chuckle."When he goes 'ah' and he gets it, it's like, YES!Tiny little victories of remembering."Sandy walks daughter Lauren down the aisle in September 2015."I feel so happy that we get to do this ... major thing on his bucket list," she said.The ultimate bucket list moment Lauren was only 28 when Sandy was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and not yet engaged to her now-husband, Jacob.But she knew how important it was to her father to be able to attend -- and remember -- her special moment, that bucket list moment."You don't know how fast things are going to progress.You don't know how healthy he will be," Lauren said when she told me of their wedding plans for September 2015."I feel so happy that this major thing on his bucket list is going to be a reality.It's like just the most enormous relief."At elder daughter Karen's wedding in 2008, Sandy gave an extemporaneous toast.For Lauren's wedding, Sandy spent weeks writing and rewriting his speech and brought his notes with him to the reception.It's a perfect Sandy delivery, full of wit, wisdom and laughter, when he noticed something was wrong."What?Did I miss something?Oh, I missed an entire page," he said and turned to the packed room with a sheepish grin as everyone burst into laughter.Sandy and Lauren dance at her reception to one of their favorite songs: "It's a Wonderful World" by Louis Armstrong."Honestly, I have known since I was 5 what song I'm going to have with my first dance with my dad to," said Lauren."The thing I'm most grateful for," Lauren said, "is that even though he struggles with his memory, he gets confused, he can't follow stories or direction, he is still so deeply who he is.His personality, his instinct, his humor, his wit -- all of that is so wonderful, and it's remained."The story continues ...It's just over two years since Lauren and Jacob were married, and Sandy has moved to a new stage in his disease.He's had to give up all his advocacy; the tiny victories of remembering are fewer now.Today, instead of describing the congested feeling in the front of his brain as "cotton," he says it just feels empty."I feel ...It just happened right now.I just feel, um ...I totally lost what I was saying," he says."It's just like a blank."Daughter Karen and family have moved less than a mile away, and she sees Sandy almost daily."We've been dealing with a more negative Dad that we are used to seeing, for sure," Karen says."The ruminating has gotten worse, and he obsesses over thoughts.It's like his brain can't now choose to filter out the negative thinking the way it used to."Part of his decline may well be due to chronic pain.Longstanding back and leg pain was partially addressed by a hip-replacement surgery in early 2016, but more surgery is not an option, and wife Gail worries about the future."The hip surgery helped a lot, but he is still constantly rubbing his left leg," says Gail."I think he's getting worse again.He limps a little, shuffles a lot.He has all his other health problems, and he constantly says he's too weak to do anything and in too much pain.""Even when he's in pain, in the past, my dad normally wouldn't talk about it," agrees Lauren."So the fact that he's so vocal speaks to the level of pain he is in.And I feel that when his pain is really intense, it affects not only his memory but his ability to cope with stuff."Lauren's right.Even without Alzheimer's, physical pain can affect your mind and make it increasingly difficult to form thoughts.For Sandy, it's clear his pain is slowly but steadily accelerating the rate of his decline.Sandy snuggles with granddaughter Maggie during a birthday party in 2013.Still, when he's distracted, the old Sandy comes back.For that, he can thank his precious granddaughters."He's lost a lot of motivation to get out of the house or talk to people, but when the girls come around, it gives him a spark of life," says Lauren."Nothing else that I can think of does that for him right now."He just gets so silly, mindlessly silly with them, and they love it.He has this little lamp outside that he will dress up like a person, with goggles and a hat," Lauren says with a chuckle."Every time the kids come over, he'll add something else, and they have to figure out what's new about the 'lamp guy.'It's almost like his subconscious creativity is still there, pouring out."Sandy teases older daughter Karen in 2013."His personality, his instinct, his humor, his wit -- all of that is so wonderful, and it's remained," said younger daughter Lauren.Dementia, and chronic pain, may be slowing Sandy down, but they have not taken him away from us -- yet."The diagnosis doesn't mean tomorrow you are no longer who you are," Lauren has told me."There is still so much life to live, and there is so much happiness and joy he still experiences.""We're all terminal," Sandy puts it."I may pass faster, but I have to live my life for now.So I want people to know there's still a good life for anyone with a diagnosis with dementia.That's what they have to know: There's a quality of life they can still have."
Opioid panel's anti-marijuana argument stirs anger:::::(CNN) New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie, head of the presidential commission on opioids, warned of the dangers of marijuana in a letter to President Donald Trump earlier this month about the panel's findings, saying the current push for marijuana legalization could further fuel the opioid epidemic."There is a lack of sophisticated outcome data on dose, potency, and abuse potential for marijuana.This mirrors the lack of data in the 1990s and early 2000s when opioid prescribing multiplied across health care settings and led to the current epidemic of abuse, misuse and addiction," Christie wrote in the letter, which was released with the commission's final report "The Commission urges that the same mistake is not made with the uninformed rush to put another drug legally on the market in the midst of an overdose epidemic."Ben Carson, the former Republican presidential hopeful and now Cabinet secretary, added to the argument during the final commission meeting, speaking nostalgically of the Reagan-era "This is your brain on drugs" ad campaign and its infamous fried egg imagery."It frequently starts with something as seemingly innocent as marijuana," said Carson, the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, who was among several officials to speak at the meeting.But some experts say the commission's fixation on marijuana was bizarre and troubling, lending credence to outdated views of marijuana as a gateway drug.And these experts want to nip such thinking in the bud.They emphasized that they support efforts to curb the nation's opioid epidemic , but not the demonization of marijuana in the process."I was surprised to see negative language about marijuana in the opioid report," said Dr. Chinazo Cunningham, a professor of medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine."Research that examines pain and marijuana shows that marijuana use significantly reduces pain.In addition, the majority of studies examining marijuana and opioids show that marijuana use is associated with less opioid use and less opioid-related deaths."She took particular issue with one line in Christie's letter in which the outgoing governor said research conducted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse "found that marijuana use led to a 2 times greater chance that the marijuana user would become an opioid user and abuser.""In general, the body of research does not back up this claim," Cunningham said.had 25% fewer opioid overdose deaths than those without medical marijuana laws.She's also starting a study that she hopes will involve 250 people who are using opioids for chronic pain and are starting medical marijuana.Cunningham's research found states where medical marijuana is legalhad 25% fewer opioid overdose deaths than those without medical marijuana laws.She's also starting a study that she hopes will involve 250 people who are using opioids for chronic pain and are starting medical marijuana.The first-of-its-kind study will follow the patients for 1 years to examine the effects of medical marijuana and opioid use."People are dying every day from opioid overdoses.We must act now," Cunningham said."We must offer a broad range of non-opioid strategies to address pain, and we must study these strategies."Cannabis remains a Schedule I substance, the classification by the Drug Enforcement Administration for drugs believed to have a high potential for abuse along with some potential to create severe dependence.With federal restrictions placed on marijuana, scientists have to overcome various legal and procedural hurdles to research it.Cunningham said those federal restrictions need to be changed "so that researchers can adequately study marijuana, and then research can guide policies."CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta, who has covered America's medical marijuana revolution in three documentaries, said "it is fair to say that the majority of people who use marijuana do not go on to use other substances.""While marijuana often precedes 'harder' drugs in people who do, so does alcohol and even more commonly, nicotine.In that sense, nicotine is a much more common gateway drug," Gupta said."It may not be that marijuana is a gateway drug but rather people who are vulnerable to drug use often start with more readily available substances, such as marijuana, nicotine or alcohol."The study Christie cited was published in September in the American Journal of Psychiatry.It was based on interviews with more than 43,000 Americans from 2001 to 2002 and with more than 34,000 respondents from 2004 to 2005."Cannabis use appears to increase rather than decrease the risk of developing non-medical prescription opioid use and opioid use disorder," said the study, led by Dr. Mark Olfson, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University.Within his report, Olfson noted multiple limitations of the study, including the fact that the data were collected over a decade ago and that "the social context of cannabis use may have changed during this period."Critics have said the report oversimplifies a complex issue.Olfson told CNN last week he didn't know that Christie was going to reference the study, and he acknowledged that some of criticism is valid."I agree that the relationship between marijuana and opioid use is complex and that more recent data might have yielded different results in light of changing marijuana use patterns," Olfson wrote in an email."Nevertheless, Governor Christie is correct in that adults who used marijuana were at significantly higher risk of developing opioid use disorder.At the same time, it is important to note that a great majority of marijuana users did not develop problematic opioid use."Shanel Lindsay, a member of the newly appointed Cannabis Advisory Board in Massachusetts, where medical marijuana and adult use was recently legalized, blasted the opioid commission for its marijuana remarks.She took particular aim at Christie for citing the study, which she called "an overly gross simplification of an incredibly complex disease affecting millions of families.""To identify cannabis as the singular starting point of any kind of addiction is dangerous, ill-informed, and ignores all the data that links alcohol and prescription drug abuse to opioid addiction," said Lindsay, the founder and president of Ardent, a biotech and medical cannabis device company."If you ask an addict what led them down this road, I'd bet the reasons go well beyond smoking a joint."Though the Trump administration has begun "waging a war on weed," Lindsay said, the majority of Americans support legalization of marijuana and acknowledge its health benefits."The growing acceptance of marijuana isn't going anywhere."Mitchell Kulick, a lawyer who specializes in cannabis legal services, said it wasn't surprising that the commission had an anti-marijuana stance.But what is most troubling, he said, is how it overlooked new research published in the American Journal of Public Health that found marijuana legalization in Colorado led to a decrease in opioid overdose deaths in the state.The opioid commission's take on marijuana, he said, seemed more in line with Attorney General Jeff Sessions' anti-weed rhetoric than current research.Sessions has said he doesn't think there are benefits to medical marijuana and has dismissed it as a solution to the opioid epidemic.Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter."The positive impact that legalized cannabis is having on the opioid epidemic in states that have robust legal marijuana programs should be further studied before politicians make conclusory allegations that support their preconceived notions and political agendas," Kulick said.In its report, the opioid commission recommended nationwide drug courts to help place substance abusers into treatment rather than sending them into the prison system.It also recommended expanding the availability of medication-assisted therapies, increasing treatment capacity for those who need help and making the lifesaving opioid overdose antidote naloxone available to more first responders.Trump last month declared the opioid crisis a national public health emergency, a move allowing for money to be redirected to fight the epidemic and for state laws to be eased.Last year alone, an estimated 64,000 Americans died of drug overdoses, most of them from opioids.
Trump's HHS pick a pharma insider as drug prices skyrocketed:::::(CNN) President Trump is nominating former Deputy Secretary and Eli Lilly President Alex Azar as new head of the Department of Health and Human Services, tweeting that he will be a "star for better healthcare and lower drug prices."Happy to announce, I am nominating Alex Azar to be the next HHS Secretary.He will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!The key position has been open since late September, when former Secretary Tom Price resigned amid reports of frequent trips across the country in private planes paid for with taxpayer dollars.Trump has stressed cracking down on rising drug costs, at one point accusing pharmaceutical companies of "getting away with murder."However, the choice of a man who helped lead the industry for a decade prompted Democrats and industry observers to wonder how effective -- or dedicated -- he will be to the President's agenda."We sincerely hope that Secretary-nominee Azar will follow through on the President's commitment to achieve lower drug prices for all Americans," the nonprofit Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing said in a statement."Given Alex Azar's professional background, there are concerns on whether he can fairly execute any significant effort to lower drug prices for patients & families," tweeted Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.A decade in Big Pharma Azar, who left his position as president of Lilly USA in January after an internal shakeup, started with the pharmaceutical giant in 2007 as senior vice president of communications, moving up to vice president of Lilly's U.S.Managed Healthcare Services and Puerto Rico in 2009 before becoming president in 2012.JUST WATCHED Is your doctor being paid by a drug company?Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Is your doctor being paid by a drug company?02:18 During his tenure at the pharmaceutical giant, Azar says, Lilly went off the "largest patent cliff in pharmaceutical history" in which it lost "$4 billion of revenue as it lost patent exclusivity, laid off a large percent of its organization and reorganized repeatedly," according to the description of one of his presentations for the Worldwide Speakers Group.It's also an era of exorbitant price increases by Lilly and big pharmaceuticals.A report this year by Credit Suisse showed that the industry added $8.7 billion in 2016 from rocketing drug prices; Sean Williams , an investor at financial services company Motley Fool, listed Lilly as one of the practice's major benefactors."Eli Lilly has had little choice but to turn to price increases on some of its established therapies, as well as its specialty indications," Williams said.Citing data from Bernstein Research, CNBC recently said that the prices of Lilly's insulin drugs Humalog and Humulin N rose 20.81% in 2014 and 16.96% in 2015, under Azar's watch.Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, has accused Lilly -- along with Novo Nordisk and Sanofi, which also sell insulin products -- of collusion to drive up insulin prices.'The cost of insulin more than tripled between 2002 and 2013, from $231 to $736 per year per patient," Sanders wrote on his website in a call-out to the public for their stories on how they cope with the rising cost of the drug.The pharmaceutical companies deny the allegations of collusion; Sanders is calling for a federal investigation.In March, a class-action federal lawsuit was filed on behalf of 38 individuals against Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi, citing violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, among others.Staunch conservative An economist and lawyer by training, Azar clerked for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in the early 1990s and later worked under Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel on the Clinton Whitewater investigation.Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Azar also served from 2001 to 2007 as Health and Human Services general counsel and deputy secretary for President George W. Bush, writing on a Yale Law School alumni page that he "wrestled with the question" of taking the job because he had not focused on health care in his career.But, he said, he soon learned that he had found his calling: "to help people around the world live longer, healthier and happier lives."If confirmed as Health and Human Services secretary, Azar would have broad authority over much of the Affordable Care Act, a reality he seemed to embrace during an interview with Bloomberg TV in June "I'm not one to say many good things about Obamacare, but one of the nice things in it is, it does give a tremendous amount authority to the secretary of HHS," Azar said."There are still changes that can be made to make it work a little better than it has been."Reaction to the nomination on Capitol Hill was predictably split along party lines.Alex Azar is an experienced and highly capable leader who knows what it takes to tackle big challenges in health care.The Senate should swiftly confirm him as our next @HHSGov secretary.Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) November 13, 2017 "For too long, hardworking, middle-class families have been forced to bear the brunt of Obamacare's failures," said Sen. Orrin Hatch , the Republican chairman for the Senate Finance Committee, which will review Azar's nomination."The leader of HHS will be at the tip of the spear, working to not only right the wrongs of this deeply flawed law but also ensure the long-term sustainability of both Medicare and Medicaid," Hatch added in his statement."Mr. Azar has the experience, knowledge and fortitude to take on these daunting challenges."Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, tweeted , "Health care is too personal to be driven by politics.I'll be asking tough questions.I will closely scrutinize Mr. Azar's record and ask for his commitment to faithfully implement the Affordable Care Act and take decisive, meaningful action to curtail the runaway train of prescription drug costs."
After Roy Moore allegations, social media uses #MeAt14 to talk about consent:::::(CNN) If your Twitter feed has been blowing up with photos of celebrities from their teen years, there's a reason for that.The photos and the hashtag #MeAt14 sparked conversations on social media over the weekend about the age of consent, following the sexual misconduct allegations against Alabama senate candidate Roy Moore.He's accused of having sexual contact with a 14-year-old when he was 32 years old.The Washington Post first reported the accusations on Thursday after interviews with more than 30 people.#MeAt14 I worshipped my brother.I loved my dog, Pucci.I loved OMD.I had Big hair.I was happy.I was innocent.Please share your #MeAt14.pic.twitter.com/ccPyVHgcVS Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) November 12, 2017 #MeAt14 aimed to raise awareness about why the age of consent is important -- because at 14, girls and boys are still growing up, dealing with trauma, with evolving sexuality and the stresses of adolescence.#MeAt14 A CHILD.Nothing more.Any man who thinks otherwise should be locked up.pic.twitter.com/dMQDu4MsW4 christine (@Masta1Christine) November 13, 2017 Not old enough to drive.Not old enough to work without a permit.Not old enough to see an R-rated movie.Not old enough to consent.#MeAt14 pic.twitter.com/1XgbbiyO7o Mary Ann Campbell (@Memberberryvine) November 12, 2017 Some women pointed out that although the hashtag focused on painting the picture of innocence that exists at age 14, older people should know better regardless of how someone is dressed or acting.The #MeAt14 stories seem to focus on how innocent everyone looks.At 14 I was exploring my sexuality, wearing revealing clothes, & pushing boundaries.Regardless, it's the responsibility of adults not to prey on children, no matter how they act or look.c a i t l i n (@hello__caitlin) November 12, 2017 Many stories described lives already affected by abuse by age 14.This is #MeAt14 , having already been abused by a grown man.I'm lost.Battling anorexia, bulimia, insomnia, low self esteem, I've already begun drinking.This is what the aftermath of sexual abuse looks like.#NoMoore pic.twitter.com/D9loYOAJZp Laura Parrott Perry (@lparrottperry) November 13, 2017
Professor resigns after allegations he sexually abused minors as a priest:::::(CNN) A professor at Arizona State University has resigned after allegations that he sexually abused at least three minors when he was a priest.James "Jaime" Lara was ordained as a priest in 1973 and served in the church until 1992 when he was removed him from active ministry.In a statement last week , the Diocese of Brooklyn included him in a list of those who had been "dispensed from the clerical state."The decree was issued by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, "which is the Vatican office authorized to deal with cases involving sexual abuse of minors by a cleric."After he was barred from the church, Lara went on to teach at many prominent universities, according to his curriculum vitae He had been a research professor at Arizona State University since 2013.Read More
New plague cases declining in Madagascar, but 9 countries remain on alert:::::Story highlights 165 people have died and more than 2,000 infected with plague in Madagascar Since mid-October, the number of new cases has been on the decline (CNN) The plague outbreak in Madagascar is continuing to slow, but nine countries neighboring the island nation are on alert in case the infection reaches their borders.Since the outbreak began in August, 165 people have died and more than 2,000 have become infected with plague as of Wednesday.Of those infections, 77% were clinically diagnosed as pneumonic -- or pulmonary -- plague, a form of the infection that can spread from person to person.Plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and is typically spread through the bite of infected fleas, which are frequently carried by rats, causing bubonic plague.Pneumonic plague is more virulent or damaging and is an advanced form characterized by a severe lung infection.The infection can be transmitted via airborne droplets from coughs and sneezes.Read More

most of the skin on his body.He has epidermolysis bullosa, a rare genetic skin disease that causes blisters and skin erosion.The skin of his arms, legs, back and flanks, and some of the skin on his stomach, neck and face was missing or severely affected due to epidermolysis bullosa.The compassionate-use experimental treatment is detailed in a case study published in the journal Nature on Wednesday.'Butterfly child' Skin as fragile as a butterfly's wings -- that's how children with epidermolysis bullosa are described and why they're often called butterfly children.The disease, of which there are five major types and at least 31 subtypes, is incurable.People with the condition have a defect in the protein-forming genes necessary for skin regeneration.About 500,000 people worldwide are affected by forms of the disease.More than 40% of patients die before reaching adolescence.Their skin can blister and erode due to something as simple as bumping into something or even the light friction of clothing, according to an email from Dr. Jouni Uitto, a professor and chairman of the Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Biology at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College in Philadelphia.Uitto was not involved with this study.Epidermolysis bullosa makes the skin incredibly susceptible to infections, and in the case of 7-year-old Hassan, whose treatment was detailed in Nature, those infections can be life-threatening.A week after he was born in Syria, Hassan had a blister on his back, his father said through an interpreter in an interview provided by the hospital in Germany where the boy was treated.Hassan's last name, as well as the first names of his family members, are not being disclosed to protect the privacy of the family.In his first few weeks of life, Hassan was immediately diagnosed with epidermolysis bullosa, and their doctor in Syria told Hassan's family that there was no cure or therapy.Over the years, their efforts to find help for their son's disease led the family to the Muenster University hospital in Germany in 2015, when Hassan was 7.His condition worsened, and he struggled with severe sepsis and a high fever.He weighed just over 37 pounds.They didn't think he would make it, and doctors at Muenster decided in summer 2015 to transfer Hassan to the Ruhr-Universitt Bochum's University Hospitals, including the burn center -- one of the oldest in the country.The search for treatment By the time Hassan arrived at Bochum, he had lost two-thirds of his surface skin."We had a lot of problems in first days just keeping him alive," said Dr. Tobias Rothoeft, consultant at the University Children's Hospital at Katholisches Klinikum Bochum.Doctors tried to promote healing by changing his dressings and treating him with antibiotics, as well as putting him on an aggressive nutrition schedule, but nothing helped.They even tried transplanting skin from Hassan's father."By that time, he had lost 60% of his epidermis, the upper skin layer, and had 60% open wounds all over his body," said Dr. Maximilian Kueckelhaus of the Department of Plastic Surgery at Bochum's Burn Center.Every approach failed, so the doctors prepared Hassan's family for what end-of-life care would entail.But the parents pleaded, asking the doctors to consult studies and research for experimental treatments that might help.They found Dr. Michele De Luca at the University of Modena's Center for Regenerative Medicine in Italy.His publications described an experimental treatment transplanting genetically modified epidermal stem cells that healed small, non-life-threatening wounds in adults.The medical team reached out to De Luca, asking whether he could help them replicate the procedure on a larger scale to help Hassan, and he agreed.De Luca told Hassan's parents that he believed there was a 50% chance of the treatment being successful.They were more than willing to accept the risk, to do anything to help their son have a chance at a normal life.Hassan "was in severe pain and was asking a lot of questions: 'Why do I suffer from this disease?Why do I have to live this life?All children can run around and play.Why am I not allowed to play soccer?'I couldn't answer these questions," his father said."It was a tough decision for us, but we wanted to try for Hassan."Growing sheets of skin To obtain the skin's stem cells, the doctors took a small biopsy -- only accounting for 1 square inches -- from an unaffected part of Hassan's skin.The stem cells were processed by De Luca in Italy.A healthy version of the gene that is normally defective in epidermolysis bullosa patients was added to the cells, along with retroviral vectors: virus particles that assist the gene transfer.This genetic transfer would essentially "correct" the cells.The single cells were grown and cultivated on plastic and fibrin substrate, which is used to treat large skin burns, to form a large piece of epidermis.This method enabled the researchers to grow as much skin as they needed.The whole process took three to four weeks, Kueckelhaus said.Once the sheets were ready, they were transferred from Italy to Germany and transplanted onto the well-cleaned wounds right away during two surgeries.The first procedure in October 2015 applied the sheets to Hassan's arms and legs.The second surgery, in November, grafted the sheets to Hassan's entire back and the other affected areas.Hassan began to improve immediately.The researchers noticed that the grafts were not rejected; they bound to all of the areas they were transplanted."For everyone that was involved, taking off the bandages and seeing for the first time that this is working out, that the transplants are actually attached to the patient and growing skin, that's an incredible moment," Kueckelhaus said.Hassan was discharged from the hospital in February 2016.After steady followups over 21 months, the researchers found that Hassan's new skin healed normally, didn't blister anymore, and was resistant to stress.It was even growing hair.Unlike some skin graft patients, he doesn't require any ointment to keep his skin smooth and hydrated.And like any growing kid, he bruises and recovers normally.They also learned that only a few stem cells contribute to the long-term maintenance of the epidermis, shedding light on cellular hierarchy in this regard."The investigators removed of small piece of patient's skin, isolated cells with stem cell potential for growth, introduced a normal copy of the mutated gene to the cells, propagated a large number of these cells in culture and then grafted them back to the skin," Uitto said."This concept is not new, but what is remarkable here is that they were able to change essentially the entire skin of the patient with normal cells."Hassan's family is currently living in Germany.Hassan, now 9, is able to go to school and play sports, but he maintains a schedule of frequent monitoring at the hospital to ensure that the initial success of the treatment continues.The area of his skin that was not treated sometimes shows small blisters, and if it worsens, he may receive transplants there as well."Seeing him 18 months after the initial surgery with an intact skin is incredible because he has been in the ICU for so long," Kueckelhaus said."He had bandages all over his body except his hands, feet and face.He was on extremely strong pain medication.So the quality of life was really, really bad for him.Seeing him play soccer, play sports, play with other kids, that is just amazing because that's something he couldn't do before.""It felt like a dream for us," the boy's father said."Hassan feels like a normal person now.He plays.He's being active.He loves life."A future treatment?Everything points to a good long-term outcome for Hassan.The researchers will continue to monitor him for complications.Sometimes, genetic modifications can cause malignancies in cells."That is of course one thing we really have to be aware of," Kueckelhaus said."However, analyzing the integration profile of that gene into the boy's DNA, which we did, we saw that it's mostly in areas that don't cause too much concern about developing malignancies."Epidermolysis bullosa patients can be at a very high risk of developing skin cancer simply because of the disease.Because Hassan now has intact skin and intact DNA, this risk might even decrease, but that will have to be proved through follow-up, Kueckelhaus said.Given that this was one successful outcome for one patient, the experimental treatment can't be applied for other patients just yet.De Luca is conducting clinical trials using the treatment."This is one case with a distinct type of EB, and further studies will show whether this approach is applicable to other forms of EB as well," Uitto said."It should be noted that in some severe forms of EB, the patients also suffer from fragility of the gastrointestinal and vesico-urinary tract, and some forms are associated with the development of muscular dystrophy.Obviously, gene therapy of the skin cannot correct them, and these issues have to be addressed in further studies."Hassan's treatment also cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.Although the process could be optimized, doctors would still have to individually grow transplants for each patient, which could get very expensive.But for patients' families, epidermolysis bullosa is already expensive."Standard maintenance treatment of patients with EB, including daily bandaging, antibiotics and special moisturizer, as well as frequent hospitalizations, can be extremely costly, and gene correction as described in this paper may well be cost-effective over the lifetime of these patients," Uitto noted.Brett Kopelan, executive director of the Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research Association of America , has a 10-year-old daughter, Rafi, with recessive dystrophic EB.Between January and August, $751,1778 for wound/burn dressings was charged to Kopelan's insurance company, he says.That doesn't account for drugs or hospital visits and surgeries.Kopelan's nonprofit sends free supplies and bandages to families.The nonprofit can provide its employees with insurance that covers the medical equipment, but that isn't the case for everyone impacted by the condition, he said.Kopelan is hopeful about the results of the study.The baths and bandage changes that are necessary for epidermolysis bullosa patients to stave off life-threatening infections can last hours and feel torturous.Follow CNN Health on

think of 60% of body being an open wound, and opioids don't really work for this kind of pain," Kopelan wrote in an email."This is what make EB kids and adults the strongest people on Earth."The study "confirms our hopes that gene therapy is potentially the most efficacious path forward to providing a significant treatment option for those with epidermolysis bullosa," Kopelan said."While it's important to remember that this is only one patient and more work needs to be done to demonstrate how effective this gene therapy platform may prove to be, I am very enthused.""I wish that all children with the same disease could be treated in this way," Hassan's father said.
Sex rarely causes hearts to stop, research says:::::(CNN) It's a familiar scene in TV melodramas: Mid-intercourse, an older man collapses, clutching his heart.Yet sex and sudden cardiac arrest rarely happen together, according to preliminary research presented Sunday at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2017."On average in the US, only 10% or less actually survive a cardiac arrest," said Dr. Sumeet Chugh, senior author of the study and a professor of medicine at Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles.'A wonderful answer' For the study, Chugh and his colleagues examined the lifetime medical records of all the adults who died of sudden cardiac arrest in Portland, Oregon, from 2002 through 2015.The study needed data from an area with a large number of people, he explained.If you follow 5,000 to 10,000 people for a year, he said, "only five or six of them will have a heart arrest.The numbers are too small.So the concept that I was fortunate enough to introduce in Portland, Oregon, was to treat the entire community as the study subjects."Chugh and his team relied on interviews with paramedics, who have been trained to find out exactly what happened, as opposed to searching death certificates, which use codes that sometimes fail to capture cardiac arrest."We learn from the medics.They tell us who had a cardiac arrest, and then we go back to the time that they were born, and we get their entire records," Chugh said.When possible, the researchers talked to survivors as well.Of the 4,557 sudden cardiac arrests identified during the study period, the researchers classified all those that occurred during or within an hour of sex as related to the act itself: 34 cases, or 0.7%.Of these, 32 were men.Among men then, 1% of the total cardiac arrest cases were triggered by sex, while for women it was 0.1%.The age range of the patients who suffered arrest during sex was 34 to 83.Heart problems and medications were common among the group.Only a third received cardiopulmonary resuscitation."If this devastating event does occur, the partner should not hesitate to perform CPR since it will potentially increase the chances of survival," Chugh said.Overall, the question of whether having sex might be dangerous to heart patients is one that "needed to be answered," said Dr. Michael J. Ackerman, a professor of medicine, pediatrics and pharmacology at the Mayo Clinic who was not involved in the study."And it's a wonderful answer for those who love sex."Putting partners' minds at ease Heart patients often wonder what activities they can safely resume after a cardiac event."They always ask about exercise and how active they can become," Ackerman said."They almost never ask directly about sex, but they're always wondering about that."Bring up the topic, and "the floodgates open."The anxiety is often tremendous, especially for the partner, he said."They're picturing the fatal event is going to happen if he becomes active again sexually."Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Three years ago, Ackerman published a similar study that looked at genetic heart disease patients.He and his colleagues showed that when the genetic condition is diagnosed and treated, sex seldom triggers a cardiac arrest."I think it's important to healthy relationships to have this anxiety lifted," he said.Chugh has expanded his study to include the 850,000 residents of Ventura County, California.The focus there is to identify better ways of predicting and preventing sudden cardiac arrest in Latinos, an understudied group, he said."In the big picture, it is rare for sexual intercourse to be a trigger for sudden cardiac arrest," he said.
The right (and wrong) way to apologize:::::(CNN) There is a right way and a wrong way to apologize, psychologists say.Over the course of the past two weeks, we've seen two high-profile examples that fall somewhere in between.On October 29, actor Anthony Rapp accused actor Kevin Spacey of making sexual advances toward him at a party in 1986.Rapp was 14 at the time; Spacey was 26.The story was originally reported by BuzzFeed News The following day, Spacey posted a statement on Twitter that read, in part, "I'm beyond horrified to hear this story.I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago.But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years."Spacey then pivoted from the serious allegations against him to confirming a longstanding rumor about his sexual orientation."I have had relationships with both men and women," he wrote."I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I choose now to live as a gay man."On Thursday, five women accused Louis C.K.of sexual misconduct ; two said the actor and comedian undressed and masturbated in front of them in a hotel room in 2002.The story was first reported by The New York Times C.K.issued a statement Friday that began, "I want to address the stories told to the New York Times by five women named Abby, Rebecca, Dana, Julia who felt able to name themselves and one who did not.These stories are true."Though both Spacey and C.K.'s statements acknowledged at least potential wrongdoing, they did so very differently.Spacey said he has "a lot of respect and admiration" for his accuser.He claimed to not remember the encounter, arguing that he was drunk and that it was a long time ago.Spacey did, however, employ the word "apology."Nowhere do the words "apology" or "sorry" appear in C.K.'s statement, but he too addressed his accusers by name.He also took responsibility for his actions -- no "ifs," "ands" or "buts."He acknowledged the lessons he's learned about the complexities of power (being admired by younger comedians) and expressed remorse.C.K.concluded his statement by writing, "I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want.I will now step back and take a long time to listen."How to say 'I'm sorry' "Comprehensive apologies are powerful tools that transgressors can use to promote reconciliation with the people they have hurt," psychologist Karina Schumann wrote in a 2014 study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology ."However, because many apology elements require transgressors to admit fault, express shameful emotions and promise change, transgressors often avoid these threatening elements and instead choose to use more perfunctory apologies or even defensive strategies."Schumann, who is now an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh , says there are three "core" elements of a good apology: Express remorse, by saying "I'm sorry" or "I apologize," as well as regret, by saying "I feel terrible" or "I regret it."Accept responsibility by stating, "I take full responsibility" or "I'm truly sorry for" whatever you did.Offer to repair the problem you caused by saying what you will do to fix it or by telling the person you've hurt how you honestly feel about them.If appropriate, Schumann says, an apology may require additional elements: An explanation of your words or actions.A promise that you will behave better in the future.Acknowledgment that you understand how your victim has suffered.Admission of wrongdoing, such as "It was wrong of me to say the things I said" or "I shouldn't have spoken poorly about you."A request for forgiveness.Equally important to what you do or say is what you don't do or don't say.Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter."Transgressors may ... try to protect themselves from the negative consequences of committing an offense by responding with defensive strategies," Schumann said."These defensive strategies can be temporarily beneficial to the transgressor by helping restore his or her self-worth but may do so at the cost of aggravating the victim and hindering reconciliation."Four things, she says, can torpedo even those most well-intentioned apologies: Justifying your words or actions by defending your behavior: "I'm sorry that I kicked you out, but I did it for the right reasons."Blaming your victim for any or all of what you did or said: "If you gave me more freedom, I wouldn't feel the need to be dishonest."Making excuses: "I was busy and in a hurry."Minimizing or downplaying the consequences of your actions: "I'm sorry if I upset you"; "it's in the past"; "it was just a joke.""One of the unfortunate certainties of life is that we sometimes hurt people we care about," Schumann wrote."But if managed well, hurtful events can be transformed into constructive experiences that might even improve the relationship between the transgressor and the victim."
A force for change: Coping with grief through activism and advocacy:::::(CNN) Every tragedy, big or small, leaves behind victims and loved ones whose lives are inalterably changed.In some cases, survivors find themselves driven to become activists or advocates, finding meaning in the tragedy by fighting whatever caused it.There are many examples making headlines all over the country.Chris Hurst was an evening news anchor at WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia, when his girlfriend, Alison Parker, a reporter, and her cameraman, Adam Ward, were shot and killed during a live interview one morning in August 2015 Eventually, Hurst left his spot at the anchor desk, inspired to run for office and address some of the issues that led to Parker's death -- though he stresses he's not a single-issue candidate, and gun control wasn't a focus during his campaign.Also this week, the uncle of Philando Castile -- a black man killed by a police officer last year during a traffic stop -- became a reserve officer in St. Paul, Minnesota .He plans to help be the change he wanted in the department and his community.Mary Fetchet, a clinical social worker who lives in New Canaan, Connecticut, lost her son, Brad, in the terror attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.When she visited the family assistance center in New York City, set up to provide aid to victims' families, Fetchet said she was "struck by the magnitude of the event, seeing thousands of families coming from around the country and around the world."It was that experience, in part, that led Fetchet to start Voices of September 11th , an organization that works to provide resources to, and address the needs of, September 11 survivors, first responders and victims' families."When I think about how it's changed my life, I almost see my life in two chapters," Fetchet told CNN."Before 9/11 and after 9/11."But what drove these people, in the midst of their grief, to try to be the force for change?Making sense of the insensible David Kessler, an author, grief expert and founder of Grief.com, told CNN that these families have undergone what he calls the sixth stage of grief: "Finding meaning.""We come away from something so devastating that we go, 'The story just can't end this way,'" Kessler said."Their life needed to matter, and their death needed to have some meaning, so for many people, that spurs us into action."Dr. Robin Gurwitch, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University who has spent most of her career studying the effects of trauma on children, agreed with Kessler's assessment that some people who deal with a traumatic, insensible loss are looking to find meaning in their suffering.In the aftermath of a traumatic loss, Gurwitch said, people ask themselves, "What are some things I can do to honor the life of the person that's no longer here?"Sometimes that's done by drawing attention to the things that caused the traumatic death, she said.There are those like John Walsh , who founded the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and started the TV show, "America's Most Wanted," after the abduction of his 6-year-old son, Adam, in 1981.Walsh now hosts CNN's "The Hunt with John Walsh."More recently, Mothers of the Movement , a group of mothers who have lost their children to police violence, are advocating for reform at the cross section of race and policing.During the 2016 Democratic National Convention, they stumped for Hillary Clinton.But Gurwitch points to the families of children killed in December 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary as examples of people who have made sense of their children's deaths by using their experience to help others.Many of those families started a foundation, she said, focusing on a different piece of what contributed to the loss of their child.Such causes "help in terms of recovery and resilience," Gurwitch said, but "there's still going to be those times that are going to be challenging, that are going to be hard."Memorializing their loved ones When people are pushed into advocacy or social work as a result of a traumatic loss, part of the benefit for those affected is in keeping busy, but it's also a way to memorialize their loved ones, explained Joanne Cacciatore, an associate research professor at Arizona State University who studies traumatic grief."In my research, one of the reasons that parents most want to get active in volunteering and doing things has to do with remembering, honoring and making sure that the world doesn't forget -- not only this terrible thing that happened, but also the beautiful person (that was lost)," she said.In 1996, two years after her own daughter died, Cacciatore started the MISS Foundation , which offers support to families who have experienced the death of a child.The foundation and "random acts of kindness" were the best way to remember her daughter, she said."For me, really, compassion was the most powerful thing," Cacciatore said."It just felt like that was the only way I would survive it."Helping others through their experience Cacciatore isn't alone in feeling that her ability to help others helped her.Some people benefit from altruistic acts, like reaching out to others after a loss, Gurwitch said."We know that when people are really struggling, even though you're hurting, if you reach out and try to help someone, it helps you do better," she said.It could be as simple as writing a letter to first responders in your community who were first on the scene of the tragedy, or something as big as creating a foundation to change how the public considers gun control or mental health services, Gurwitch said.Fetchet, whose son was killed in the 9/11 attacks, said that because of her background in social work, she felt she was "in a unique position, because I had an understanding of the impact of traumatic events.""I almost felt like I had an opportunity and a responsibility to make a difference," she said.'Creating a new future' Kessler, who dealt with the loss of his 21-year-old son more than a year ago, said the people who are able to move forward and find meaning in their loss are the ones who are "creating a new future.""That loss can paralyze you," he said."But it can also help you grow in ways that you never thought."Fetchet echoed this sentiment.As awful as losing Brad was, his death prompted a change in her life's work, and she's proud of the "great strides" she and others affiliated with the Voices of September 11th have been able to make in developing the 9/11 memorial and providing help to victims of the tragedy."The loss of my son has had a profound impact on me," Fetchet told CNN."It was certainly a life-changing event that in a sense expanded my life's journey, personally and professionally."
Why men use masturbation to harass women:::::It isn't a physical assault, and it doesn't necessarily involve men using sexual language.Instead, a powerful man masturbates in front of unwilling women made to witness the act."At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first," the statement said."But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn't a question.It's a predicament for them."Last month, several women accused Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of masturbating in front of them.Weinstein denied "any allegations of non-consensual sex," a spokeswoman said.Four women said journalist Mark Halperin , when he was at ABC News, masturbated in front of another employee in his office.Halperin denies the allegation.Director and producer Brett Ratner is accused of masturbating in front of actress Olivia Munn, as well as other misconduct.Ratner denied the allegations outlined in the report to CNN through his attorney, Martin Singer.Screenwriter and director James Toback is also accused of sexual harassment, including masturbating in front of actresses, according to the Los Angeles Times.He told the paper he had never met any of the women -- or if he did meet them, it "was for five minutes and (he had) no recollection."CNN has not independently confirmed the women's stories.What could be going on in the minds of powerful men who feel the urge to masturbate in front of women in a professional or professionally connected setting?The scientific literature doesn't say much about this particular kind of behavior.It does, however, address exhibitionist disorder: Someone acts on an urge to display, fondle or stimulate themselves in front of a stranger.The disorder is one of the paraphilias, defined by science as "recurrent, intense, sexually arousing fantasies, urges, or behaviors that are distressing or disabling and that involve inanimate objects, children or nonconsenting adults, or suffering or humiliation of oneself or the partner with the potential to cause harm."James Cantor, director of the Toronto Sexuality Centre and an associate professor at the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine, said he treats and has treated many men with all sorts of exhibitionism and other paraphilias, including men who masturbate in this fashion."This is exhibitionism, an extreme form of it," he said."They rarely escalate.The exhibition, the actual displaying of the genitals is the goal."For exhibitionism alone, the behavior can include leaving dirty notes behind for someone to see, flashing someone with and without an erection, or masturbating in front of others.The last, Cantor said, can be very frightening for the victim, because they don't know what's going to happen next."The rules have gone out of the window, and she doesn't know if this will escalate into violence or rape," he said."But for these perpetrators, showing off their genitals is the goal, and they are more interested in that than in hands-on sex."David Ley , a clinical psychologist and author of "The Myth of Sex Addiction," said it is hard to know what motivates someone to do this."We oftentimes want to take this kind of sexual behavior and separate it out like a thread from a rope and pretend that we can evaluate and understand this sexual behavior separate from everything else.We really can't," Ley said.It's hard to know, he said, "if the exhibitionism is the whole point or is the exhibitionist behavior just part of the bigger picture."Dr. Prudence Gourguechon, a Chicago psychiatrist and past president of the American Psychoanalytic Association, said that in all her years of practice, she has dealt with many clients who have had challenging sexual behavior, but she has never had a client talk about this particular issue.She thinks, however, that the problem comes from a kind of "wish to be looked at and admired."Cantor agrees.He makes the analogy of a peacock that wants to display his prowess."We don't actually know what causes it.Some clients will spend a large amount of therapy trying to find out what causes it," Cantor said."As a group, they are, more than anything else, confused.They only know they are different, and they don't understand why the rest of us don't do it, too."Gourguechon thinks there may be something calculated in this choice of sexual harassment."It could also be a kind of strange plausible deniability," she said."It's a kind of disavowal, a kind of pernicious defense mechanism that allows a man to know that he did something on one level, but they are essentially telling themselves a story that they are not doing anything so bad.He could think to himself, 'Well, I didn't rape anyone,' which is true in the broader sense, but it is a twisted defense."All of the men making headlines for masturbation were in a position of power or authority, raising the question: Is this behavior a form of power-crazy aggression?Not exactly, Cantor said.Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter."It's more like privilege," he said, because their position allows the men to get away with it."And because they are able to get away with it," he said, "it's fertilized enough to grow further out of control.The side effect of being powerful is that they can spiral that much further before they are caught."Louis C.K.addressed the issue of power in his statement: "The power I had over these women is that they admired me.And I wielded that power irresponsibly," he wrote."I also took advantage of the fact that I was widely admired in my and their community, which disabled them from sharing their story and brought hardship to them when they tried because people who look up to me didn't want to hear it.I didn't think that I was doing any of that because my position allowed me not to think about it.

Disneyland shuts down cooling towers over Legionnaires' cases:::::Story highlights The 12 patients are between ages 52 and 94 One patient who had not visited the park died (CNN) Disneyland Park has shut down two cooling towers at its park in Southern California following an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease.Orange County health officials said nine people who visited the Anaheim theme park in September developed the disease.An additional three people who had been to Anaheim but not Disneyland got sick, said Jessica Good, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Health Care Agency (OCHCA).One patient, who had not visited the park and had additional health issues, died, she said.The 12 patients are between ages 52 and 94, and 10 were hospitalized, she said.According to Dr. Pamela Hymel, chief medical officer for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, the towers were shut down after Disney was contacted by the county health care agency on October 27 about increased Legionnaires' cases in Anaheim.Read More
Breathing in Delhi air equivalent to smoking 44 cigarettes a day:::::New Delhi (CNN) It was early on Tuesday morning when residents in the Indian capital of Delhi first began to notice the thick white haze that had descended across the city.Initially viewed as a mild irritant, by mid-week its debilitating effects were evident to all, as the city struggled to adapt to the new eerie, martian-like conditions brought about by the pollution.With visibility severely reduced, trains have been canceled, planes delayed and cars have piled into each other, with multiple traffic accidents reported across the city.The sense that this is now a city under siege has been enhanced by the unusually far-reaching actions of the Delhi government The Delhi government has suspended all civic construction projects as part of several emergency measures intended to help tackle the pollution crisis.On Tuesday afternoon, city chiefs closed all public and private schools, requesting instead that the city's tens of thousands of school-aged children remain indoors; on Wednesday, they banned incoming trucks and halted civil construction projects; while on Thursday, they announced new plans to begin implementing a partial ban on private car use as of next week.Read More
The risks of crowdsourcing kids' screen decisions:::::Go Ask Your Dad is parenting advice with a philosophical bent as one dad explores what we want out of life, for ourselves and our children, through useful paradigms and best practices.Share your insight at the CNN Parenting Facebook page.(CNN) Months ago, my daughter -- age 9 at the time -- came to my wife and me with a plea to download the app Musical.ly , which was all the rage among her classmates.It basically enables you to share your own music videos to popular songs.She reassured me that we could limit the people she shared with to "just friends."And as she described it, the app sounded creative and fun to her, and safe to me.Besides, she added, "everyone else has it."It's not the most convincing childhood argument, but it's one that is effective too often in this age of screen-time saturation and parental crowdsourced decision-making.Go Ask Your Dad is parenting advice with a philosophical bent as one dad explores what we want out of life, for ourselves and our children, through useful paradigms and best practices.It considers old problems in new ways, and new problems that previous generations didn't face.But I wasn't buying it, literally.I told her I'd have to research the app and started with the website Common Sense Media .I've been relying on the nonprofit's reviews of screen media since we started showing our daughter movies at the age of 4.(Full disclosure: I now serve on the advisory board of Common Sense News, and CNN occasionally runs Common Sense content.)The site gave Musical.ly an age rating of "16+," pointing out that it is essentially a social network, and "some families have encountered explicit sexual material despite the available settings and controls in the app."Normally, that would be enough for me say no to my daughter, but she had already argued that the site was wrong if it said 9 years old was too young.She'd been on Musical.ly on her friends' phones and seen nothing that made her uncomfortable.I trust her judgment, so I sought out more information.I read other internet commentary, signed up for the app myself and stayed up after she went to bed to try it out.Within minutes, I saw sexual images in profiles, in homemade videos and in comments that all made the site feel a lot more mature than my daughter.Feeling defensive that I was about to give a parenting "no" in the face of what seemed like so much "yes," I went on Facebook and explained myself.Here is why I said 'no' on this new popular thing everyone my daughter's age seems to be doing, I wrote, giving three reasons: I found sexual content in user profiles and videos, without trying very hard.There was easy, direct exposure to strangers.Adult strangers.And I found no way to filter out those first two items, even with privacy settings on.The privacy settings seemed to only reduce other risks.In fairness to Musical.ly, the app's terms and conditions say as much.Signup requires users to be age 13 and older, but user age is self-reported and something parents can restrict only for app downloads at the device level.A little more digging revealed that the basis for that seemingly arbitrary age cutoff (a common one for websites and apps) is a 1998 law titled the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act that details the responsibilities of developers to protect online privacy and safety of kids under age 13.Website operators reduce their legal culpability by putting that age cutoff in their terms and conditions.I reached out to Musical.ly to ask them what measures they are taking to address the inappropriate content I saw, and they pointed me to their parent Q&A page , which explains that choosing a private account means the only people who can message you are those from whom you accept a follow request.And as for explicit profile pictures in those follow requests, or in the public videos or in the comments to videos, the parents page explains that they can all be reported for moderation and possible removal.I already knew about these safety measures and felt they weren't good enough for my daughter.I decided to heed Musical.ly's advice and not allow my under-age-13 child to use the app.She was upset when I gave her the verdict the next day over breakfast.She explained that the root of her sadness was being unable to contribute to lunchtime conversations about the app.My heart tore a bit when she added, through tears, "all I can do is just repeat the few things I know about it."She simply wanted to fit in.But I explained to her that an important part of my job as a parent is to do everything I can to keep her safe.And because she trusts that I've got her back in all things, my permission to use social media brings with it the assumption that it is a safe thing for her to do.It's my job to decide whether to open a door to a given experience or keep it closed for the time being.Musical.ly wasn't the first, nor will it be the last, time my wife and I will decide about doors.And we won't always do so for her.Soon enough, she will be largely making these decisions for herself.I know I can't filter out all of the potentially harmful, confusing or age-inappropriate stuff that comes her way.(Nor can I fully outsource that filtering to software and search filters, as a recent New York Times story reminds us.)But I do have the opportunity now to be thoughtful about these decisions and show her how I make them and what I value.When it's time for her to take over, she'll at least have a model from which to start.That is more important to her well-being over time than a couple of awkward school lunches.It is hard to stay anywhere near abreast of the technology our kids are engaging with.If I read every Term & Condition I ever signed, I'd have time for little else.And there isn't much generational and historic wisdom to rely on as we cross this frontier.So we need to rely on our own judgment.We need to be present to see what they're up to.And we can seek help from peers (and, thankfully, sites such as Common Sense Media) to sort it out.We will all have different ideas of what's appropriate, but it's the conversation and deliberation that's important.And the flipside of social media is that it gives us a great forum with which to engage in it.Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.A couple of days after delivering the bad news on Musical.ly, I checked in with my daughter.Some of her friends' parents had deleted the app from their phones.(Maybe after reading a certain Facebook post?)It was yesterday's news.She asked about a different one, Animal Jam.A year earlier, I'd deemed the privacy controls insufficient, but the developer had improved the protections since, so I gave it the green light.And until something else came along, she happily and securely animal jammed, knowing that I had her back.
Herpes and other germs lurking on makeup:::::A woman in the US is suing a cosmetics store because she claims that she caught herpes from their lipstick tester.In case you're wondering if this is even possible, as a microbiologist, I can tell you that it most certainly is.And it's not just herpes that can lurk in makeup.But let's look at herpes first.This very common virus is mainly spread by skin-to-skin contact, kissing and sex, but it can also be transmitted in droplets of spit left by an infected person on towels, cups, cutlery and, yes, lipstick.Globally, it's estimated that 67% of people are infected with the Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1).But it's a hidden enemy -- a person doesn't need to have visible signs of the virus to spread the infection.The virus lives in facial tissues where it can shed and spread.It doesn't always show up on the skin as a blister immediately after it has infected a person, instead it can stay hidden and appear after a few months.Because of this, it's impossible to say with certainty if the American woman caught herpes from this particular store tester, or elsewhere.Herpes causes blisters on the lips and around the mouth that can last up to ten days.Lipsticks and makeup brushes that touch these parts of the face can then spread the infection to other people.Fortunately, herpes is a fragile virus and typically only survives outside the body for ten seconds.But it can survive longer in warm and moist environments, such as in sweat.It can also survive between two to four hours on plastic, chrome and water, so there are lots of ways the virus can spread.There is no cure for a herpes infection, although treatments are available that will reduce the length of infection.An old problem Microbiologists have known about the link between beauty products and pathogens since the mid-1940s when talcum powder contaminated with Clostridium tetani bacteria caused the death of a newborn baby Since the 1960s, contamination linked to other opportunistic pathogens, including Salmonella, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , has been reported by microbiologists across the globe.Cosmetic products contain preservatives to help slow down the growth of microbes, but they can become contaminated if people use non-sterile applicators or fingers to apply products, or if the products are poorly handled and stored; for example, products stored in warm and humid or damp conditions such as the bathroom.Makeup brushes also have the potential to act as suitable homes for bacteria to thrive.Often, beauty blenders and brushes are dampened to help the application of eyeshadows or foundation.But this environment has the potential to promote rapid bacterial growth.In 2015, it was reported that a 27-year-old Australian woman became paralysed after contracting an MRSA infection that attacked her spine.She used a brush to apply makeup that belonged to a friend who had a Staphylococcus infection on her face, and became contaminated with the organism.Staphylococcus is a common bacteria that doesn't typically cause harm and lives on the skin or in the nose.However, MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is an antibiotic-resistant strain of Staphylococcus.Irreversible blindness Mascara wands and eyeliners not only beautify the eyes, but can cause irritation and conjunctivitis, caused by both bacteria and viruses, including herpes simplex.Studies have revealed that 43% of eyeliners and mascara wands contain contaminants.I know many friends who have been left with a "pink eye" after sharing mascara or using ancient mascara that has been sitting in their makeup bags.Symptoms of pink eye include redness, watery discharge and, in extreme cases, irreversible blindness.Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Lashes aren't just there to make us look pretty, they serve to block out dirt and bacteria, and using products on the eyes can cause contamination of the product.With time, bacteria can build up in the cosmetic container increasing the risk of eye infection every time the product is used.If all of these horror stories tell us one thing, it's stay away from sharing makeup products, both among your friends and especially in cosmetic stores.You just don't know what infections other people could be carrying on their skin.Always keep your own cosmetic products clean and use single applicators where possible.You wouldn't share your toothbrush with strangers, so why make an exception with your cosmetics?
How to resist technology addiction:::::Son won't turn off his video game?Daughter obsessed with "likes" on Instagram?It may not be entirely their fault.Like the high-octane sugar in a pint of Ben & Jerry's and that irresistible chemical spice in Flamin' Hot Cheetos, the ingredients in social media, video games, apps, and other digital products are carefully engineered to keep you coming back for more.While researchers are still trying to discover whether kids (and parents) can be addicted to technology , some computer scientists are revealing their secrets for keeping us hooked.Resisting the urge to check your phone or shut down Netflix after another cliffhanger Stranger Things episode should be a simple matter of self-control.But according to so-called whistleblowers such as Tristan Harris, a computer scientist who founded the Time Well Spent movement, and Adam Alter, author of Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked , we humans are totally overpowered.Features such as app notifications, autoplay -- even "likes" and messages that self-destruct -- are scientifically proven to compel us to watch/check in/respond right now or feel that we're missing something really important Behind the apps, games, and social media is a whole crew of folks whose job is to make their products feel essential.Many of the techniques they use are ones outlined by experts in human behavior, including Nir Eyal author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and BJ Fogg of Stanford University's Persuasive Technology Lab.Harris argues that these methods "hijack" our own good judgment.Most teens care deeply about peer validation, for example.So it makes sense that friends' feedback on social media -- both the positive and the negative -- would tug at you until you satisfy your curiosity.You have a phone in your pocket, so why not check now?And now.And now?What do the big tech companies say to the criticism that they're designing addictive products?They typically give the business argument , that they're creating products people love to use and are constantly trying to improve people's experience ( Facebook says it polls users daily to gauge success).But soon it may be hard for the tech giants to say that they're blameless.More and more industry insiders -- including some who designed these attention-claiming features -- are coming forward to cry foul on digital manipulation and even to suggest ways companies can limit it.In fact, it's not just people who are going public.In 2017, a leaked Facebook internal memo showed how the social network can identify when teens feel "insecure," "worthless," and "need a confidence boost."That's not a problem "likes" can fix.There is a way to fight back.Thanks to the folks who are calling out these methods, you can spot specific tricks and reflect on how they affect your thoughts and behavior.Remember: The other side wants to reduce the time between your thoughts and actions.Putting that pause in will help you resist your urges.Below are some of the key features designed to keep their grips on you.Also check out some ideas you and your kids can use to resist temptation.Autoplay.Most notable on Netflix and Facebook, autoplay is the feature that makes videos continue to stream even after they're over.Tristan Harris calls this the "bottomless bowl" phenomenon.With a refilling bowl, people eat Most notable on Netflix and Facebook, autoplay is the feature that makes videos continue to stream even after they're over.Tristan Harris calls this the "bottomless bowl" phenomenon.With a refilling bowl, people eat 73 percent more calories .Or they binge-watch way too many movies.What to do.Autoplay is typically on by default, so you have to turn it off.The feature can usually be found in the app's account Settings.Here's how to turn it off in Netflix.Notifications.Studies show that push notifications -- those little pings and prods you get to check your apps -- are habit-forming.They align an Studies show that push notifications -- those little pings and prods you get to check your apps -- are habit-forming.They align an external trigger (the ping) with an internal trigger (a feeling of boredom, uncertainty, insecurity, etc.).Every app uses them, but some, such as Musical.ly and YouTube, have discovered that when notifications tells us to do something, such as "Watch Sally's new video!"or "See who liked your post!"we respond immediately.These calls to action not only interrupt us, they cause stress.What to do.Turn them off.Most devices have a Settings section where you can turn off notifications.You should also be able to turn off notifications in the app's settings.Snapchat's Snapstreaks.A Snapstreak begins after two users send snaps (pictures) to each other for three days straight.You might think competition is the motivation behind Snapstreaks, but it's more likely due to a psychological theory called the A Snapstreak begins after two users send snaps (pictures) to each other for three days straight.You might think competition is the motivation behind Snapstreaks, but it's more likely due to a psychological theory called the rule of reciprocation .Humans have a need to respond to a positive action with another positive action.Voil, a Snapstreak is born.Kids can become so obsessed with sustaining a streak that they give their friends access to their accounts when they're unable to maintain their own streaks (which is actually a privacy risk).The rule is also at play with "like backs" -- when you like someone's post and ask them to like yours back to bolster your total number of likes.Of course, companies exploit the rule of reciprocation because more data points for them means more opportunities to understand their users and try to sell them stuff.What to do.Help kids understand how companies like Snapchat are using their (positive) desire to be nice to their friends to get them to use their product more.If your kid's streaks are getting out of control, try allowing one time per day that your kid can send snaps, for example, after they take out the garbage, clean their room, and finish their homework.Finally, if your kids' streaks are merely annoying and not harmful, you may need to ride out this phase until your kids go on to something new.Randomness.If you knew that Instagram updated your feed at precisely 3 p.m. every day, that's when you'd check in, right?But that won't keep you glued to your phone.Instead, social media companies use what's called "variable rewards."This

Despite reforms, sexual assault survivors face systemic barriers in India:::::New Delhi (CNN) When 25-year old Kajal went to the police station to file a complaint that two men had raped her, she says she was beaten by the police.Later, when she went to a government hospital for a medical examination, she says the doctor asked her: "Why did you go out alone?"Yet Kajal, a young woman from Neemuch district in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, says she is not angry."There is no purpose in anger," she tells CNN, but she is scared.Kajal is using a pseudonym out of fear for her safety.Her case is one of the 21 cases that form the basis of a new report by Human Rights Watch (HRW), detailing whether reforms on sexual assault policies in India have had any effect.Five years after a gang rape in Delhi that shocked the world, the HRW investigation finds that the country's medical and legal system has not caught up with the changes in the law and regulation.Indian students of Saint Joseph Degree college participate during an anti-rape protest in Hyderabad on September 13, 2013.Kajal's case is not exceptional, said Amu Vinzuda, a program coordinator with Jan Sahas, a social development organization which partnered with HRW on the report.What happened with Kajal often happens when the accused has more status, wealth or power, Sahas said.Kajal is determined to see her rapists punished, but so far that hasn't happened."They destroyed my life," she said, "[but] they didn't spend a single day in jail."JUST WATCHED Facing up to rape in India Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Facing up to rape in India 01:55 Women's safety initiatives Shortly after the 2012 gang rape in which a group of men attacked a young woman named Jyoti Singh Pandey who later died from her injuries, the Indian government strengthened punishments for cases of sexual harassment and assault.This involved increasing the length of prison sentences and adding the death penalty.In addition, the government set up fast-track courts and set up a $480 million budget, known as the Nirbhaya Fund, for new women's safety initiatives.In the nation's capital, there has been some change, thanks to training workshops on the new laws and practices."You see the change in the courtroom in the way things are being conducted," said lawyer Vrinda Grover.But mostly, the reforms are on paper.From the moment a woman approaches a police station, she faces multiple barriers, according to the new report.If the victims are from a poor family, or a lower caste, police may choose not to even register their complaint of sexual assault.Alternatively, there are multiple cases where the police pressured women to settle their complaints for money, HRW's investigation found.Even if police start an investigation, they don't tell families or victims about free legal aid or the monetary compensation they are owed, said Sandhya Gokhale, a founder of Forum Against the Oppression of Women, adding that many are unaware of the new initiatives."A woman is treated only as a witness," Gokhale said."Only after five years, she will be called, until then she will have no idea what happens in her case."JUST WATCHED Police: Indian woman raped twice by same men Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Police: Indian woman raped twice by same men 02:01 The 'two-finger test' New guidelines issued in 2014 on medical care for survivors of sexual assault warned against depending solely on the two-finger test, an exam which supposedly determines whether a woman is used to sex.But a woman is still likely to undergo the test, despite it also coming under criticism in recent years for being scientifically inaccurate and irrelevant to cases of rape.A study of fast-track court judgments in the southern Indian state of Karnataka found that 25% of the judgments explicitly referenced the two-finger test and whether a victim was sexually active, according to the HRW report.Furthermore, only nine out of 29 states have adopted the 2014 guidelines on medical care, according to HRW.Medical care also rarely includes the type of long-term counseling that a survivor of trauma needs And with creating programs on female safety, the Nirbhaya fund remained unspent for the first three years.Now, about 20% of it has been allocated for recommended programs as of 2016, according to Center for Budget and Governance Accountability."There needs to be more resources, monitoring and accountability," said Jayshree Bajoria, the author of the report."That is key to anything working."Women cover their mouths in a 2013 protest against rape in Guwahati, India.Change of mindset If there's been any change, it's been in the community, activists say.Indian civil society organizations have taken the lead in providing victims with initiatives like Why Loiter , where women band together to walk at night, and SafetiPin , an app that allows a user to highlight concerns on a street or a particular neighborhood and share it with others.There's been a change of mindset too, believes Vinzuda, the Jan Sahas activist.Victims are no longer blaming themselves, and their families are starting to support them, she said.After the 2012 rape, millions of Indians took to the streets to protest the flaws in the system.The conversations and the protests continue in 2017.In January, concerned Indians formed a spontaneous protest called #IWillGoOu t in reaction to multiple cases of sexual harassment on the streets of Bangalore over the New Year.More recently, Indians shared their stories of sexual assault as part of the global #MeToo movement."We are not going to live the life of half-citizens anymore" said Grover.
#MeToo helps spark wider conversation around sexual abuse in India:::::New Delhi (CNN) "Me Too, Me Too, Me Too," they said, in Mumbai, Delhi, and Chennai.They were part of the global outpouring of voices, after actress Alyssa Milano called on the public to speak up shortly after sexual assault allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein were made public.A spokeswoman for Weinstein has repeatedly denied allegations "of non-consensual sex."In India, where memories of a horrific gang-rape in 2012 continue to linger , use of the #MeToo hashtag has been widespread, taking over people's Facebook walls, spawning numerous columns and restarting a public conversation about the ongoing sexual abuse of women.For many Indian women, it was an important moment of solidarity and a means of showing the extent and continued pervasiveness of sexual abuse in India."The#MeToo (posts) made it evident how widespread it was, it was different from looking at a statistic or data," said Namita Bhandare, a writer and a columnist with the Hindustan Times."A lot of my (male) friends said 'oh we didn't know, we had no idea it was widespread, and these are fairly enlightened men.'"Others took it as a moment to speak on the systemic cultural reasons that prevent women in India from confronting abuse."For the Indian context, I do believe that it opened things up.There's a lot more women coming out," Bani Rachel Bali, the founder of Krantikali, an organization that works on gender issues, tells CNN."I haven't seen a campaign that started in one corner of the world and replicated all across, so to see something like this really blow up and more than this being an online campaign ...I felt the presence of a sisterhood," she added.Ongoing dialogue In the aftermath of the 2012 gang rape , in which a group of men attacked a young woman named Jyoti Singh Pandey who later died from her injuries, the Indian government strengthened punishments for cases of sexual harassment and assault, increasing the length of prison sentences and adding the death penalty.In addition, the government set up fast-track courts and provided a $480 million budget, known as the Nirbhaya Fund, for creating new women's safety initiatives.Still, activists point to recent crime statistics that show a rise in rape complaints, as proof that sexual abuse is not something that can be simply legislated away.Officially, India recorded more than 34,651 criminal complaints of rape in 2015, the most recent year for which data is available.That marks a 40% rise compared with 2012."Rape is defined as 'izzat lootna' in Hindustani, or robbing one's dignity," wrote actress Richa Chadha on Facebook ."In whatever form one is assaulted, what do you think happens when prejudice like this exists in society -- does it get easier or more difficult to report a gender crime?"More recently, in late September, the issue of mistreatment of women once against came to the fore when a Delhi court overturned the rape conviction of filmmaker Mahmood Farooqui, saying that "a feeble no" could still signal willingness on the part of an alleged victim.Unsubstantiated accusations The outpouring has not been without controversy, however.A few days after the hashtag spread, Raya Sarkar, a graduate student at University of California, Davis, created a crowdsourced list accusing numerous academics at universities in India and in the US, of sexual violence, based, she said, on what victims had told her.In response, many prominent feminists issued a statement saying that, the names on the list, which was published online by Sarkar, were put out there "with no context or explanation.""One or two names of men who have been already found guilty of sexual harassment by due process, are placed on par with unsubstantiated accusations," they wrote."It worries us that anybody can be named anonymously, with lack of answerability."Still, Bhandare said the larger #MeToo movement and "every little conversation" is a step forward."There's no letting up, one doesn't know where the #MeToo movement where it will go," Bhandare said."It's a continuing conversation."
Climbing bounds above more earthly sports:::::Edinburgh (CNN) Athletes typically push themselves beyond barriers and past personal limits.And for competitive climbers, the force they defy is Earth's gravity itself.Climbing is an evolutionary holdover.As our ancestors learned, if the animal trying to kill you is unable to climb a tree or rock, that's where you're safe.That survival skill is rarely called upon in modern life, but it remains in our DNA, often surfacing as a passion among kids and speaking to the innate joy of going up!Competitive climbers never lose that love, even as they struggle to perch on a postage-stamp-size piece of real estate, leap from one egg-size outcrop to another, or scale inch by inch up a sheer wall, then an inverted wall, then a nearly upside-down wall.These spider-men and -women flex taut muscles in their backs, shoulders, arms and legs -- muscles that are soft and undefined on non-supers like the rest of us.And more indoor climbing walls are opening to fulfill that love, with international competitions following.Compared with natural cliffs and boulders, indoor walls are a design science.Climbing holds are strategically placed by a "route setter" who plans for the climb to get progressively harder and weed out all but the strongest competitors.Routes are also designed to be "visually spectacular" for audiences, as setter and professional indoor and outdoor climber Robbie Phillips put it, to "make climbers do interesting moves" such as long reaches, dramatic jumps and odd contortions.Professional climbing walls create an even playing field for competitions, even if that field is vertical.And in September, many of the best climbers descended (or ascended) upon Scotland's Edinburgh International Climbing Arena, one the largest indoor climbing centers in the world and host to one the sport's half-dozen annual climbing World Cups.Photos: Edinburgh World Cup for climbing Many of the best climbers competed at the Edinburgh World Cup this year.The sport will be featured for the first time at the 2020 Olympics.Hide Caption 1 of 7 Photos: Edinburgh World Cup for climbing The Edinburgh International Climbing

climbing Communicating by headset, guides describe to blind climbers where their feet and hands are in relation to a given hold.Hide Caption 6 of 7 Photos: Edinburgh World Cup for climbing The climbing arena is an adult playground just outside the city of Edinburgh housing various climbing walls, a rope obstacle course and a cafe with large observation windows.Hide Caption 7 of 7 Wall climbing ... and running As competition, indoor climbing has three main disciplines: speed climbing, bouldering and lead climbing.Bouldering, climbing a designed boulder-like structure (as opposed to a wall), is a burst of power over six or fewer moves.Lead climbing up a wall is a sport of endurance and technique in which climbers are tethered by a rope in case of falls.Speed racing is a head-to-head match going straight up at a dizzying pace.Speed still matters in lead climbing because the climb must be done in under 6 minutes.As difficult as it is to get to the top, time pressure doesn't help -- not that you can take too long anyway, because a climber's strength will quickly run out from just hanging.For lead climbing, audience appeal lies in the acrobatics designed by the route setter, but also in the tension of climbers trying to make it to the top of a 50-foot wall.You see the struggle, the missteps and the harrowing transitions.Most competitors slip (at the Edinburgh World Cup, around 70% failed to reach the top in the qualifying round, and closer to 95% fell in the more difficult route of semifinals), so when they do reach the top after a very difficult final stretch, the crowd erupts.In the final round of this World Cup, not a single competitor made it to the top, though several came very close.The winner is the one who makes it farthest.Speed climbing may be the most fun to watch as the athletes frog-hop and monkey-climb a slightly inverted wall with seemingly no effort.It's an all-body power surge of less than 10 seconds up a wall of 15 meters (nearly 50 feet), pitting country against country.The fastest at the Edinburgh World Cup scaled it in 5.89 seconds, just shy of the world record, a feat that made the audience of about 700 gasp and cheer.Speed winners are determined by several rounds of single elimination.A false start is an automatic loss, with no do-over.For some of the men at Edinburgh, a false start was the difference between a gold and silver medal in the dramatic last round.Climber strategy (called "route reading") happens just before the competition begins.They come out of isolation to see the wall's structure for the first time and have an "observation."Standing on the ground and looking up, their arms reach into the air, plotting the movements in their imagination."Left foot there.Reach to that one next.Cross over there," they seem to be thinking.There are various holds: crimps (a small edge), pinches, pockets, slopers (the big rounded shapes) and large structures called volumes that change the angle and dimension of the wall itself.Each is challenging in its own way.The slightest misstep or miscalculation, and the climb is done.As interesting as it is to crane your neck and watch the best climbers scale geometric obstacle courses, even more awe-inducing are the paraclimbers doing the same with prosthetics, missing a limb or two, blind or having survived a stroke or other mobility issue.For those without a limb, there are fewer positions available, and weight is divided among available hands and feet."Missing a limb is missing an opportunity for weight shift and purchase points," explained Phillips, who tested routes at the Edinburgh World Cup competition."Some are able to use the stump of a leg or arm, but that's not the same purchase power of fingers or toes."Visually impaired climbers were led to the wall by their guides.The rock music blaring in the arena was shut off, and the announcer asked the crowd for silence so that the climber and their guide could hear each other by headset during the competition.The guide described in detail what the climber couldn't see, like where their feet and hands were in relation to a given hold.They quickly worked out a strategy at each move.For out-of-reach holds, climbers with sight must carefully connect hand and eye at their destination in space.But a blind climber must make small leaps of faith.Once they shift their bodies, they hope to quickly find a finger or toe hold before they fall.A mecca of indoor climbing Although the equipment and terminology is basically the same, indoor and outdoor climbing are different sports.Indoor climbing is generally a lot more physical and has evolved beyond just training for outdoor climbing into a separate discipline for those who compete or use it as exercise.Outdoor climbing is a lot more varied, given different rock types, and includes additional skills such as roped sports climbing and Alpinism (bagging high mountain peaks).The Edinburgh International Climbing Arena appeals to both types.What's odd, or perhaps inspired, is that its climbing structures are bolted onto actual dolerite rock faces that make up two sides of the enclosed structure.Inside, the cliff is wet in places, and fungus and shoots of wild grass grow out of the rock.It's basically an adult playground.An obstacle course of logs and rope netting dangles from the roof.A third-floor caf has a wall of observation windows.And some of the climbing walls are whimsical; one colorful tower is reminiscent of a helix-shaped Jenga game.The World Cup is a festive and well-organized affair, carrying the drama, thrills and heartbreak that often come from watching any athletes performing at the highest levels.Contestants were mainly from the United States and Europe, but in general, the best tend to be the Japanese, Austrians and Slovenians.Some have Olympic dreams, and others are enticed by prize money, up to 3,620 euros (about $4,200) at the World Cup.But all come for a deep love of the sport.Men outnumbered women in Edinburgh, but not by much, and the age range roughly spanned teens through 30s.An announcer pumped up the cheering crowd.When the power went out for hours on the first day of competition, the play-by-play commentary was improvised on a bullhorn.That, combined with a brogue, made it entertainingly incomprehensible.Popularity is going up, and up Indoor climbing is on the ascent, no matter how you define in.Participation is growing as more and more climbing gyms open in cities around the world; Edinburgh alone has five.Corporate sponsorship has turned the sport pro; one industry publication called it "the sport that will dethrone CrossFit."And speed climbing achieved the sporting world's highest honor: acceptance into the Olympics.It will make its debut at Tokyo in 2020.It's also one heck of a workout.Climbers are built like gymnasts: strong but agile, and lightweight because the handicap of added weight and the physics of gravity require it.The lighter you are, the easier it is to hold positions and make transitional leaps.And because most of the effort is in the upper body, arms are the one area of larger muscle growth.Mentally, climbing requires intense focus.The sport itself is a lesson in mindfulness practice.But off the wall, it's a very social sport, in which climbing clubs often become supportive second families.And competitive climbers travel frequently, a bonus for most.The best training is probably the most fun: hours on the climbing wall.And because it's such a new sport, the level of techniques is still largely undeveloped.There are a couple of tools that have been around since the 1980s, such as the finger board and campus rungs that replicate some holds.But any variety of weight-bearing exercises (hiking, stair-climbing, running, dancing) will promote agile muscle growth.There is inherent risk in climbing, but that's where proper training is key.Climbers learn how to use safety ropes and harnesses and avoid injury from falling.It's possible to sprain an ankle or wrist on descent, but that's rare.A 2001 study found that the most common injury in indoor climbing is overuse, such as a pulled tendon, and a 2013 study declared indoor climbing a low risk for acute injuries.Less serious but more common is pain from the extended use of key muscles."That tight, weak, swollen feeling in the forearms while climbing," explained Phillips, "that comes from the accumulation of lactic acid combined with restricted blood flow."Competitors are often seen getting arm massages before or after climbs.Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Besides general fitness, the main requisites for starting the sport are cost and access to a rock face or climbing gym, which often has single-entry or monthly membership fees.There is needed equipment, too: climbing shoes, chalk bag and chalk, close-fitting athletic clothes, a harness, various ropes and carabiners.But the child-like appeal is clear.And competitively, in what other sport, besides maybe stair climbing, do you eventually come out on top?

How your food is engineered to taste great:::::(CNN) Who says being "vanilla" is a bad thing?It's one of the most popular flavors in the world.Whether it's in cookies, cakes or ice cream, we just can't seem to get enough.The vast majority of bona fide vanilla bean is produced in Indonesia and Madagascar, but there's simply not enough supply to meet the global demand.That's where "flavor houses" come in.Their flavor chemists are responsible for formulating the flavoring in virtually every product you eat and drink that is processed, preserved or packaged before it gets to you.Case in point: Toward the end of the ingredient label on many packaged foods and drinks is the phrase "Contains natural and artificial flavoring."But behind these nebulous words is carefully considered science, says Kim Juelg, a senior flavorist at Givaudan Headquartered in Switzerland, Givaudan is the biggest flavor house in the world, commanding nearly 20% of global market share, according to industry analysts Leffingwell & Associates 'Like Mother Nature intended' Her own favorite foods mostly include fruits, and she has an affinity for bananas that are so green, they are still crunchy.Juelg began her career at Givaudan more than 20 years ago as an organoleptic scientist -- a job title even her own father struggled to pronounce -- working on the science of the senses.Her own favorite foods mostly include fruits, and she has an affinity for bananas that are so green, they are still crunchy.JUST WATCHED Pleasing the Senses -- Taste Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pleasing the Senses -- Taste 08:34 "The flavors that we make go into consumer goods that are baked, that are fried, that are frozen -- so, put through pretty rigorous processing, and they lose flavor," Juelg told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta ."So what we do is try to add back to that and make that taste like Mother Nature intended."When Gupta asked whether a flavorist's job is simply "re-creating what's natural," Juelg said, "a lot of it is ... but we can (also) create fantasy flavors.We can create combinations maybe that Mother Nature didn't intend."She gave the example of a mojito, made up of mint, lime, sugar and rum."We can re-create that in one flavor," she said.Depending on what individual compounds Juelg uses to "build" a particular flavor, it will be classified as either natural or artificial.JUST WATCHED Pleasing the Senses -- Sight Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pleasing the Senses -- Sight 05:42 "Natural materials come from a natural source and are processed in a natural way.Synthetic materials are from a not-natural source, or they are not processed in a natural way," said Juelg."For instance, we use ethyl butyrate here in a lot of our fruit flavors.It's a material that's found in peaches and in strawberries and in blueberries.The molecule is the same, but it's processed differently."Even if the compounds are identical, the method she uses to combine them could lead to different classifications.Either way, flavoring typically makes up less than 1% of the volume of a finished food product -- and the formula remains top secret."It would be similar to a chef in a kitchen creating dinner for you and you want to take home that recipe to make a banana cream pie.That chef is not going to give you that recipe," Juelg said.Generally Recognized as Safe Like all flavor houses, Givaudan is bound by strict confidentiality agreements with its clients, which include "all of the biggest global and national beverage companies in all product categories," according a company spokesman.Some flavors, such as black pepper, contain only a single ingredient.Others may contain hundreds or more -- there really is no maximum.A typical flavor, the spokesman said, contains 25 to 30 ingredients.JUST WATCHED Pleasing the Senses -- Sound Replay More Videos ...

Your internal body clock may be able to heal you:::::(CNN) Circadian rhythms control your sleep and wake cycles as well as guide essential bodily functions including metabolism, blood pressure and even the individual cell-level work done by your genes.In fact, each of your cells has its own biological clock, which is synchronized via temperature, hormones and other bodily cues, while the entire clockwork symphony is coordinated by a single conductor, a master clock in your brain known as the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei.A Nobel Prize awarded to three American scientists who focused their research on the genetic and molecular biology of circadian rhythms suggests how fundamental these processes are to our health.Alina Patke, a research associate in the lab of Dr. Michael Young, one of the Nobel Prize winners and a professor at Rockefeller University, explained that circadian rhythms not only control human behavior and physiology but also that of animals, plants and even fungi.Studies show that disruptions of our body's clockwork contributes to diseases as diverse as cancer and diabetes Recently scientists have begun to wonder if the opposite might also be true: Could healing be guided by this clockwork as well?Two new studies support this idea, widening our perspective and encouraging us to consider timing as essential to the process of recovery.Timing of injury Wounds, such as burns and cuts, heal nearly 60% faster when the injury occurs during the day rather than at night, a new study published Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine found.Scientists from the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, analyzed the records of 118 burn injury patients who had been cared for in England and Wales.They found burns that happened at night (between 8pm and 8am) took longer to heal than burns that occurred during the day (between 8am and 8pm), the researchers found -- an average of 28 days compared to only 17 days.One reason for this faster daytime healing was that skin cells moved much more quickly to repair the wound site when the body clock was set for daylight, the team said.Within individual cells, this speed was driven by increased activity of proteins that are involved in cell movement and repair.Mouse experiments, where the researchers made incisions to the skin, also showed wound healing to be significantly greater when wounds were inflicted during the animal's active phase compared with the rest phase.Further examining this process in the lab, the researchers "found that the microscopic architecture of the cell, the actin cytoskeleton, has a 24-hour rhythm in skin cells grown in a dish," said Ned Hoyle, lead author of the paper and a postdoctoral fellow at the MRC Laboratory."One of the main jobs of these cells in a whole animal is to respond to wounds by moving into them and secreting proteins to repair the damage," said Hoyle.The researchers believe this healing process is driven by individual cells' internal circadian clocks -- and not signals transmitted throughout the body.Hoyle also speculated that cellular clocks at the site of surgery could be "adjusted to the best time for healing before the operation," while more generally, "the time of surgery could be scheduled to coincide with each patient's biological time."So that "larks," or early risers, could see the surgeon in the morning, while "owls," or late risers, would be treated in the afternoon.Another new study, published last month in the Lancet, also suggests that timing may be essential to health care.Timing of heart surgery Following open heart surgery, some patients experience cardiac events that negatively impact the results and increase their risk of dying.The Lancet study explored whether this poor outcome might be influenced by the time of day an operation occurred.Dr. David Montaigne -- the study's lead author and a professor at University of Lille in France -- and his colleagues examined the medical records of 596 people who had heart valve replacement surgery between January 2009 and December 2015.Half of the patients had surgery in the morning, half in the afternoon.People who had surgery in the afternoon had a 50% lower risk of a major cardiac event within 500 days of their operation compared to people who had surgery in the morning, the researchers found.Among the 298 afternoon patients, 28 had an event (9.4%) compared to 54 of 298 morning patients (18.1%).Next, with the help of surgical patients, the researchers conducted an additional experiment between January 2016 and February 2017.Montaigne and his colleagues randomly scheduled half of 88 patients for heart valve replacement surgery in the morning and the other half for an afternoon operation and then monitored all until they left the hospital.None of the patients died, and the average hospital stay was the same for both groups: 12 days.Still, afternoon surgery patients had lower levels of heart tissue damage after surgery compared to the morning group, the researchers found.Conducting genetic tests on tissue samples, the team learned that the 287 genes linked to the circadian clock were more active in the afternoon samples than the morning samples.And in experiments on mice involving the deletion and replacement of relevant genes, the researchers found more evidence to suggest the heart's ability to repair in the morning is poorer than in the afternoon.Based on their explorations, the team believe drugs could be developed to modulate these genes and so protect the heart during surgery.Or, surgeries can be scheduled to protect at-risk patients."Aortic valve replacement is very safe nowadays," said Montaigne and his co-author, Bart Staels, a professor at the University of Lille said by email."The point is not to alter the schedule of surgery for all patients: changing the time of surgery for low risk patients (the most abundant) makes no sense, since they do not develop complications."Montaigne and Staels emphasized that more research is needed.Still, they noted their "findings are in line with the concepts of chronobiology and chronotherapy" -- natural cycle-based biology and treatments.And there are other examples as well.The existence of daytime variation in chemotherapy efficiency and toxicity has been well known for many years.And more recent experiments have shown that morning vaccination with a flu shot enhances immune response more than afternoon vaccination.Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your

patterns that are affected.Patke noted that circadian dysfunction is also a medical issue."How this actually works is not entirely clear," she said."But most people would agree at this point that there definitely is a correlation."
Vets combat trauma with therapeutic surfing:::::Folly Beach, South Carolina (CNN) As a Marine serving in the Iraq War, Sgt.Andrew Manzi spent long hours on patrol, never knowing what dangers were ahead.He saw intense firefights during his two tours, and many of his comrades lost their lives."I just knew I was going to die," Manzi said.While on patrol, Manzi and fellow soldiers would talk about life after war."I remember looking at one of my (medics) and being like, 'I'm going to go surf one day,'" said Manzi, now 32."There was just something that looked just so incredible in how these guys lived their lives."But after returning home in 2005, he struggled for years."I felt like I had no control over myself, and I was afraid of myself," said Manzi, who was suffering from a traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder.He sought professional help to cope day to day.But it was the moment he took a surfboard he bought at a yard sale and hit the waves for the first time when his soul began to heal."I had my ass handed to me that day, but it was the first time I felt alive again," he said."I could go out there and just turn off the world."Manzi quickly fell in love with surfing.In 2013, he moved to Folly Beach, South Carolina, where he started giving surf lessons.On the beach, he met and bonded with other veterans, and he soon realized he had found a way to bring healing to their lives.Today, his nonprofit, Warrior Surf, provides free surf camps for veterans and their families.Each camp lasts six weeks and offers therapy sessions on the beach.The group has found that having therapy on the beach makes it more approachable for veterans.They aren't required to participate if they're not ready, but they are encouraged to work with the organization's therapist.In the last two years, around 300 people have benefited from the program."You feel safe out there when you know you got a bunch of brothers floating around you," Manzi said."We're just taking a natural approach to healing."CNN's Meghan Dunn spoke with Manzi about his work.Below is an edited version of their conversation.CNN: What's it like for you when you're out on the ocean?Andrew Manzi: There's only one thing I'm focused on when I'm out there: surfing.It's as powerful as meditation, breathing techniques, yoga.You really get in tune with your body.In combat, you wait and wait and wait for something bad to happen.Well, bad stuff happens over there.It always does.Well, here, man, you wait, you wait, you wait, and something amazing happens.CNN: It's not just veterans out there in the water.Why do you involve their families?Manzi: When we started, it was very veteran-based.We definitely were focusing on the veterans.But really quickly it became apparent that the whole family needs this stuff.We try to create an opportunity where the family can come back together again.How do you expect an individual to get better in his whole entirety if he goes home and he's like, "I'm doing the surfing thing, these guys are great, I'm feeling good, I can conquer the world" -- but the family's been in the trenches taking grenades for the past four years since he's been back from deployment?That's why we all agreed that we need to really incorporate the whole family.So, if you want to come with your six kids, we can get them in the water.If you want to come out with your wife and surf, we have the babysitters so both of you can go in.I'm really a true believer on the whole community aspect of healing.JUST WATCHED CNN Hero Andrew Manzi: Warrior Surf Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Hero Andrew Manzi: Warrior Surf 02:34 CNN: Your program also offers free therapy.Manzi: We take the veterans outside the clinical setting of a room in an office building or a hospital -- doors shut, white walls, fluorescent lights, it's just uncomfortable.We conduct all our therapy on the beach or on the river.You wouldn't know the difference between a veteran and (therapist) sitting on the beach and those two people sitting right over there.After therapy, you have to either go surf with another veteran or at least get in the water and paddle around and kind of decompress.You raise those symptoms pretty high.Let's say you're talking about a certain day, you're going to get a little bit of anxiety.I think the best way to battle that is to go calm down in the ocean and relax and let the ocean kind of cleanse you, bring you back so you're good, you're fine -- instead of just hopping in the car and driving back home and sitting in the closet again.CNN: What do you want veterans to take away from this?Manzi: I want them to take away a little bit of hope, because hope leads to courageous actions.There's so many things out there that you can try and do, and that time in your life shouldn't dictate the rest of your life.There's a lot of brothers and sisters out here that will welcome you.Life can be really good if you make it good.And this is a way we can start.Want to get involved?Check out the Warrior Surf website and see how to help.To donate to Warrior Surf click the CrowdRise widget below.
Contaminated water killed 13 in US in 2013-14, CDC says:::::(CNN) Clear water is not always a sign of clean water -- or so suggest two new reports on water-associated disease outbreaks published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In 2013-14, a total of 42 drinking-water-associated outbreaks caused by infectious pathogens, chemicals or toxins were reported to the CDC from 19 states.The reports do not include lead contamination.These outbreaks led to at least 1,006 cases of illness, 124 hospitalizations and 13 deaths across Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin."The number of drinking water outbreaks has increased from 32 in 2011-2012," said Kathy Benedict, lead author of the report and an epidemiologist in CDC's Waterborne Disease Prevention Branch."This may be due to a true increase in disease, better reporting or changes in capacity in states to do surveillance."Legionella bacteria are present in the environment and enter drinking water through various activities, including floods, explained Wilma Subra, president of the Subra Co., an environmental consulting firm.She was not involved in the CDC reports.Though water systems frequently "chlorinate before they distribute," Subra explained, in some cases, the level of chlorination "isn't sufficient to make it all the way to the end of this distribution system.""So if these bacteria are in there and don't get properly treated before they leave the plant ... then the bacteria grows again and causes the people in the farthest regions of the distribution system to become contaminated and to become ill," Subra said.Cryptosporidium or Crypto , a parasite that causes a diarrheal illness, caused five outbreaks in the CDC report, and Giardia , another parasite leading to diarrheal illness, caused three outbreaks."Giardia is known to be active and alive in groundwater sources, particularly," Subra said.Five outbreaks were caused by chemicals or toxic algal blooms rather than bacteria or parasites.The report said that 75% of the 1,006 cases of illness were linked to community water systems, which are government-regulated.A related CDC report brought similar news.Waterborne disease During the same 2013-14 time frame, 15 outbreaks associated with an environmental exposure to water contaminated with harmful pathogens, chemicals or toxins were reported to the CDC by 10 states.A total of 226 cases of illness, 69 hospitalizations and nine deaths were recorded in Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah and Virginia.An additional 12 outbreaks caused by undetermined exposure to contaminated water were reported by eight states during the 2013-2014 period.Alabama, California, Kentucky, Montana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas together recorded 63 cases of illness, 39 hospitalizations and eight deaths.Benedict said outbreaks associated with environmental exposure to water increased from eight outbreaks in 2011-2012, while no change occurred in undetermined exposure outbreaks.Undetermined exposures could include cases in which, for example, an unreported spill of chemicals or waste products into the Mississippi River causes illness downriver."By the time everyone was really ill, that slug of water had gone through the system, and so it was indeterminate what that contaminant was," Subra said.For the combined environmental and undetermined disease outbreaks, Legionella was responsible for 63% of the illnesses, 94% of hospitalizations and all deaths.Among the environmental exposure outbreaks, eight involved human-made systems, such as cooling towers and decorative fountains, while seven involved natural water bodies, such as rivers and streams, according to the CDC.Giardia caused most of the natural water illnesses."In general, there are fewer waterborne disease outbreaks reported today in comparison to the late '70s or early '80s," said Benedict.Yet she also noted that the "data likely do not capture all of the outbreaks or cases that occurred" during the 2013-14 time period due to variations in surveillance and reporting among the states.Combined, the two reports suggest action is needed.Aging infrastructure, no funds "I see aging infrastructure is one of the major, major, major sources of the problem," Subra said."And it's because a lot of these smaller, poorer communities just don't have the resources to put into infrastructure repair, and they also can't afford to get a loan, because they can't afford to repay it."A second major problem is the source: where the raw water comes from."Whether it be surface water or groundwater, it has a lot of contaminants that historically have not been monitored for," Subra said.In recent years, we have become more knowledgeable about new chemical contaminants."Those materials were missed, and it was degrading our water quality and not being accounted for.And then of course you have the potential for all the bacterial contamination."Historically, water systems would test for bacteria from leaks at sewage plants and septic tanks, but they weren't looking "for all the other things," she said."So you have chemical contamination and bacterial contamination that you weren't looking out for historically that are also now contaminating the water and causing severe health impacts to the community."Though environmental scientists figured these issues were happening, there was no testing to verify them and no requirements at the federal or state level that tests be done by water systems.What's a water-drinking human to do?"Citizens can become educated and empowered in order to bring these issues to the forefront -- to their elected official, to the regulatory agencies," Subra said."It's really up to the citizens to be able to identify what's going on with their drinking water source."If people think their water may be contaminated, they should "absolutely" test their own water, she added."However, there are so many of those people who have individual wells who don't have the resources to pay for testing."Benedict said, "Providing safe drinking water was one of the most important public health achievements of the 20th century."She added that "investments in upgrading and maintaining drinking water treatment and distribution systems are important to continue providing safe water to communities in the US."Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.On the household level, though, it may not always be clear when water is polluted."If you have iron in your water, you get this orangey-red-brown slimy sediment in your water, and you know something's wrong," Subra said."A lot of these bacteria and chemicals are colorless, odorless, and you aren't aware the quality of your water is bad until you consume it and become ill."
More than 103 million Americans will have high blood pressure under new guidelines:::::The American Heart Association has changed the definition of hypertension for the first time in 14 years, moving the number from the old standard of 140/90 to the newly revised 130/80.The change is outlined in the American Heart Association 2017 Hypertension Practice Guidelines, an extensive report by experts without relevant ties to the pharmaceutical industry.The changes are expected to drastically impact adult Americans: revising the hypertension threshold downward will increase the percent of U.S. adults living with high blood pressure from 32 percent to 46 percent -- nearly half of the adult population.It will also disproportionately affect younger people by tripling the number of men under 45 and doubling the number of women under 45 with the diagnosis.American Heart Association The new guidelines reflect years of research, which have shown that people within the new range of blood pressure defined as hypertension have doubled their risk of cardiovascular problems in the future, such as heart attacks or strokes.As such, health care professionals should be identifying these patients and helping to initiate interventions to bring down blood pressure.While the new guidelines significantly increase the number of Americans with a diagnosis of hypertension, they do not suggest a proportionate increase in treating with medication.The number of Americans with hypertension who are recommended for medical treatment would increase by only 4.2 million adults, or 5 percent more than were previously recommended.Medication will be recommended for patients with previous cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, or significant cardiovascular risk factors determined by factors such as age, blood tests and having other medical conditions that increase risk of heart attack.The study authors recommend lifestyle changes, including exercise, diet modifications and weight loss, as the first step to reducing high blood pressure.Getty Images Doctors in the guidelines stress the importance of using two separate blood pressure readings on two different occasions to diagnose hypertension.They recommend that those with hypertension use approved blood pressure monitors at home.Writing down these readings at home can help tell the difference between people with truly abnormal blood pressure and those with white-coat syndrome -- with high blood pressure only under stress like at the doctors office.High blood pressure increases the risk of cardiac problems and strokes, and is sometimes called the silent killer because so many adults live with high blood pressure and dont know it.To help understand the new hypertension guidelines and how they affect managing your health, see your healthcare professional.
Half of US adults have high blood pressure in new guidelines:::::New guidelines lower the threshold for high blood pressure, adding 30 million Americans to those who have the condition, which now plagues nearly half of U.S. adults.High pressure, which for decades has been a top reading of at least 140 or a bottom one of 90, drops to 130 over 80 in advice announced Monday by a dozen medical groups.The change means an additional 14 percent of U.S. adults have the problem, but only an additional 2 percent will need medication right away; the rest should try healthier lifestyles, which get much stronger emphasis in the new advice.Poor diets, lack of exercise and other bad habits cause 90 percent of high blood pressure."I have no doubt there will be controversy.I'm sure there will be people saying 'We have a hard enough time getting to 140,'" said Dr. Paul Whelton, a Tulane University physician who led the guidelines panel.But the risk for heart disease, stroke and other problems drops as blood pressure improves, and the new advice "is more honest" about how many people have a problem, he said.Currently, only half of Americans with high blood pressure have it under control.The upper threshold for high blood pressure has been 140 since 1993, but a major study two years ago found heart risks were much lower in people who aimed for 120.Canada and Australia lowered their cutoff to that; Europe is still at 140 but is due to revise its guidance next year.The guidelines were announced Monday at an American Heart Association conference in Anaheim.WHAT THE CHANGES MEAN The guidelines set new categories and get rid of "prehypertension": Normal: Under 120 over 80 Elevated: Top number 120-129 and bottom less than 80 Stage 1: Top of 130-139 or bottom of 80-89 Stage 2: Top at least 140 or bottom at least 90 That means 46 percent of U.S. adults have high pressure (stages 1 or 2) versus 32 percent under the old levels.How common it is will roughly triple in men under 45, to 30 percent, and double in women of that age, to 19 percent.For people over 65, the guidelines undo a controversial tweak made three years ago to relax standards and not start medicines unless the top number was over 150.Now, everyone that old should be treated if the top number is over 130 unless they're too frail or have conditions that make it unwise."The evidence with this is so solid, so convincing, that it's hard to argue with the targets," said Dr. Jackson Wright, a guidelines panel member from University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center.Older people "have a 35-to-50-fold higher risk of dying of a heart attack or stroke compared to younger people."But the Cleveland Clinic's Dr. Steven Nissen said he's worried."Some more vulnerable patients who get treated very aggressively may have trouble with falls" because too-low pressure can make them faint, he said.WHO NEEDS TREATMENT Certain groups, such as those with diabetes, should be treated if their top number is over 130, the guidelines say.For the rest, whether to start medication will no longer be based just on the blood pressure numbers.The decision also should consider the overall risk of having a heart problem or stroke in the next 10 years, including factors such as age, gender and cholesterol, using a simple formula to estimate those odds.Those without a high risk will be advised to improve their lifestyles lose weight, eat healthy, exercise more, limit alcohol, avoid smoking."It's not just throwing meds at something," said one primary care doctor who praised the new approach, the Mayo Clinic's Dr. Robert Stroebel.If people continue bad habits, "They can kind of eat and blow through the medicines," he said.The guidelines warn about some popular approaches, though.There's not enough proof that consuming garlic, dark chocolate, tea or coffee helps, or that yoga, meditation or other behavior therapies lower blood pressure long-term, they say.The government no longer writes heart guidelines, leaving it to medical groups.Unlike previous guideline panels, none on this one have recent financial ties to industry, although some on a panel that reviewed and commented on them do.The guidelines were published in two journals Hypertension and the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.HOW AND WHEN TO CHECK IT Blood pressure should be checked at least once a year by a health professional, and diagnosing high pressure requires 2 or 3 readings on at least two occasions.The common way uses a cuff on the upper arm to temporarily block the flow of blood in an artery in the arm and gradually release it while listening with a stethoscope and counting sounds the blood makes as it flows through the artery.But that is prone to error, and many places now use automated devices.The guidelines don't pick a method, but recommend measuring pressure in the upper arm; devices that work on fingers or are worn on wrists "aren't ready for prime time," Whelton said.Home monitoring also is recommended; devices cost as little as $40 to $60.WHAT ABOUT KIDS?Unlike adults, numbers for normal pressure in children vary with age, height and gender.Kids should be checked at least once a year for high pressure, say guidelines announced in August by the American Academy of Pediatrics.After age 13, the levels defining high pressure are the same as for adults, said a member of the pediatrics panel, Dr. Elaine Urbina of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center."When you turn 18 years and one minute, you shouldn't suddenly have a new definition," she said.Marilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP
How to lower your blood pressure without medication:::::The new recommendations on blood pressure from the American Heart Association (AHA) will significantly increase the number of Americans diagnosed with hypertension, particularly in younger age groups.The number of adult women under 45 with the diagnosis will double, while the number of adult men under 45 will triple.The number of Americans that are recommended medical treatment will only increase slightly.The AHA recommends lifestyle modification as a first line treatment.However, it is not always clear to patients which lifestyle modifications are the most effective.The below descriptions summarize which lifestyle modifications are recommended by the AHA, based on the latest available research.Stock Photo/Getty Images Diet changes The single intervention with the greatest documented effect on blood pressure is the DASH diet, a well-studied diet that encourages fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and discourages foods high in saturated and total fats.Research shows that this diet can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by approximately 11 mmHg.In addition, the guidelines recommend low-sodium diets (goal less than 1,500 mg per day, with the best effects seen at less than 1,000 mg per day), and diets rich in potassium (dried apricots, avocado, salmon, green leafy veggies and bananas).Low sodium and high potassium diets can lower systolic blood pressure by approximately 4-6 mmHg.Weight loss Losing weight improves health and well being in many capacities, but exactly how much to lose may be different for everyone.For those over 5 feet tall, an ideal body weight can actually be calculated mathematically.These numbers will change based on how tall you are, and the calculations are different for men and women.Formulating an individualized numerical goal in this way can help people reach a healthy body mass index.A normal, healthy BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 may be a good long-term goal, but in order to get there most physicians recommend losing 1 kilogram (or about 2.2 lbs.)at a time.The average American can expect a 1 mmHg drop in systolic blood pressure for every 1 kilogram reduction in body weight.Exercise Aerobic exercise yields the most benefit in lowering blood pressure.What constitutes enough?The experts say 90-150 minutes per week with heart rates up to 65-75 percent of one's heart rate.For strength training, the AHA recommends dynamic and isometric resistance exercises.Dynamic exercise is any exercise that involves joint movement, such as bicep curls, tricep dips or squats.Stock Photo/Getty Images Isometric exercise is typically done against immovable objects and includes planks, wall-sits and boat pose.Experts say weight training should be done three times per week and benefits are usually seen after 8-10 weeks of practicing.All of the above activities were seen to benefit people with hypertension with studies indicating a decrease of systolic blood pressures of approximately 4-8 mmHg.Alcohol consumption For drinkers, limiting the amount of alcohol consumed has a beneficial impact on blood pressure.Studies find that drinking in moderation lowers systolic blood pressure by up to 4 mmHg.For men, AHA recommends drinking less than or up to two drinks daily, and for women only up to one drink daily.In fact, decreasing alcohol intake even proved to reduce blood pressure in patients who had not been diagnosed with hypertension yet.Consult with a health care professional While the above recommendations can change blood pressure for a large share of those with hypertension, there are still millions of Americans for whom lifestyle modifications are not enough.Consult with your health care professional to see which intervention, medication or otherwise, is right for you.
Over 400 killed, thousands injured in earthquake near Iran-Iraq border:::::Over 400 people died and more than 7,000 were injured in Iran and Iraq after a powerful earthquake struck the countries' border region Sunday, authorities said.Interested in Earthquakes?Add Earthquakes as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Earthquakes news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The quake hit Iran much harder than Iraq.In Iran, authorities said at least 407 people were killed and 6,700 were injured, The Associated Press reported.The area that appeared to be the most devastated was Iran's western Kermanshah province, which is a rural area where people mostly rely on farming, the AP said.Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA The Associated Press Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA In Iraq, at least seven people died and 535 were injured, the AP said.Amina Mohammed said she and her sons fled their home in Darbandikhan, Iraq, as the house fell apart, the AP reported."I screamed to God and it must have been him who stopped the stairs from entirely collapsing on us," she said, according to the AP.The magnitude-7.3 quake struck about 19 miles from the Iraqi city of Halabjah, at a depth of 14 miles, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).The Associated Press There were two smaller quakes in the area after the 1:18 p.m.ET quake: a magnitude-5.3 quake at 1:29 p.m.ET, at a depth of 6 miles, and a magnitude-4.5 quake at 4:33 p.m.ET, also at a depth of 6 miles, according to the USGS.The Derbandikhan Dam in Iraq experienced surface cracks and people near the Sirwan River, which flows between the two countries, had been warned to leave as a precaution, the dam manager told ABC News.A U.S. Department of Defense spokesman said today all coalition personnel and equipment are accounted for.The quake has not affected the campaign to defeat ISIS, Pentagon spokesman Col. Robert Manning told reporters today.The Iraqi government has not requested earthquake-related assistance from the coalition but the coalition is ready to help if that request comes in, Manning said.ABC News' Dyar Mohammed Rafiq, Elizabeth McLaughlin and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Trump announces ex-Big Pharma exec Alex Azar as Tom Price's replacement at Health and Human Services:::::President Donald Trump today announced he's nominating Alex Azar to be Department of Health and Human Services secretary, replacing Tom Price.Interested in Trump Administration?Add Trump Administration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Trump Administration news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Azar is a former executive for pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and worked as a deputy secretary at HHS under President George W. Bush.Price resigned Sept. 29 amid investigations into his use of charter jets at taxpayers' expense.After graduating from Yale Law School, Azar, 50, clerked for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and then worked for then-independent counsel Ken Starr on the so-called Whitewater investigation that embroiled the Clinton administration.Azar calls Starr a mentor.In a Yale Law School student profile, Azar says he entered health care largely by accident.After working on the Bush-Cheney campaign in 2000, Azar joined the George W. Bush administration as general counsel of HHS.He later became deputy secretary of HHS under Secretary Mike Leavitt.I realized I had found my life's calling: to help people around the world live longer, healthier, and happier lives, wrote Azar about his work at HHS.Former HHS Secretary Leavitt praised Trumps pick of Azar.Alex is highly competent, hes experienced, hes ideologically aligned with the president and hes been confirmed twice by the Senate for HHS, Leavitt told ABC News.There may never have been a nominee better able to hit the ground running.We worked side by side for the implementation of Medicare Part D, on pandemic preparedness and Katrina recovery.He also had complete responsibility for the administrative rulemaking process at HHS which will be used extensively in changing the existing law, said Leavitt.After serving at HHS, Azar joined Lilly USA, LLC, an affiliate of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co., where he oversaw the commercial side of the business.Azar stepped down from Lilly after more than a decade to start up a health care consulting firm, Seraphim Strategies, LLC.Trump touted Azars experience working with the drug industry in a tweet announcing his pick although his very connection to the pharmaceutical business could raise questions during his confirmation hearings.Happy to announce, I am nominating Alex Azar to be the next HHS Secretary.He will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2017 Comments on Obamacare The Trump administration has sought to repeal and then to weaken the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obamas signature health care legislation.Over the course of the past year, HHS has dramatically cut outreach and advertising funding for open enrollment under Obamacare, and President Trump ended cost-sharing subsidies to help fund insurance for low-income individuals.With the Republican Congress unable to follow through with the campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump has signaled hes looking for regulatory avenues for dismantling the Affordable Care Act.Azars comments about aspects of the Affordable Care Act signal his potential policy positions as head of the regulatory body overseeing the law.Its certainly circling the drain, said Azar of the Affordable Care Act during an interview on the Fox Business Network.Obamacare plans are following the laws of economics.First, if youre running an insurance company youve got to be able to make money, and in order to make money youve got to be able to predict risk.The Obamacare system has made it impossible to predict risk.Theres actually fairly few levers that the government can do at this point to stabilize this broken system, said Azar.Azar has also said that the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care has been unsuccessful.The potential loss of Medicaid expansion dollars has been a sticking point for some Republican lawmakers from Medicaid expansion states who have welcomed the increase in federal dollars.Instead of throwing more money and more beneficiaries into state-run, single-payer programs, weve demonstrated that it works to use the government money through private-sector vehicles, said Azar said in an interview with the Zetema Project in February.Senate Health Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., praised Trumps choice to lead HHS.As a former Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services and private sector executive, Alex Azar has the qualifications and experience to get results.The Senate health committee will promptly schedule a hearing on his nomination, said Alexander in a statement.Critics slam Azar's stance on Obamacare Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement that Azars confirmation process will be a referendum on the Trump administration's repeated efforts to sabotage our health care system and raise premiums on millions of Americans.Its time to turn over a new leaf at HHS," Schumer said."The next secretary must demonstrate a commitment to lowering premiums, and not sabotaging the Affordable Care Act and our health care system with reckless actions that hurt families.I look forward to reviewing Mr. Azar's nomination.Protect Our Care, an advocacy organization that supports the Affordable Care Act and which ran advertising campaigns against Tom Price during his nomination process, blasted Azar in a statement."President Trump has nominated in Mr. Azar someone who shares his misguided and factually flawed views on the Affordable Care Act, said Brad Woodhouse of Protect Our Care in a statement."The nomination of a new HHS Secretary could be an opportunity for Trump and Republicans to turn the page on their repeal and sabotage agenda, especially in light of last week's election results where Republicans lost across the country with the GOP's unpopular health care agenda being a leading cause.
Study suggests women less likely to get CPR from bystanders:::::Women are less likely than men to get CPR from a bystander and more likely to die, a new study suggests, and researchers think reluctance to touch a woman's chest might be one reason.Only 39 percent of women suffering cardiac arrest in a public place were given CPR versus 45 percent of men, and men were 23 percent more likely to survive, the study found.It involved nearly 20,000 cases around the country and is the first to examine gender differences in receiving heart help from the public versus professional responders."It can be kind of daunting thinking about pushing hard and fast on the center of a woman's chest" and some people may fear they are hurting her, said Audrey Blewer, a University of Pennsylvania researcher who led the study.Rescuers also may worry about moving a woman's clothing to get better access, or touching breasts to do CPR, but doing it properly "shouldn't entail that," said another study leader, U Penn's Dr. Benjamin Abella."You put your hands on the sternum, which is the middle of the chest.In theory, you're touching in between the breasts."The study was discussed Sunday at an American Heart Association conference in Anaheim.Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops pumping, usually because of a rhythm problem.More than 350,000 Americans each year suffer one in settings other than a hospital.About 90 percent of them die, but CPR can double or triple survival odds."This is not a time to be squeamish because it's a life and death situation," Abella said.Researchers had no information on rescuers or why they may have been less likely to help women.But no gender difference was seen in CPR rates for people who were stricken at home, where a rescuer is more likely to know the person needing help.The findings suggest that CPR training may need to be improved.Even that may be subtly biased toward males practice mannequins (they're not called "woman-nequins") are usually male torsos, Blewer said."All of us are going to have to take a closer look at this" gender issue, said the Mayo Clinic's Dr. Roger White, who co-directs the paramedic program for the city of Rochester, Minnesota.He said he has long worried that large breasts may impede proper placement of defibrillator pads if women need a shock to restore normal heart rhythm.The Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health funded the study.Men did not have a gender advantage in a second study discussed on Sunday.It found the odds of suffering cardiac arrest during or soon after sex are very low, but higher for men than women.Previous studies have looked at sex and heart attacks, but those are caused by a clot suddenly restricting blood flow, and people usually have time to get to a hospital and be treated, said Dr. Sumeet Chugh, a cardiologist at Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles.He and other researchers wanted to know how sex affected the odds of cardiac arrest, a different problem that's more often fatal.They studied records on more than 4,500 cardiac arrests over 13 years in the Portland area.Only 34 were during or within an hour of having sex, and 32 of those were in men.Most already were on medicines for heart conditions, so their risk was elevated to start with."It's a very awkward situation, and a very horrifying situation to be one of the two people who survives," but more would survive if CPR rates were higher, Chugh said.Results were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.Marilynn Marchione can be followed on Twitter: @MMarchioneAP

Study eyes hospitalists:::::The old-fashioned, family doctor style of medicine could be lifesaving for elderly hospitalized patients, a big study suggests, showing benefits over a rapidly expanding alternative that has hospital-based doctors overseeing care instead.Medicare patients with common conditions including pneumonia, heart failure and urinary infections who were treated by their own primary care doctors were slightly more likely to survive after being sent home than those cared for instead by hospitalists internists who provide care only in hospitals.While hospitalist care can shorten stays and reduce costs, the new results suggest that, for at least some patients, getting taken care of in the hospital by a doctor who knows them can have important advantages.Almost 11 percent of patients cared for by a hospitalist died within 30 days of leaving the hospital, compared with just under 9 percent of primary care patients.While that difference was small, it "was certainly a startling finding," said Dr. Jennifer Stevens, the study's lead author at Harvard Medical School.Also, among hospitalist patients, 36 percent were sent to a nursing home or other long-term care center, versus about 30 percent of primary care patients.Studies show that elderly patients who are discharged to nursing homes are less likely than others to ever return to their homes, Stevens said.Reasons for those advantages are unclear.Stevens noted that primary care doctors who know their patients' health and family histories may be more attuned to how well they can manage at home after hospitalization and which potentially risky follow-up tests or medicines they can avoid.Stevens and her colleagues analyzed Medicare claims data on nearly 600,000 hospital admissions in 2013.Their results were published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine.The researchers don't advocate replacing hospitalists, but Stevens said the study "opens the door" to limiting their use with certain hospital patients, particularly the elderly.Patients in the study were aged 80 on average.The hospitalist specialty has grown since the 1990s amid insurance industry changes, rising demands on primary care doctors' time and research showing hospitalists can shorten patients' stays and reduce costs.In 1995, hospitalists provided 9 percent of general medicine services in hospitals, but by 2013 that had grown to nearly 60 percent, a journal editorial noted.Hospitalists may bring "new eyes" to patients' problems, but the study results, if valid, suggest there's a trade-off, the editorial said.In the study, 60 percent of patients got their hospital care from hospitalists versus only 14 percent from their primary care doctors.The rest got care from other general physicians including partners of patients' primary physicians.These were physicians who likely didn't know the patients or the hospital well, Stevens said.The average length of stay was about 5 days for primary care or general care and about half a day shorter for hospitalists.Those treated by other general physicians were slightly more likely than the others to die within 30 days of discharge and to be readmitted to the hospital.Follow Medical writer Lindsey Tanner on Twitter at @LindseyTanner .Her work can be found here.
Trump turns to drug industry for his new health secretary:::::Turning to an industry he's rebuked, President Donald Trump on Monday picked a former top pharmaceutical and government executive to be his health secretary.If confirmed, Alex Azar would oversee a $1 trillion department responsible for major health insurance programs, including "Obamacare," as well as medical research, food and drug safety, and public health.The nomination of Azar is unusual because Health and Human Services secretaries have come from the ranks of elected officials such as governors, leaders in academia and medicine, or top executive branch managers not industries regulated by the department."He will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!"Trump tweeted in a morning announcement.Trump has a track record of making industry-friendly nominations, such as former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state and wealthy investor Wilbur Ross as secretary of commerce.But Trump also has been a scathing critic of the drug companies, both as a candidate and as president.Azar, 50, a lawyer by training, has spent most of the last 10 years with pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, rising to president of its key U.S. affiliate before leaving in January to start his own consulting firm.He's also seen as an expert on government health care regulation.As secretary, Azar would be returning to HHS after serving in senior posts in the George W. Bush administration.He would have to scrupulously avoid conflicts with Lilly's far-reaching interests, from drug approval to Medicare reimbursement.The drugmaker has drawn criticism from patient advocacy groups for price increases to one of its biggest products: insulin, used to treat high blood sugar for nearly 100 years.Azar's earlier HHS nominations in the Bush era sailed through the Senate.This time, he'll face Democrats wary of the administration's unyielding quest to repeal the Affordable Care Act.Top Democrats in Congress were skeptical, but also said they hoped Azar would bring a shift from an ideological hard line on "Obamacare.""It's time to turn over a new leaf at HHS," said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., flagged a potential conflict of interest, questioning how Azar "can fairly execute any significant effort to lower drug prices for patients."Murray is the senior Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.But committee chairman Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., cast Azar as a problem solver, saying "he has the qualifications and experience to get results."Insurers and for-profit hospitals also reacted positively, while the Public Citizen advocacy group likened Azar's nomination to a "coup d'etat" by drug companies.Americans consistently rank the high cost of prescription drugs among their top health care priorities, ahead of divisive issues like repealing former President Barack Obama's health care law.Trump has been a sharp critic of the industry."The drug companies, frankly, are getting away with murder," he said at a Cabinet meeting this fall.Prices are "out of control."In the spring, a Trump tweet sent drug stocks tumbling after the president said he was working on a new system that would foster competition and lead to much lower prices.In meetings with industry executives, however, Trump has focused on speeding up drug approvals, a cost-reducing tactic they would back.Professionally, Azar has another set of skills that may be valuable to the president.In his previous service at HHS, the Yale law graduate developed an insider's familiarity with the complex world of federal health care regulation, serving first as the department's chief lawyer and later as deputy secretary.Frustrated by fruitless efforts to overturn the Obama-era health law in Congress, Trump might see the regulatory route as his best chance to make a mark on health care.If confirmed, Azar would join the club of Trump administration officials from big business.Ross was chairman of a private equity firm he founded and later sold.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was a former Goldman Sachs executive and hedge fund manager.Tillerson was CEO of ExxonMobil.Admirers say Azar's drug industry experience should be considered an asset, not a liability."To the extent that the Trump administration has talked about lowering drug prices, here's a guy who understands how it works," said Tevi Troy, who served with Azar in the Bush administration and now leads the American Health Policy Institute, a think tank focused on employer health insurance."Would (Azar) have been better off if he had been meditating in an ashram after serving as deputy secretary?"asked Troy.Trump's pick to lead the Food and Drug Administration, Scott Gottlieb, also faced scrutiny for receiving consulting payments from drugmakers and medical device companies while in the private sector.Once in office, Gottlieb pushed efforts to lower drug prices by reworking FDA drug reviews to increase competition.Azar would be Trump's second HHS secretary, replacing former Georgia congressman Tom Price, ousted after his use of private charter planes for government travel displeased the president.Associated Press health writers Matthew Perrone and Tom Murphy contributed to this report.

helping everyone understand that you'll need to work outs when he five minutes today and so that was Massey we.This collection.Really yeah Tyler program.And I actually appears in this a little known fact about me I love infomercials.I love them so when I'm up at night an ounce of into the channels I will skip past the show.And see an infomercial and stop everything and might get a snack cannot tell you something yeah.I love in commercials that it open and not because I have them I literally they're great.I'd flip through channels to see what I can buy M and it's so funny because will be sitting at home.And I'll say about it and statements and you can do to eyesore won't.The deal is that the I know you because I watched the infomercials intently.And counselor to see those transmission I don't wanna be buried the lead.Big day for use celebration in your book is out now John TT is for transformation.Unleash the seven superpowers.To help you dig deeper feel stronger and add your best Latin elation think you can add author to amber amber and author yet let's talk a book.I am so seven super powers.This is not necessarily of this book.It's not if it's not a fitness book in terms of your bodies have fitness but in terms of them.So for so many years having been a fitness industry for twenty years and having dean weak minds though asking.I'm third.And pack.Yes though I've been in a fitness industry for years and when I realizes a lot of people you know.Diego gave me this and meeting transformation.They take the photo of their cited gates at a waiting dictated beats and in literally less than two months later.Their backs and now feel angry.But personally.And thousands and thousands of taking thousands and thousands of people food test groups many many test group.Where they feel amazing and making strides in Maine and eight yes.Are happy for a few weeks and see them and then eight with their head down when he skinny because they have sustained transformations.Heart maintenance is hard.But that's marker in the book it's about fitness it's about some life it's about you journey use recreating this story and understanding that.Sustainability happens in these small steps.And as you know and a lot of people out there you know you've gained a week beat it's.Ellen is a symptom it's a simpler now it hasn't and so what I want you to do is understand that you have to connect at a sentence because.The struggles that you had.Produced the most amazing.Super powers that you can have been so.Everyone wants to get read.The trouble they went in this of that and they were English everything to go back and everything in the clause.Why if what if you actually reached in the closet and said you know I'm gonna face that I'm going to be transparent with Everett was kept me back and we're.Where can promise you.Is as you go through that thing you've been hiding them and you become transparent refused so.You're gonna find out there you're gonna find out that you develop an amazing strength from going through that struggle and so full weight loss in.Instead of saying mausoleums are excited and Indian government and now connect.Right down the successful moments ago because these are amazing superpowers in schools that you can use when you it's it and so that.If you have a tough day Wednesday with two number 45 you know.At weight loss when I was when I was 45 pound down and I had a plateau would that I do you can connect.You're addressing this very complex way.Because White House isn't about eating less and exercising more if it were that simple we look like you read.Lord for yogurt right you.A year and it's very complex and you mention any OC people on the hang their heads you know because they have not maintain their weight.And there's all the shame attached to it and what a really big moment for me.Was saying ashamed of having gained weight my weight fluctuating at shameful.YE a mechanic Harry and shame anymore it's a reality there's something happening in my life.I'd I'd behaved in a way that was counter to Michael's.I am now paying the consequences cutting back on track to additionally any shame in that so so when you talk about the super powers meteors really speaking to be how complex all of that is.So what are these superpowers that can help us you know companies do.So the first when I want to talk about which news.Something that a lot of people are freed of the first super powers actually uncomfortable.Being able to get a comfortable.And that leads to change right in so some people are so afraid of change change and a job change in.Oh my goodness have to eat something different or they print so much pressure on themselves at I don't know if I can do this and with uncomfortable on this.Calms the process of questioning yourself questioning whether you can actually commit.But if you think about it every day when you get out of bed you're meet putting yourself in an uncomfortable situation.How much gonna get through today common remember reached that deadline network.How my.Or if you do use to start on a fitness journey.And the many you say I'm going to start to try and lose weight guess what happens you have decided that you were gonna take uncomfortable steps because in order to progress.Yet the do something that's a little bit tougher than you do yesterday.And so that's what progressives.The do you find that when people start a fitness journey and they start putting themselves and physically uncomfortable situations.Are they able to then transitioned that to life to putting themselves and comfortable life situations is.Is there parallel there there's a parallel months ago.If it anyone who's ever done my work especially insanity they know that's I don't care about the week I care about how deep you and I want you to take the sixty days or however long Europe your personal program.I want you to take your sixty days or thirty days or whatever it is.An and connect to those moments that you haven't work better really tough and imagine you'd get through that moment now translate that into your life.So imagine for sixties or implicit position or you're you're human a Berne union.And you say for sixty days I've really had to garments from Amman say keep our trust in the lead in New York has passed that they're.That positive self talk immediately.Correlates with what's happening in your life in so you feel good about that so you have to take.The positive self talk that she doing your work and something to work and on.To produce immediate results and your body and produced the measles and what of one of the other superpowers that it you liken I had so many there's not an average in the time to time when our agenda the truth bombs I wanna get to an.Society that they couldn't guarantee debt.OK so one of my other one of my favorite super powers it is a superpower itself it's.Now and everyday conversation and most people talk about someone being selfish it's deemed as a negative connotation as saying.If someone call me selfish and most of the time out of morality say that the criticism right now with storm caused this officer Mike yup.Absolutely because if you are.Positively selfish at one point every single day of your life gas way you have given yourself the time you have given yourself.Positive self and NG deposits of talk the trust and believe in you aren't so the first thing I tell people to do in terms of being selfish is when you wake up every day.Instead of thinking about which you your boss needs or even is that I think about what your kids need unless there's an emergency.That seemed like blasphemy to save a mother I believe because of oxygen mask on first.I think that as it and that's the problem people's well.After due to smoke and the Deutzman the dias but imagine if you felt really good every single thing you do something amazing for you.You put it.That you give yourself the confidence and so now everyone else is going to benefit from your happiness.But if you don't it yourself excite me and you don't give yourself could and jeans in you don't give yourself.That one point today that it's all about you gets way you can start to be bitter toward everything else.So those superpower means selfish and understanding it is okay to give yourself the time it's their here's another example active and when it of the game itself is kind of funny so most at a time when someone compliments you you say yeah and asked him and lose this hour.That adventurous sorts of unionized UGC and accurate it is world wars and modest when I want you to do.From this lower maintenance so we're gonna try to authorities answers on the opinion a couple of use amazing your body fat each moment.Of true.Bell goes through go to comes across this office which he said dad in him.But it the first these.Org Seoul.And you say thank you to that that a pushing away the compliment we eat.Train ourselves to push away common we don't want attention because of how unhappy we are and so once you.Except be a little bit selfish it at that to be selfless.But if they human like Myanmar has been read read read about these its agreement Mike Hutton.And an aggregate my heart attack by bats every time because he wants me.And that's that there's a saying thank you I've been working really hard at this and thank you for noticing eggs and I mean it's a great great way to beat this itself.It's a truth bombs what it what are the truth bombs what is any truth bomb.A truth bomb as though is a direct quote for you to understand this is how eight days it's it's not a non sugar coated form where a speaking.And talking and listening in reading so that you get straight to the point because.A lot of times at a fitness journey.Or a weight loss journey or your relationship we eat sugar coat the issue where most people wanna hear exactly what is requiem in him.We can hand if you've ever been enough argument with your spouse disagree with someone.People beat around the bush in makes the conversation long normal line and then it just carries a hole went to extra words that you don't need to hear from me my messy streets and appoint what is the issue at hand and so that's the truth arm.And I wanna start I don't know if you have when you are talk about I don't slow.Here but I'm interest annaly youth thing is lime street and in her book is.What it once you are so wanted to want to want to focus on goes back to talk about about self love.And that is nothing looks as good as confidence field everyone thinks that you should only field when you reach that certain number but what if you walk out the house this very day after listening figures put on those fields lore.But on knows that new outfit and walk up and walked the runway as you walk down the steps your car as you walk into the officer you're walking.Through the parking lot ensued the office and I am laughing now on the I want you to walk the runway on which he deliberately looked act like.The gnarled as my stable world as must each because nothing looks as good confidence feel there are people out there who have a six pack who.On the cover of magazines and yet he talked to some of them they're still not happy they still say.All of that and he didn't lose this and I am I at that now with how do you feel right now and so connect to where you are.And be confident at this moment and so if you as you go along your journey if you walk the runway everything but if you had your speech everything today.By the end that you journey you have.Developed a positive self confidence that you can really take you actually be very motivating and motivations and have to come from place of loading.Oh look at these girls and I was dismissed miser that competence can be motivated.Pelican keep this up and get better yes which is a great places are touched the roles of the role because you know why right now you are the strongest person you're going to be you know so who love it it's there.I you people cancer an amiga and seated there.Most people can't seem at this moment that stretch marks on them arms mob and my hips and he's he really afridi naked in front of people does that bother you district mark bother you not anymore used oh goodness.Well one thing and never.Bother me and I am with every time I get more and only good thing about it me.Nothing about the that's an attractive in my opinion though about how to are stretched right now before at least you now light.Day it is what it is it is a reminder.That asthma and I got really big accidents vehemence lost the way right so.Now it's a reminder of mustering my accomplice.Sneaky.Appointment and that in Kenya union of putting out and acted a little small hide.And it's another treat but with an August another treat bombings calm atmosphere.Hayes accept it life as it is expect your responsibility to change.Because excuses arts schools of incompetence that built monuments into nothingness how those who specialize in them seldom accomplished anything else says don't.Don't saddle and and specialized in excuses if your life is this way.You either have to accept the responsibility to changes or excepted as it is an once you.Except the responsibilities change it because you have the power change and that's when it goes like.Rust.Raft but you have to either you're going to act on something done or you have to accept it to the way you can't have both weigh exactly about it and do nothing and so what I wanna.You know I wanna talk about this in.The reason why that truth bombs the special smears and might be job and had on the front rather being sexually abused as a young Qaeda and getting older and having that.Weigh heavily on the every single day.I was saying to myself and I'm connected to continue to be heavy armor and accept responsibility changed my life emigrant go to fair and face the demons that have happy.And when I realize it's as hard as cities.This steps to success and feeling so amazing when you actually like this before and you take the father Claude that you face and so.You know exception either of popular music that responsibility changes but the thing.No you can change what I think it's very easy for people on the outside looking in to look at you and say you're gorgeous your fit you have this you know huge successful fitness empire.Com.What you do know about struggle which is a lot you've had to face your stuff and deal with it.In a very rural very real way and so.You know I believe that life happens that ends in some people ma oh is that right.But I every seven years you have a major transition and transformation.And everyone is listening go back and think what happened seven years ago.So from the age of prima seven to fourteen.How is ours.From age of at the age of 78 years I was sexually abuse and and fourteen amid decision to move out of my house to make it changed left home fourteen F fourteen.At aged 21 eight.Came out as a gay male.At age it's funny I released my very first international Dina fitness program and so I've read everything and years.You have a major chance summation and so and I am married seven years ago and there's something happen and amazing as there are and what amounts are.Com anyway I just think that you know.If you actually pay attention TI from pay attention to what's going on are in your surroundings in your world.You will be able to connected these transitions and make the transitions and changes so great and monitor and adjust so that you can really keep control of what's happening.A lot of people really genuinely wants to do better when it comes to their.There health and Mamas and fitness and weight yes thumb and I was one of those people that for years I wanted to do better but I just did it really know how these so if you're speaking to in someone who wants to be fitter they they have a gold they've tried for years to accomplish it they can't get there and they don't know why.What advice would you give someone to be able to take a real look at what's standing in their way and deal with it.Right so when new things that I tell people at the beginning of a fitness Schoen.And I tell people who health leaders and at the tells someone on you know area high cholesterol or diabetes you have a lot of weight to lose you know.A tellem don't go into the room and tell this person you have a long road have you and you know you asked them what a great first step is.Problem with the human joy in life.Gonna talk about the problem because there they're there.Or or for yourself when you're looking into yourself you already know with the issue in the problem but would do I enjoy life.That's the first the second step is connecting to your story saying.You know you look on social media and there's the before picture and after picture but I'm I'm more concerned Rick.What happened before the before picture what was a journey to get to the before.And what's gonna happen after you take this snapshot and added that after phone right and so what's gonna happen.So that's the second thing connect NT journey and the successful steps where does that every day stepped that you can do took create positive social change because people go after.The big picture and I want people and a lot there don't put the pressure on yourself.Not everyone is you're not striving to be on the cover of fitness magazine right people get paid to do that as a force hype job but.Thank you I mean it's important for people to remember that it's yeah you're a fitness model or even if you're an actress and actor.That is your job to look like that but the rest of us have to go to a real job I mean not that's not that's not a real job we did not fitness related job and we have kids and grocery shopping in.It's a completely different way of what.If they're completely and that's why topping the don't.Looking at the cover of magazines and I have many friends who are fitness models and I love them I can tell you right now.They're like this is really hard this is very tough if you.I want people if you are listening if you Google.Fitness competitions art you know you'll see people really ripped and he grew go where having that that a figure competition you'll see because it's not sustainable rack and I want.Some important for people to know that even those people don't look like that any day of the week they have did get to competition.Baze they look like men onstage and then they don't.Right and I want to tell people my personal story when it comes back with people might say.Audience and the you fit you'd get an arms and lesson when I have a photo shoot their things that I do that I have to like.One of them really good and looked remotely immediately summoned the clinics have heard and don't drink water.Oh your muscles pop yes.So if things don't turn water pretty much for the last you sip water ice like the tests.Among its 36 hours and an in the morning.When UR's super meaning you haven't eaten UE.Wicks war chocolate in candy because what happens there's.It's sugar coats it actually pumps.That some people out there and I have a lot of difference you get this.Go beyond this amazing culture and eat really well and in the day activity.You look at him realize Panama on the ground and at because your body thank thank cute but here is that it's funny.But here is the ironic part about.That's why I believe in 85% how the 15%.And because you have to understand.You can eat healthy which you can still have five you know have to eat lettuce all day or just.You know born grow chicken you can go to the movies are happy.If you go to the movies remaining is when I'm happy and this is so thorough.Every dollar of their movies popcorn and the pretzel bites I don't know why I like Richardson and together.And some meaningless sound hires Avery as weak and now I'm just a guy 68.But generally I think a more saver Nam a modestly.I'm not mess is that don't even as Obama.At.But and I'm a firm believer in doubt don't eat what you don't like and don't do activities you don't like.So I tried for years to diet eating salad and then one else that you know what I don't like cold vegetables.I'll liked cooked vegetables so I'm married without again I don't want to there's no rule book that says that the only way to consume vegetables.So adding give you if you try to look for the things you like it's a little less pain painful.And and in terms of that offer some wanna say we have so much incumbent I hate coal forward if there but if got a failing to say when it's in terms of eating in human an amazing part of the witchy like other thing is.We knew ye ask yourself especially if you're in the beginning of the journey how's this gonna make me feel afternoon.It's important question because as the emotional eating which we've all done before trust me I've done it before but if you ask itself.Com I'm gonna feel after this is digested and am I gonna beat myself up for eating are among gonna celebrate right.So when you go to a party don't be afraid to eat cake because you can actually celebrate the moment with the people.Every day if it's you know late at night in yet the choose something.Watermelon somebody was literally from but you know eating watermelon is bad and the brownie and refrigerate it right it's the lesser evil writes the wood dale what's gonna make you feel better or even him breakfast lunch and Dynegy use an effective talking to your food and you don't have to do it physically out loud as it might be weird.But when you're looking at the menu or when you're in the grocery store talks at about what are you gonna do it right it should be worth it it

Toddler with dairy allergy dies after preschool allegedly fed him a grilled cheese sandwich Video:::::Transcript for Toddler with dairy allergy dies after preschool allegedly fed him a grilled cheese sandwich Now to a family's demand for answers.Their 3-year-old boy tragically died after eating a grilled cheese sandwich at preschool.His parents claim he was given the sandwich even though the school knew he was severely allergic to dairy and spoke with Adrienne Bankert.Good morning, Adrienne.Reporter: Good morning, everybody.Yes, this is a terrible tragedy.Now this father is hoping his child's life serves as a warning for others.This morning, outrage as details emerge about the death of 3-year-old Elijah Silvera.Something so simple could have been avoided if they would have just followed or paid attention to my son's needs.Reporter: Elijah's father saying he was at pre-k when he suffered a severe allergic reaction after being fed a grilled cheese sandwich last Friday.They allegedly called family members instead of 911, the boy's mother, not an ambulance rushing him to the hospital.I kept praying and praying and it was like, you know, this cannot happen.Reporter: Silvera says by the time he arrived he was too late.My wife comes out and I think everything is okay because she has her face seemed Normal but as I got closer she fell to the floor.Reporter: According to Silvera it was well documented his son had a dairy allergy and how dangerous it was for him to eat certain foods.He was an asthmatic and he had like so many different allergies from dairy was like the main source, peanuts, all berries.He was that kid that we had to watch over very seriously.We carried this emergency pack that would have benadryl and have tylenol that will have his epipen.I'm a chronic asthmatic myself and suffer from allergies so having that, you know, and, you know having that I know all the signs.Reporter: Several city agencies are looking into his death.The administration of children's services which runs the early education program tells us the New York City health department ordered the center to close.We expect in the investigation that we will learn more about the specific protocols that this particular site had in place.Elijah was strong, he was a fighter and I'm going to keep fighting for that boy just so people know that, you know, this is not the end of Elijah.Now, obviously the family devastated.With we talked to children's services staff they told us the school's executive director was very emotional and say nothing has ever happened at the school before like this.The school is clear of violations.You heard Thomas say they always had an emergency kit.With an epipen.It's just not clear if that kit was at the school with Elijah.Michael.Thank you very much, Adrienne.Here with Dr. Jen Ashton.Help us understand about these food allergies and we hear about food allergies, doc but mostly about nuts.Right.What exactly do we know about dairy allergies.When you think about food allergies there are eight common allerg Aller allergys.Dairy and milk, 2.5% of children, that's theirs.This is a partial list of things that can contain milk or dairy.So I like to say it's probably easier to know what you can eat than what you can't eat and with a 3-year-old or someone who is just barely verbal it can be really, really difficult.What about anaphylactic shock?There are a lot of myths about Anna father lack cyst.The biggest one if you don't have hives, that can't be an anaphylactic reaction.That's false.20% don't have skin findings.0% of people who die in anaphylaxis don't have hives.The other one things tend to get worse and worse.30% of the allergic reactions in schools in the last couple of years were the first time those people manifested food reactions so can come out of the blue and your past reaction does not predict the present or the future.And this is scary.The audience went whoa when they heard about it.What is your advice for parents with small children, with allergies who have to go to school.Look, I think they have to have a plan and that is key and that plan needs to be reviewed every year, sometimes multiple types a year with the teachers, the bus driver, the school nurse and there has to be a clear chain of events that involve the sign, symptoms, recognizing a possible reaction and the immediate use of an epinephrine auto injector if necessary and, Michael, I was telling you this hits home for me.I have had an anaphylactic reaction and developed them in my 30s so this is mine and I carry two of them with me at all times.Safe to carry them.Better safe than sorry.Yeah, and people need to know how to use them.I want to briefly show you because there are a lot of different products on the market.They all contain epinephrine.This one is actually comes with a trainer so I want you to listen to this.Pull off the top.This trainer contains no needle or drug.It talks to you.Okay.So this one talks you through it.Literally talks you through it and then the epinephrine auto injectors.People need to know how to use them.Take it out and pull off the blue top and apply steady firm pressure to the upper outer thigh even if you have to put it through clothing and hold it there for at least ten seconds until you hear a click release and then you call 911 and you go to the emergency room.People need to know how to use them.You might not only have to save your own life but someone else's.One thing to have it, another to know how to use it.We appreciate you, doc.Yeah,

'Motivated' podcast: How to gain weight and muscle in a healthy way Video:::::Transcript for 'Motivated' podcast: How to gain weight and muscle in a healthy way Entered I am.The so today we're here talking about healthy weight gain.And I'm gonna learn a lot today because having to tried to gain weight it's never been an issue for me it's always been kind of after stay there that are under two great guests paper as personal trainer and competitive bodybuilder who just finished her first camp dissing ventilation and air.And nutritionist Heidi is comic.I'm so this idea this this topic actually came from a listeners I want to give a shout out to her Miriam and to Allah.Amen she said you know I'm really naturally thin and I struggled to gain weight can you give me some guidance on healthy weight gain.You know you everyone goes through life with their own perspective and this was really eye opening for me because on the show we focus a lot about weight.Loss of not to myself yeah that's.Relevant for a lot of people the owner people who are struggling to gain weight in a healthy way who were underweight or want to put an unhealthy muscle.Until Basilan wanna talk about Tibet.Some Miller a lot this is summing I know nothing about so Heidi you know I in the rules of losing weight.You cut your calories increased car radio.Is the reverse automatically true if you want to gain healthy weight do you just after calories and sit around.Sitting on it ago way and he wanted to be healthy enough.It is true that there's a lot of opposite.When we talk about it but first let's just take that back and recognize that for those who are tiny keenly is unique to for the frustrating.And you're right so many of us think about we lost we lost weight loss it's hard to be that in the fat to somebody who's saying I just can't keep the weight.But for them it is a real struggle but what you would think it was an accident trying to lose weight you're like why you probably still eating too much you're not getting enough exercise.Is isn't a metabolic thing for people were trying to gain weight due to their body just burned through it too quickly or they really just not eating enough.While both want it is too they might be sort of you know high earners but what does that mean offer when you look at it through just like with weight loss has a lot of different reasons why you meet.And need to lose weight and sort of your approach where it's coming from.But for people who need to keenly it is true that often they get full very quickly as opposed to feeling like they never get.And they are under eating but they don't think their country and if you look closely they often.Other times it it is that they just might really be hard gainers in their very fat.And then they're not keeping up with the amount that their burning but.Exercise is crucial for weight gain as well especially if you want it to be.Muscle in healthy weight it's not all be health I mean people get a little.You know over Zealand's about this idea of only muscle weight when your putting on weight.Use there's usually broom to pump out muscle and mean Estes normally how we put on weight.On the other thing that often I find with planes Hugh who are trying to put on weight is.Again the opposite of people who are stressed eaters like their emotional eaters and get stressed they are for eat and since there's a lot of stress some light they offer you a lot.And they have to be into distinguished.For people who are trying to put on weight when they get stressed they don't.But in hampering for instantly for stressful you know every week they might make a few advances and then they get stressed in and they are not eating.And so the lose the weight they had even.That experience for the first time in my life this summer we're moving as life going on and I was so stressed out I.Wasn't eating and I lost like to Richard -- not much.After listening which never happens and I like wow I'd rather be stressed and losing weight and that the opposite which distressed and gaining weight and stresses me out more.I'm so big you're an expert if you will on putting on muscle but so on muscle gains so what is the prescription for that if you want it.Put on muscle idea to change your diet and headed to changer exercise routine well.Highlight flexible eating.So I do macro nutrients.So basically it's how he beef.And I tried to do really high high protein.01 point five grants into.Two grams or so more.That woman body weight is.So late that I am eating more protein thank you just filled me muscle little bit more and also as far as exercise I try to go heavier were less repetitions.So like how many reps do you aim figure trying to put Hamas bohemian rhapsody and I would go from eight to ten.The key to turn routes instead of doing lake fifteen if you just trying to toned.And burned.And then at ten are you really struggling or.Aria okay so it's not add to ten panic comfortably now she herself now when you hit six of southern you're ready struggling that you try to finesse.About eight to ten TK gets a ton perfect if not is the sufficient.And then how many.How many sets.Heard whenever body group you're working on that about three cents OK so the presets eight to ten wraps and didn't wait that means for exactly and then when it gets.Easy or manageable or you get to ten and it's no problem how much you're increasing your weight by how do you know how much to go.At the turns it could be five pounds extra.You know you just have to go with that and see anybody feels with a weak that you have in front of you.Illegal all of relieved because then if you struggling to breathe and you can't get to eight.They you know it's chewed too happy.So when you talk about much and macro nutrients an and I if these are pretty damn thing here you know you're talking about.Like your your break out of cars protein test there's a you're going for high.Hire a scene but what about your calorie intake overall I mean how how much it people will be looking to.Bring up their calorie intake tend to gain weight.I think need to go back to the the practicality of it because it's it's great to sort of made recommendations but to recognize again for those people to assimilate and be like when you're trying to lose weight to state eclipse.Okay thank them very much lately I never thought right wingers are.So it's it's often sort of behavioral.And recognizing.What happens for that person and so again if some think it's full easier you can't it's hard to just.That much more so it's it's more about OK so how do we look at your day.And for them it's eating more often because there's only so much more they eat one.So really making those snacks one important which.Again for people are losing weight they have snacks to help bridge the hunting accident gets hungry for.In this case he want to have those snacks because it's extra calories you otherwise wouldn't concede.But it still sounds like the same kind of discipline and commitment.Through.Oh OK I have to eat this because it's working towards Michael and it's right like when you support aid is kind of the very opposite if they if some of the tools that you have to loosely.Art to do.You smaller plates wealth for somebody turning keenly he's a bigger public has a look like a small report.If your goal is to me BB think about portion around.On carbohydrates start cards somebody tiny keenly you have more rights more cost more brand more so actually increase in harm's.Is actually very helpful because they're more politically dance.On your protein needs don't collect that much more they do but we came to eat enough for me mr. purposely not eating protein.You you don't need that much more routine while you're lifting to be able to put on the muscle you really need the energy to put on the mosque and you need the stimulus.Of the exercise depend on the muscle.So and depending you don't have did you know it depends again it is are you just like sort of a person exercising health and wellness are you at the screening for purposeful goal.And that that's really what's can it determine how you train.Because if you're.Training for wellness and you might not quite as much party.Right you don't need to do our junior thirty minutes again in the benefit of the car audio but we don't wanna be burning too much more focus on your strange from me.So your your training is gonna shift but.Act at the food part.You know vegetables you don't want to fill up untouchables.Lacey wanna get enough to be healthy but in China Philip untouchables you don't want to have water or soup or salad at the beginning of the meal.Because that fills you up.So instead you want to were collecting dense food first and then have your fluids and later as like opposite Danes and.Blowing my mind I.How do you handle arms at him and I do think carves the bad word that.I'm in love cars can be honestly.It is managing.Me and I just.Oh my intake it's not that high of cards only because again what I was screen enforce something totally different and indeed today.On the offseason my carb level as its higher than it would be fun training.To be on states.All the numbers at that point everything it's innocent it's very different it's very different.And when you're training to be on stage Arctic are you trying to like when you're trying to put on muscle.Do you use the scale as a tool or how are you measuring your your progress.I do it 3-D skin which you stand on that and it just calculates everything for you with the season that.I actually did an agriculture revolutionizing jurors think.They do a 3-D scanned that you could just stand on it and it calculates everything forays to see how you body with.What you're eating and your exercise if everything is actually.Mean Ireland England he dance where.As Andrea nickel at a 3-D scans or doesn't give you like body fat doesn't give you what what I think that's great if not nearly two measurement and obviously I that your body measure he OK anyway okay.So what it what is a good tool you know someone's trying to gain weight but there are gossiping a muscle which you know is heavier than fat.I mean is the scale than the the best school for a lot I hate to scale.So.Again I ate it so depends on what your goal is and we are starting so for many people are underweight.They're actually at higher risk they're immune insist on their muscular but their their bones.The Moscow or integrity there's so much else going on like it's different than trying to show put on muscle league.You went above and beyond because you were show there at your resume to that's different and somebody's walking around under way.Who's just trying to put and some weight and yes manners if it's mostly fat but really at that point strength training.Any lake it is dependent starting from a they've been doing strengthening or not they're gonna begin to see gains in their body will regulate so.Yes body composition is is definitely better than the scale but people can abuse body composition is while in terms of getting up so Aston.Over checking immediately and check every eight weeks or so it's not daily as Carroll is a tool.And it could be used or abuse can be misused it can be crazy making and not you know micromanaging.You know women who get on the scale every day who get on the scale multiple times in the day and you know they eat it you know the joke is he sees me again on the skillet heat cannot that you.He's definitely doesn't really matter pregnant not pregnant until I got bracelets.Everything about Sox.You know and so.So it's a senior trend and it's to get a sense dispute if he canteen in tears your own lake view if you felt great before you got on the scale.And then you get on the scam me feel horrible.Did you really changed just is that number what determined years you know cell work for the air had you been doing if you stick to the process.Whether that's for weight loss or weight gain.Yeah you're eating you know you have certain goals of whether to orbit Poulter who were carved serve more protein or whenever Nancy you stick in the process and you're exercising appropriately not too much not too little.Is that it's not like about how much more time chemist and an intent it can be.Well it could it could become compulsive.And that's not very healthy.So if your goal is for health and well being it's figuring out.Know how to exercise appropriately Hanoi eat in a way that's not too much not too little and into an island and in an imbalance he.And then wherever my weight is that's my realistically.Does there's an ideal weight which is usually not a true weight.And then there's a realistic weight which is the one you can manage that you Mullen exercising.I want to touch on on two things mentions he talked about aria so you might wanna scaled back on your party if you're trying to put weight on.But what about in the intensity do you also want to because you we want the benefits of coronary are still good for you.So how do you how do you balance that how do you make sure that you're doing what's good for your body but you're not working.Against your goals.Want you to fuel up for whatever it is so lake yes I believe I mean if you do hit trained in high intensity that's great.On it actually might even help to spur your appetite.So that's a good thing you want an exercise and had appetite working.We just only to burn so much that you can't eat and not when you're somebody who began isn't that hungry so that you're burning more than your Guinea eat.Right we don't need to be burning more it's not about.Getting to the gym and burning more when you trying to put on weight but it's about not exercising and not getting your carrion and enough to get the benefits it deftly wanna do.You deafening legal intense enough.And enough.But just not more rain and or do you do you carrion house Korea factor into your routine.I really don't do much to be on as if they do maybe twenty minutes.That's enough how often.Maybe three times a week and practicing here and how how much time do you spend on strength train.Centennial do about an hour.Because anomaly break only body parts when they do it it's mainly to two body parts at a time so it went heard what's your split in general that's a typical week like.Typical week I would do chest and bias.Than it would be back and try as and then I would do legs and Jim campaign attest in my Sam's bank back into triceps and packed.And then I would do legs I would to the glue it's and then I.Tackle my legs as well cedar hobbies on different day different days yes different days so I am right now I work out three days a week.I cut my days shorter because when you hit and stage actually worked and now.Five to six times a week and it could be twice that day.So in the offseason you know it's legal more leisure type my name and just to build a little bit more muscles I don't want to.Who too much harder to bernalillo that are most of them put in on.I try to keep it a little bit more limit it hinges just think our.Yeah I'm him but again.This thing about that is you've built up in your rating have been lines you can go more intensely during intimidate those people who gone more intensive meaning wouldn't do it.Right Atlantic great things better so bright for shore there's a lot of different ways to do resistance training yeah.Right there's a lot of different ways to still be healthy and and you know so it's.It's again very different it's wrinkled you're right and recognizing where you're starting in rewind go.He now a lot of women in particular are very concerned that if they start lifting weights they're going to get bulky.And you actually work very very very hard to build muscle that people think it's gonna have maxim that you pick up from three pound weights in the span class and all of a sudden you know your arms agreements but can you talk about that abound about the fear that women have that they are going to get bulky.And not look as feminine as they would like to if they start string training.We don't have since nationally commandos are as much as weak that you would want to listen I lift the very very happy Munich a squat 150 pounds on June 6 easing.I'm feminine so in order to get to that point it's very very hard naturally to do yet we can get mosque you learn a lot of ways and then when we need.When you take away a lot of the fat layers the muscles pops even more so special little you shall muscular thing you would.But you wouldn't have allowed match we look like a man.But instead we need to Centrino and it's actually beautifully get those mice curves in your body you get them wastes her own the most tones of separations.So to look like.To look like commandments.It naturally would not happen and generally are now scared now he should not be scared of nation embrace it and love it.Isn't a stronger than via strength Australia is there as sexy in a strict you know restraint that the new beautiful grin yeah.Com as something else that I hear a lot of that kind of drives me crazy is is when people talk but they want long lean muscle.And I have a friend who says.I've never seen a short stubby muscle leg muscles muscle right teen and developed him like there's this idea that you can likes to ratchet and get like a different and answers.Body by mean it what is that is that is Ares.I have to bat while women that a taller.The muscles are leaner and longer genetic there's.I think I ever be all that I kid that is an exit genetic potential that real.Vs ideal and we were formed different fiber types whether its fiber had wandered too fast twitch slow twitch and then there's this crossover.That you can train differently so more power.Is usually tends to be somewhat more I'm gonna say I'll hear from Acton of verses.Like endurance based empty seat runner's build persons who apparently after built.Right soccer and it is different sports tend to attract different types of body type to act of war and a morph.To there's different body types and when you trained those muscle fibers and activate.And so you're not gonna bureau long lean you're not gonna become.He any mean and it could be that Connecticut power sport posted lot of crossover and in you can train to accentuate what you have or to try to pull in those crossovers.So yes training does and it does if you train more like a ballerina.In between more like a power lifter you aren't going to develop good muscles somewhat differently but you're not gonna genetically.We just because you train like a ballerina doesn't union become five foot seven and long and recently if there's a self selection process of who

More than 103 million Americans will have high blood pressure under new guidelines Video:::::Transcript for More than 103 million Americans will have high blood pressure under new guidelines We turn next this evening to the major new health alert about high blood pressure the American Heart Association late today changing the guidelines when it comes to hypertension.Meaning nearly half of American adults could now be living with what's called the silent killer.Of course it affects both men and women so let's get rightly BC's chief medical editor doctor Jan asked engine always good to have you you've got the numbers what they used to be and what they now are tonight.Rate let's get right to those numbers under the old criteria someone had high blood pressure if they had a reading of 140 over ninety.Now it's an average reading of 130 over eighty the point behind this change is the thinking that it's better to treat the cause in this case high blood pressure.Then in effect like a heart attack or stroke to bring the number down in advance that a lot of people watching and homes and are gonna say this this Meehan and of the and medication now actually not necessarily and it's estimated that that number will only go up by 2% so the key here is lifestyle modification.Things like exercise and weight loss losing just 5% of your body weight.Lowering sodium intake and increasing potassium with foods like salmon avocados and bananas and limiting alcohol consumption no more than two drinks a day for man.And one drink a day for women this can bring down that number by an average of four to eleven points and every point matters Laurie doctor asked him with us tonight thank you Jan.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
Half of US adults have high blood pressure in new guidelines:::::New guidelines lower the threshold for high blood pressure, adding 30 million Americans to those who have the condition, which now plagues nearly half of U.S. adults.High pressure, which for decades has been a top reading of at least 140 or a bottom one of 90, drops to 130 over 80 in advice announced Monday by a dozen medical groups.The change means an additional 14 percent of U.S. adults have the problem, but only an additional 2 percent will need medication right away; the rest should try healthier lifestyles, which get much stronger emphasis in the new advice.Poor diets, lack of exercise and other bad habits cause 90 percent of high blood pressure."I have no doubt there will be controversy.I'm sure there will be people saying 'We have a hard enough time getting to 140,'" said Dr. Paul Whelton, a Tulane University physician who led the guidelines panel.But the risk for heart disease, stroke and other problems drops as blood pressure improves, and the new advice "is more honest" about how many people have a problem, he said.Currently, only half of Americans with high blood pressure have it under control.The upper threshold for high blood pressure has been 140 since 1993, but a major study two years ago found heart risks were much lower in people who aimed for 120.Canada and Australia lowered their cutoff to that; Europe is still at 140 but is due to revise its guidance next year.The guidelines were announced Monday at an American Heart Association conference in Anaheim.WHAT THE CHANGES MEAN The guidelines set new categories and get rid of "prehypertension": Normal: Under 120 over 80 Elevated: Top number 120-129 and bottom less than 80 Stage 1: Top of 130-139 or bottom of 80-89 Stage 2: Top at least 140 or bottom at least 90 That means 46 percent of U.S. adults have high pressure (stages 1 or 2) versus 32 percent under the old levels.How common it is will roughly triple in men under 45, to 30 percent, and double in women of that age, to 19 percent.For people over 65, the guidelines undo a controversial tweak made three years ago to relax standards and not start medicines unless the top number was over 150.Now, everyone that old should be treated if the top number is over 130 unless they're too frail or have conditions that make it unwise."The evidence with this is so solid, so convincing, that it's hard to argue with the targets," said Dr. Jackson Wright, a guidelines panel member from University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center.Older people "have a 35-to-50-fold higher risk of dying of a heart attack or stroke compared to younger people."But the Cleveland Clinic's Dr. Steven Nissen said he's worried."Some more vulnerable patients who get treated very aggressively may have trouble with falls" because too-low pressure can make them faint, he said.WHO NEEDS TREATMENT Certain groups, such as those with diabetes, should be treated if their top number is over 130, the guidelines say.For the rest, whether to start medication will no longer be based just on the blood pressure numbers.The decision also should consider the overall risk of having a heart problem or stroke in the next 10 years, including factors such as age, gender and cholesterol, using a simple formula to estimate those odds.Those without a high risk will be advised to improve their lifestyles lose weight, eat healthy, exercise more, limit alcohol, avoid smoking."It's not just throwing meds at something," said one primary care doctor who praised the new approach, the Mayo Clinic's Dr. Robert Stroebel.If people continue bad habits, "They can kind of eat and blow through the medicines," he said.The guidelines warn about some popular approaches, though.There's not enough proof that consuming garlic, dark chocolate, tea or coffee helps, or that yoga, meditation or other behavior therapies lower blood pressure long-term, they say.The government no longer writes heart guidelines, leaving it to medical groups.Unlike previous guideline panels, none on this one have recent financial ties to industry, although some on a panel that reviewed and commented on them do.The guidelines were published in two journals Hypertension and the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.HOW AND WHEN TO CHECK IT Blood pressure should be checked at least once a year by a health professional, and diagnosing high pressure requires 2 or 3 readings on at least two occasions.The common way uses a cuff on the upper arm to temporarily block the flow of blood in an artery in the arm and gradually release it while listening with a stethoscope and counting sounds the blood makes as it flows through the artery.But that is prone to error, and many places now use automated devices.The guidelines don't pick a method, but recommend measuring pressure in the upper arm; devices that work on fingers or are worn on wrists "aren't ready for prime time," Whelton said.Home monitoring also is recommended; devices cost as little as $40 to $60.WHAT ABOUT KIDS?Unlike adults, numbers for normal pressure in children vary with age, height and gender.Kids should be checked at least once a year for high pressure, say guidelines announced in August by the American Academy of Pediatrics.After age 13, the levels defining high pressure are the same as for adults, said a member of the pediatrics panel, Dr. Elaine Urbina of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center."When you turn 18 years and one minute, you shouldn't suddenly have a new definition," she said.Marilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP
How to lower your blood pressure without medication:::::The new recommendations on blood pressure from the American Heart Association (AHA) will significantly increase the number of Americans diagnosed with hypertension, particularly in younger age groups.The number of adult women under 45 with the diagnosis will double, while the number of adult men under 45 will triple.The number of Americans that are recommended medical treatment will only increase slightly.The AHA recommends lifestyle modification as a first line treatment.However, it is not always clear to patients which lifestyle modifications are the most effective.The below descriptions summarize which lifestyle modifications are recommended by the AHA, based on the latest available research.Stock Photo/Getty Images Diet changes The single intervention with the greatest documented effect on blood pressure is the DASH diet, a well-studied diet that encourages fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and discourages foods high in saturated and total fats.Research shows that this diet can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by approximately 11 mmHg.In addition, the guidelines recommend low-sodium diets (goal less than 1,500 mg per day, with the best effects seen at less than 1,000 mg per day), and diets rich in potassium (dried apricots, avocado, salmon, green leafy veggies and bananas).Low sodium and high potassium diets can lower systolic blood pressure by approximately 4-6 mmHg.Weight loss Losing weight improves health and well being in many capacities, but exactly how much to lose may be different for everyone.For those over 5 feet tall, an ideal body weight can actually be calculated mathematically.These numbers will change based on how tall you are, and the calculations are different for men and women.Formulating an individualized numerical goal in this way can help people reach a healthy body mass index.A normal, healthy BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 may be a good long-term goal, but in order to get there most physicians recommend losing 1 kilogram (or about 2.2 lbs.)at a time.The average American can expect a 1 mmHg drop in systolic blood pressure for every 1 kilogram reduction in body weight.Exercise Aerobic exercise yields the most benefit in lowering blood pressure.What constitutes enough?The experts say 90-150 minutes per week with heart rates up to 65-75 percent of one's heart rate.For strength training, the AHA recommends dynamic and isometric resistance exercises.Dynamic exercise is any exercise that involves joint movement, such as bicep curls, tricep dips or squats.Stock Photo/Getty Images Isometric exercise is typically done against immovable objects and includes planks, wall-sits and boat pose.Experts say weight training should be done three times per week and benefits are usually seen after 8-10 weeks of practicing.All of the above activities were seen to benefit people with hypertension with studies indicating a decrease of systolic blood pressures of approximately 4-8 mmHg.Alcohol consumption For drinkers, limiting the amount of alcohol consumed has a beneficial impact on blood pressure.Studies find that drinking in moderation lowers systolic blood pressure by up to 4 mmHg.For men, AHA recommends drinking less than or up to two drinks daily, and for women only up to one drink daily.In fact, decreasing alcohol intake even proved to reduce blood pressure in patients who had not been diagnosed with hypertension yet.Consult with a health care professional While the above recommendations can change blood pressure for a large share of those with hypertension, there are still millions of Americans for whom lifestyle modifications are not enough.Consult with your health care professional to see which intervention, medication or otherwise, is right for you.
Man: Psychiatric hospital staff tormented, kicked brother:::::A man who says his brother was abused repeatedly by staff at Connecticut's only maximum-security psychiatric hospital urged lawmakers on Monday to look more deeply into the case and make changes at the state-run facility.Al Shehadi said he came forward to give a name to the victim at the center of internal and criminal investigations, to tell his brother's story and to "encourage this committee to continue to investigate what happened.""The abuse my brother suffered is hard to imagine," Shehadi told members of the General Assembly's Public Health Committee.He described seeing surveillance video of workers flipping his brother, Bill Shehadi, off a bed, pouring liquid over his head and mopping his head with a floor mop.He said there are roughly 50 episodes of abuse over 24 days, most occurring when his brother was sleeping."The videos I saw convey an atmosphere of almost constant menace," he said, describing how staff would circle his brother's bed and kick and torment him."It was the feeling of cats playing with a cornered mouse that was most disturbing to me."Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services Commissioner Miriam Dephin-Rittmon voiced surprise during Monday's hearing at the extent of abuse that took place at the Whiting Forensic Division of the Connecticut Valley Hospital in Middletown, telling lawmakers her agency is working to understand how it happened without the knowledge of higher-ups.Lawmakers are expected to consider possible reforms when they reconvene in February.The commissioner called it "very troubling" that 37 staff members have been implicated and that abuses weren't reported."We are working very hard to understand how this could happen and what other measures we should take to ensure this will never happen again," she said.Whiting is part of Connecticut Valley Hospital, a psychiatric care complex run by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services.It includes 106 beds for patients in maximum security and 141 beds for those in enhanced security.The patients include people found not guilty of murder and other crimes by reason of insanity and other people committed voluntarily or involuntarily by civil courts.Al Shehadi said his brother slipped into deep depression decades ago and became increasingly psychotic, eventually killing their father.Ten employees have been arrested and seven fired in connection with the hospital abuse case.An internal investigation is continuing, and Dephin-Rittmon said additional disciplinary actions may be taken.Whiting's chief operating officer and director of nursing have been removed, while an outside security firm has been hired to monitor live camera feeds around the clock.A former top Whiting official has been named acting director, and a behavioral health consulting group has been hired to help identify and rectify systemic issues, Delphin-Rittmon said.Delphin-Rittmon said she believes fear and intimidation contributed to why the abuse continued without the knowledge of top Whiting officials.While not naming Bill Shehadi, a recent state Department of Public Health report found staff members put a diaper on the patient's head, threw food at him, put salt in his coffee and kicked, jabbed, poked and taunted him this year.The agency investigated at the request of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which regulates the hospital, following a whistleblower complaint.Delphin-Rittmon said video evidence of the abuse "has sickened and haunted" her.State Sen. Heather Somers, the Republican Senate chair of the Public Health Committee who pushed for Monday's hearing, said she believes the state needs to do more to address a systemic problem of bullying and fear of retaliation among employees.
Police: Man shoots doctor outside hospital, kills himself:::::Police say a man shot a doctor in an Ohio hospital parking lot before killing himself.The police chief in Massillon (MAS'-ih-luhn) says it appears the doctor was shot twice Monday afternoon while walking to his vehicle.Police Chief Keith Moser says the doctor was in surgery at the hospital, but he didn't know the severity of his injuries.He says the shooter had parked next to the doctor's vehicle and that he died from a gunshot wound to the head.A man who lives near Affinity Medical Center tells The Independent newspaper he heard about six shots Monday afternoon.The hospital and nearby schools went into lockdown after the shooting.
Emotional toll of diabetes 'needs more recognition':::::Image copyright Getty Images Many people living with diabetes are struggling with related emotional problems - an issue that needs support and recognition, a charity says.Diabetes UK surveyed 8,500 people about diabetes and how it affected their daily life.Three in five said their condition made them feel down.Of those in employment, 16% felt discriminated against at work - and 7% had not even told their employer about their diabetes.Clare (not her real name), 26, says she had to quit her job as a management consultant as a direct result of her diabetes.She was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 13.Despite being one of 4.5 million people affected by the condition in the UK, she says the "lack of understanding" she encountered in the workplace left her feeling "frustrated, anxious and stressed"."I was constantly undermined and told that my diabetes wasn't that serious," says Clare."This included being told off for having medical appointments during the day, and being made to feel bad for talking about my diabetes."I don't want to be treated differently, but sometimes I need to be treated differently," she tells BBC News."You're young and in your 20s and people on the Tube look at you and ask, 'Why do you need a seat?'"No-one knows I have an insulin pump attached to my bra, my blood sugars are being monitored and I am constantly thinking about food."She says her employers "never sat down and talked to me about it".In an appraisal, she was told she needed "to manage her health anxiety"."Eventually, I decided that enough was enough, and I quit my job so I could spend some time taking care of myself," she says.She says diabetes "is not a dirty secret - it's part of my life"."There needs to be more talking in the workplace - and more flexibility."Life-changing The number of people diagnosed with diabetes - type 1 and type 2 - is on the rise.According to Diabetes UK, about 700 people are diagnosed every day.And it's a life-changing diagnosis.Those affected often have to check their blood sugars up to 10 times a day and plan their meal breaks - and what they will be eating - factoring in any exercise they may be doing.Trips to the toilet can break up a night's sleep.And then there can be hypos - when blood sugars drop dangerously low.Diabetes Diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar to become too high.Type 1 can develop at any age, but often begins in childhood.It is not related to diet or lifestyle Type 2 is far more common than type 1, but is still rare in childhood.It is usually seen in adults and is often associated with obesity It is important to keep blood sugar under control to prevent health complications Symptoms of type 2 diabetes include - feeling very thirsty, passing urine more often than usual, particularly at night and feeling very tired The latest research - published to mark World Diabetes Day - cites six areas where Diabetes UK believes treatment could be improved, including: better access to specialist healthcare professionals broader emotional support following a diagnosis "Effective diabetes care requires that a person's emotional needs are taken into account alongside their physical care needs," said Chris Askew, chief executive of Diabetes UK."We want to see a system where specialist support - from people who understand diabetes - is made available to those who need it."Healthcare professionals can provide help and support.
Liver test to aid paracetamol overdose treatment:::::People who overdose on paracetamol could be helped by a blood test that shows immediately if they are going to suffer liver damage.Researchers in Edinburgh and Liverpool said the test would help doctors identify which patients arriving in hospital need more intensive treatment.The blood test detects levels of specific molecules in blood associated with liver damage.The three different molecules are called miR-122, HMGB1 and FL-K18.Previous studies have shown that levels of these markers are elevated in patients with liver damage long before current tests can detect a problem.Free up beds A team led by the Universities of Edinburgh and Liverpool measured levels of the three markers in more than 1,000 patients across the UK who needed hospital treatment for paracetamol overdose.They found the test could accurately predict which patients are going to develop liver problems, and who may need to be treated for longer before they are discharged.The test could also help identify patients who could be safely discharged after treatment, freeing up hospital beds.About 50,000 people are admitted to hospital each year in the UK due to paracetamol overdose.Many people unknowingly consume too much by taking paracetamol at the same time as cold and flu medications that also contain the drug.Liver injuries are a common complication of drug overdoses.In some cases the damage can be so severe the patient needs a transplant and, in rare instances, can be fatal.Patients with a life-threatening level of paracetamol in their blood can be treated with an antidote called acetylcysteine, given by intravenous drip.The treatment is associated with side effects so doctors do not treat patients longer than necessary.Large workload The researchers said the test could help to pinpoint patients who are unlikely to benefit from treatment.The study, published in the Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, was funded by the Edinburgh and Lothians Health Foundation and the Medical Research Council.Dr James Dear, of the University of Edinburgh, said: "Paracetamol overdose is very common and presents a large workload for already over-stretched emergency departments."These new blood tests can identify who will develop liver injury as soon as they first arrive at hospital.This could transform the care of this large, neglected, patient group."
Drivers 'should have compulsory eye tests':::::Image copyright Getty Images Drivers should have compulsory eye tests every 10 years, the Association of Optometrists has said.One in three optometrists say they have seen patients in the last month who continue to drive with vision below the legal standard, their association said.Motorists must read a number plate from 20m (65ft) in the practical driving test, but there is no follow-up check.The Department for Transport said changes to eyesight should be reported by motorists to the DVLA."All drivers are required by law to make sure their eyesight is good enough to drive," a spokeswoman said.Data from the Department for Transport shows seven people were killed and 63 were seriously injured in accidents on Britain's roads last year when "uncorrected, defective eyesight" was a contributory factor.'Outdated laws' Nine out of 10 optometrists believed the existing rule - that put the onus on motorists to report themselves to the DVLA if they develop eyesight problems - is insufficient.When drivers pass the age of 70, the emphasis changes a little.Drivers must actively make a declaration every three years that they are fit to drive.As part of that they must confirm that they meet the minimum eyesight requirement.Brenda Gutberlet, whose 28-year-old niece Natalie Wade was killed in 2006 by a 78-year-old driver who was blind in one eye, says she wants the "outdated laws on drivers' medical fitness" changed.Ms Gutberlet, from Canvey Island, Essex, said her niece died just months before her wedding and that she does not want other families "to go through what we have".Optometrist Dr Julie Anne-Little said Britain "falls behind many other countries" because of the initial number plate test and the self-reporting of eyesight problems."Because sight changes can be gradual, often people won't realise that their vision has deteriorated over time," she said.
Sex unlikely to cause cardiac arrest, study finds:::::Image copyright Getty Images Sudden cardiac arrest is associated with sexual activity far more often in men than women, research suggests.But sex is a rare trigger for sudden cardiac arrest.Only 34 out of the 4,557 cardiac arrests examined occurred during or within one hour of sexual intercourse and 32 of those affected were men.Sumeet Chugh, of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute, said his study is the first to evaluate sexual activity as a potential trigger of cardiac arrest.The research was presented at a meeting of the American Heart Association.A cardiac arrest happens when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating.It causes someone to fall unconscious and stop breathing and unless treated with CPR, it is fatal.This differs from a heart attack, where blood flow to the heart is blocked.It is known that sexual activity can trigger heart attacks, but the link with cardiac arrest was previously unknown.Cardiac arrest facts Almost 90% of people who suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrests die Every minute without cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or defibrillation reduces someone's survival chances by 10% CPR, especially if performed in the first few minutes of cardiac arrest, can double or triple a person's chance of survival During CPR, you should push on the chest at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute.The beat of the Bees Gees' hit Stayin' Alive is a perfect match for this Source: American Heart Association Dr Chugh and his colleagues in California examined hospital records on cases of cardiac arrest in adults between 2002 and 2015 in Portland, Oregon.Sexual activity was associated in fewer than 1% of the cases.The vast majority were male and were more likely to be middle-aged, African-American and have a history of cardiovascular disease.The study also found CPR was performed in only one-third of the cases, despite them being witnessed by a partner.Dr Chugh said: "These findings highlight the importance of continued efforts to educate the public on the importance of bystander CPR for sudden cardiac arrest, irrespective of the circumstance."He said it shows the need for people to be educated about how to administer CPR.Another study presented at the conference showed children as young as six can learn it.After a heart attack or surgery, the British Heart Foundation suggests patients should typically wait four to six weeks before resuming sexual activity.
New Scottish GP recruitment plans to cut workload:::::Image copyright PA The Scottish government has announced plans to deal with problems in recruiting GPs.They are part of a proposed new contract for the profession, which aims to cut workload and make it easier to run practices.The NHS across the UK is having trouble attracting people to become GPs.Many doctors have stayed away from general practice because of the financial risk of having to buy or lease their own premises.The Scottish government has now announced a fund to tackle that and has promised to cut bureaucracy so GPs can spend more time with patients and less on paperwork.If GPs vote to approve the new contract, it will come into force in April next year.'Right care' Health Secretary Shona Robison, who is visiting a GP practice in Clydebank to meet staff and patients, said: "GPs tell us they want to spend more time with patients and less time on bureaucracy, while patients say they want better access to GPs when they really need them."We have listened and, I believe, we have achieved that balance."These changes, agreed jointly with the British Medical Association, will give patients the right care in the right place.Patient safety is at the very heart of this agreement and is the central principle guiding how changes will be implemented."She added that the Scottish government was also investing in facilities that will offer more doctors the chance to enter the profession."We are confident that this contract best supports Scotland's primary healthcare needs while also making general practice an even more attractive employment prospect for doctors," she said.
'Urgent need' for football header research:::::Image copyright Stirling University Scientists investigating links between heading footballs and dementia say there is an urgent need for more research.It follows the screening of a BBC documentary "Dementia, football and me", featuring Alan Shearer.Last year, scientists at Stirling University found just one session of heading a ball could lead to an immediate decrease in brain function.They said more work was needed to assess long-term effects.The academics have called for funding for further studies looking at the risks of heading footballs.The BBC documentary, which was screened on Sunday night, heard from current and retired professional footballers, the relatives of former players diagnosed with dementia, the Football Association (FA), the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) and scientists in sports medicine.Many of those interviewed raised concerns that there could be a link between heading the ball and brain health but said that more research was required.Image copyright Stirling University The documentary included footage of former England international Shearer undergoing tests in a lab at Stirling, where academics have, for the first time, found direct evidence of brain changes immediately after heading a ball.The FA and PFA have commissioned research into whether the degenerative neurocognitive disease is more common in ex-professional footballers than the rest of the population.But cognitive neuroscientist Dr Magdalena Ietswaart and Dr Angus Hunter, reader in exercise physiology, said more funding was needed for scientific studies that would provide understanding of the risks associated with heading footballs.'Definitive answers' Dr Ietswaart said: "We do not yet know whether there is a definitive link between football and dementia.This can only be discovered by carrying out research in this area."Scientific developments open up a new approach that is achievable but requires a robust funding drive.If you want real answers, you need to understand what is happening in the brain; what is cause and effect, the approach we use here at Stirling."Until now, we did not have sensitive or direct ways to identify how moving a ball with your head can impact brain health."However, we now have stronger neuroscience emerging that can look directly at what goes on in the brain as a result of heading the ball."Image copyright Stirling University She added: "We have applied these techniques here at Stirling but there is a lot more that we, and others, can do to give definitive answers on the dangers of heading."Current neuroscience has substantial promise in providing the evidence-base on the effects playing football has on brain health that is currently lacking."The tests undertaken by Shearer showed immediate brain changes after heading the ball - the same changes observed in participants who took part in the landmark study.The research, published in EBioMedicine, is the first to show direct evidence for short-term sub-concussive changes in the brain following any sport-related impact.After meeting the Stirling team, Shearer said: "Football should be encouraging these universities to do as much research as possible but, like everything else, these universities need funding."There's enough money around nowadays in football but not enough of it is being given to research.It is about time we had more definitive answers."Dr Hunter said: "As conveyed by the BBC documentary, our study is the first to show changes in brain function after heading the ball."Combined with the anecdotal evidence, our research and this documentary should provide the stimulus for further scientific research to be carried out in this area."The research was funded by the National Institute of Health Research.
Major trauma care gap means patients die 'unnecessarily':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Prof David Lockey is heading up clinical efforts to establish major trauma network Up to five seriously injured patients in south Wales die unnecessarily each month because the region is not part of a major trauma network, an expert in emergency care has said.Prof David Lockey said a lack of specialist treatment meant lives were "being lost all the time".Plans to establish a major trauma network for the region have been put to public consultation.South Wales is the only region in England and Wales not in a network.Both Swansea's Morriston Hospital and Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales had bid to become Wales' first major trauma centre (MTC).In June, a panel of independent experts concluded Cardiff was the preferred option as it is Wales' only specialist neurosurgery hospital and home of Noah's Ark Children's Hospital of Wales.The panel recommended Morriston Hospital should be a major trauma unit as part of the wider network.Experts from Morriston Hospital had argued it was better located to become an MTC - with a greater proportion of the south Wales population living within an hour's travelling time.Morriston also has a well-established burns and plastics surgery unit - which serves Wales and south west England.Image copyright Mick Lobb/Geograph Image caption UHW at the Heath in Cardiff has been earmarked as the preferred option for a major trauma unit in south Wales What is a Major Trauma Centre?A designated, specialist hospital responsible for the care of the most severely injured patients Experts in a wide range of injuries are available 24/7 If it is safe to do so, critical cases are usually taken there directly instead of to the nearest A&E Major trauma cases are relatively rare but getting the right care quickly can make a huge difference to survival chances The first was established in London in 2010; four are planned in Scotland MTCs work within a network of other hospitals - designated major trauma units (MTUs) Patients in north Wales, and much of mid Wales are already part of the West Midlands major trauma network - since 2012 people from these areas with life-threatening injuries have been routinely transferred to the MTC at the Royal Stoke Hospital.Among those to have benefited from that arrangement is Megan Jones, who nearly died after a road crash in Gwynedd five years ago, when she was 17."Being in a major trauma centre and having the expertise in the various injuries I had was the key to giving me the correct and highest standard of treatment for my recovery," she said.Image copyright Family photo Image caption Megan Jones has overcome the serious injuries she sustained in a road crash Prof Lockey has been running the Severn Trauma Network based around the MTC in Bristol for the past five to six years and is heading up clinical efforts to establish a major trauma network in Wales.He said: "If one of your family or friends has a major trauma your chances of surviving are much higher and that is my priority.The details are slightly less relevant."Lives are being lost all the time."We're looking at a 25% to 30% reduction in mortality [since major trauma networks were established[ in England - that's around 600 lives a year."If you scale that down to a population of 2.3 million that we're talking about in south Wales we're talking about 45-60 lives a year."So every month we don't put a trauma network in we're losing 4-5 lives unnecessarily."He said south Wales could learn lessons from already established networks and become "a leading light" in the area.
'I'm dealing with life-threatening situations:::::Image copyright Trinity Mirror Publishing Ltd Image caption Hayley and Holly Smallman "She can have up to up to 40 seizures a day - potentially each one could be dangerous."Hayley Smallman's 15-year-old daughter Holly has a series of complex, life-limiting health conditions.Her cerebral palsy, chronic lung disease and epilepsy mean she needs 24-hour care at their home in Liverpool.It is estimated there are 40,000 children like Holly living with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions in England alone.Many of them need palliative care round-the-clock, which is largely provided at home by their families but with the support of community children's nurses and community paediatricians.'Alone and scared' Hayley says: "I have a community matron and a community physio.They work Monday to Friday, 9am till 5pm.They are great."But when it comes to out-of-hours and weekends, Hayley says she is left without any support."We don't have anyone through the night, we don't really have anyone at the weekend."I'm dealing with life-threatening situations, and if I make the wrong decision that could have a serious impact on Holly."I feel like I'm trying to do a job, but I'm not given the right tools to do the job, and I feel quite isolated and alone and scared sometimes."I'm not a clinician, I'm a mum.To have that support, it's like when somebody gives you that hug and says, 'it's going to be ok.' "Sometimes we need that - it shouldn't be a luxury - it's a necessity."Image copyright Hayley Smallman Image caption Holly with her mum Hayley and dad Gary Out-of-hours Hayley is not alone.BBC Radio 5 live Investigates has seen a new report by the charity Together for Short Lives which describes the commissioning of children's palliative care as 'patchy and inconsistent'.The charity submitted Freedom of Information requests to every Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) in England asking what services they commission for children who need palliative care.In all, 199 (94%) CCGs provided data.It revealed that, while nearly all CCGs commission community children's nursing teams, just two-thirds (67%) could say that they commission them to provide care out-of-hours and at weekends.If this support isn't in place, families say they have to call an ambulance or go to A&E."We know how much it disrupts Holly to take her into hospital because she's so comfortable at home," said Hayley."Also, because she is so immunocompromised, going into a hospital environment potentially brings more risk to her."Liverpool CCG said it couldn't comment on individual cases, but that it did offer out-of-hours access to very high quality children's palliative care.Services are provided by Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust.Alder Hey said: "The community children's nursing team is commissioned to provide an extended hours seven day service, but not 24/7."The community paediatricians do not provide a 24/7 service except for safeguarding."Liverpool CCG added: "It would not be appropriate for us to discuss details about an individual's care, but we would urge the family to raise any issues about their care with their provider in the first instance, or with us as a commissioner if they would prefer."'Not a nine-to-five job' Following a review in 2015 into end-of-life care the government said that, where possible, children should be cared for at home with the support of community services.But this new research shows that only a third of CCG's in England could say they are implementing this commitment.Barbara Gelb, chief executive of Together for Short Lives, said the government should undertake a review of children's palliative care as a matter of urgency: "It is not a nine-to-five job.A child's condition can deteriorate very quickly, and being able to call on a community service in the middle of the night is crucial to help families cope at these times. "A spokesperson for NHS Clinical Commissioners, the membership organisation for CCGs, said it was encouraged that the report showed improvement in some aspects but acknowledged there was more work to be done.It added, "Commissioners are having to make really difficult decisions on a daily basis about how to use the finite funding they have been allocated".The Department of Health has said it will look at the report's recommendations closely.A spokesperson said the NHS is expected to provide "a personalised and dignified service" that takes account of families' wishes.They added "We recently published the government's end of life care commitment so that by 2020 there will be significant progress in patient choice, increased personalisation of care and improved quality and availability of services".5 live Investigates is broadcast on Sunday 12th November 2017 at 11am GMT.If you've missed it you can catch up on the iPlayer.Have you got something you want us to investigate?We want to hear from you.Email us.
Did you know you should give under-fives vitamin tablets?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Children between the age of six months and five years should take vitamin A, C and D supplements, government advice says - do you find this surprising?If you do, it seems you're not alone.Researchers in Wales found only 30% of parents and carers said they had ever been given advice by a health professional about giving young children vitamin supplements.And nearly two-thirds (64%) of those asked said they didn't give their children vitamin supplements.The Department for Health (DoH) recommends all children aged six months to five years should be given supplements containing vitamins A, C and D every day.This advice has been in existence since the early 1990s, when it was endorsed by the then committee on medical aspects of food policy.The DoH also says breastfed babies should be given a daily vitamin D supplement from birth.'Thought healthy diet was enough' The Welsh researchers wanted to find out how well known this advice was among parents and carers.They surveyed adults accompanying children at paediatric out-patient clinics in two hospitals in Swansea.A total of 101 filled out questionnaires designed to test their knowledge of the guidelines.The researchers said the most common reasons given by parents for not giving their children vitamin supplements were: They were unaware that they should/had not been advised They thought a healthy diet was enough "We are concerned that the majority of carers participating in our survey do not follow guidance around vitamin supplementation for their young children," the report says."Many seem unaware of recommendations, suggesting that health professionals are not providing them with information."We feel that action needs to be taken to raise carers' awareness and encourage a much wider use of vitamin supplements in the under-fives, with health professionals adopting a more proactive approach."Dr Bethan McMinn, paediatric registrar at the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board, said the complexity of the guidelines could be a barrier for effective information sharing between professionals and parents.She said that while the DoH recommends all children aged six months to five years take a daily supplement, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has recently updated its advice.It now says that all babies from birth to one year should take a daily Vitamin D supplement - but this does not apply for infants having 500ml a day of formula milk.Dr McMinn acknowledges her research is small scale, but says it could well reflect the situation across the UK."Our project was conducted in Swansea, Wales so it is difficult to comment on whether our findings reflect the situation across the UK in general."However it would not surprise me if this were the case."Image copyright Getty Images Prof Mary Fewtrell, nutrition lead at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the Swansea research suggested healthcare professionals were not routinely sharing the information with new parents."I suspect in large part this is due to the complex and conditional nature of the guidelines leading to confusion and that we would be likely to see a similar picture in other parts of the country."Further research is needed to establish if this is the case and, if so, how to best overcome these challenges so that our children can receive the best possible nutrition."Prof Louis Levy, head of nutrition science at Public Health England, said: "All children aged six months to five years should take a supplement containing vitamins A, C and D. "This is a sensible step because growing children may not get enough of these vitamins - especially those not eating a varied diet."The research was presented at the Welsh Paediatric Society autumn clinical meeting.
UK most overweight country in Western Europe says OECD:::::Image caption Britain now has a "considerably worse" obesity problem than the other OECD nations Britain is the most obese nation in Western Europe, with rates rising faster than any other developed nation.Obesity rates have doubled over the past two decades, and 63% of UK adults are overweight, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Britain is now sixth heaviest - "considerably worse" than the rest of the 35-member club of wealthy nations.The UK's comparatively high adolescent drunkenness rate is also a key concern.However, the OECD Health at a Glance report said the overall health and life expectancy of Britons remained average - aided by a reduction in smoking and adult drinking - despite a noted shortage in hospital beds and staff.British obesity rates have grown to 27% of people with a body mass index (BMI) above 30.The OECD average is 19%.Overweight people have a BMI between 25 and 30.The OECD lists the UK as one of five countries suffering from "historically high" rates of obesity since the 1990s - increasing by 92%, compared to 65% in the United States."Obesity means higher risk of chronic illnesses, particularly hypertension, cholesterol, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases," the report said.Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The UK obesity rate has doubled over the past two decades The OECD recognised campaigns to fight obesity, such as the decision by hospitals in England to ban 'super-size' chocolate bars from hospital outlets, and the impending government sugar tax, but said "more could be done".A number of OECD nations, such as Australia and Canada, have managed to reduce and stabilise obesity levels in recent years, but Japan remains lowest at 4%.Britain is, however, doing better at tackling child obesity.Figures show it is stable at 24%, remaining below average over the past decade, at a time when it is increasing rapidly across the rest of Europe.Adolescent drinking 'problematic' Although smoking rates are down, harmful alcohol consumption among adolescents continues to be a problem.Image caption The OECD said drunkenness among adolescents remained a concern The OECD found that 30.5% of 15-year-olds admit to having been drunk at least twice in their life.This is considerably higher than the 22% average.Health service squeeze Good access to treatment remains stable for patients, although the number of doctors and nurses is down per head by 18 and 12% respectively.The report praises improvement in some cancer outcomes, with the survival rate for breast and rectal cancer surpassing the average for the first time.However, colon cancer survival rates are still below average.Delays over patient discharges are worsening."Since 2013, England has seen a significant increase in the number of days people stay in hospital after a doctor declares them ready to be discharged or transferred, reaching over 30 additional bed days per 1000 population in 2015," the report said."This increase largely reflects ongoing health or social care services not being ready to receive patients," the report concluded.
Thousands of out-of-hours doctor shifts unfilled:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Unfilled shifts are symptomatic of wider pressures on the NHS, says the BMA Thousands of GP evening and weekend shifts are going unfilled in the Western Health and Social Care Trust area, the BBC has learnt.Western Urgent Care, which provides the GP out-of-hours service in the western area, could not cover 3,800 shifts during the last three years.The information was obtained via a Freedom of Information (FOI) request by BBC Radio Foyle.Dr Tom Black of the BMA, said the situation is "not good for patients".The chair of BMA's Northern Ireland general practitioners committee said unfilled shifts are symptomatic of wider pressures on the service."When you don't fund the service and let the workload build up, and fail to train a workforce, you end up with a lot of empty shifts, which is not good for patients," he said.Dr Black said the lack of shift cover is currently being investigated by the Regulations and Quality Improvement Authority.The FOI request further revealed that the out-of-hours service has used more than 120 medics over that time period, with one individual doctor earning more than 250,000.A spokesperson for the Department of Health said it intends to deal with medical vacancy rates "as part of a future workforce strategy.""We recognise that increasing agency and locum costs are not sustainable, particularly at a time of serious financial pressures right across the public sector," added the spokesperson.Out-of-hours services in the western area operate at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry, Limavady, Strabane, Omagh and Enniskillen and are covered by both GPs and locum doctors.They operate in the evenings and at weekends, when GP surgeries are closed.The BBC has asked all six health trusts in Northern Ireland for information on the performance of their out-of-hours service.At present only the Western Trust has responded.
Cervical cancer jab women will 'only need three smears':::::Image copyright DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Image caption The current HPV vaccine is given in two doses Women vaccinated against human papilloma virus (HPV) - thought to cause about 99% of cervical cancers - may only need three smear tests in their lifetime, a new study suggests.Since 2008, the HPV vaccine has been offered to girls aged 11 to 13.Reported cases of HPV have fallen sharply since then.A team from Queen Mary University of London found that screenings at age 30, 40 and 55 would offer the same benefit to these young women as the current 12.Prof Peter Sasieni, the lead author of the study, said cutting the number of smear tests for vaccinated women would make sense and save money."These women are far less likely to develop cervical cancer so they don't need such stringent routine checking as those at a higher risk," he said."This decision would free up resources for where they are needed most.The change in the screening system is a unique opportunity to reassess how often women are invited for cervical screens during their lifetimes."'Great news' The study, published in the International Journal of Cancer and funded by Cancer Research UK, comes ahead of changes being planned to the screening programme in England for 2019 and similar adjustments in Scotland and Wales.At the moment, labs test for abnormalities in cells taken in a smear test but the new tests will check for the presence of HPV first and only check for abnormal cells if the virus is found.The study says that when the new HPV testing first comes in, unvaccinated women should only need seven screenings in their lifetime, instead of 12.Dr Julie Sharp, head of health information at Cancer Research UK said it was "great news" for women."While we hope to see these improvements to the screening programme in the future, it's important that women continue to take up invitations for cervical screening."Image copyright Family photo Image caption Sarah Farr with her daughter Maisie, who is seven Sarah Farr, 34, from Barrow in Cumbria, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in November 2016.Her cancer was picked up early through a screening - she had surgery to remove the cancer and didn't need any further treatment.She is very glad her seven-year-old daughter Maisie will be able to get innoculated and experience fewer screenings."Cervical screening can be quite an uncomfortable experience, but I'm forever grateful that the test spotted my cancer early."It would be great if Maisie doesn't have to have to go for screening as often as I did, because of the HPV jab and the new screening test."Cervical cancer facts Cervical cancer is one of the most deadly but most preventable forms of cancer in women It is the most common cancer in women under 35 Around 3,000 cases are diagnosed every year in the UK and it causes 900 deaths Public Health England says almost all the deaths are of older women who did not benefit from the HPV vaccination programme Currently 85% of eligible girls are immunised and HPV vaccine rates in England are among the world's highest The vaccine could save several hundred lives every year and also provide protection against other cancers and genital warts Women aged 25 to 64 are automatically invited for cervical screening, which detects abnormal cell changes in the cervix Source: Public Health England Image copyright Science Photo Library New vaccine Testing for HPV first will be rolled out into the English cervical screening programme over the next two years.A new HPV vaccine is also expected to be introduced at some point from 2019.It should have a 90% success rate - up from 70% for the current vaccine.With this new vaccine, the researchers believe vaccinated women will only need two smear tests in their lifetime.Robert Music, chief executive of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said while it is positive to see a potential reduction in screenings needed, focus must continue on increasing the uptake of the vaccination and screening programmes to ensure more women are able to benefit from these advances."We would urge the government to use any savings made as a result of reduced screening intervals to fund a national cervical screening awareness campaign."If we do not reverse falling screening attendance we will simply be faced with more lives lost to the disease which could have been prevented."In July, immunisation experts decided there was little evidence to justify giving boys the HPV vaccine because high uptake among girls would reduce everyone's risk of HPV infection - but critics said the decision was concerning.Who should have the HPV vaccine?The HPV vaccine works best if girls get it before they come into contact with HPV - in other words, before they become sexually active.That is why getting the vaccine during the teenage years is recommended.However, girls who have already had sex should still have the vaccine if they are in the relevant age group.Girls can have the HPV vaccination on the NHS up to their 18th birthday but they will need three doses, rather than the normal two, in order to be fully protected if they are over 15.If you are not eligible for the vaccine, experts say the best protection against cervical cancer is to continue going for regular cervical screenings.In the UK, women are invited for screening between the ages of 25 and 64, every few years.
Sick baby's treatment 'should continue', High Court told:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Isaiah, pictured with an aunt, has brain damage A mother and father are fighting a High Court battle to stop their eight-month-old son's life support machine being switched off.Isaiah Haastrup is brain damaged and dependent on a ventilator to keep him alive at King's College Hospital, London.Doctors said giving him further treatment was "futile, burdensome and not in his best interests".But father Lanre Haastrup and mother Takesha Thomas want it to continue.They also hope an independent assessor will be appointed to give a medical opinion.Isaiah was born with a severe brain injury believed to have been caused by oxygen deprivation.Doctors do not think there are any "further investigations or forms of treatment" which would benefit him, the hospital's barrister Fiona Paterson said.She told Mr Justice MacDonald relations between hospital bosses and Isaiah's parents were "difficult".The court heard that Mr Haastrup, of Peckham, south London, had been barred from visiting the hospital following an incident a few days ago.'Not a saint' Mr Haastrup sought a judicial review over the ban which has been refused by the High Court."I am not a saint but I am not a demon either," he said.He told the court there had been a "lack of care" for Isaiah.Mr Justice MacDonald created an order barring the media from identifying medical staff caring for Isaiah and said he hoped mediation could avoid a full trial.Failing that, the court case will formally begin on 15 January.A King's College Hospital spokeswoman said Mr Haastrup had already made a written application for permission to launch a judicial review but this was refused by a judge earlier this week.In July, the High Court ruled Great Ormond Street Hospital doctors could stop providing life-support treatment to baby Charlie Gard, following a lengthy and high profile court case.
Breast cancer 'can return 15 years after treatment ends':::::Image copyright Science Photo Library Breast cancer can resurface after remaining dormant for 15 years following successful treatment, a study has found.Women with large tumours and cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes had the highest 40% risk of it coming back.Researchers writing in the New England Journal of Medicine said extending treatment with hormone therapy could reduce the risk of it recurring.Scientists analysed the progress of 63,000 women for 20 years.All had the most common form of breast cancer.This is a type fuelled by the hormone oestrogen which can stimulate cancer cells to grow and divide.Every patient received treatments such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors which block the effects of oestrogen or shut off the hormone's supply.Although after five years of treatment their cancers had gone, over the next 15 years a steady number of women found that their cancer spread throughout their body - some up to 20 years after diagnosis.Women who originally had large tumours and cancer that had spread to four or more lymph nodes were at highest risk of the cancer returning the next 15 years, the study said.Women with small, low-grade cancers and no spread to the lymph nodes had a much lower 10% risk of cancer spread over that time.'Remarkable' Lead researcher Dr Hongchao Pan, from University of Oxford, said: "It is remarkable that breast cancer can remain dormant for so long and then spread many years later, with this risk remaining the same year after year and still strongly related to the size of the original cancer and whether it had spread to the (lymph) nodes."Doctors have long known that five years of tamoxifen reduces the risk of recurrence by about a third in the five years after stopping treatment.Recent research has suggested that extending hormone therapy to 10 years may be more effective at preventing breast cancer recurrence and death.Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Breast cancer cells are stimulated to grow and divide by the hormone oestrogen Aromatase inhibitors, which only work for post-menopausal women, are believed to be even more effective.But there are side effects with hormone treatments which can affect patients' quality of life and cause them to stop taking the pills.These include menopausal symptoms, osteporosis, joint pain and carpal tunnel syndrome.Prof Arnie Purushotham, senior clinical adviser at Cancer Research UK, which funded the study, said that since the research began, new drugs had been used to treat breast cancer and those worked in different ways to tamoxifen.He said: "It's vital that work continues to better predict which cancers might return."We also need to know what the difference for women might be in taking hormone therapies for 10 years instead of five, the side effects and how this affects patients' quality of life."Sally Greenbook, from charity Breast Cancer Now, said it was essential that women discussed any changes in treatment with their doctor."We would urge all women who have had treatment for breast cancer not to be alarmed, but to ensure they are aware of the signs of recurrence and of metastatic breast cancer, and to speak to their GP or breast care team if they have any concerns."
Blood vending machine 'a first' for NI:::::Image caption The machine in the Mater Hospital is the first of its kind in Northern Ireland Vending machines in hospitals are normally used for a quick snack or cup of coffee - but one which dispenses blood is an innovation.Staff at Belfast's Mater Hospital have helped devise and produce a piece of technology called a HemoSafe.It has been described as a new way of delivering blood, which will improve the safe delivery of blood products.It is proving so successful there are plans to roll it out in other hospitals across the Belfast Health Trust.Blood vending machines are already in operation in hospitals in the United States and London, but this is the first time one has been used in Northern Ireland.'Less paperwork' The HemoSafe uses blood track software, which means that when a doctor or nurse takes a sample of blood from a patient, it is tracked and sent to the lab.If that patient then needs extra units, the information is already available and can be simply verified.As the system is automated, it is considered to be more accurate and also cuts down the paperwork for hospital staff.Nurse Carmel Wright, the clinical leader behind the project, said she was delighted with the way the machine worked with the lab's management system.Image caption Nurse Carmel Wright said the machine benefits patients and the health care system "It's a winner for the patient and our service and it is safe and efficient," she said.The new system aims to cut down on red tape and any potential for human error, especially during a blood transfusion when the patient requires pints of a particular type of blood.According to deputy sister Pamela Johnson, it also reduces the time it takes to get blood for life-saving operations."It's better for the staff working in the theatre department because we have a lot less paperwork to fill in."It's automated, so every piece of information that is associated with that blood unit is documented on a database rather than use doing it manually," she said.Nonetheless, delivering blood is still a team effort.Image caption Hospital porter Michael Curley said delivering blood gives him a sense of achievement "It starts from the people at the bottom, right up," said Mater Hospital porter Michael Curley."You are part of the unit of blood being brought up to the patient, which is helping the patient get better."So you feel as if you are achieving something when you deliver the blood."

Daytime wounds 'heal more quickly':::::Wounds heal more quickly if they occur during the day rather than after dark, a study suggests.It found burns sustained at night took an average of 28 days to heal, but just 17 for those that happened in daytime.The team, at the UK's MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, said they were astounded by the difference they saw in 118 burns patients they studied.The effect was explained by the way body clock ticks inside nearly every human cell across a 24-hour cycle.The research, published in Science Translational Medicine, examined 118 patients at NHS burns units.It showed the average 11-day difference in healing times between people hurt at night and during the day.Detailed lab work showed skin cells called fibroblasts were changing their abilities in a 24-hour pattern.Fibroblasts are the body's first responders, rushing to the site of injury to close a wound.During the day they are primed to react, but they lose this ability at night.Dr John O'Neill, one of the researchers, told the BBC: "It is like the 100m.The sprinter down on the blocks, poised and ready to go, is always going to beat the guy going from a standing start."The researchers think they could use this knowledge to improve surgery.Some drugs, such as the steroid cortisol, can reset an individual cell's body clock and may be helpful in night-time procedures.And everybody's body clock runs to a slightly different pattern or "chronotype".So, it might make sense to schedule operations to keep in time with the patients' 24-hour "circadian rhythms".Both ideas are still untested, though.Dr John Blaikley, a clinician scientist at the University of Manchester, said: "Treatment of wounds costs the NHS around 5bn, which is partly due to a lack of effective therapies targeting wound closure."By taking these [circadian factors] into account, not only could novel drug targets be identified, but also the effectiveness of established therapies might be increased through changing what time of day they are given."Follow James on Twitter.
Gut bacteria 'boost' cancer therapy:::::Image copyright Getty Images Bacteria living in the murky depths of the digestive system seem to influence whether tumours shrink during cancer therapy, say French and US researchers.They tested the microbiome - the collection of microscopic species that live in us - in cancer patients.Two studies, in the journal Science, linked specific species and the overall diversity of the microbiome to the effectiveness of immunotherapy drugs.Experts said the results were fascinating and held a lot of promise.Our bodies are home to trillions of micro-organisms and the relationship between "us" and "them" goes far beyond infectious diseases.The microbiome is involved in digestion, protection from infection and regulating the immune system.Both studies were on patients receiving immunotherapy, which boosts the body's own defences to fight tumours.It does not work in every patient, but in some cases it can clear even terminal cancer.Survival One study, at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus in Paris, looked at 249 patients with lung or kidney cancer.They showed those who had taken antibiotics, such as for dental infection, damaged their microbiome and were more likely to see tumours grow while on immunotherapy.One species of bacteria in particular, Akkermansia muciniphila, was in 69% of patients that did respond compared with just a third of those who did not.Boosting levels of A. muciniphila in mice seemed to also boost their response to immunotherapy.Meanwhile, at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 112 patients with advanced melanoma had their microbiome analysed.Those that responded to therapy tended to have a richer, more diverse microbiome than those that did not.And they had different bacteria too.High levels of Faecalibacterium and Clostridiales appeared to be beneficial, while Bacteroidales species were bad news in the study.'Game-changing' Tissues samples showed there were more cancer-killing immune cells in the tumour of people with the beneficial bacteria.The team then performed a trans-poo-sion, a transplant of faecal matter, from people to mice with melanoma.Mice given bacteria from patients with the "good" mix of bacteria had slower-growing tumours than mice given "bad" bacteria.Dr Jennifer Wargo, from Texas, told the BBC: "If you disrupt a patient's microbiome you may impair their ability to respond to cancer treatment."She is planning clinical trials aimed at altering the microbiome in tandem with cancer treatment.She said: "Our hypothesis is if we change to a more favourable microbiome, you just may be able to make patients respond better."The microbiome is game-changing, not just cancer but for overall health, it's definitely going to be a major player."Promising Mark Fielder, president of the Society for Applied Microbiology and professor of medical biology at Kingston University, said the study showed the importance of understanding the micro-organisms that call our bodies home.He told the BBC: "It's really interesting and holds a lot of promise, we need to do more work but there are exciting glimmers here in treating some difficult diseases."Some claim the microbiome is the answer to everything, I don't think that's the case."But once we understand more, it could be that microbiome manipulation is important in changing people's health."Dr Emma Smith from Cancer Research UK, said: "It's fascinating."One of the big challenges for using immunotherapies to treat cancer is understanding which patients will respond, and this research is a step towards helping doctors to identify these people."Follow James on Twitter.
Why is it so difficult to discover new antibiotics?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sources being checked for new antibiotics include the blood of Komodo dragons Over-reliance on and misuse of antibiotics has led to warnings of a future without effective medicines.Why is it so difficult for scientists to discover new drugs?It's a tale of scientific discovery taught the world over: the serendipitous find of a mould that revolutionised modern medicine.Almost 90 years ago, Alexander Fleming returned from holiday to find Penicillium on Petri dishes left in his basement laboratory at St Mary's Hospital in London.By the 1950s, the golden age of antibiotic discovery, an array of new medicines was being found.Today, scientists are searching for a new breakthrough, testing microbes in sources as diverse as soil, caves and Komodo dragon blood, as well as developing new, lab-made synthetic drugs.Yet despite these remarkable advances, we are running out of effective antibiotics - the drugs that fight infection and are essential for everything from organ transplants to the treatment of food poisoning.Deadly bacteria resistant to penicillin, or the more than 100 different antibiotics since developed, are already killing 700,000 people every year.Unchecked, the global toll could rise to 10 million a year by 2050.If the problem is so serious, why, in this age of incredible medical and scientific endeavour and advance, is it so difficult to get the new antibiotics the world so desperately needs?Racing the superbugs The answer lies partly in scientific challenge and partly in the broken economy of research and development work.Perhaps the less well known part of Fleming's story is the long period of research and collaboration which followed, before, in the 1940s, Penicillium became the world's first antibiotic.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alexander Fleming in his laboratory at St Mary's Hospital Or that Fleming himself cautioned from the earliest days that bacteria could become resistant to drugs.As a patient, antibiotics can seem such a simple treatment for infection, but the pills have a complex relationship with the very bacteria they are designed to destroy.All microorganisms evolve and those that develop defences against antibiotics will survive, while the defenceless will be killed.The more antibiotics we use, the faster the process of bacteria developing resistance becomes.The result of misuse and overuse, in human and animal health, is a continual race to stay ahead of the superbugs.Surprising sources for antibiotics being investigated Years of testing It's easy to find chemicals that kill bacteria.The challenge is that it's much more difficult to discover and develop substances that are not also toxic to humans.The path from discovery to clinically approved medicine is necessarily long and the failure rate is high.The process starts with basic research to identify organisms which produce antibiotic substances.Thousands of possibilities will be screened - a process which in itself can take years.Scientists look at different chemicals, combinations of chemicals and ways to weaken bacteria.Some might try to attack the cell wall; others interfere with the way the bacterial cell functions, or with its metabolism.When a candidate is found this must be tested on known infectious bacteria.Then, if the results are promising, it will be tested for its possible toxicity to humans and must be produced at scale.Only then can the years of clinical trials begin.In total it takes around 10 to 20 years from discovery to medicine.The overuse of antibiotics A fifth of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary, Public Health England says Coughs or bronchitis may take three weeks to clear on their own, but antibiotics reduce that by just one to two days, it says An estimated 5,000 people die in England each year as a result of drug-resistant infections Worldwide, if unaddressed, drug-resistant infections could kill more people than cancer by 2050 Animals consume a large proportion of antibiotics - as much as 80% in the US No new discoveries Of course, with complexity and uncertainty comes cost.This is where the broken economy comes into play.Antibiotics are not only complex to develop, the most innovative new products also cannot be sold freely.Instead, they must be put on the shelf in reserve for serious cases - as is the case with colistin, the "drug of last resort".This doesn't present an appealing investment opportunity, and over the past 30 years pharmaceutical companies have significantly decreased their work developing new antibacterial therapies.No new classes of antibiotics have been invented for decades.In fact, all the antibiotics brought to the market in the past 30 years have been variations on existing drugs discovered by 1984.Most worryingly, it was as long ago as 1962 that the last new class of antibiotics to treat those infected by the most resistant gram-negative superbugs was discovered.These include multi drug-resistant bacteria which can cause severe and often deadly bloodstream infections and pneumonia.They pose a particular threat in hospitals, nursing homes and for patients treated with devices such as ventilators and catheters.Other priorities include increasingly drug-resistant bacteria that cause more common diseases such as gonorrhoea and food poisoning caused by salmonella.In recent years, as awareness of drug-resistant infections has increased and politicians have taken heed of the warnings long given by doctors and scientists, the public and private sectors have begun to work together to find solutions.As of May 2017, a total of 51 antibiotics were in the clinical pipeline - around a third targeting priority pathogens, 12 families of bacteria seen as posing the greatest threat to human health.But only a small number are innovative products - those not based on existing classes of antibiotics.Not just luck New drugs are vital but they are only part of the solution.We also need to explore the potential for vaccines to protect against infection in the first place.Image copyright Getty Images And better, more accurate diagnosis of infections could help doctors know as quickly as possible the best and most appropriate treatments.We also need a better understanding of where drug-resistant infections are spreading, not just in people, but also in animals and the environment.Improving hygiene in hospitals, clinics and communities across the world would help stop infection taking hold in the first place.If we are to succeed in getting and staying ahead of superbugs we cannot rely on Fleming's luck in 1928.More needs to be done to ensure industry and governments work together to test promising treatments and bring them to market.Perhaps most importantly of all, we must give this miraculous and marvellous medicine the respect it deserves.Antibiotics, old and new, are a valuable resource, to be used only when necessary for protecting and improving health.About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.Tim Jinks is head of drug-resistant infections at the Wellcome Trust, which describes itself as a global charitable foundation working to improve health for everyone.The Wellcome Trust is supporting antibiotic discovery through its US partnership, CARB-X.In the past year it has announced funding for 18 projects targeting the most urgent drug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, including eight potential new classes of antibiotics.Edited by Duncan Walker
Share of European Union staff leaving NHS rises following Brexit:::::Image copyright sturti Image caption Experts say England does not yet produce enough home-grown staff for the NHS to meet requirements without workers from abroad The proportion of EU nationals leaving jobs in the NHS is rising, while the share of those joining is shrinking.The BBC analysed NHS Digital figures, which showed the trend in England over the past two-and-a-half years.Health experts say the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June 2016 was behind the trend.The Department of Health says new language requirements for EU nurses may have played a part.The analysis comes days after the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said the health system was "straining at the seams" and faced a "precarious" future, highlighting staff shortages and rising vacancy rates.What do the figures show?In the last full year before the referendum - 2015 - there were 7,535 EU nationals who left NHS Trusts, making up 5.6% of workers of all nationalities leaving their jobs.The following year, EU nationals accounted for 6.6% of all leavers, and in the first six months of this year, they made up 7.4%.The pattern was repeated in 80 NHS Trusts out of 240 across England.The proportion of EU staff joining fell over the same period.In 2015 EU nationals made up 10% of new joiners.In the first six months of 2017, they accounted for 8.2%.That trend was reflected in 62 trusts.Danny Mortimer, co-convenor of the Cavendish Coalition, which represents health and social care organisations, said: "This analysis starts to confirm anecdotal stories we are hearing from our members, especially in the South East."Our members don't feel able to recruit in big numbers."There are practical challenges like the exchange rate [between the pound and the euro] is weak - and the number of people choosing to leave is increasing."The trend was more pronounced when focussing solely on nurses.In the year before the vote, EU nurses made up 7.6% of all the nurses leaving nationally, rising to 11.5% in the first six months of 2017.Almost one in five nurses, 6,299 out of 34,595, joining the NHS in 2015 came from other EU member states.In the first six months of 2017 this had fallen to just one in 10 newly-recruited nurses.One source told the BBC of at least one NHS trust that had abandoned a recruitment fair on the continent due to poor response rates.The General Medical Council surveyed more than 2,000 doctors from the European Economic Area (EEA) in February and of the 60% who said they were thinking of leaving the UK at some point in the future, nine in 10 said the UK's decision to leave the EU was a factor in their considerations.Janet Davies, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: "A nurse who trained in Lyon or Lisbon is as much a part of the NHS family as one trained in London.But sadly, it is no surprise that so many are leaving - few can live with the uncertainty."During the Brexit negotiations, [Prime Minister] Theresa May must reassure nurses from around Europe that they are needed and welcome in the NHS.It would not survive without their contribution."Overall, the NHS says there are around 3,200 more EU nationals working in the NHS than at the time of the referendum, as the size of the health service continues to grow.Over the same period, there has been a slight reduction of 162 nurses, which it suggests may be down to the Nursing and Midwifery Council introducing new language requirements in January 2016, making it more difficult to be eligible for employment.But our analysis shows the growth is slowing.The year-on-year percentage increase in the EU workforce dropped from 16.8% in 2015 to 2.7% in the first six months of 2017.Experts say England does not yet produce enough home-grown staff for the NHS to meet staffing requirements without workers from abroad, although the government wants to make the country "self-sufficient" in training doctors and create thousands more nursing training places to boost the domestic workforce.The Commons Health Select Committee previously began to take evidence on the implications of Brexit but postponed its inquiry when the snap General Election was called for June 2017.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had told the committee the government had stopped short of publishing its own analysis because "the publication of what might be called the worst-case scenario could itself have an impact on negotiations".Dr Andrew Dearden, the treasurer of the British Medical Association, said: "We know that Brexit has already had a huge impact on the morale of EU NHS staff working here.Our own research has shown us that more than four in ten EU NHS staff are considering leaving the UK following the EU referendum result."A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: "There are 3,193 more EU nationals working in the NHS than at the time of the referendum we have been absolutely clear that these staff play a vital role in the NHS and want to see their excellent work continue long after the UK leaves the EU."However, we recognise the NHS also needs more home-grown staff, so we'll be training an extra 1,500 doctors and 10,000 nurses, midwives and allied health professionals a year by 2020 to ensure the NHS has the workforce it needs both now and in the future."Image copyright Reuters Image caption Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has promised more training places for home-grown doctors and nurses Across the UK In Wales, the proportion of EU nationals leaving the NHS was 2.5% the year before the referendum, rising to 3.5% in 2015-16 when the vote took place.It has since returned to 3%.Neither NHS Scotland or The Department of Health in Northern Ireland records the nationality of leavers and joiners.More about this story The Shared Data Hub makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.For more information on methodology, click here.For the full dataset, click here.The figures do not include data for GPs and practice staff or Clinical Commissioning Groups, and concern headcount rather than full-time equivalent posts.
Mental health: 10 charts on the scale of the problem:::::Image copyright Other At any one time, a sixth of the population in England aged 16 to 64 have a mental health problem, according to statistics body NHS Digital.Whether it is family or friends, neighbours or work colleagues, the chances are we all know someone who is affected.And bearing in mind the figure leaves out less common conditions and is a snapshot in time, you could easily argue it is even more prevalent than that.Indeed many do.With Prime Minister Theresa May expected to announce plans to improve care next week, these 10 charts show the extent of the challenge.1.Problems are on the increase It seems to be getting more common - or at least among those with severe symptoms.While the proportion of people affected does not appear to have risen in the past few years, if you go back a little further there has certainly been a steady increase.Evidence from the NHS Digital study in England shows the rise has been driven by an increase in women with illness.Why is this?Undoubtedly some of it is down to people being more willing to report and admit mental health problems.Experts point to the way self-harm in particular is recognised in a way it was not 20 or 30 years ago.But it is also clear 21st Century life is taking its toll on some people.Economic uncertainty, social media, the influence of the media and rising expectations of what life should be like have all been suggested as possible causes.2.Women are now more likely to be affected Women are now much more likely to have a common mental illness.One in five report they have, compared with one in eight men in England.If you include only those with severe symptoms, the difference is less acute, but still apparent.Young people are particularly susceptible.A number of theories have been put forward for this.The economic uncertainty of the past decade has particularly affected the young, making it harder to get on the career ladder.And psychiatrists and mental health campaigners are increasingly raising questions about whether social media increases peer-group pressure and online bullying.Whatever the reason, the one thing experts are agreed on is that the figures are shocking.3.But men are more likely to take their own lives Mental health problems prompt thousands of people to take their own lives.In fact there are about 6,000 suicides in the UK each year and it's the biggest killer of men up to the age of 49.Men account for three-quarters of the total figure.The best overall measure is the number of suicides per 100,000 people.That's because, with a rising population, the absolute figure is almost bound to go up.Since the 1980s, the trend is down.There's quite a big national variation, with England having the lowest suicide rate and Northern Ireland the highest.Scotland and Wales have similar rates and are in the middle.4.Mental health problems tend to start early As already mentioned, mental health problems are particularly common in the young in the UK.In fact, most mental health problems develop in childhood or when a person is a young adult.Three-quarters of problems are established by the age of 24.It is why there is such an emphasis at the moment on addressing childhood mental illness.In 2015, the government promised funding for child and adolescent mental health services would increase.5.Mental health services are the poor relation when it comes to funding Extra money has also been earmarked for adult services in England.Together with the investment in children's services it means by 2020-21 1.28bn more should be spent in real terms than was in 2015-16.Ministers say the money will be used to put mental health services in A&E, more crisis teams in the community and a focus on helping new mothers, with one in five reporting problems in the first year after the birth of their baby.But an analysis last year by the King's Fund health think tank found 40% of mental health trusts in England had actually seen their budgets cut in 2015-16.The government is adamant things will change.They have to.While 23% of NHS activity is taken up by mental illness, mental health trusts have been receiving only about 11% of funding in recent years.Extra investment is being made in the other parts of the UK.Wales and Scotland have both recently unveiled new plans.But like England, mental health remains the poor cousin compared to the spending on physical ailments.6.A nation of pill-poppers?The promise of investment has also been accompanied by a desire to reshape services - and particularly how quickly we can access them.The government established the first set of waiting time targets for the NHS in England in 2016.They mean the health service should be providing access to talking therapies within 18 weeks and treatment for those experiencing their first episode of psychosis within two weeks for at least half of people.Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland all have their own targets too.But drugs are still the most common form of treatment.The number of medicines dispensed for anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic attacks has more than doubled in the past 10 years.An increase in the numbers of people getting antidepressants is clearly a factor.But so too is the fact prescribing patterns have changed.Doctors are much more likely to keep people on drugs for longer with evidence suggesting it is a more effective way of treating patients.But as common as antidepressants are, the fact remains the majority of people with mental illness report they are not getting help.Only one in three of those polled said they were receiving treatment, according to NHS Digital.7.More and more people are being detained With the high rates of non-treatment in mind, it perhaps should not come as a surprise that there is an upwards trend in England in the number of people being detained under the Mental Health Act.Campaigners say patients in crisis are given just enough treatment to stabilise them before being sent home too early to ease pressure on beds.What happens then?They suffer another crisis and are detained again.So some people spend years being detained over and over again without ever getting well.8.A long way from home The pressure on the system also manifests itself in long journeys for treatment.Last year a major report looked at the issue and pointed to thousands of people being sent more than 30 miles for services like acute care, psychiatric intensive care or rehabilitation.In some rural areas, of course, travelling long distances is not that uncommon for all sorts of care.But that's not the point, said the report.Far too many people in towns and cities, where services should be easier to access, are affected, and the situation was "unacceptable".Everyone knows it's a problem.Nobody likes it, and it can be massively disruptive for patients and their families.Yet an awful lot of sufferers of mental ill health travel a long, long way to get treatment.And, according to the British Medical Association, things are getting worse not better.In fact, it says, there's been a "startling rise" in the number of patients being sent out of area for treatment, a rise of nearly 40% between 2014-15 and 2016-17 to 5,876 adults.One patient they found had been sent from Somerset to the Highlands, a journey of 587 miles.9.It's not all bad news...The use of police cells for people in mental health crisis has attracted huge disquiet, not least among officers themselves.In a rare public statement of concern from a senior police chief, Devon and Cornwall Assistant Chief Constable Paul Netherton tweeted "#unacceptable" when a 16-year-old girl was held for two days in a cell in 2015 because no beds were available.That caused quite a stir among officers, patients and distraught families who felt that police cells were the last place someone in a health crisis should be held.But now the use of police cells is down - at least in England and Wales, though figures in Scotland suggest it may have gone up.In England and Wales it has fallen by more than half from 4,500 in 2014-15 to just over 2,000 in 2015-16, according to the National Police Chiefs' Council.The NPCC also says the downward change is even bigger for under 18s to just 43 cases in 2015-16.10.It's Time to Change But perhaps the most promising development in terms of mental health is the changing attitude towards mental illness.A public campaign called Time to Change was launched in 2009 by leading charities Mind and Rethink.It has been supported by the lottery and government along the way - and seems to be working.Latest results from the National Attitudes to Mental Illness Survey, released in May, showed people's willingness to work, live with and live nearby someone with a mental health problem has been improving in England.Campaigners have described the progress as wonderful but warn against complacency.Despite the improvements, nearly nine in 10 people who have had mental health problems report they have suffered stigma and discrimination.For all the positives, there's a long way to go, it seems.
Why British Chinese mothers won't go out after giving birth:::::Image caption Ching Ching Turner believes confinement is good for the baby's health "Postnatal confinement" - where new mothers do not leave the house, have visitors or shower for a month after giving birth - is said to be widespread among the UK's Chinese community.Experts warn that few in the medical profession know this occurs."Being confined in your flat is important," says Ching Ching Turner, from her home in London that she has not left since giving birth 28 days earlier.She speaks to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme via video call, as visitors are not allowed.Mrs Turner argues confinement is an important process as traditional belief is that the mother and baby's immunity is very low.She is of Chinese ethnicity, and says: "For us, if you don't practise it you're kind of disadvantaging yourself."Confinement is common across Asia and in China there are special hospitals where mothers stay confined for a month, sometimes only seeing their babies once a day.It is carried out because traditional Chinese medicine purports that women who have just given birth are more susceptible to cold air, and becoming ill as a result.Mrs Turner, who believes she has "done confinement in a modern way" by still showering for example, says her wishes came as a surprise to her husband, who was born in the UK."I don't think he realised that [confinement] came with a whole set of rules," she says."It was a bit difficult for him as he wanted to show off his baby."But now we've nearly completed the month, he sees the benefits."Image caption Dr Wu worries confinement will exacerbate postnatal depression Dr Kit Wu, a neurologist at King's College Hospital, says postnatal confinement is a tradition so engrained in Chinese culture "that even I did it"."Some of the very strict rules are that you shouldn't drink cold drinks during the month, you shouldn't really shower, hair washing isn't allowed and obviously not going outside the boundaries of your house."Some ladies who are very strict don't actually get out of bed for the first two weeks, and then do very minimal exercise after that," she adds.Dr Wu is particularly concerned about the effect confinement has on British Chinese mothers who experience postnatal depression."New mums can often be left in isolation and it can be difficult to cope," she explains, adding that many will also hide the symptoms from health professionals because of the pressure within Chinese communities for giving birth to be seen as a time of happiness.She also worries that "when mothers have medical problems, they try to deal with them themselves and that can be detrimental to the health of themselves and the baby".In Mrs Turner's case her mother travelled from Singapore to be with her daughter.Public Health England said: "Health visitors and midwives are specially trained and skilled in various cultural traditions and how to respect them while safeguarding the needs of the family."If a more tailored programme of support is needed then that will be agreed with the family."Traditional medicine Dr Wu says many in the Chinese community are also being "overlooked" by mainstream health services as a result of the cultural aversion to seeking help.When contacted, the Royal College of Midwives, the Institute of Health Visiting and various maternity mental health charities said they had very little, if any, expertise in healthcare for the British Chinese.Dr Lip Lee, a clinical oncologist at Christie's Hospital, says there is also a tendency for members of the UK's Chinese community to put on a "brave front" - including when it comes to cancer."Even when the doctor asks if they're in pain, they may deny it.They feel that, 'if I have cancer, it's a given, I should endure the pain' or, 'let's just treat it with traditional Chinese medicine'."Image caption Eddie Chan says the language barrier means many elderly Chinese people are left isolated Experts also suggest that the decision not to ask for help is also harming elderly members of the UK's Chinese community, who are living alone in old age."There are a whole generation of first generation migrants now living in the UK and they are very isolated," explains Eddie Chan from the Chinese Healthy Living Centre in London, who also says that dementia can be heavily stigmatised among the British Chinese."They will find it very hard to find any mainstream services that cater to their needs," he says, explaining that this is in part because of the language barrier.'No' to chemotherapy Hon Cheung Tang, aged 73, lives on his own in a tiny bedsit and is unable to speak English.He was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer, but has decided against any treatment.He is in pain and cannot walk.Volunteer carers from the Chinese Healthy Living Centre come to see him when they can, but Mr Tang says some days he does not have a meal or a cup of water."One doctor tried to tell me to have chemotherapy as I will certainly die if I don't.I said, 'No, as with almost all cancers you're certain to die or you won't last long'," he says, contradicting medical evidence.Image caption Hon Cheung Tang In Mr Tang's case, the loneliness he feels is exacerbated by the absence of his children."One day I was going to the bathroom, and then blacked out, felt dizzy and fell," he explains."I laid down on the floor for a while then realised the bed was so far away, I had to crawl there."I called the kids - my daughter answered but she didn't say much and they didn't turn up."Those few days were very bad.I don't know how I got through those days."In a statement, the Department of Health said it wants "everyone to have the same opportunity for a long and healthy life, whoever they are, wherever they live and whatever their background".It added: "We take a comprehensive and strategic approach to reducing health inequalities so we can address the cause of ill-health and promote healthier lifestyles."But for Dr Wu, more needs to be done to understand the Chinese community.She is calling for more data to be collected regarding their health needs - currently they are "grouped into a box along with other ethnicities", she explains.She also wants more funding for Chinese community groups, as for many individuals they are their main and only source of support."Just because we're silent and polite doesn't mean we should be ignored," she says.Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.
Could virtual reality treat anxiety?:::::Image caption Liz says her fear of heights was beginning to take over her life One in four people will experience some sort of mental health problem this year.Could virtual-reality programmes help to deal with the increased demand for treatment?Standing on the building's 10th floor, you look down into the atrium, dizzyingly far below with just a very low barrier for protection.You then move out over the space on a platform to pick apples from a branch.It's enough to make most people's stomach flip - but this virtual-reality (VR) programme is designed to help conquer a fear of heights.Completing the programme is Liz Willits, who says her phobia was making her feel "very tense and jumpy" and starting to take over her life."Certain height situations made me feel not just like I might fall over the edge, but that I might voluntarily tip over the edge, which is a very unnerving feeling," she explains."I didn't trust myself with heights any more."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Can virtual reality cure a fear of heights?The programme is being developed by clinical psychologist Dr Daniel Freeman, who says there's "something beautiful" about how VR works."People know it's not real so they try things they've not done before or for a long time, but mind and body does behave as if it's in the real world," he explains."And what they are doing is learning a new memory, in Liz's case about safety around heights.And that memory of safety is replacing and helping diminish the fear memory that she had."Body swapping Image caption Emily has anxiety that can make ordinary social tasks such as ordering a coffee difficult But could machines ever replace a human when treating more complex conditions such as anxiety and depression?Another programme under development simulates a therapist's office.It uses a popular psychological technique called body swapping, in a virtual self-help therapy.Using the simulator is Emily, who has severe social anxiety, meaning she finds daily interactions such as ordering a coffee or getting a book out of the library difficult."I get quite hot and quite flushed and flustered, my breathing gets quicker and then suddenly everything spills over," she says.First Emily explains her condition to a virtual therapist - a man with a beard - in the virtual office.She then swaps places and becomes the therapist.First she listens to her avatar relay the problem she's just spoken about - and it's then her job to counsel herself.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Emily is trialling VR that allows her to become her own therapist She asks "herself" if she has tried any methods to calm down, such as focusing on her breathing, and if she has tried to find the cause of the anxiety.She then swaps back into her own body ready to hear that advice spoken back to her by the therapist.Emily says that knowing it was actually her speaking made it less helpful than the traditional therapy she's had."But it's reassuring too, a bit of a self mantra, something you were saying to someone else could actually be useful and you could take it on board," she adds.But she says it's hard to compare with treatment from a trained professional who knows the best techniques for a particular problem.Powerful effect Clinical psychologist Dr Nihara Krause said virtual-reality body swapping could be useful as a tool to accompany traditional treatment - but she has concerns about it being used on its own."It assumes that the person first of all has got the ability to put themselves in someone else's position, which isn't always very easy," she says."The second assumption is that people have the verbal ability to be able to express something objectively, which again for some people isn't very easy.So I would have concerns about somebody doing it on their own."Image caption Since completing the programme Liz has visited a treetop adventure park with her son It is being developed by computer scientist Mel Slater, who says although it is still early days, the software has huge potential."We know there is a crisis in mental health and we know people have to wait a long time for appointments for things that can be fairly mild but over time become much, much, worse.And maybe this could be a stopgap before they see a real therapist."Meanwhile, Liz has completed her course and it's had a powerful affect.Afterwards she put herself in positions where she had to face heights in real life -

Arthur Collins trial: Acid attack on the dance floor:::::I didnt walk in there with those scars.Thats a 22nd birthday Ill never forget.Lauren Trent Lauren Trent In the early hours of Easter Monday, Arthur Collins threw acid over a group of men in the middle of a packed dance floor at an east London nightclub.In a matter of seconds, dozens of partygoers were in agony, burnt by splashes of the toxic substance.Among them was Lauren Trent who was celebrating turning 22 - a birthday she will now "never forget".The club night at Mangle E8 in Dalston - a former industrial launderette - was put on by LoveJuice, which hosts dance music parties all over the world, from Ibiza to Dubai."We got there at 8 or 9pm.It was absolutely rammed," said Lauren.Security was lax and no-one checked her bag or her identity on the way in, she said.After a few hours of dancing, Lauren decided she wanted to go home."I was ready to go get my McDonald's.I was tired.I bent down to get my bag and that's when it went off.Image copyright Lauren Trent Image caption Lauren and her friend, Sophie, pictured on the night of the attack, before going to Mangle "It sounded like a fizzing noise.And then there was smoke.It smelled like petrol."People fell to the floor like dominoes.It was pandemonium."Lauren raced to the bathroom with her friend to get water."I literally touched my neck and my skin was coming off.I just ripped the blisters off - anything to stop the stinging."Lauren was taken to a separate room above the club where she found her friend, Sophie Hall, who had acid splashed over her face."I was so shocked.I didn't know whether to cry or scream.But I couldn't cry because there was my friend with it on her face."Lauren had third degree burns to her neck, stomach, hands, chest, legs and foot.She spent a day in hospital and was off work for two weeks.Image copyright Lauren Trent Image caption Lauren had third degree burns to her neck, chest, legs, foot and stomach "If I hadn't bent down, it would have been on my face," she said.Both Lauren and Sophie gave evidence during the trial.Most victims gave their evidence from behind a screen in court, but Lauren said she wanted to look at the accused."Collins didn't look at me.He had his head down the whole time."Six months on, Lauren says she's more anxious and cautious than she used to be and doesn't like busy places."What he's done is give people life injuries," she added."I didn't walk in there with those scars.You notice them - they're not going to go."Image copyright Metropolitan Police Image caption Arthur Collins became a father during the trial, when Ferne McCann gave birth to their baby What happened that night?Collins, the then-boyfriend of TV presenter Ferne McCann, never disputed throwing the liquid.What he did dispute was that he brought it into the club and that he knew it was acid.The substance had a pH level of 1, similar to that found in toilet cleaners.Giving evidence, Collins, 25, from Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, said his attention was drawn by a group of men talking loudly as he made his way to the bar."I overheard someone saying 'no, you spike her, you do it'," he told jurors.He said he swore at them, angry at the thought of them spiking a woman's drink.He had been "brought up to respect women", he added.Image copyright PA Image caption About 600 people were at the Mangle, in London Fields, when the attack happened As one of the men approached him, Collins snatched a little bottle from him, assuming it was a date rape drug, the court heard."I wanted to show them the drug was gone; show them there was nothing left in the bottle."CCTV from inside the club shows Collins throwing acid at the men.Seemingly unaware of the mayhem caused, Collins returned to the dancefloor "drinking, dancing, Snapchatting and having a good time", the court heard.The men - Kwami Licorish, Makai Brown and Ruam Mota - refuted Collins's version of events.Mr Brown and Mr Mota denied any knowledge of a bottle being snatched and told the court no argument had taken place - but did not provide an alternative version of events.All three suffered burns to their faces and elsewhere.Image copyright @PhieMcKenzie Image caption Emergency services treated victims at the scene 'Hair loss' Dressed in a suit, Collins appeared calm and measured throughout his trial.Owing to weight loss, he looked quite different to the man pictured holidaying with McCann in Dubai weeks before the attack on 17 April.On his second day giving evidence, there was a collective raise of eyebrows when George Carter-Stephenson QC, defending, asked his client if he had ever suffered from hair loss.The answer was yes.In fact, Collins revealed he had undergone two hair transplants.Image copyright Kiehl's Image caption The jury was shown a bottle of the "acid" shampoo Collins said he used after a hair transplant This line of questioning was to explain a text message which, the prosecution had argued, proved that Collins had started carrying acid.A week before the attack, Collins sent his sister a text message, saying: "Tell mum to mind that little hand wash in my car acid".The jury heard this referred to an amino-acid shampoo that Collins used to thicken his hair and he was worried his young nieces would find it and bite into it.His sister, Chinade Rowe, told the court she would massage his special shampoo into his scalp.Asked if she had come to court to lie for her brother, she replied: "Absolutely not."Image copyright Ferne McCann/Facebook Image caption Ferne McCann was not with Collins on the night of the attack Collins's family was a constant presence at the trial, both in his evidence and in court.His parents and siblings - four sisters and two brothers - took up much of the public gallery, travelling to Wood Green Crown Court, in north London, every day.On some days, victims' families struggled to find a seat.But it was his ex-partner and the mother of his newborn baby - seen in court at least once - who has been the focus of much of the press attention.Just hours before the attack, McCann, who first found fame on reality TV show The Only Way is Essex, was with Collins at a barbecue, breaking the news of her pregnancy to her family.That same day, OK magazine published a front page feature with the couple which revealed their plans to move in together and have a beach wedding."It was the happiest I've ever felt.We were both really happy," Collins told the court.Image copyright PA Image caption Ferne McCann appeared in the hit reality TV series The Only Way is Essex But two days after his arrest, the star confirmed she was pregnant with his child and had ended their relationship.McCann, who was not at the nightclub when the attack happened, had urged him to hand himself in; it was five days before police found him in Northamptonshire.A video shown in court showed Collins jumping from a bathroom window in his underpants - fracturing both his heels - before being Tasered and arrested.As a result of going on the run, plain-clothed police officers were in the courtroom throughout the trial - unbeknownst to the jury.Collins told the court he hadn't gone to police due to fears his girlfriend and unborn child would be targeted by gang members.Weeks after the attack, McCann gave a tearful television interview on ITV's This Morning."This isn't how I imagined my first pregnancy to be, but this isn't about me, or the situation, my main priority is the baby," she said.She gave birth earlier this month, as the trial was coming to an end.
I made a film from my bed to show my illness is real:::::Image caption Photo: Jason Frank Five years ago, Jennifer Brea was struck down by ME (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis), and found herself bed-bound, a prisoner in her own body.Now, she has invited the world on an intimate journey into a condition that some deny even exists, interviewing fellow patients from all over the world - from her sickbed.She spoke to the BBC's Natasha Lipman.As the opening credits roll on the documentary, Unrest, we see filmmaker Jennifer Brea lying on the floor of her bedroom, eyes glazed over, as she stares apparently peacefully at the camera.Then, with arms shaking, gasping for breath, she tries to pull herself up, managing only a few inches before she collapses back on the floor.Eventually she is able to crawl slowly to her bed, before dropping the camera, collapsing with relief and fatigue.Episodes like this initially came as a shock for Brea.Seemingly out of nowhere, she would suddenly lose all muscle force, unable to move her body, or even lift her head.She struggled to get words out, let alone form sentences, and even the smallest exertion would have knock-on effects that lasted for days, weeks, or even months.I never imagined that something like this could happen to me "I'd never been sick before and so I had this sense of abundance of health and body and life.I had never really heard about ME or people becoming ill in their 20s - it just wasn't a part of my awareness.So I never imagined that something like this could happen to me."While studying for a PhD in Political Economy and Statistics at Harvard, she met fellow student, Omar Wasow, an internet analyst and entrepreneur who once taught Oprah Winfrey how to surf the net.They married in 2012.Home videos show the life Brea and Wasow led before she became sick - travelling the world, scuba diving, candlelit dinners with friends - a perfect vision of a carefree young couple in love.Shortly before their wedding, they both contracted a virus, coming down with a high fever.Wasow recovered completely, but afterwards Brea remained plagued by strange symptoms.Whenever she got a sore throat or a cold she would have dizzy spells and crash out for days at a time.She suffered from insomnia, and memory loss - symptoms she now recognises as a mild form of ME.They all seemed to get worse after exercise."Omar and I used to always do this bike ride along the river - six miles out, six miles back -and I noticed that while I could make it six miles out, then I had to call a taxi to get back home.Or I would go skiing with my family, and suddenly feel my legs giving out," she says."I didn't know why."Image caption Jen and her husband Omar loved the great outdoors - until she fell ill (Photo: Jason Frank) She suspected there might be something wrong with her immune system and went to her doctor, but the lab tests always came back normal."I was told that either I wasn't really sick or that maybe I was just depressed or that it was all in my head," she says.I was told that either I wasn't really sick or that maybe I was just depressed or that it was all in my head Brea was eventually diagnosed with Conversion Disorder, a mental condition with unexplained physical symptoms - formerly known as hysteria - and told it was due to a childhood trauma she couldn't even remember.But when she showed doctors the disturbing footage of her symptoms from the video diary she'd been recording on her phone she was sent for a battery of further tests."I still had hope that I just had a rare disease - that if I could just get to the right specialist they would figure out what was wrong with me," says Brea.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption "Our lives are frozen in this sickness amber" (from Unrest) It turned out that what she had is actually very common - ME, a condition that affects up to 17 million people worldwide, according to some estimates.Now her illness had a name, but she discovered that there was very little medical research into it, much controversy over treatments, and no cure."That was something that I never imagined could happen.I always thought that medicine would be there to help me," says Brea."In some ways getting the diagnosis was a bit of a relief but it also gave me this sense of: 'Oh my gosh, what I have to deal with is actually much more complicated than I imagined.'"What is ME?ME - also called Chronic Fatigue Syndrome - is a medical condition characterised by profound and disabling fatigue Symptoms include: loss of muscle power, debilitating pain, difficulty sleeping and cognitive dysfunction affecting memory and concentration The cause of ME is unknown, but many patients contract it after a viral infection Women are four times as likely to have ME than men The NHS guidelines on ME treatment are currently being revised ME has always caused debate.Brea's film shows clips of US TV host Larry King calling it "yuppie flu", and TV anchor Katie Couric describing it as "a made-up condition".Patients are battling against this perception in both the medical community and society as a whole."It's not just about the disease itself, it's also about those layers of stigma and lack of understanding," says Brea.For nearly two years, she was too ill to get out of bed for more than 10 minutes a day."I spent a lot of time wondering: 'If I never leave this bedroom again, if I can't read, write or think, then who am I?What value does my life have?What purpose or meaning does it have to even keep existing, if I am living a life that is this limited?'"She describes ME as a "perfect prison", custom-made for each sufferer."It doesn't matter what you once were, it removes your ability to exert yourself and be a part of the world."If you were an accountant then you might find that you can no longer add and subtract, if you're a mother you can't be there for your children the way you want, if you are an athlete or a teacher, that's impossible.Everything becomes impossible."Image caption In Unrest, Jen and her husband Omar confront an uncertain future in the face of chronic illness (Photo: Jason Frank) In the documentary we see the couple's private anguish as Brea wonders about their future as a family."I can't be someone's mum like this.I can't be someone's wife like this," she says, in tears.Wasow admits there have been times where he has found her condition incredibly difficult, particularly in the beginning."The person I'd fallen in love with was sort of fading before my eyes," he says.I am the one that has been confined to this prison.He can choose to do whatever he wants This wasn't lost on Brea, as the film explores her guilt.At one point she cries: "I'm nothing.I can't give you anything."She explains: "I am the one that has been confined to this prison.He can choose to travel the world and do whatever he wants with the freedom of the body he has.Even though I didn't choose this, his life has been altered because of this thing that's happened to me.""Fundamentally what I get from our relationship is her company," says Wasow."The fact that her mind is as sharp and vibrant and interesting as it was when I first met her means that I still feel quite lucky."Brea feels lucky too, even though there are days where her mind feels far from sharp.But she points out that it is still seen as exceptional for a man to stay and look after a woman."If he were sick and I had stayed to care for him, I don't think people would look at me as a hero," she says.Image caption Omar Wasow and Jennifer Brea Find out more By its nature, ME is extremely isolating.Many sufferers are stuck in their beds, invisible to the outside world, and the medical establishment.As time went by, and she found herself in limbo - with limited treatment options - Brea realised she needed to come to terms with her new life, and find purpose and happiness.One of the main driving forces behind this change was discovering the online ME community, some members of which had been living in their beds for five, 10, even 20 years.As she made friends with fellow patients, she decided to film their stories.With a little bit of creative thinking, videoconferencing software and a tablet, she was able to interview and direct film crews from her bed, saving her the month-long recovery that a day of filming would usually necessitate.Her camera was wheeled into bedrooms across the world, into intimate spaces where few but the patient's family and carers had ever been, to film the reality of a disease that is usually hidden behind closed doors."The key symptom we share is that whenever we exert ourselves, physically or mentally, we pay and we pay hard," she says.Those signals of pain or fatigue are your body trying to tell you something - I wish I had listened But much of what Brea saw gave her hope for the future."I found that it is possible to live a life of meaning and purpose even if you're bedridden.It is possible to be a mother - and a very good mother - even if you're bedridden," she says.Meanwhile, the desperate situations she witnessed gave her a new sense of purpose."Once I started to realise just how many people had been living trapped in their homes or bedrooms and really marginalised by medicine and science, then I started to conceive of this as a social justice issue."It wasn't about me, it was about the fact that there were so many of us, and what could I do for all of us to try to start to make some progress."Image caption Unable to find treatment, Jen tries to understand the science and metabolics of her disease in the film Unrest (Photo: Shella Films) Physically, Brea has made some progress.She says she has benefited from drug therapies being trialled in the US, including anti-viral drugs that were first developed for HIV, and a drug used to treat auto-immune conditions.From having been bed-bound 99% of the time, she is now travelling round the world to talk about Unrest.Making the film accessible to people who may be housebound has been important to Brea, and she has used video-chat software to host online question and answer sessions with the audience.The response has been positive."What I've started to see happen is that patients feel like they can share their experiences, come out and be more public."She hopes it will unite patients and scientists in a search for answers."It's not until we have a consensus that not only is this disease real, but it is debilitating and has been neglected, that we are going to see the investment and research that we need," she says.Looking back now, Brea wishes she had listened to her own body more."I wish I had understood how much exertion was harming me.I think if I had completely rested right after my infection, I might have recovered.Those signals of pain or fatigue are your body trying to tell you something - I wish I had listened to myself."More from BBC Stories Jessica, who features in Jennifer Brea's documentary, was bedridden for 10 years with ME and osteoporosis.She was told that she'd never be on her feet again, but she made it her mission to walk to the altar on her wedding day.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Determined to walk on my wedding day Portrait of Jen and Omar by Phil Coomes Follow Natasha Lipman on Twitter Join the conversation -

'My therapist reignited my sex abuse trauma':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption "Marie" says her counsellors offered to bath her The ineffective regulation of those practising talking therapies - such as counselling and psychotherapy - is leaving patients at risk of harm, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has been told.For two sexual abuse victims, painful memories were brought back to the surface.Sitting in a room with three female counsellors, "Marie" hoped her counselling would help her deal with at least some of the emotional pain caused by the sexual abuse she had endured from the age of nine to 18.They had begun by saying "all the right things", she explains.But looking back on the session now, she feels like she had been in a "place of terror".The main practitioner sat so close, she says, that she was able to feel their breath - reigniting memories of past sexual assaults."It was very intimidating, my space being invaded," says Marie.When she repeatedly sat with her legs crossed, contrary to the therapist's orders, she says the counsellor "actually got hold of me, holding my arms, looking in my eyes"."I was getting very, very distressed, and feeling very sick, very ill, shaking."It's at that point they actually brought a sick bowl in because I was so distressed and traumatised."The therapists later asked her if she wanted to be given a bath by all three of them, "as a way of showing nurturing towards me", she says.'Slap on wrist' The government has recently begun a consultation into the regulation of healthcare professionals, calling for an improved system "to protect patients"."While the healthcare regulators are generally effective in protecting the public from serious harm," the Department of Health says in the foreword, "there has been criticism, not least from the regulators themselves, that the system is slow, expensive, complicated, reactive, overly adversarial and confusing for patients, professionals and employers."The main therapist was suspended following a hearing after Marie made complaints against her.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some psychotherapists continue practising after they have been struck off, campaign group Safe Spaces says But after an appeal process - which Marie was not allowed to attend - this was withdrawn, and she was allowed to continue to practise."It's appalling, it's disgraceful," she says."They've caused me so much harm and yet the sanctions they give - it's like a slap on the wrist."Most therapists are ethical, but the ones that aren't - there's no deterrent."In a 2016 report, campaign group Unsafe Spaces said "at least one in four" of those struck off appeared to still be practising.'He wanted me for sex' As a child, Kate was sexually, physically and emotionally abused.She sought professional help through the NHS years later as an adult, each week meeting a psychotherapist who knew she had a long history of mental health problems because of her traumatic childhood.Yet she says he too sexually abused her."The person who was supposed to help me recover did no more than perpetuate the abuse."In 2010 he pressured her into having sex with him, she says, which continued for three months."I was terrified but I didn't have the strength to stop it.It took me back to the abuse I had suffered as a child."I thought he cared about me but all he wanted me for was sex."Image copyright Getty Images When Kate finally found the strength to report him, he was immediately suspended by the NHS Trust and sacked for gross professional misconduct.Kate was paid damages.Two years later she decided to go to the police, who investigated.But prosecutors decided not to take the case to court, leaving Kate devastated."Victims of sexual abuse in childhood who suffer severe mental health problems in adult life should be able to receive treatment from NHS services without being abused again.The law is in place and should be used," she says.Kate says that after her psychotherapist was sacked, he was still able to work privately.'Unscrupulous people' Gary Fereday, chief executive of the British Psychoanalytic Council, says the current regulatory system "allows unscrupulous people to claim they're psychotherapists"."If they've been struck off from one register they can simply register with another body, or call themselves something different, and continue to practise."The Department of Health said it had created "a comprehensive public record of accredited professionals, overseen by the independent Professional Standards Authority."Marie now wants to make sure no-one else has to go through what she did."I think it would break most people.And they've been broken once - that's why they're going into therapy."Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.
How fear puts girls off PE:::::Image copyright Girls Active Image caption Gracie says learning to love PE has transformed her life Gracie Rowe used to be terrified of PE."I was on the tubby side."My personal self-consciousness was like a devil on my shoulder telling me I couldn't do it."It was the fact that I had to move, be active and sweat."I would just stand and watch and mope."Gracie says she had zero self-confidence when she started secondary school.She was so nervous that she tried to persuade her mum she was sick most days and twice-weekly PE lessons were a particular source of stress."I was worried that people judged me.It was because I wasn't happy with myself."The school's PE uniform didn't help: "It was a 'skort' - sort of shorts and skirt in one - and it was quite tight and short."All my friends hated PE just as much as I did."Hayley Wood-Thompson, Gracie's PE teacher at The John Warner School in Hertfordshire, says about half of the girls feel the same.The school shares its site with a sports centre, so has the use of excellent facilities."We offer quite a broad spectrum of activities.There is a dance studio and swimming pool.But lots of the girls are still turned off by it."Image copyright The John Warner School Image caption Hayley Wood-Thompson is a PE teacher at The John Warner School The UK's chief medical officer recommends school-age children do at least an hour of exercise each day.But new research with 25,000 secondary students in England and Northern Ireland suggests that, at secondary level, only 8% of girls and 16% of boys manage this.Of the teenagers, surveyed by Youth Sport Trust and Women in Sport, more than 80% understood the importance of being active but almost half of boys and nearly two-thirds of girls were less than keen on taking part themselves.The research suggests lack of confidence is key.Among girls over 14, more than a third said they felt insecure, hated other people watching them and were self-conscious about their bodies.Almost two-thirds said they disliked competitive PE lessons.Skorts out Gracie's mum and her teachers realised they had to boost her confidence to ensure she attended school.Her mum brought her in for meetings with the head of year - and the school enrolled her on to a healthy living project to improve her self-esteem.At the same time, big reforms to the school's PE programme were under way, designed to encourage girls to engage with the subject.First off, skorts were out, replaced by black sports leggings."It's the sort of thing you might wear to the gym on a Saturday morning.It feels a bit more adult," says Ms Wood-Thompson.The school also now divides its PE programme into pathways, allowing girls and boys to choose how much competitive and outdoors sport to do."The girls-only pathway is tailored to boosting levels of confidence."There will be a bit more aerobics, dance, being inside in the winter.So they're not turned off by being outside in the rain and cold."More sporty girls are offered a mixed programme with the less athletic boys - this might involve dodgeball, football and more competitive games."And sporty boys have a boys-only programme."Image copyright The John Warner School Image caption Gracie's activities include field days and camps with the Combined Cadet Force Gracie Rowe chose the girls-only pathway and liked it."It was just the fact that we didn't need to show off to anyone or act like someone we're not."Gradually her confidence improved.She not only started to join in PE, but began to enjoy it and made friends."It helped me forget what other people thought of me and have confidence in myself."Now 14, she is no longer tubby, plays in the football team for her school year, takes dance classes and is in the gym "all the time".She also joined the Combined Cadet Force run at a nearby private school, knows how a rifle works and takes part in field days and camps.Last year the school nominated her as a leader on the Youth Sport Trust's Girls' Active programme, which aims to tackle girls' negative body images, improve attitudes to physical activity and to make sport more relevant to them.Image copyright Girls Active Image caption Girls Active encourages girls who have overcome their fear of PE to help their classmates "She has made the biggest improvement I have ever seen," says her PE teacher."I know that not every girl is going to have a fully positive experience in every PE lesson every day but I hope I can enthuse them enough to encourage them to take part.It's all about relationships."She hopes the young leaders on the programme will help other girls overcome barriers to physical activity."They are very keen to improve the mental health and self-esteem of their peers."They really care about trying to remove the stigma of being active and getting sweaty and to foster a happy, supportive and relaxed environment for PE."Gracie says a myriad of factors can stop girls being active "but you realise you don't have to be like that or think like that"."I feel empowered now to influence other girls who were like me by showing them that there is no limit to what you can do."It doesn't matter on your size, age or ability level, start with what you are comfortable with and push those boundaries.Don't let anyone hold you back."
Check NHS cancer, A&E and operations targets in your area:::::The NHS is under unprecedented pressure.Rising numbers of patients need hospital care - whether in an accident and emergency department, for cancer treatment or for planned operations and care, such as knee and hip replacements.For each there are strict targets local services are expected to meet across the UK.But what are the chances of being seen in time where you live?Use our interactive tracker to find out.Sorry, your browser is unable to display this content.Please upgrade to a more recent browser.Search for a health trust or postcode Search for your nearest health trusts Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Browse the full list Go Rather search by typing?Back to search Inspection rating: 1.A&E Target hit Target not hit 2.Cancer care Target hit Target not hit 3.Planned ops & care Target hit Target not hit Figures are assessed against targets before rounding Other Trusts When was the target last hit?Other Trusts When was the target last hit?Other Trusts When was the target last hit?If you can't see the tracker, click or tap here.Waits for cancer care, A&E and ops worsen How the NHS Tracker works This guide uses the latest published data on performance against three key NHS waiting-time measures: A&E treatment cancer care planned operations and care, such as knee and hip replacements This data is currently published either monthly or quarterly depending on where you live in the UK, and there are differences between how the targets are measured in each part of the UK.See below for data sources.The A&E target The way the A&E target is measured is almost identical.In each case services across the UK are given four hours in which to treat and discharge or admit or transfer a patient.They are all expected to do that in 95% of cases, although ultimately Scotland wants it services to get to 98% once 95% is achieved.There are also slight differences in the way the start time is measured.The cancer target There are similarities in the way cancer care is measured.Each expects patients to be treated within 62 days of an urgent referral.In Scotland this can be following a GP or A&E referral or following a screening test.Elsewhere it is broken down individually by referral route.So for the rest of the UK the BBC has chosen GP referral as the area to focus on as this is the most common route.Again the thresholds services are expected to achieve vary.The planned operations and care target The one that varies the most is for planned hospital care, which is also known as non-emergency treatment.In England, Wales and Scotland the target measures the point at which you get a referral from your GP to the point when your treatment starts - in effect the whole patient journey.In Scotland and England services have 18 weeks, in Wales it is 26 weeks.Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland there are a range of targets for different parts of the patient journey.The BBC has chosen the last part, from when the decision is taken to admit the patient for treatment to when that treatment starts.It therefore does not include the tests and appointments that follow a GP referral, which can take weeks or even months.Services in Northern Ireland have 13 weeks to achieve this target.The thresholds vary too.None is expected to achieve these goals 100% of the time.In Northern Ireland services have to achieve the target in 55% of cases, whereas in Wales it is 95%, in England 92%, and in Scotland 90%.How local is defined In England data is provided down to individual hospital trust level, some of these run more than one hospital.The BBC has excluded specialist trusts for cancer, children's care, women's services and orthopaedic treatment and instead focused on the 135 general hospital trusts - what most people would consider their local service.Elsewhere performance is broken down to health board level, known as health and care trusts in Northern Ireland.They are in charge of services for a region or large city and often run more than one hospital.We have chosen these boards because while some data is provided down to individual hospital level it is not done across all three targets.How far back performance is tracked The BBC has tracked back performance to the point at which the latest target was set or to when the records allow.When a target has been missed for five years, we have just labelled it as that.When targets have been hit more recently, we have provided the month they were last hit.There are only two targets where it has not been possible to go back five years: in Scotland for A&E as the target threshold was reduced from 98% to 95% in October 2014 in Northern Ireland for planned operations and care because its 13-week target threshold of 55% was set only in April 2016 The full list of dates from which the performance of local services is available are: For England: A&E: June 2010 Cancer: January 2009 Planned operations: April 2012 For Northern Ireland: A&E: April 2008 Cancer: April 2009 Planned operations: April-June 2016 For Scotland: A&E: October 2014 Cancer: January 2012 Planned operations: January 2011 For Wales: A&E: October 2009 Cancer: October-December 2009 Planned operations: September 2011 Research by the BBC data team, Ransome Mpini, John Walton, Christine Jeavans, Nick Triggle and William Dahlgreen.Design by Sumi Senthinathan.Development by Chris Ashton, Evisa Terziu, Becky Rush and Alvin Ourrad.Data sources
'I spent my savings rather than wait for the NHS':::::Hospital services are facing mounting pressure.Staff shortages, rising demand and a squeeze on budgets mean waiting times are rising in many places.And while the health service still sees most patients quickly - whether they turn up at an accident and emergency unit, need cancer treatment or have to have an operation - growing numbers are having to wait longer than they should.So what is it like for those caught up in the system?'I waited so long I gave up and spent most of my life savings' Image copyright Supplied Image caption Christine Moon, pictured here with her partner, Geoff, waited for months for a coronary bypass on the NHS Christine Moon, 66, was on holiday in Bali in 2015 when she started feeling chest pains.When she returned to her home in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, she went to see her GP and ended up in hospital having all number of tests on heart."Eventually, they said, 'I'm very sorry, but we've decided you have a 90% block in your coronary artery,'" she told BBC News.This was in August last year.She then waited until November to see a consultant, who said she needed a coronary bypass but there would be an additional 18-week wait.So, 18 weeks later, she rang the hospital."I was told they were way behind and they had absolutely no idea where I was on the waiting list," Ms Moon told BBC News."No-one at the hospital could tell me when I was likely to have my operation."Every week, patients in more critical need of a bypass were being referred to the hospital, effectively bumping her further down the queue, she said."I couldn't do any housework, I couldn't do stuff that I normally did.My symptoms were getting worse, but I wasn't going to have a heart attack."In April this year, 32 weeks after being diagnosed, she gave up on waiting and paid 16,000 to have the operation privately."I had to think long and hard about it, but it was really hanging over me," Ms Moon told the BBC."I was more and more depressed, and just not able to get an answer out of anyone."Having the operation had given her "bags of energy" and her life back, she said.But, she is angry and has spent much of her savings.Ms Moon told the BBC: "Eighteen weeks seems to be this magic number they come out with that is just lies."Would I still be on a waiting list if I had not gone privately?I may well have been."Search for a health trust or postcode Search for your nearest health trusts Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Browse the full list Go Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker, click or tap here.'Doctors want something they can fix in 10 minutes' Image copyright Supplied Image caption Holly has had many complex health conditions since she was a child Holly Wilson was nine years old when she started seeing doctors on a regular basis.She had a condition where her white blood cells infiltrated her bowel, causing inflammation and pain.Since then, the 22 year-old, from Chichester, has been in and out of hospital."The list is endless," she said, of the number of medical conditions that cause her day-to-day pain.Her entire body is affected, including her connective tissue, joints and gut, and once she had a cyst on her ovary "the size of a grapefruit"."At one point, I was in hospital 30 times in a year," Ms Wilson told the BBC."There are a lot of problems - I'm very, very complicated.I'm always known as the difficult, complex patient."She has noticed waiting times increase, and recently had to wait more than 10 hours for a medical slip to give to her employer to allow her to return to work.Her most recent medical issue is a fast heart rate and palpitations.Doctors are trying to diagnose what is causing it, but it can take up to 18 months between being referred for tests and getting the results."The long wait for this diagnosis - it's a lot of not really knowing, which makes it stressful," Ms Wilson told the BBC."Doctors want something they can fix in 10 minutes.""They're trying to see so many people in such a short amount of time."But Ms Wilson's three folders of medical history do not make this easy."Doctors look at all these notes, and they're just too much for one person to take them in," she said."I don't feel the notes are being read or paid attention to as much as they should be."Ms Wilson doesn't want to "bash the NHS"."They have done a lot for me.Without them I wouldn't be alive," she said."It's just frustrating as I have been in and out of hospital since I was very small and I have noticed the change."'My wait was so long I launched a formal complaint' Image copyright Supplied Image caption Andy Goble waited almost a year for an operation that would fuse his talonavicular joint Andy Goble, 48, had painful arthritis in his feet.He had one foot operated on and then, a couple of years later, in August 2016, doctors said they needed to operate on the other."The idea of the operation is to fuse two bones in the foot to stop them grinding together and stop the pain," he told the BBC.The condition means he struggles to walk any great distance and lives in continual pain.Even though he works from his home, in Southend-on-Sea, the condition has affected his work as a web designer."I am self-employed and find it impossible to work all day," he said."I am also unable to drive much of a distance if I need to visit clients."This is starting to cause me financial problems."The father of two has also had to take painkillers, which tire him out.He waited an "absolute age" to receive a date for the operation, which was then cancelled a week later.And in May, after many phone calls, he decided to launch a formal complaint."Then, all of a sudden, everyone jumps and gets involved," Mr Goble told the BBC.The hospital had "bent over backwards" to get the surgery done, he said, scheduling operations "at weird and wonderful times", with his taking place on a Sunday morning 15 weeks ago.He can now walk again, but his foot remains very painful as it recovers."Because it's not life threatening - it's just pain-relief surgery - you come bottom of the list," he said."It's always the lowest priority.""There is knock-on pain to other joints, such as the knee, hip and back.So, while you're waiting, the condition gets worse and affects your life more and more."'I waited almost six weeks for an urgent appointment when I had late-stage cancer' It was February 2014 when Susan Down, now 65, first thought something was wrong."It was quite sinister what I found, the lump," she told the BBC."I'd had it for quite a few weeks, and it was getting worse."She saw a GP, who gave her creams for piles.A couple of weeks later, when things hadn't improved, the GP gave her a referral for an emergency appointment.Despite it being deemed urgent, her local hospital wasn't as quick to respond as she had expected."I was quite anxious.I kept calling the hospital," Ms Down told the BBC.Five and a half weeks later, she got an appointment."Then they were running around like headless chickens," she said, giving her six different tests over the next fortnight.Her daughters and partner went with her to the appointment.She was told she had stage-four anal cancer and that her tumour was 2.5cm (1in)."It hadn't metastasised, but it was very big and pushing it's way to the front," Ms Down told the BBC."If it had gotten right through to the front, I would've been poisoned."Her diagnosis caused her to retire from her job, as a support worker for adults with learning disabilities.It took a couple of months before she was fitted with a stoma, and then she had to wait a couple more months before she could get radiotherapy."The doctor said, 'Lets get on with it or else you will die,'" Ms Down told the BBC.The radiotherapy machine at her local hospital was not appropriate for her so she had to be treated in a specialist hospital in Hertfordshire, a two-hour drive from her home in Kent.She had six weeks of radiotherapy followed by two weeks of chemotherapy."At first they couldn't say it had shrunk, because it was so big," Ms Down told the BBC."But after a few months they said it as going in the right direction."Looking back I think, That was awful.'"Now, Ms Down spends half her week looking after her one-year-old granddaughter, Charlotte.She appears to be clear of cancer, but has long-term problems from the treatment.
Antarctica's warm underbelly revealed:::::Image copyright BAS Image caption Hotspots are located under West Antarctica; in contrast, the East is broadly relatively cold This is the best map yet produced of the warmth coming up from the rocks underneath the Antarctic ice sheet.This "geothermal heat flux" is key data required by scientists in order to model how the White Continent is going to react to climate change.If the rockbed's temperature is raised, it makes it easier for the ice above to move.And if global warming is already forcing change on the ice sheet, a higher flux could accelerate matters.The map was made by researchers at the British Antarctic survey and is published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters."The heat coming from the Earths interior is important to understand the overall conditions that control the dynamics at the base of the ice sheet and hence the ice flow, explained Yasmina Martos, currently affiliated to the US space agency."If this heat flux is elevated, the ice base can melt and produce water that acts as a sliding film."One result of our study is that the heat flux is higher underneath West Antarctica, where more ice is currently melting, than underneath East Antarctica."Even a little melting at the base helps the ice sheet to slide faster.We also identified areas of low heat flux, which will help stabilising the ice sheet," she told BBC News.Image copyright M.BRANDON/OU Image caption The West contributes most to sea level rise currently, but this is a consequence of warm ocean water eroding glacier fronts - not from the interior ice sheet being melted by underlying warm rock No-one has actually drilled through the kilometres of ice in Antarctica to take the temperature of the bed.Instead, the BAS team inferred the likely warmth of rocks from their magnetism.This property can be sensed by instruments flown across the surface of the ice sheet by planes.What happens next is a smart calculation.Scientists know the temperature (580C) at which hot minerals lose their magnetism, so if they can gauge how close to the rock-ice interface this occurring then they have a means of estimating the heat flux.The new map is said to represent a 30-50% improvement on previous efforts.It supports - but with far more detail - the established idea that East and West Antarctica are very different provinces.The East is a giant chunk of old, cold continental crust.The West, however, underwent recent rifting in the Cretaceous (100 million years ago) that has pulled it apart."This rifting has thinned the crust and brought hot material from deep down in the Earth - from hundreds of km down - to within 100km or so, or even maybe less, of the rock surface," said co-author Tom Jordan."It confirms what you would expect from the sparse, exposed geology in West Antarctica where we have volcanoes."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tom Jordan: "Just the ice being warm means it's more plastic and deformable" One of the great advances in polar science in the past decade is the recognition that there is a really extensive hydrological network under the ice sheet.Rivers of water feed huge subglacial lakes that fill and burst their banks periodically.Satellites see the top of the ice sheet heave and relax when this happens.Any projections of future change in Antarctica and its contribution to sea level rise through the loss of ice have to take this basement hydrology into account, and the variations in geothermal heat flux are a critical part of the overall picture.One research project that will see an immediate benefit from the maps data is the quest to drill the oldest ice on the continent.Europe, America, China and others are seeking a location where they can collect a core of frozen material that contains a record of past climate stretching back at least 1.5 million years.This information - about historic atmospheric conditions including carbon dioxide levels - can be deciphered from tiny air bubbles trapped in the ice.But the whole endeavour depends on the base of the ice sheet being undisturbed.Places with a warm rock underbelly are therefore to be avoided, obviously."It is very exciting to see the implications this new heat map has for many communities, including new generations of ice sheet and sea level models," said Dr Martos."I am very glad we are contributing an important aspect at unprecedented detail.The Earths interior has a lot to tell us in terms on how the ice behaves."Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos
'World's oldest wine' found in 8,000-year-old jars in Georgia:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Some of the Neolithic jars bore decorations of grapes Scientists say 8,000-year-old pottery fragments have revealed the earliest evidence of grape wine-making.The earthenware jars containing residual wine compounds were found in two sites south of the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, researchers said.Some of the jars bore images of grape clusters and a man dancing.Previously, the earliest evidence of wine-making was from pottery dating from about 7,000 years ago found in north-western Iran.The latest finds were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)."We believe this is the oldest example of the domestication of a wild-growing Eurasian grapevine solely for the production of wine," said co-author Stephen Batiuk, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto."Wine is central to civilisation as we know it in the West.As a medicine, social lubricant, mind-altering substance and highly valued commodity, wine became the focus of religious cults, pharmacopoeias, cuisines, economies and society in the ancient Near East."Traditional methods The pottery jars were discovered in two Neolithic villages, called Gadachrili Gora and Shulaveris Gora, about 50km (30 miles) south of Tbilisi, researchers said.Telltale chemical signs of wine were discovered in eight jars, the oldest one dating from about 5,980 BC.Large jars called qvevri, similar to the ancient ones, are still used for wine-making in Georgia, said David Lordkipanidze, director of the Georgian National Museum who helped lead the research.Mr Batiuk said the wine was probably made in a similar way to the qvevri method today "where the grapes are crushed and the fruit, stems and seeds are all fermented together".Previously, the earliest evidence of grape wine-making had been found in the Zagros Mountains of Iran and dated to 5,400-5,000 BC.In 2011, a wine press and fermentation jars from about 6,000 years ago were found in a cave in Armenia.The world's earliest non-grape based wine is believe to be a fermented alcoholic beverage of rice, honey and fruit found in China and dating to about 7,000 BC.
First CO2 rise in four years puts pressure on Paris targets:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Consumption of coal has grown once again in China after three years of decline Global emissions of CO2 in 2017 are projected to rise for the first time in four years, dashing hopes that a peak might soon be reached.The main cause of the expected growth has been greater use of coal in China as its economy expanded.Researchers are uncertain if the rise in emissions is a one-off or the start of a new period of CO2 build-up.Scientists say that a global peak in CO2 before 2020 is needed to limit dangerous global warming this century.The Global Carbon Project has been analysing and reporting on the scale of emissions of CO2 since 2006.Carbon output has grown by about 3% per year in that period, but growth essentially declined or remained flat between 2014 and 2016.Concern at first CO2 rise in four years The latest figures indicate that in 2017, emissions of CO2 from all human activities grew by about 2% globally.There is some uncertainty about the data but the researchers involved have concluded that emissions are on the rise again."Global CO2 emissions appear to be going up strongly once again after a three-year stable period.This is very disappointing," said the lead author of the study, Prof Corinne Le Qur from the University of East Anglia."With global CO2 emissions from human activities estimated at 41 billion tonnes for 2017, time is running out on our ability to keep warming well below 2 degrees C, let alone 1.5C."The most important element in causing this rise has been China, which is responsible for around 28% of the global total.Emissions there went up 3.5% in 2017, mainly because of increased coal use, driven in the main by a growing economy.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption US coal production has increased slightly this year mainly due to export demand Another important factor in China has been lower water levels in rivers which have seen a drop in the amount of electricity made from hydro-power, with utilities turning to coal and gas to make up the shortfall.US emissions have continued to decline but the fall has been less than expected.Higher prices saw a drop in the use of natural gas for electricity - with renewables and hydro-power picking up the slack.Coal use has also grown slightly in the US this year, with consumption up about a half of one percent.India's emissions are projected to grow by about 2%, which is a considerable decrease from around 6% per year over the last decade.However, experts believe that this may be a temporary drop-off caused by a number of factors that have hampered the consumption of oil and cement.Action required Europe also saw a smaller decline than expected, falling by 0.2% compared with 2.2% over the last 10 years.One common theme around the world is continued use of gas and oil, says Prof Le Qur."There have been lots of ups and downs in the use of coal but in the background there has been no weakening in the use of oil and gas.And that is quite worrisome."The report has been launched in Bonn where UN negotiators are trying to move forward with the rules for the Paris climate agreement.Researchers involved with the study say they are not moving fast enough."Lots of diplomats are working out the rules but that is all a little bit meaningless unless they go back home to their countries and ratchet up climate action and that is where the gap is," said Dr Glen Peters, from the Centre for International Climate Research in Norway."These countries have to be pushing on with the policies, but everything keeps getting pushed back."Image copyright Sean Hawkey/WCC Image caption Demonstrators at UN talks in Bonn demand faster cuts in carbon The report is sure to increase tensions in Bonn between developed and developing nations.There is increasing resentment about the fact that all the focus is on future commitments made under the Paris climate agreement but very little on the years before it becomes active.Poorer countries want the richer ones to increase their carbon-cutting actions over the next three years."The climate will not let us wait until 2020 when the Paris agreement comes into force," said Nicaragua's chief negotiator, Paul Oquist."Climate change is happening now and it's vital that immediate actions to cut emissions become a feature of this summit."The new research on carbon emissions has been published simultaneously in the journals Nature Climate Change,Earth System Science Data Discussions and Environmental Research Letters.
Brexit: Environment watchdog planned says Gove:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some MPs are concerned Brexit poses a risk to UK wildlife and habitats A new environment watchdog to protect UK wildlife, land, water and air once Britain leaves the European Union is being planned by the government.Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the body would hold the powerful to account and deliver a green Brexit.The plans come amid concerns that environmental regulations enshrined in EU law could be lost after Brexit.Mr Gove told the Andrew Marr Show standards would not be sacrificed as part of a potential US free trade deal.Wildlife prioritised Mr Gove wants the watchdog to be independent of government - able to speak its mind freely, he said, with clear legal authority.Writing in The Telegraph, he said the watchdog would have "real bite" but did not outline exact planned powers.He said it was important that environmental enforcement and policymaking remained bound to a clear set of principles once Britain leaves the EU.He added that the watchdog would make a national policy statement to ensure policymakers protect the environment, and remain grounded by rigorous scientific evidence.Speaking to Andrew Marr, Mr Gove rejected suggestions from US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that the UK may relax its policies to secure an agreement post-Brexit."While we do want a trade deal with the United States, we will not lower environment or animal welfare standards," he said."Free trade is a good thing, but free trade flounders on the rocks of public opinion if it is used as a Trojan horse for lowering environmental standards, so we're not going there."Some MPs are worried Brexit poses a risk to UK wildlife and habitats - with the cross-party Environmental Audit Committee calling for the creation of new environmental protection law.Labour's Mary Creagh, chair of the committee, told BBC News earlier this year: "European law protects huge amounts of the UK's environment, farming and countryside."The government has said the EU Withdrawal Bill - which goes before MPs for debate this week - will incorporate many of these regulations.Supporting British farmers Mr Gove also outlined his vision for British agriculture and wildlife once Britain leaves the EU.Describing British farmers as the "best in the world", he said he wanted to "help support farmers produce food in a sustainable and productive way".Mr Gove told Marr that in the event of a no deal scenario, British food would still be "increasingly in demand worldwide"."The trend overall globally is toward greater quality and British farmers are in the best position to meet that," he added.He also revealed plans to plant 11 million trees over the next decade, and encourage a "wider range of species"."I want the number of birds to increase - particularly farmland birds," he concluded.
Scale of 'nitrate timebomb' revealed:::::Image copyright BGS Image caption The team estimated the nitrate pollution stored in rocks above groundwater Huge quantities of nitrate chemicals from farm fertilisers are polluting the rocks beneath our feet, a study says.Researchers at the British Geological Survey say it could have severe global-scale consequences for rivers, water supplies, human health and the economy.They say the nitrate will be released from the rocks into rivers via springs.That will cause toxic algal blooms and fish deaths, and will cost industry and consumers billions of pounds a year in extra water treatment.In a paper in Nature Communications, the scientists from BGS and Lancaster University estimate that up to 180 million tonnes of nitrate are stored in rocks worldwide - perhaps twice the amount stored in soils.They say this is the first global estimate of the amount of nitrate trapped between the soil layer and the water-bearing aquifers below.They warn that over time the nitrate will inevitably slowly seep into the aquifers.Image copyright Getty Images Most nitrate, the team says, is in rocks in North America, China and Europe where fertiliser has been lavishly applied for decades.In some developed countries, the amount of nitrate stored in the rocks is increasing, despite improvements in farming practice and the introduction of rules to control the pollutant.In developing countries, the problem is currently not so severe.But there is an urgent need for early intervention to avoid the environmental damage experienced by rich countries.Matthew Ascott, hydrogeologist at the BGS and lead author, said: "With big investments being made to reduce water pollution through changes in farming, it is vital that we understand what pollution is already in the environment."Water and the pollutant travels through the rocks below our feet very slowly.This and a history of intensive agriculture means that a large store of nitrate pollution has built up over time."When this pollution is released, it will continue to impact water quality for decades, in some cases, even where controls on fertiliser use have been put in place."Image copyright BGS/Ascott et al Image caption The unsaturated region below soils but above groundwater is called the vadose zone This is what's known as the nitrate timebomb.The EU is trying to clamp down on careless application of nitrates but farmers say the fertilisers are vital for agricultural productivity.The UK government has said all EU environmental laws will be brought into British law after Brexit.But a legal taskforce set up by the UK Environmental Law Association (UKELA) to examine the risks of Brexit identified nitrate pollution as an example of the protections that will be at risk when European laws are rolled over into domestic legislation in 2019.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin
Venus and Jupiter conjunction: Sky-watchers witness dawn display:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Jupiter and Venus were photographed here above Brighton Pier Jupiter and Venus - the two brightest planets - have appeared together in the morning sky.The planetary conjunction was visible to the naked eye across much of the UK, with the time before dawn being the best to catch the spectacle.Experts said the planets were so close as to appear almost on top of each other.One astronomer said it would probably be "decades rather than years" before they appeared as close together.While the planets have been visible to the unaided eye, viewers with a telescope have also been able to see Jupiter's four Galilean moons.People in the UK have taken to social media to share their photos of the planetary display.Viewed from London, the planets began appearing shortly before 06:00 GMT with the conjunction occurring just after.Those on high ground with a clear view of the eastern horizon had the best chance of witnessing the planetary display.Image copyright Tim Jilani Image caption This image of the planetary display was captured by Alexandra Palace in London Image copyright Ian Bonnell Image caption The planets were spotted here in the Merseyside skyline Image copyright Jodrell Bank Image caption The conjunction of the planets looks like a bright star Image caption In 2004, the planet Venus could be seen crossing the Sun as a small black dot Mark Thompson, an astronomer and former presenter on the BBC show Stargazing Live, said conjunctions occur when planets line up in such a way that they appear from Earth to be next to each other - despite in this case being hundreds of millions of miles apart.Mr Thompson told the BBC the cloudy atmospheres of the two planets made them appear bright to the naked eye.He said the event was not uncommon - Venus and Jupiter appeared together in 2015 and 2016, also on 13 November - but it was much rarer for them to appear so close to each other."There have certainly been cases where they've been close in the sky but they've not been this close in recent years, certainly the last couple of planetary conjunctions."This is actually quite a good conjunction because they're so close, and over the next few years they'll pass each other and be close but not this close "One as close as this, you're probably looking decades rather than years."The conjunction can also be seen in countries in the mid-northern latitudes, including parts of the US.Those who missed the event will be able to see the two planets again on Tuesday morning, but they will not be as close together.According to Nasa, stargazers will be treated to another planetary pairing later this month, when Saturn will meet Mercury on the western horizon at dusk on 24 and 28 November.You may also like:
Antarctic base comes out of deep freeze:::::Image copyright BAS Image caption In good shape: Halley station is now being readied for the summer season The advance party sent in to open up Britains mothballed Antarctic base have found no damage.Halley station was closed in March and staff withdrawn because of uncertainty over the behaviour of cracks in the Brunt Ice Shelf - the flowing, floating platform on which it sits.The base was secured and left to the elements, with temperatures dipping down to around -50C.But the first arrivals say Halley is none the worse for its shut-down.The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) flew a party of 12 into the base to start switching all the utilities back on - the power and heating.One fear was that windows might have broken in a storm and that this could have allowed snow to get inside.But that has not been the case.Halley operations manager John Eager said: "The team was very pleased to find the station in such good shape.It's testament to how well last season's team carried out the shut-down just after we successfully re-located the modules 23km inland."Apart from a few carpet tiles lifting, and some crazing on inner glazing, everything is exactly as we left it.It is early days in the season, and many complex challenges remain, but it's a great start by the team on the ice."Some further technical investigations are being carried out to assess how well all the materials and equipment faired during winter.Image copyright BAS Image caption Halley should be occupied year-round Halley is now being prepared for the annual southern summer influx of scientists in the coming weeks.The Royal Research Ship Ernest Shackleton is also expected soon with supplies.Together with the Rothera base on the Antarctic Peninsula, Halley spearheads British activity on the White Continent.The station gathers important weather and climate data, and it played a critical role in the research that identified the ozone "hole" in 1985.In recent years, Halley has also become a major centre for studying solar activity and the impacts this can have on Earth.Image copyright BAS Image caption Some detailed technical investigations continue at Halley Halley is supposed to be a year-round station, but its position on the 150m-thick Brunt Ice Shelf has always had a bearing on its operations.Two fissures are spreading across the shelf.One is a large chasm cutting in front of the base on its seaward side, the other is a long, arcing split that is moving eastwards and away from Halley.Both fissures are set to spawn big icebergs.Image copyright BAS Image caption Halley's library: The facilities will soon be in use by scientists The concern for glaciologists is that both cracks run near to a feature known as the McDonald Ice Rumples.This is a raised area of seafloor that helps pin the shelf in place.We hope - as we actually predict - that the chasm will not disconnect the shelf from the rumples.But it is a concern that if that were to happen we dont know what the stability of the shelf will be in the long term, BAS science director Prof David Vaughan told BBC News.Image copyright BAS Image caption The summer accommodation blocks and garages It is this uncertainty that has prompted BAS to make Halley a summer-only base for the time being.Evacuation is relatively straightforward in the benign months around the turn of the year, but it becomes extremely hazardous when winter weather is coupled with long polar nights (105 days are spent in 24-hour darkness).En route now to Halley is a so-called micro-turbine - a kind of jet engine in a box.This will be used to power automated instruments next winter when the base is once again in shut-down.The turbine is designed to run for thousands of hours without servicing and should provide sufficient electricity to warm the experiments.Scientists are keen to maintain a basic stream from Halley of weather data, ozone readings, and geomagnetic observations.Image caption The uncertainty is how the cracks will connect with the rumples Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos
Extinct wolf-sized otter had powerful bite:::::Image copyright Maurico Anton Image caption The otter lived in a swamp surrounded by evergreen forest A giant otter that roamed southwestern China six million years ago had a surprisingly strong bite and could have been a top predator, say scientists.Studies of the animal's fossilised skull reveal that it had the chewing ability of a bear.Unlike its living relatives, which feed on fish and shellfish, the otter may have eaten a wide range of prey.It was capable of crushing big mollusc shells or the bones of birds and rodents, according to a new study.The research, published in the journal, Scientific Reports, provides insight into the life of this oversized otter.Known as Siamogale melilutra, it weighed more than 50kg and was the size of a wolf.Not only was it larger than living otters, but its jaws were more powerful."We conducted a series of engineering simulations on the jaw models of fossil otters as well as ten living otter species and what we found was that the fossil otter had a jaw that was six times as strong as expected, based on what we see in living species," Dr Jack Tseng of the University at Buffalo, US, who led the research, told BBC News.The fossil record of the animal is incomplete.The few skull fragments that have been discovered were found in what was once a swamp or shallow lake surrounded by evergreen forest or dense woodland.The site, known as Shuitangba, has yielded hundreds of fossils of animals and plants, which are exceptionally well preserved.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The European otter is among 13 living species "There was a diverse aquatic fauna at Shuitangba, including fish, crab, molluscs, turtles and frogs, as well as many different species of water birds, all of which could have been potential prey for S. melilutra," said Denise Su, a paleoecologist at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.The animal's size and jaw strength would have made it a formidable hunter.Although scientists can't be sure, they think the otter was unusual in exploiting a varied diet."Carnivores are known to evolve powerful jaws, often for the purpose of cracking the bones of their prey," said Xiaoming Wang, a curator in the Vertebrate Paleontology Department of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County."In the shallow swamp of South China, it's possible that an abundance of big clams drove these giant otters to acquire their rare traits, including their crushing teeth and robust jaws."Otters are carnivorous mammals that are adapted to hunting and living in and around water.The 13 living otter species are found throughout the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa.The otter is found across the UK, where it is gradually returning to rivers after years of conservation efforts.Follow Helen on Twitter.
Government urged to act over computer science GCSEs:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The lack of skilled teachers is the biggest problem, the report found More than half of England's secondary schools, 54%, did not offer GCSE computer science in 2015-16, a report from the Royal Society has found.It urged the government to increase spending on computer education tenfold over the next five years to ensure youngsters can "unlock the full potential of new technologies".The biggest issue was the lack of skilled teachers, the report found.The Department for Education said more pupils were choosing the subject."We want to ensure our future workforce has the skills we need to drive the future productivity and economy of this country and that is why the government made computing a compulsory part of the national curriculum," said a spokesperson."Computer science GCSE entries continue to rise more quickly than any other subject."We recently saw an increase in entries to Stem subjects [science, technology, engineering and maths] for the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) and the number of girls taking Stem subjects at A-levels has increased by over 17% since 2010."Since 2012, the department has pledged 5m to the Network of Teaching Excellence in Computer Science programme, which has built a national network of nearly 400 computer science specialists (who) schools can commission to provide bespoke training for their teachers."Computer science in numbers The number of schools not offering the subject at GCSE represented 30% of the total number of pupils in England Across the UK, the report found that that only 11% of students in England took GCSE computer science In 2017 only 20% of GCSE candidates in the subject were female and the figure fell to 10% at A-level Bournemouth had the highest percentage of pupils (23%) opting to take computer science Hartlepool, Harrow and Bracknell Forest had the highest proportion of school offering the subject at GCSE level, not including the Isles of Scilly which has a 100% rate as it teaches it at its only school Two in three schools near the UK's technology hub in East London, did not offer it to pupils as a GSCE option Other London boroughs, including Islington, Kensington & Chelsea, Tower Hamlets and the City of London also had a low proportion of schools offering the subject The Royal Society, the UK's independent scientific academy, is concerned about how the lack of computing expertise will affect the future workforce.Prof Steve Furber, who worked on the report, said: "Computing teachers have told us that they feel the government rushed in a new curriculum without giving them the support or money to deliver it."The report paints a bleak picture in England, which meets only 68% of its computing teacher recruitment targets and where, as a result, one in two schools don't offer computer science at GCSE, a crucial stage of young people's education."He added that, "overhauling the fragile state of our computing education" would require an ambitious, multipronged approach.The Royal Society called for: A 60m investment in computer education over the next five years The training of 8,000 secondary school computing teachers Analysis by Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC News technology correspondent This report highlights what some teachers have been telling me for a while - that the revolution in computing education in the UK has stalled.Five years ago a head of steam built up behind the idea that children needed to be taught coding and that the ICT GCSE was not fit for purpose, teaching little more than how to use Microsoft Office.The government responded by taking ICT off the National Curriculum and replacing it with computer science.But this course is proving far more demanding of both pupils and teachers, and many schools have decided that it is just not worth the bother at a time when resources are tight.Some ICT teachers who had always argued that it was a practical course, attractive to a far wider range of children, are now saying "I told you so".But across the world of computing education there's agreement on one thing - more money needs to be spent on training teachers in this vital subject.Prof Furber's views were echoed by technology firms Microsoft and Google, who are both working to increase computer skills among schoolchildren.Google's UK managing director Ronan Harris said: "There is still much more to do to ensure young people across the UK have access to computer science education."Whatever school they attend or whatever field they plan to go into, every student should have the opportunity to understand the principles and practices of computing."And Microsoft's UK chief executive Cindy Rose said: "The risk, if we don't make these investments now, is that too many young people struggle to access new opportunities and the UK loses its advantage in a world being transformed by technology."
Ben Nevis gets automatic weather station:::::Image copyright NCAS Image caption The station is temporary and will be taken down in December Live weather data is being recorded again at the top of Ben Nevis, the UK's highest peak, after a 113-year gap.Researchers have installed an automatic meteorological station that digitally collects information on temperatures, wind speeds and rainfall levels.Until 1904, the same measurements were gathered by men who lived in a shelter at the summit.The weather station was carried up the mountain, in the Scottish Highlands, by a team of researchers on Tuesday.Image copyright NCAS Image caption Solar panels and batteries drive the station The new station means visitors to the UnEarthed exhibition in Edinburgh next week will be able to take a look in real-time at weather conditions on the mountain, something that was not possible previously.Dr Barbara Brooks and her team from the NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science carried the equipment up the mountain on Tuesday - and were able to be precise in their observations on the weather they encountered."We had some blue sky and then as we crested the summit the cloud banks rolled in and we got some light snow flurries.The temperature was -3.6C with a wind chill of -12C," she told BBC News.Escorted by local guide Ron Walker, the team of five set up a solar-and battery-powered Vaisala WXT536 station to record wind speed and direction, pressure, temperature, humidity, and precipitation - specifically rain and sleet.These are the measurements that the famous "Weathermen of Ben Nevis" would take by hand on the hour, every hour, during the period from 1883 to 1904.They lived in a small shelter and telegraphed their observations to the town of Fort William down below.Their original logs are now being digitised by volunteers for the Operation Weather Rescue: Ben Nevis project.Image copyright Royal Meteorological Society Collection Image caption The Ben Nevis weather observatory was manned from 1883 to 1904 Image copyright NCAS Image caption The NCAS team got all types of weather as they went up Ben Nevis The old information is still useful because it can shed light on past storms in the Scottish Highlands as well as providing ongoing insights into how weather systems evolve as they pass over Scotland's largest mountains.In addition, scientists say, it is all part of the broader archive of data that is needed to inform our understanding of Britain's climate."Next year, the UKCP18 report will be released and it will contain very detailed projections of how the UK climate could change," explained NCAS scientist Prof Ed Hawkins from the University of Reading."As part of that there are updated observations and these will include a gridded daily rainfall data-set back to 1891.That's brand new and it will include the recovered Ben Nevis information."Image copyright NCAS Image caption A 4G modem is used to send the weather data to NCAS at Leeds University The newly installed weather station on the peak of Ben Nevis will only be in place until December, when it will be taken away again.It has been bolted to some old metal caging about 15m from the pillar that in the past was used to measure the height of the mountain's summit (1,345m/4,411ft) and the surrounding peaks.A permanently installed weather station would require a more secure footing.The scientists, however, are hopeful the interest around the digitisation project will inspire a successful long-term funding proposal.This would enable a bigger installation to be flown up by helicopter.Additional instruments such as snow-depth sensors could be included.Dr Brooks' team left a webcam in position on Tuesday, but a permanent station could have several looking out in all directions.Image caption The "Ulysses storm": This is now much better understood "The weather data would be useful for scientists but of course for the local community it would be more than that - not to be too dramatic about it, it could save lives," the Leeds University-based researcher said."They would be able to point and say to walkers, 'it may be the middle of August but it really is that cold at the top of Ben Nevis'."Volunteers are still needed for Operation Weather Rescue.Prof Ed Hawkins, who oversees the project, said it was 90% complete but some of the earliest rainfall, pressure and temperature data had yet to be digitised.Photos of tables containing these measurements, which were gathered by the Victorian meteorologists between 1883 and 1887, are now online for citizen scientists to examine in detail."There is so much great information in these data-sets.There was a famous storm for example in 1903 that was mentioned in James Joyce's Ulysses because it knocked down loads of trees in Ireland."We can now reconstruct this storm much better because it also went right over the top of Ben Nevis and Fort William," Prof Hawkins said.Image copyright ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH Image caption The Weather Rescue project turns printed tables into a digital format Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos
Hurricane Maria devastation prompts Ocean XPRIZE rethink:::::Image copyright XPRIZE September's Hurricane Maria has disrupted a major competition to find innovative ways to map the seafloor.The Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE was due to hold a demonstration of new robotic systems off Puerto Rico.But September's huge Atlantic storm caused extensive damage to the US territory's infrastructure, forcing the organisers to rethink plans.Competing teams will now have to showcase their mapping technologies in waters of their choice.These are likely to be in some offshore area or even in a lake close to the groups' home countries.The surface of the Moon and Mars is mapped to a higher resolution than the seafloor on Earth.The $7m Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE is designed to find the new approaches and survey equipment that can rapidly reverse this situation."The devastation on Puerto Rico was island-wide, and our base of operations also took a hit," Jyotika Virmani, prize lead and senior director of the XPRIZE Planet and Environment team, told BBC News.Dr Virmani said the first priority was Puerto Rico's swift recovery, and expressed the hope that the XPRIZE competition could return to the island at some later date.Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Palm trees were bent double in Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan Nineteen teams from across the globe are competing for the innovation prize.They have school pupils, university students and professional scientists and engineers among their number.They are working on a slew of "intelligent" airborne, surface and underwater vehicles to accomplish the tasks that have been set.Originally, the teams were supposed to showcase their designs in a 2,000m-deep, 500-sq-km test zone off the south coast of Puerto Rico.A high-resolution baseline map had already been made by XPRIZE partner, Fugro, the big international geoconsulting firm that led the search for the missing airliner MH370.Now, however, a judging panel will visit each competing group on their own "home turf", to inspect the technology-readiness of their solutions.Deep final The judges will be looking at 11 criteria.Dr Virmani explained: "These range from very simple seaworthiness - in other words, does your entry leak?Because if it does it will sink to the bottom - all the way to very complicated matters, such as the action of mapping, data-download and processing.They will also need to demonstrate speed as well."The inspections will run from late November through to February.All the teams at this stage will get to share a milestone prize of $1m, and those that satisfy the judges' criteria will be moved forward to a big final.Originally this was going to be restricted to the 10 most advanced groups, but now if all 19 can show they are ready - all will go through.The final will see the teams operate at a depth of 4,000m.At least 50% of the 500-sq-km competition zone will need to be mapped at 5m resolution.A time limit of 24 hours will be set.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos
'Zombie' star survived going supernova:::::Image copyright SPL Image caption Artwork: The "zombie" star kept erupting for nearly two years It's the astronomical equivalent of a horror film adversary: a star that just wouldn't stay dead.When most stars go supernova, they die in a single blast, but astronomers have found a star that survived not one, but five separate explosions.The "zombie" star kept erupting for nearly two years - six times longer than the duration of a typical supernova.An international team details their results in the academic journal Nature."This supernova breaks everything we thought we knew about how they work.It's the biggest puzzle I've encountered in almost a decade of studying stellar explosions," said co-author Iair Arcavi, a postdoctoral fellow at Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) who is based in California.The mysterious object, iPTF14hls, was picked up in September 2014 by a wide-field camera astronomy survey.Astronomers identified it as an exploding star in January 2015; everything about the discovery seemed normal at first.In common types of supernova, a blast at the centre of the star ejects material at high speed into surrounding space.The expansion of this material releases energy, causing the object to shine brightly for up to 100 days (about four months) before it finally fades.It soon became clear this exploding star wasn't conforming to expectations.For one thing, it didn't fade, but shone brightly for 600 days - nearly two years.What's more, the astronomers found that its brightness varied by as much as 50% on an irregular timescale, as if it was exploding over and over again.And, rather than cooling down as expected, the object maintained a near-constant temperature of about 5,700C.60 years later Intriguingly, by combing through archived data, scientists discovered an explosion that occurred in 1954 in exactly the same location.This could suggest that the star somehow survived that explosion, only to detonate again in 2014.The object may be the first known example of a Pulsational Pair Instability Supernova."According to this theory, it is possible that this was the result of a star so massive and hot that it generated antimatter in its core," said co-author Daniel Kasen, from the University of California, Berkeley."That would cause the star to go violently unstable, and undergo repeated bright eruptions over periods of years."That process could even repeat itself over decades before the star's final explosion and collapse to a black hole.Image copyright Palomar/Caltech Image caption The discovery was made by the Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) wide-field camera survey Kate Maguire, from Queen's University Belfast, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News: "It's a theoretical idea that people have put forward, but this is the first time that an object has been identified that matches this quite well."It's quite unusual."Writing in a news and views article published in Nature, Prof Stan Woosley, from the University of California, Santa Cruz, said that in the Pulsational Pair Instability theory, a massive star may lose about half its mass before the series of violent pulses begins.Not everything we know about the "zombie" matches this theory, Prof Woosley added, and many uncertainties remain."As of now, no detailed model has been published that can explain the observed emission and constant temperature of iPTF14hls, let alone the possible eruption 60 years ago," he wrote."For now, the supernova offers astronomers their greatest thrill: something they do not understand."Follow Paul on Twitter.
'Butterfly child' given life-saving skin:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hassan has been given a new genetically modified skin that covers 80% of his body A child has been given a new genetically modified skin that covers 80% of his body, in a series of lifesaving operations.Hassan, who lives in Germany, has a genetic disease - junctional epidermolysis bullosa - that leaves his skin as fragile as a butterfly's wings.A piece of his skin was taken, its DNA was repaired in the laboratory and the modified skin grafted back on.After nearly two years, the new skin appears completely normal.The family's full details have not been released to protect their privacy, but Hassan's father said the transformation was "like a dream"."Hassan feels like a normal person now, he plays, he's being active, he's enjoying his life and he's not the way he was before," he said.Weak skin Hassan was born in Syria and has had blisters and wounds all over his body since he was a few days old.Normally, the different layers of the skin are held together by "anchoring proteins".But the junctional epidermolysis bullosa means Hassan's DNA lacks the instructions for sticking his epidermis (the surface layer) to the dermis (the next one down).Image copyright SPL There is no cure, and about four in 10 patients do not even reach adolescence.Hassan attended the Children's Hospital at Ruhr-University, in Bochum, Germany, in June 2015.The seven-year-old was missing a massive amount of epidermis.Most of his body looked like a red-raw open wound.Doctors were preparing the family for the worst.Dr Tobias Hirsch, from the hospital, said: "We initially decided to provide palliative care because we had no chance to save the life of this child."But a team of biologists specialising in gene therapy were brought in from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, in Italy - and the parents gave approval for them to try an experimental therapy.So how did they save Hassan's life?In September 2015, a 4 sq cm (0.6 sq inches) patch of skin was taken from an area where the epidermis was still intact.The biopsy was then infected with a customised virus.Viruses are good at getting inside cells, and this one was used like a postman to deliver the missing instructions for binding the layers of skin together.The now genetically modified skin cells were grown to make skin grafts totalling 0.85 sq m (9 sq ft).It took three operations over that winter to cover 80% of the child's body in the new skin.Hassan's father said his son had spent months covered in so many bandages he had looked like a mummy.But 21 months later, the skin is functioning normally with no sign of blistering.'Goosebumps' You can even pinch the once incredibly fragile skin, with no sign of damage.Dr Hirsch said: "The kid is now back to school, he plays soccer, so there was a tremendous increase in quality of life."Dr Anna Martinez, who leads the national epidermolysis bullosa service at Great Ormond Street Hospital, told the BBC: "I got goosebumps when I heard this, it was just incredible."Today this treatment is not available and it is not going to be available in the next few months, but this is a massive advance in research and is going to give us hope going forward with gene therapy."Clinical trials Epidermolysis bullosais is rare, but the charity DEBRA, which campaigns for EB patients, estimates half a million people are affected around the world.There are different forms of epidermolysis bullosa, including simplex, dystrophic and, as in this case, junctional.Each is caused by different genetic faults leading to different building blocks of skin being missing.Prof Michele De Luca, from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, told the BBC: "The gene is different, the protein is different and the outcome may be different [for each form of EB] so we need formal clinical trials."But if they can make it work, it could be a therapy that lasts a lifetime.An analysis of the structure of Hassan's skin, detailed in the journal Nature, has discovered a group of long-lived stem cells are that constantly renewing his genetically modified skin.Follow James on Twitter.
UK 'will support' neonicotinoid pesticide ban:::::Image copyright AFP An extended ban on controversial neonicotinoid pesticides will be supported by the UK, Environment Secretary Michael Gove says.The UK has previously resisted tighter restrictions on the pesticides, saying there was insufficient evidence.Mr Gove says that's no longer the case.Environmentalists have long said neonicotinoids are harming pollinators.But the UK government has generally backed the farmers' view that the chemicals are safe.It was overruled in 2013 when the EU banned three types of neonicotinoid pesticides for most uses in the fields.The European Commission now wants to extend that ban to all uses of "neonics" except for in greenhouses.This time Mr Gove says the UK won't object in principle.He'll wait to see the exact wording of the proposal but he agrees the science now suggests that the pesticides could be harming pollinators."The weight of evidence now shows the risks neonicotinoids pose to our environment, particularly to the bees and other pollinators which play such a key part in our 100bn food industry, is greater than previously understood," said Mr Gove."I believe this justifies further restrictions on their use.We cannot afford to put our pollinator populations at risk.""I recognise the impact further restrictions will have on farmers and I am keen to work with them to explore alternative approaches both now and as we design a new agricultural policy outside the European Union."Mr Gove says he'll impose the same standards on neonicotinoids after Brexit.The decision comes at a time of heightened concern about a steep drop in the number of insects in the countryside.Mr Gove has confirmed to the BBC that he will resist an attempt in the EU to restrict the use of the weedkiller glyphosate, which is said by some scientists to be potentially harmful to humans.Follow Roger on Twitter.
EU split over use of major weedkiller glyphosate:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Crop-spraying in Germany: Many European farmers use glyphosate An EU vote has failed to resolve a controversy over the use of glyphosate, the world's biggest-selling weedkiller.One UN study called the chemical "probably carcinogenic", but other scientists said it was safe to use.The current glyphosate licence runs out in the EU on 15 December.Only half of the 28 member states backed a European Commission proposal to renew the licence for five years.An EU appeal committee will now try to rule on the issue.The UK was among the 14 states backing the Commission position on glyphosate.Nine voted against - including France and Italy.Germany was among the five who abstained.Glyphosate was introduced by US agrochemical giant Monsanto in 1974, but its patent expired in 2000, and now the chemical is sold by various manufacturers.The Monsanto weedkiller is called Roundup.The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) says glyphosate is unlikely to cause cancer in humans.Image copyright AFP Image caption Monsanto's Roundup based on glyphosate has been sold worldwide Critics say widespread use of glyphosate reduces biodiversity, by killing plants that are essential for many insects and other animals.Some countries and regions have banned glyphosate use in public parks and gardens.Its effect on plants is non-selective, meaning it will kill most of them when applied.Read more on farm chemicals: How does glyphosate work?It is usually mixed with other chemicals that help it get into plants, where it blocks a key enzyme pathway.The disruption prevents plants from making certain proteins needed for their growth.The "shikimate pathway" involves seven enzymes, which enable the plant to form amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.The pathway is not found in animals.Some crops, such as soybean, have been genetically modified to resist glyphosate.Farmers spray it on fields before their crops emerge in spring, so the crops do not have to compete with weeds.Some also use it as a pre-harvest treatment to dry out crops and make them easier to harvest.The UK Soil Association says such use is risky, as it can increase glyphosate residues in food.How widespread is it?It is described as the world's most popular weedkiller.In the US more than 750 products contain it.Glyphosate use worldwide has risen almost 15-fold since 1996, when so-called "Roundup Ready" crops, genetically-engineered to resist glyphosate, were introduced.A 2016 study by Environmental Sciences Europe notes growing concern about intensive glyphosate use, because some plants have developed resistance to it - meaning that farmers tend to use even more of the herbicide.Sri Lanka banned use of glyphosate in 2015 - though the tea industry opposes the ban.In 2015 too Colombia stopped aerial spraying of glyphosate - even though it had been used widely to kill illegal coca plants.What is the effect on humans?Glyphosate's toxicity is reckoned to be low, in the concentrations used by farmers, although the UN International Agency for Research on Cancer called it "probably carcinogenic".The European Commission says that besides EFSA, the European Chemicals Agency and other scientific bodies found no link to cancer in humans.The Soil Association says glyphosate traces are regularly found in bread.According to the US National Pesticide Information Center, the chemical mostly passes through the body quickly in urine and faeces.

Fossil of 'our earliest ancestors' found in Dorset:::::Image copyright Mark Witton Image caption The mammals ventured out at night to hunt insects Fossils of the oldest-known ancestors of most living mammals, including human beings, have been unearthed in southern England.Teeth belonging to the extinct shrew-like creatures, which scampered at the feet of dinosaurs, were discovered in cliffs on the Dorset coast.Scientists who identified the specimens say they are the earliest undisputed fossils of mammals belonging to the line that led to humans.They date back 145 million years.''Here we have discovered from the Jurassic coast a couple of shrew-like things that are to date unequivocally our earliest ancestors,'' said Dr Steve Sweetman of Portsmouth University, who examined the ancient teeth.The mammals were tiny, furry creatures that probably emerged under the cover of night.One, a possible burrower, dined on insects, while the larger may have eaten plants as well.Their teeth were highly advanced, of a type that can pierce, cut and crush food.''They are also very worn which suggests the animals to which they belonged lived to a good age for their species,'' said Dr Sweetman.''No mean feat when you're sharing your habitat with predatory dinosaurs."The fossils were discovered by Grant Smith, then an undergraduate student.He was sifting through rock samples collected at Durlston Bay near Swanage for his dissertation when he found teeth of a type never before seen in rocks of this age.Image copyright Steve Sweetman Image caption Researchers from the University of Portsmouth made the discovery ''The Jurassic Coast is always unveiling fresh secrets and I'd like to think that similar discoveries will continue to be made right on our doorstep," said Prof Dave Martill of Portsmouth University, who supervised the project.One of the new species has been named Durlstotherium newmani after Charlie Newman, who is the landlord of a pub close to where the fossils were discovered, and is also a keen fossil collector.The second has been named Dulstodon ensomi, after Paul Ensom, a local palaeontologist.The findings, published in the Journal, Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, add new evidence to a hotly-debated field.Recent fossil discoveries from China pushed back the date of the earliest mammals to 160 million years ago.However, this has been disputed, based on data from molecular studies.A separate study revealed this week suggests that the earliest mammals were night creatures that only switched to daytime living after the demise of the dinosaurs.The research, published in the journal, Nature Ecology and Evolution, could explain why many mammals living today are nocturnal.Follow Helen on Twitter.
Paris climate accord: Syria to sign up, isolating US:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Syria's decision was reported at the Bonn climate conference The US is set to become isolated in its stance on the Paris climate agreement, after Syria said it was preparing to join the deal.The Paris deal unites the world's nations in tackling climate change.Syria and Nicaragua were the only nations outside the deal when it was agreed in 2015.Nicaragua signed in October.In June the US said it would withdraw, but the rules of the agreement state that this cannot be done until 2020.Meanwhile, French officials said US President Donald Trump had not been invited to December's climate summit in Paris.More than 100 countries have been invited to the summit, which is aimed at "building coalitions" with finance and business to further the accord, an aide to French President Emmanuel Macron said."I would like to affirm the Syrian Arab Republic's commitment to the Paris climate change accord," Syrian Deputy Environment Minister Wadah Katmawi told delegates of the 196 nations participating in the current climate talks in Bonn, Germany.He said the accord would be signed "as soon as possible", adding that Syria would seek foreign aid to help it meet its commitments under the deal.UN spokesman Nick Nuttall, quoted by AFP news agency, confirmed the move, saying that Syria would first have to submit ratification documents at the UN headquarters in New York.Correspondents say Syria was effectively an international pariah when the accord was first signed, and sanctions would have made it difficult for officials to attend the discussions in Paris.Also, the meetings coincided with some of the fiercest fighting in Syria's civil war, meaning the country was in no position to sign.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Matt McGrath explains why we should care about climate change Announcing the US decision in June, Mr Trump said it was part of his "solemn duty to protect America" and he would seek a new deal that would not disadvantage US businesses.He claimed that the accord would cost the US 6.5 million jobs and $3tn (2.2tn) in lost GDP - while rival economies like China and India were treated more favourably.A US statement issued in October when Nicaragua signed the agreement said the US would withdraw "unless we can re-enter on terms that are more favourable for our country".White House spokeswoman Kelly Love said there had been no change in Washington's position since then.Responding to the Syrian move, environmental NGO the Sierra Club issued a statement attacking the US position: "As if it wasn't already crystal clear, every single other country in the world is moving forward together to tackle the climate crisis, while Donald Trump has isolated the United States on the world stage in an embarrassing and dangerous position."Scientists point out that work to implement the Paris accord must be stepped up if it is to have any chance of success.Historically, the US, Europe and China account for almost half of the world's carbon emissions.What was agreed in Paris?Keep global temperature rises "well below" the level of 2C (3.6F) and "endeavour to limit" them even more, to 1.5C Limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100 Review each country's contribution to cutting emissions every five years so they scale up to the challenge
Endangered apes saved from pet trade:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The arrival of the new baby gibbon provides hope for the future of this endangered species Conservationists are celebrating the arrival of a baby Javan gibbon - the first of this species to be born in the wild to parents that were rescued from the pet trade.Conservation International says the birth is a boost for the future of the apes on the Indonesian island of Java.But illegal trade is still a threat, and is increasingly moving online.A UK-based investigation this year revealed that the law protecting these ape species was being openly "flouted".Researchers who carried out the investigation, who are based at Oxford Brookes University, also showed BBC News videos of protected species being advertised by pet traders on social media platforms.Learning to be wild The birth of the wild-born Javan gibbon - in a protected forest in West Java - is a breakthrough for a project that has now released 17 of the apes into the area.Conservation International (CI) and the Javan Gibbon Foundation have rehabilitated the animals, and rangers now patrol the site at Mount Malabar daily, monitoring the animals and checking for any poaching activity.It has taken almost 10 years to bring the two adults back to the forest."It's a long, long process," explained Anton Ario from CI."Because the poachers that take gibbons for the trade target the babies - because they're cute and easy to sell - when we find them, they're often living in a cage and cannot move around at all.They need to learn to live in the trees."To ensure their rereleased animals are able to survive, they introduce them to potential mates while they are still in captivity - ultimately releasing pairs or family groups of the animals.The new birth represents hope for a primate that is rapidly losing its habitat in Java, which has less than 5% of pristine forest left in its steep, tropical mountains.But while programmes like this can get a few animals back to the wild every year, many more are being bought and sold as pets.Ape for sale Image copyright TRAFFIC Image caption Young orangutans are targeted by the illegal pet trade A search on social media channels will reveal pet shops and sellers - many based in South East Asia - openly advertising pet baby gibbons for sale."They are flouting the law," says Prof Vincent Nijman, from Oxford Brookes University, who has carried out investigations of the illegal trade in endangered apes.Image copyright other Image caption Researchers monitoring the trade showed us pictures and videos of gibbons being advertised for sale on social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram "No-one is being punished."So if people [entering the forest] come across a baby gibbon and have the option to capture it, they are motivated to do it.It represents money and doesn't represent any risk."The trade is not confined to gibbons.Critically endangered orangutans and slow lorises are also being "plucked" from the wild.Prof Nijman's recently published investigation revealed that, while more than 400 illegal pet orangutans had been seized by law enforcement in Indonesia in the last two decades, those confiscations had led to only seven prosecutions.Image caption Rescued apes have to be rehabilitated by conservationists, who help them learn to return to the trees after life in a cage BBC News reported a post to Facebook that advertised a baby gibbon for sale.In response, the company said it had removed the post and was "investigating the page where it was posted"."We're committed to helping tackle the illegal online trade of protected wildlife and will remove any content that violates our community standards when it is reported to us," Facebook said in a statement.Instagram has also responded after the BBC alerted it to the sale of gibbons on the site.In a statement sent to BBC News, the company said that the accounts in question had been removed, adding that the illegal trade or sale of animals was "prohibited on Instagram".Prof Nijman pointed out that the numerous threats to endangered apes in Indonesia were not all problems that people had the power to tackle."Orangutans in particular face threats left, right and centre," he said, "But curbing the pet trade is within our control."It's in human hands to fix this."Watch our full investigation into the trade in wild animals and birds in Indonesia in Our World: Songbirds for Sale on BBC Iplayer Follow Victoria on Twitter
2017 'very likely' in top three warmest years on record:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Globally, temperatures in 2017 look set to be the third highest on record The year 2017 is "very likely" to be in the top three warmest years on record, according to provisional figures from the World Meteorological Organization.The WMO says it will likely be the hottest year in the absence of the El Nio phenomenon.The scientists argue that the long-term trend of warming driven by human activities continues unabated.They say many of the "extraordinary" weather events seen this year bear the hallmarks of climate change.On the opening day of this year's key UN climate talks, researchers from the WMO have presented their annual State of the Global Climate report.It follows hot on the heels of their greenhouse gases study from last week which found that concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere were the highest on record.While the new study only covers January to September, the WMO says the average global temperature was 1.1C above the pre-industrial figure.This is getting dangerously close to the 1.5 degrees threshold that many island states feel temperatures must be kept under to ensure their survival.The analysis suggests that 2017 is likely to come in 0.47C warmer than the 1981-2010 average.This is slightly down on 2016 when the El Nio weather phenomenon saw temperatures that were 0.56C above the average.According to the WMO, this year vies with 2015 to be the second or third warmest mark yet recorded.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Aerial footage of the aftermath in Dominica "The past three years have all been in the top three years in terms of temperature records.This is part of a long-term warming trend," said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas."We have witnessed extraordinary weather, including temperatures topping 50C in Asia, record-breaking hurricanes in rapid succession in the Caribbean and Atlantic, (and) reaching as far as Ireland, devastating monsoon flooding affecting many millions of people and a relentless drought in East Africa."Many of these events - and detailed scientific studies will determine exactly how many - bear the tell-tale sign of climate change caused by increased greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities," he said.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Caribbean island of Saint-Barthelemy after it was hit by Hurricane Irma Scientists will have to do attribution studies to clearly link specific events from 2017 to rising temperatures.But they believe the fingerprints of climate change are to be seen in events such as tropical cyclones, where the warmer seas can transfer more heat to the gathering storms and increased sea levels can make flooding more damaging.The Accumulated Cyclone Energy Index, which measures the intensity and duration of these events, showed its highest ever monthly values in September this year.It was also the first time that two Category 4 hurricanes made landfall in the same year in the US.Hurricane Irma was a Category 5 storm for the longest period on record.Rain gauges in Nederland, Texas, recorded 1,539mm, the largest ever recorded for a single event in the mainland US.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Scientists say that extreme heat and drought contributed to many destructive wildfires such as this one in California There were also significant flooding events with large loss of life in Sierra Leone, in Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Peru among many others.In contrast, droughts and heatwaves affected many parts of Africa and South America.In Somalia, more than half of cropland was impacted with herds reduced by 40-60%.More than 11 million people are experiencing severe food insecurity in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia."This year saw a multitude of damaging weather extremes which is not uncommon but many of these events were made more severe by the sustained warming influence of increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas levels due to human activities," said Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading, UK.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Hurricane Hunters fly over eye of storm to help forecasters "An increased severity of weather extremes is expected in the decades ahead as Earth continues to heat up and it is only with the substantive cuts in greenhouse gas emissions required by the Paris climate agreement that we can avert much more potent and widespread damage to our societies and the ecosystems upon which they depend."With UN talks on climate change now underway here in Bonn, the report is likely to reinforce a sense of urgency among many delegates."These findings underline the rising risks to people, economies and the very fabric of life on Earth if we fail to get on track with the aims and ambitions of the Paris Agreement," said Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of UN Climate Change, which is hosting the Bonn conference.Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook
Relocated squirrels moving to new areas, says charity:::::Image copyright Peter Cairns Red squirrels relocated to woodlands in the north west Highlands are "flourishing and breeding", according to a conservation charity.More than 80 squirrels were trapped in other parts of the Highlands in phases of the project led by Findhorn-based Trees for Life.The animals were released in areas that had no squirrels, including Shieldaig.Tree for Life said many of the squirrels were not only breeding but also spreading to other new areas.Becky Priestley, the charity's wildlife officer, said: "Early indications are that this could be a real wildlife success story."The new squirrel populations are not only flourishing and breeding in their new homes, they are also starting to spread out into new areas - with squirrels being sighted as far as 15km away."The project's initial relocations took place between the springs of 2016 and 2017, with the first 33 squirrels from near Inverness and also in Moray released at Shieldaig in Wester Ross.This was followed by 22 more released at the Coulin Estate next to Beinn Eighe National Nature Reserve near Kinlochewe.Thirty squirrels were also released at Plockton, in Lochalsh, where the landowners include The National Trust for Scotland.Furry flit: How do you get a squirrel to move house?Image copyright Reuters The squirrels were transported in nest boxes lined with hay and with food and water available.Small numbers of the animals were moved from where they are trapped so as to avoid harming the survival of "donor populations".The captured squirrels were also checked for diseases before being transported.At the new sites, the nest boxes were fitted to trees and the exit holes were opened and filled with grass, which the squirrels could push their way through to get outside.Food was provided for several months while the animals become accustomed to their new habitat.There are an estimated 138,000 red squirrels in the UK, according to Trees for Life.
New great ape species identified in Indonesia:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A new orangutan species has been discovered - and it's already in danger.Scientists who have been puzzling for years over the genetic "peculiarity" of a tiny population of orangutans in Sumatra have finally concluded that they are a new species to science.The apes in question were only reported to exist after an expedition into the remote mountain forests there in 1997.Since then, a research project has unpicked their biological secret.The species has been named the Tapanuli orangutan - a third species in addition to the Bornean and Sumatran.Image copyright Andrew Walmsley Image caption Researchers have studied these great apes in detail for 20 years It is the first new great ape to be described for almost a century.Publishing their work in the journal Current Biology, the team - including researchers from the University of Zurich, Liverpool John Moores University and the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme - pointed out that there are only 800 individuals remaining, making this one of the world's most threatened ape species.Early on in their study, researchers took DNA from the orangutans, which showed them to be "peculiar" compared to other orangutans in Sumatra.So the scientists embarked on a painstaking investigation - reconstructing the animals' evolutionary history through their genetic code.One of the lead researchers, Prof Michael Krtzen from the University of Zurich, Switzerland, explained to BBC News: "The genomic analysis really allows us to look in detail at the history."We can probe deep back in time and ask, 'when did these populations split off?'."The analysis of a total 37 complete orangutan genomes - the code for the biological make-up of each animal - has now shown that these apes separated from their Bornean relatives less than 700,000 years ago - a snip in evolutionary time.Head to head Image copyright NAter et al Image caption The Tapanuli orangutan has distinguishing anatomical features - revealed by a close examination of its skull For his part in the study, Prof Serge Wich, from Liverpool John Moores University, focused on the orangutans' signature calls - loud sounds the male apes make to announce their presence."Those calls can carry a kilometre through the forest," Prof Wich explained."If you look at these calls, you can tease them apart, and we found some subtle differences between these and other populations."The final piece of the puzzle, though, was very subtle but consistent differences in the shape of the Sumatran, Bornean and Tapanuli orangutan skulls.Prof Wich told BBC News that the decades of collaborative genetic, anatomical and acoustic studies had achieved an "amazing breakthrough"."There are only seven great ape species - not including us," he said."So adding one to that very small list is spectacular."It's something I think many biologists dream of."New and disappearing But this newly described great ape will be added to the list of Critically Endangered species, just as it is added to the zoological textbooks."It's very worrying," said Prof Wich, "to discover something new and then immediately also realise that we have to focus all of our efforts before we lose it."Follow Victoria on Twitter
Asteroid impact plunged dinosaurs into catastrophic 'winter':::::Image copyright BARCROFT PRODUCTIONS/BBC Image caption Artwork: The impact hit with the energy equivalent to 10 billion Hiroshima bombs Scientists say they now have a much clearer picture of the climate catastrophe that followed the asteroid impact on Earth 66 million years ago.The event is blamed for the demise of three-quarters of plant and animal species, including the dinosaurs.The researchers' investigations suggest the impact threw more than 300 billion tonnes of sulphur into the atmosphere.This would have dropped average global temperatures below freezing for several years.Ocean temperatures could have been affected for centuries.The abrupt change explains why so many species struggled to survive."We always thought there was this global winter but with these new, tighter constraints, we can be much more sure about what happened," Prof Joanna Morgan, from Imperial College London, told BBC News.The new assessment is reported in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.Image copyright Max Alexander/B612/Asteroid Day Image caption The drill project is revealing new insights on one of the most astonishing events in Earth history The UK geophysicist was the co-lead investigator on the 2016 project to drill into what remains of the impactor's crater under the Gulf of Mexico.She and colleagues spent several weeks retrieving the rock samples that would allow them to reconstruct precisely how the Earth reacted to being punched by a high-velocity space object.Their study suggests the asteroid approached the surface from the north-east, striking what was then a shallow sea at an oblique angle of 60 degrees.Roughly 12km wide and moving at about 18km/s, the stony impactor instantly excavated and vaporised thousands of billions of tonnes of rock.This material included a lot of sulphur-containing minerals such as gypsum and anhydrite, but also carbonates which yielded carbon dioxide.The team's calculations estimate the quantities ejected upwards at high speed into the upper atmosphere included 325 gigatonnes of sulphur (give or take 130Gt) and perhaps 425Gt of carbon dioxide (plus or minus 160Gt).The CO2 would eventually have a longer-term warming effect, but the release of so much sulphur, combined with soot and dust, would have had an immediate and very severe cooling effect.Image copyright Max Alexander/B612/Asteroid Day Image caption Prof Morgan pictured with some of the rock samples drilled from beneath the Gulf of Mexico An independent group earlier this year used a global climate model to simulate what would happen if 100Gt of sulphur and 1,400Gt of carbon dioxide were ejected as a result of the impact.This research, led by Julia Brugger from the University of Potsdam, Germany, found global annual mean surface air temperatures would decrease by at least 26C, with three to 16 years spent at subzero conditions."Julia's inputs in the earlier study were conservative on the sulphur.But we now have improved numbers," explained Prof Morgan."We now know, for example, the direction and angle of impact, so we know which rocks were hit.And that allows us to calibrate the generation of gases much better.If Julia got that level of cooling on 100Gt of sulphur, it must have been much more severe given what we understand now."The generation of what has become known as the Chicxulub Crater was an astonishing event.The initial hole punched in the Earth would have been about 30km deep and 80-100km across.Unstable, and under the pull of gravity, the sides of this depression would then have collapsed inwards.At the same time, the centre of the bowl likely rebounded, briefly lifting rock higher than the Himalayas, before also falling down to cover the inward-rushing sides of the initial hole.And although this violent reconfiguration of the Earth's crust took just minutes to complete, its consequences led to the fifth great mass extinction on our planet.Chicxulub Crater - The impact that changed life on Earth Image copyright NASA Image caption The outer rim (white arc) of the crater lies under the Yucatan Peninsula itself, but the inner peak ring is best accessed offshore A 12km-wide object dug a hole in Earth's crust 100km across and 30km deep This bowl then collapsed, leaving a crater 200km across and a few km deep The crater's centre rebounded and collapsed again, producing an inner ring Today, much of the crater is buried offshore, under 600m of sediments On land, it is covered by limestone, but its rim is traced by an arc of sinkholes Image copyright Max Alexander/B612/Asteroid Day Image caption Mexico's famous sinkholes (cenotes) have formed in weakened limestone overlying the crater The project to drill into Chicxulub Crater was conducted by the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP).The expedition was also supported by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP).Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos

Sheep 'can recognise human faces':::::Image copyright SPL Image caption Ewe look familiar: sheep have a human-like ability to recognise faces Sheep have demonstrated the ability to recognise familiar human faces, according to a study.Cambridge University researchers were able to train sheep to identify the faces of actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Emma Watson, former US President Barack Obama and BBC newsreader Fiona Bruce.After training, the sheep chose photos of familiar faces over unfamiliar ones significantly more often than not.It shows that sheep possess similar face recognition abilities to primates.Previous studies had shown that sheep could identify other sheep and human handlers that they already knew."What we did is ask whether a sheep could learn to recognise someone from a photograph," the study's lead author Prof Jenny Morton said."We focused on whether or not an animal was capable of processing a two-dimensional object as a person."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sheep recognise celebrities in experiment Eight female Welsh Mountain sheep were trained to distinguish the four celebrity faces from pictures of unfamiliar people, using food pellets as a reward.The ruminants were shown different photos on two computer screens; the sheep made their choice by breaking an infrared beam with their noses to release the treat.After establishing the animals' ability to recognise the celebrities, researchers set them a new task.They wanted to see whether the farm animals could correctly identify the same celebrities when pictured from different angles.Again, the animals' performance on this task was significantly above chance.Finally, the researchers wanted to know if the sheep could recognise their handlers from a photo.Images of their custodians were randomly interspersed in a sequence of unfamiliar faces shown to them on the screens.On this task too, the sheep didn't disappoint.The results show that the animals' face-recognition abilities are similar to those of monkeys, apes - and humans.The researchers say it might be interesting in future to investigate whether sheep can identify different expressions on human faces.The work might even have implications for learning about neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's and Parkinson's.The research is published in the Royal Society journal Open Science.Follow Paul on Twitter.
'Big void' identified in Khufu's Great Pyramid at Giza:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mark Lehner: "A space that the builders left to protect the grand gallery?"The mysteries of the pyramids have deepened with the discovery of what appears to be a giant void within the Khufu, or Cheops, monument in Egypt.It is not known why the cavity exists or indeed if it holds anything of value because it is not obviously accessible.Japanese and French scientists made the announcement after two years of study at the famous pyramid complex.They have been using a technique called muography, which can sense density changes inside large rock structures.The Great Pyramid, or Khufu's Pyramid, is thought to have been constructed during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu between 2509 and 2483 BC.At 140m (460 feet) in height, it is the largest of the Egyptian pyramids located at Giza on the outskirts of Cairo.ScanPyramids has already detected a smaller void on the northern face The new cavity is perhaps 30m long and several metres in height All three muon technologies sense the same feature in the same place Khufu famously contains three large interior chambers and a series of passageways, the most striking of which is the 47m-long, 8m-high Grand Gallery.The newly identified feature is said to sit directly above this and have similar dimensions."We don't know whether this big void is horizontal or inclined; we don't know if this void is made by one structure or several successive structures," explained Mehdi Tayoubi from the HIP Institute, Paris."What we are sure about is that this big void is there; that it is impressive; and that it was not expected as far as I know by any sort of theory."Image copyright SCANPYRAMIDS Image caption The newly found void is directly above the Grand Gallery The ScanPyramids team is being very careful not to describe the cavity as a "chamber".Khufu contains compartments that experts believe may have been incorporated by the builders to avoid collapse by relieving some of the stress of the overlying weight of stone.The higher King's Chamber, for example, has five such spaces above it.The renowned American archaeologist Mark Lehner sits on a panel reviewing ScanPyramids' work.He says the muon science is sound but he is not yet convinced the discovery has significance."It could be a kind of space that the builders left to protect the very narrow roof of the Grand Gallery from the weight of the pyramid," he told the BBC's Science In Action programme."Right now it's just a big difference; it's an anomaly.But we need more of a focus on it especially in a day and age when we can no longer go blasting our way through the pyramid with gunpowder as [British] Egyptologist Howard Vyse did in the early 1800s."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mehdi Tayoubi: "It's a big void, similar to the Grand Gallery, but what is it?"One of the team leaders, Hany Helal from Cairo University, believes the void is too big to have a pressure-relieving purpose, but concedes the experts will debate this."What we are doing is trying to understand the internal structure of the pyramids and how this pyramid has been built," he told reporters."Famous Egyptologists, archaeologists and architects - they have some hypotheses.And what we are doing is giving them data.It is they who have to tell us whether this is expected or not."Much of the uncertainty comes down to the rather imprecise data gained from muography.This non-invasive technique has been developed over the past 50 years to probe the interiors of phenomena as diverse as volcanoes and glaciers.It has even been used to investigate the failed nuclear reactors at Fukushima.Muography makes use of the shower of high-energy particles that rain down on the Earth's surface from space.When super-fast cosmic rays collide with air molecules, they produce a range of "daughter" particles, including muons.These also move close to the speed of light and only weakly interact with matter.So when they reach the surface, they penetrate deeply into rock.But some of the particles will be absorbed and deflected by the atoms in the rock's minerals, and if the muon detectors are placed under a region of interest then a picture of density anomalies can be obtained.Image copyright SCANPYRAMIDS Image caption The muon detectors have to be placed under the region of interest The ScanPyramids team used three different muography technologies and all three agreed on the position and scale of the void.Sbastien Procureur, from CEA-IRFU, University of Paris-Saclay, emphasised that muography only sees large features, and that the team's scans were not just picking up a general porosity inside the pyramid."With muons you measure an integrated density," he explained."So, if there are holes everywhere then the integrated density will be the same, more or less, in all directions, because everything will be averaged.But if you see some excess of muons, it means that you have a bigger void."You don't get that in a Swiss cheese."The question now arises as to how the void should be investigated further.Jean-Baptiste Mouret, from the French national institute for computer science and applied mathematics (Inria), said the team had an idea how to do it, but that the Egyptian authorities would first have to approve it."Our concept is to drill a very small hole to potentially explore monuments like this.We aim to have a robot that could fit in a 3cm hole.Basically, we're working on flying robots," he said.The muography investigation at Khufu's Pyramid is reported in this week's edition of Nature magazine.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos
Trump emissions threat to US car industry:::::Image copyright Getty Images The US car industry will be wrecked if President Trump relaxes emissions standards, California's governor says.Jerry Brown said China would dominate car manufacture because it was heavily promoting the electric vehicles that would dominate the future.He said huge investment was needed on electric vehicles, along with federal rules to encourage their purchase.He said President Trump and US car-makers were "half asleep" and hadn't understood the scale of the challenge.He told BBC Radio 4's Costing the Earth: "There will be a serious threat to the US auto industry."The Chinese have taken over the world in wind turbine production, and photovoltaic."They're going to take over the American car industry - and the people in Detroit are half asleep.They have to wake up - and I'm hoping they will."China's investing billions in battery technology and electric cars - and introducing a regulatory regime that will produce for their market a percentage of electric cars that to my knowledge no American executive can even imagine."Image copyright Reuters Image caption Jerry Brown says the US has a "very tall mountain to climb" Mr Brown said he believed the electric car had a good prospect of being "very competitive" with petrol and diesel cars within five years.California has special powers as a state to set its own car standards but Mr Brown believes federal action is essential to create a big enough market."Boy, it's a very tall mountain we have to climb.To make it work needs a federal tax and regulatory regime."But that we don't have and won't have until Mr Trump returns to his hotel business."Mr Brown is leading a group of 15 states refusing to follow Mr Trump's attempt to lower CO2 standards for vehicles and electricity."We can pursue an intelligent, forceful climate agenda without jeopardising jobs and damaging our economy - which is the message of Trump," he said."We're in a contest of ideas, actions and policies.The outcome of this contest will determine what the world's going to look like in the next 10-20 years."We have to rise to the occasion."'A rare sight' California's critics say the state has talked a good game on clean vehicles but on its sprawling highways, electric cars are still a rare sight.The governor admitted its electric vehicle programme is "nowhere near what it needs to be".He wants 1.5m electric vehicles from what he said was 300-400,000 today - a task he described as a "very steep hill".Mr Brown visited China a few months ago and promised co-operation over clean vehicles.He said it was ironic that US car-makers previously driven to the verge of bankruptcy by fuel-efficient imported vehicles were once again campaigning against higher efficiency standards."We are looking for ways to up the ante against automobile companies who want to do less rather than more," he said."Maybe our biggest ally is the People's Republic of China, which is going to demand a zero vehicles initiative that would align very closely with California.'With US car makers we are looking at the inertia of a complacent culture than enjoys the present and is unaware of the danger in the future.""The global alliance on climate is growing stronger.We are carving our own path forward."Trump won't be a permanent phenomenon.We are holding the torch pending this sorry interim of environmental ignorance."The Trump administration declined to be interviewed on Mr Brown's comments.His supporters would point out that he is simply following through policies promised before the election to lower pollution standards, safeguard coal and withdraw from international agreements.In the absence of a major political figure from the administration, Mr Brown will be the senior US politician at the UN climate talks in Bonn, where delegates are drawing up a rule book for implementing the Paris climate accord.The US delegation is led by career diplomats who have accepted the seriousness of the climate threat.But President Trump has infuriated other delegates by taking a delegation from Peabody Coal to trumpet the virtues of clean coal in tackling climate change.You can hear more about America's green resistance on the podcast for BBC Radio 4 Costing the Earth.Follow Roger on Twitter.
100 Women: The ice ceiling that held women back from Antarctic exploration:::::Image copyright Getty Images For decades, there was a ceiling not of glass but of ice, for women in science - the continent of Antarctica.The heroic tradition of polar exploration conducted solely by men meant that Antarctica itself was often thought of as a woman to be conquered.US Navy Admiral Richard Byrd described it as "an enchanted continent in the sky, pale like a sleeping princess".Women were not permitted a role in this age of adventure.But not for lack of trying.Sir Ernest Shackleton refused the request of "three sporty girls" who wrote to him in 1914, seeking a place in his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition because they "[did] not see why men should have all the glory, and women none" Image copyright COURTESY OF SCOTT POLAR RESEARCH INSTITUTE There is also evidence, says Antarctic historian Morgan Seag, that 1,300 women applied to join a proposed British expedition in 1937.All were denied, she tells 100 Women.Russian geologist Maria Klenova was the first woman to conduct research in the Antarctic, in 1956.Argentine scientists followed a decade later.But some countries were slower to thaw, with the US and UK only reversing their formal bans in the late 1960s and 70s.The apparent moral peril of mixed accommodation was one argument against including women.Janet Thompson, the first woman to go south with the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), had to informally convince the wives of her teammates that she was going as a serious scientist, Seag explains.Another application was turned down by BAS as "there were no facilities for women in the Antarctic no shops no hairdressers".Image copyright Sudipta Sengupta Unsurprisingly, tenacity is a common theme amongst early female polar scientists.Geologist Sudipta Sengupta tells 100 Women that she wrote to India's Department of Ocean Development in 1982 declaring her interest in the country's second Antarctic expedition.A year later, she and marine biologist Aditi Pant became the first Indian women to set foot on the continent.The team's mission was to set up India's first station in Antarctica - Dakshin Gangotri.Sengupta remembers having to fight the idea that she was an "ornamental part" of the expedition team."I assumed all kinds of responsibilities - both scientific and tasks that required physical labour You have to consider yourself equally capable as a man in everything you do," she recalls.Image copyright Monika Puskeppeleit Meanwhile in Germany, doctor Monika Puskeppeleit was fighting a similar battle.Fascinated by the medical challenges of overwintering in the Antarctic, where brutal weather isolates teams from civilisation for up to nine months, she first began appealing to Germany's polar research institute in 1984.Puskeppeleit's campaign attracted letters from other German women, mostly scientists, keen to take part.But resistance was strong."They didn't want to have mixed teams on an Antarctic base," she explains to 100 Women."[I was told] this is not possible for women in this century."Ironically, the eventual compromise turned out to be more groundbreaking than Puskeppeleit anticipated.What men said about women going to Antarctica "There are some things women don't do.They don't become Pope or President or go down to the Antarctic."- Harry Darlington, 1947 "Women will not be allowed in the Antarctic until we can provide one woman for every man" - Rear Admiral George Dufek, 1957 "Antarctica [will] remain the womanless white continent of peace" - Admiral F E Bakutis, 1965 In 1989, she led the first all-female team to overwinter in Antarctica.They arrived at the Georg-von-Neumayer station to take over from a male crew who had heard little of the transition that was about to occur."I will not say they were jealous, but they did not like it at all," she remembers.Buried under nine metres of ice, the team spent 14 months in the Antarctic, with Puskeppeleit as base leader and medical doctor.She found it challenging, with only a radio for contact with the outside world, but exhilarating."You have to learn a high respect for nature... You have to pay attention.If you don't have respect for nature you will lose."So what is it like to work in Antarctica now?What is 100 Women?BBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year.This week marks 150 years since the birth of Marie Curie and we are celebrating women in science all week.Join us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and let us know about your favourite scientists on #100Women "Like living in your very own natural history documentary," says Dr Jess Walkup, "surrounded by seals, penguins and the occasional whale."Having just spent her third winter on the continent, Walkup is base leader at Rothera Station on the Antarctic peninsula."My first overwinter I was the only woman, but my fellow winterers didn't treat me any differently," she explains to 100 Women.Yet women are still less likely to overwinter than men.This is, Walkup feels, largely down to the nature of the support roles necessary to keep the base running in harsh conditions, with mechanics, plumbers and engineers coming from commonly male-dominated trades."There are not normally a high proportion of women on the stations, maybe between 10% and 25%, and I have found that the women I have worked with generally share a kind of extra camaraderie," says Dr Walkup.Image copyright Michelle Koutnik Prof Michelle Koutnik, who has made regular research trips to the Antarctic since 2004, also feels that things have improved for women in science on the continent."I have always felt that there were role models, even if women are not the majority," she says of studying glaciers near McMurdo Station.Image copyright National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research While Antarctica may no longer be the sole domain of men, barriers are still being broken in many areas.This year marked the first in which women have overwintered at both stations in the Indian Antarctic Programme.But for the women working there, it's just another year on the ice."When you are part of a historic moment," Sudipta Sengupta observes, "you do not realise it."Looking back, you understand it was a defining moment."Additional reporting by Ritwika Mitra.
100 Women: The women who sew for Nasa:::::Image copyright NASA/JPL-Caltech Without its seamstresses, many of Nasa's key missions would never have left the ground.From the Apollo spacesuits to the Mars rovers, women behind the scenes have stitched vital spaceflight components.One of them is Lien Pham, a literal tailor to the stars - working in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's shield shop to create thermal blankets, essential for any spacecraft leaving Earth.It may not sound glamorous, but Lien does work with couture materials.The Cassini mission, her first project at Nasa, went to Saturn cloaked in fine golden insulation for durability over its 19-year journey.Your shoes have more in common with interplanetary spacecraft than you might think - thermal blankets are created on the same industrial sewing machines as footwear, and then laced onto the spacecraft so they don't come loose during launch.Image copyright NASA/JPL-Caltech Growing up in Vietnam, Lien "never dreamed" of working for Nasa, least of all sewing for the space agency.But when her family fled the country in the late 1970s after the fall of Saigon, she found herself in the US, needing to make enough money to support six siblings.The family bought two sewing machines and began to sell clothes from their home, sewing by night."We did dresses, blouses, shirts, and other things.We got paid maybe 50 cents per garment," she tells 100 Women.What is 100 Women?BBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year.This week marks 150 years since the birth of Marie Curie and we are celebrating women in science all week.Join us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and let us know about your favourite scientists on #100Women Working a day job at a lingerie company, once a week Lien went to electrical engineering classes.At that time, engineering was a booming business in California.And Nasa were hiring.Lien's friend recommended that she apply for a job at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and in 1994 she started work at the space agency - on the cabling team for the Cassini mission to Saturn.The intricate job of connecting all the separate scientific instruments on the spacecraft to a central power supply was very demanding - it took her team three years."Just like a sewing factory is mostly women cabling is mostly women because we're good with our hands," she says.Image copyright NASA/JPL-Caltech The thermal blanketing team, or the shield shop as it's known, is a small group made up mostly of women.They carefully stitch together over 20 individual layers - some just 1/1000th of an inch thick.Each blanket is patterned, measured and fitted, like the finest suit."It's all tailored," Lien explains, "all hand made."Nasa hires women with sewing experience for a reason.When engineers couldn't figure out how to work with Teflon - the non-stick material that coats many saucepans - they were at a loss.Lien suggested folding the edge of the material and sewing it like a hem, as she would with a shirt at home.It worked.Image copyright Raytheon photo courtesy of David Meerman Scott Lien is the latest in a long line of women whose crafting skills have been vital to Nasa.During the Apollo programme, which sent the first humans to the moon, employees at defence contractor Raytheon were employed to "weave" the software for the spacecraft.Referred to as the "little old ladies", many of them were in fact young women, threading copper wires through tiny magnetic loops to create the individual ones and zeros of programme code.Their role in this time consuming and incredibly precise process was largely invisible to the outside world.Similarly, the seamstresses of lingerie brand Playtex pioneered new sewing techniques to create the Apollo spacesuits.Working to unprecedented levels of precision, and often late into the night, their innovations made human spaceflight possible.Much like the hidden figures of Nasa's aeronautics research facility, many of their stories go untold.However, for Lien, the work itself is a dream come true."I would look up at the sky when I was little, and I thought it would be nice to touch one of those stars.But then I came here and got to build something that would go there.""Never in my imagination could I have believed that."
A brief history of the Earth's CO2:::::Image copyright Getty Images Climate change has been described as one of the biggest problems faced by humankind.Carbon dioxide is is the primary driver of global warming.Prof Joanna Haigh from Imperial College London explains why this gas has played a crucial role in shaping the Earth's climate.Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been present in the atmosphere since the Earth condensed from a ball of hot gases following its formation from the explosion of a huge star about five billion years ago.At that time the atmosphere was mainly composed of nitrogen, CO2 and water vapour, which seeped through cracks in the solid surface.A very similar composition emerges from volcanic eruptions today.As the planet cooled further some of the water vapour condensed out to form oceans and they dissolved a portion of the CO2 but it was still present in the atmosphere in large amounts.Tomorrow's World What is climate change?The first life forms to evolve on Earth were microbes which could survive in this primordial atmosphere but about 2.5 billion years ago, plants developed the ability to photosynthesise, creating glucose and oxygen from CO2 and water in the presence of light from the Sun.This had a transformative impact on the atmosphere: as life developed, CO2 was consumed so that by around 20 million years ago its concentration was down to below 300 molecules in every one million molecules of air (or 300 parts per million - ppm).Image copyright SPL Image caption Artwork: As life developed on Earth, carbon dioxide levels plummeted Life on Earth has evolved under these conditions - note that humans did not appear until about 200,000 years ago - and atmospheric CO2 has not exceed that concentration until the industrial revolution brought with it massive emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels: coal and oil.CO2 plays an important role in climate because it is one of the atmospheric "greenhouse" gases (GHGs) which keep the Earth's surface about 33 degrees warmer than the -18C temperature it would be at were they not present.They do this by being fairly transparent to the Sun's rays, allowing them through to warm the surface, but then absorbing the radiant heat that the surface emits, so trapping it and enhancing the warming.In the present climate the most effective GHGs are water vapour, which is responsible for about two-thirds of the total warming, and CO2 which accounts for about one quarter.Other gases, including methane, make up the remainder.The atmospheric concentration of water vapour is less than 1% and, with CO2 making up only a few molecules in every ten thousand of air, it may be surprising that they can have such a significant impact on the surface temperature.They are able to do this, however, because the structure of their molecules makes them especially effective at absorbing heat radiation while the major atmospheric gases, nitrogen and oxygen, are essentially transparent to it.Image copyright NOAA Image caption This air sampling station at Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii recorded CO2 levels going past 400ppm The greenhouse effect means that as the atmospheric loading of GHGs increases the surface temperature of the Earth warms.The overall increase in global temperature of about 1C over the past 150 years is almost entirely due to the human activities that have increasing amounts of atmospheric GHGs.Most significantly, the concentration of CO2 has been rising exponentially (at a rate of about 0.17% per year) since the industrial revolution, due mainly to the combustion of fossil fuels but also to large-scale tropical deforestation which depletes the climate system's capacity for photosynthesis.In 2015, it passed 400ppm, more than 40% higher than its pre-industrial value of 280ppm and a level that has not existed on Earth for several million years.While the basic science of how GHGs warm the Earth is very well understood, there are complications.The climate system responds in various ways which both enhance and ameliorate the effects of these gases.For example, a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapour (before it condenses out in clouds or rain) and because water vapour is a GHG, this increases the temperature rise.Another example: as the oceans warm they are less able to hold CO2 so release it, again with the result the initial warming is enhanced.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Volcanoes can eject small particles into the upper part of the atmosphere The global temperature record over the past century does not show the same smooth increase presented by CO2 measurements because the climate is influenced by other factors than GHGs, arising from both natural and human sources.Some particles released into the atmosphere by industrial activities reflect sunshine back to space, tending to cool the planet.Similarly, large volcanic eruptions can eject small particles into the higher atmosphere, where they remain for up to about two years reducing the sunlight reaching the surface, and temporary dips in global temperature have indeed been measured following major volcanic events.Changes in the energy emitted by the Sun also affect surface temperature, though measurements of the solar output show this effect to be small on human timescales.Another important consideration in interpreting global temperatures is that the climate is inherently complex.Energy moves between the atmosphere and oceans in natural fluctuations - an example being El Nio events.This means that we cannot expect an immediate direct relationship between any influencing factor and surface temperature.All these factors complicate the picture.Nevertheless, it is indisputable that the global temperature rise over the past century is a result of human-produced GHGs, mainly CO2.While, until the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration has not exceeded the 280ppm value that last occurred several million years ago, it has gone through periods when it was considerably lower.Notably, during the ice ages which have occurred roughly every 100,000 years over at least the past half million, drops in global temperature of perhaps 5C have been accompanied by reductions in CO2 concentration to less than 200ppm.The ice ages, and associated warmer interglacial periods, are brought about by changes in the Earth's orbit around the Sun which take place on these long timescales.The cooling in response to a decline in solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface results in a greater uptake of CO2 by the oceans and so further cooling due to a weakened greenhouse effect.This is an entirely natural phenomenon and it is worth noting that such amplification of temperature fluctuations will occur in response to any initiating factor regardless of its source and including human-produced greenhouse gases.The effects of increasing CO2 are not limited to an increase in air temperature.As the oceans warm they are expanding so producing a rise in sea level, this being exacerbated by the melting of some of the ice present on land near the poles and in glaciers.The warmer atmosphere holds more water vapour resulting in increased occurrences of heavy rainfall and flooding while changes in weather patterns are intensifying droughts in other regions.If human emissions of GHGs into the atmosphere continue unabated then the global temperature will continue to rise and the associated weather impacts become ever more severe.The UN climate conference in Paris in December 2015, at which 195 nations unanimously agreed on an aim to restrict the temperature rise to less than 2C, or preferably 1.5C, above the pre-industrial "baseline" was an extraordinary political achievement.To achieve this, however, will require a complete cessation of global CO2 emissions by the second half of this century and, while the world considers how this might be achieved, the crossing of the 400ppm mark in CO2 concentration has been matched by a global warming of 1C.
A last refuge for Europe's blighted killer whales:::::Image caption The orcas come to the fjords around Kvalya to feast on herring Europe's killer whales wowed in the BBC's Blue Planet II series but these animals face extinction.Chris Gibson travelled to the small Norwegian island of Kvalya where the orcas retain a strong foothold.But for how much longer?It was one of those television moments.The sight of killer whales herding shoals of herring into tighter and tighter balls to trap the prey near the surface of the water.The killer whales work as a pack of skilful hunters before deploying their secret weapon - tail-slapping the fish so hard they are either dazed or die.The story behind those shots is even more remarkable.They were filmed in the majestic Norwegian fjords.These long, narrow inlets are now among the few places in Europe you can see a pod of killer whales.Image caption Blue Planet II showed the orcas tail-slapping to stun the fish Across Europe, these cetaceans are declining rapidly.In the Mediterranean and the North Sea, they have vanished.Elsewhere, there are now only eight killer whales in the NW Scotland-Ireland population, and only 36 left in the Strait of Gibraltar population.Scientists believe they are doomed to extinction due to harmful chemicals manufactured by man.This worrying decline explains why tourists and marine biologists are flocking to the fjords around Kvalya - which aptly translates as Whale Island.Kvalya is nestled in the Arctic Circle, close to the city of Troms.It is the land of the Northern Lights, of snow-capped mountains and weak winter sun.It is also the land of observing something spectacular.Image caption The humpbacks can take 100kg of fish in one gulp It's here that a humpback whale announces its presence with a thunderous blast of water through its blowhole - a sound like the opening of the woodwind section of an orchestra.Shortly afterwards, a pod of killer whales arrives on the scene.The orcas glide with grace through the icy water.Marcus hlund is a tour guide who spends several hours at sea on his boat every day and often in freezing temperatures.Hearteningly, he is still so visibly excited by seeing the pod.Marcus lives on Kvalya and tells me with a huge smile on his face that the numbers of killer whales here are actually on the rise.But he knows the cherished photographs of his passengers and these lasting memories shouldn't be taken for granted."We thought we lost them," he said."The island is named after the whales because they were always found here.But for 70 years, the whales abandoned the island.It's only in the last five years that they've been coming back."Image caption Marcus hlund recognises the fragility of the situation The return of the killer whales after so many years left locals and scientists scratching their heads.It didn't make sense when the rest of Europe's killer whale population was dying off.Fredrik Broms, a local marine biologist and keen photographer, believes the answer is simple.Food.The killer whales are just following their lunch like a human at a drive-through restaurant - the enormous shoals of herring."This is one of nature's largest feeding frenzies.The herring changed their route.They have started to come back here and so the whales follow," he said.Scientists believe these Norwegian orcas are faring much better than their cousins in the south because of their diet.In Kvalya and across northern Norway, the whales gorge themselves almost entirely on herring.These smaller fish feed on plankton and are therefore less exposed to a toxic group of chemicals known as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls).However, in the Mediterranean and around UK shores, killer whales eat large fish that are already higher up the food chain and therefore carry a larger load of PCBs.These harmful chemicals were once used in electrical gear, paints and flame retardants.They were used heavily in the construction of tower blocks but were banned from the 1970s because of their toxic effect in humans and animals.However, the manmade chemicals have leached into the sea, and are accumulating in top predators.Are PCBs from tower blocks killing whales?Image copyright Getty Images Polychlorinated biphenyls were manufactured from the 1920s Banned in the US in 1979, the UK in 1981 and the rest of the EU Europe produced some 300,000t from 1954 to 1984 About 90% of it has yet to be destroyed or safely stored away PCBs were used in tower blocks, especially in sealants These fill gaps between the concrete blocks of the buildings Many of these tower blocks have since been demolished The rubble was buried in landfill, and even used for sea defences PCBs were found in coolant fluids in electrical apparatus Also in cutting fluids for machining operations, and carbonless copy Today, only North Korea still manufactures polychlorinated biphenyls "A lot of these PCBs, we don't know how much, have not been disposed of and are slowly leaking into rivers and estuaries, from landfills, and eventually into the marine environment," explained Dr Paul Jepson, a specialist wildlife veterinarian from the Zoological Society of London, UK.The chemicals then gradually work their way up the food chain and into the top marine predators, where they accumulate in the cetaceans' blubber.Once a whale accumulates a high enough level of these toxic chemicals, their chance of reproducing becomes non-existent.Essentially, PCBs make the orcas infertile.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Humpback whales bask under the Northern Lights Researchers analysed samples taken from more than 1,000 killer whales and dolphins in Europe's waters."Our findings show that, despite the ban and initial decline in environmental contamination, PCBs still persist at dangerously high levels in European cetaceans," explained Dr Jepson.The levels are higher than those found in cetaceans in the waters around America and elsewhere.Now, Paul Jepson has teamed up with the UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme and DEFRA's chief scientific advisor, Prof Ian Boyd, to urge tougher action."We call on the UK and other European governments to make an inventory of PCBs in joint sealants used in large buildings built in the 1950s-1980s," said the ZSL researcher."Regulations could also be applied to demolition of these buildings to make sure that PCBs are captured and disposed of correctly - following the lead of some Scandinavian countries."Back to Kvalya and the seemingly healthy looking pod of killer whales continues to dance in the water.Occasionally, their dorsal fins break the tide, resembling a pack of submarines.But with more PCBs ending up in Arctic waters, could their time be running out?"PCBs in the Arctic were declining over many years - but in the last 5-10 years levels of PCBs have either stabilised or even increased in some Arctic species like polar bears and killer whales.This is a very worrying trend if it were to continue," said Dr Jepson.As the tour boat begins to make its way back to shore, Fredrik Broms tries frantically captures as many images of the orcas as he can."It's so easy to tell if a whale has been damaged on the outside, such as colliding with a boat propeller or a fishing net.It'll have scars.But it's much harder to know what's going on inside their body what chemicals are there."
Blue Planet II: 22 things to know about the new series:::::A year after the epic Planet Earth II, Sir David Attenborough is returning to our screens with a follow-up to 2001's Blue Planet.No spoilers, but we've seen the first episode and as sequels go we can confirm it's better than Sex And The City 2.We've also been to the press conference and spoken to some of the team behind the new series.Here are 22 things you need to know about Blue Planet II - complete with behind-the-boat info and what you can expect from the first episode.1.Five babies were born to crew members in the time it took to film.Blue Planet II involved "125 shoots, 6,000 hours filming underwater and 1,000 hours filming in submersibles", explains production manager Katie Hall.But away from the shoots, she adds, it was also a busy time for the crew: "We had three weddings.Four houses were bought.Five babies.Two babies on the way."That's what happens when you're filming for four years."2."Oceans cover 70% of the surface of our planet, and yet they are still the least explored," says Sir David Attenborough in the opening sequence."Hidden beneath the waves, there are creatures beyond our imagination," he continues.Roughly translated, we think he's saying: "Look, I know you might have seen Finding Dory multiple times but this is the real deal."3.Hans Zimmer is doing the music again.It's bad news for Fifth Harmony fans as the soundtrack has already been sorted by composer and general legend Hans Zimmer."We actually put the music out to tender, we weren't sure who we wanted to do it," explains executive producer James Honeyborne."And although we loved Planet Earth II [which Zimmer also did the soundtrack for] we wanted to keep this feeling fresh."But Hans came to us with such an impassioned pitch as to why he wanted to do it, which was incredible."4.There will be seven episodes in the series.And they're split into different habitats - like deep ocean, the coral reefs, the open ocean and the coastlines."Once you start dividing those up, you start to see where some of the stories would naturally fit," says James.5.We wouldn't fancy filling out the risk assessment form for this show."When we green light each shoot, we're constantly mitigating risk," says Katie."But bar a couple of earaches, a little bit of water at the bottom of a submersible, and one cameraman stubbed his finger, we were extraordinarily lucky."But the planning that goes into every single shoot, and managing the risk - whether that's financial risk or health and safety - you don't see any of that."Shame.6.There's some serious drama in the opening episode.Spoiler alert etc, etc.In the opening episode, we meet some birds.Who sometimes like to fly down to the ocean and chill out a bit on the surface.Unfortunately for them, there's some rather hungry giant trevallies (ie big scary fish) lurking under the water.And they have a particular taste for birds.We won't give much more away, but it's safe to say you're about to see some snakes and iguanas-level drama go down.7.Fish are Facebook-friendly.The trailer for the new series has already built up 43 million views on social media.Which is all part of a new digital strategy this year, according to Tom McDonald, who is (deep breath) head of commissioning at the BBC's Natural History and Specialist Factual unit."One of the interesting things about Planet Earth II was that more people watched it than the X Factor results show when they were up against each other last year," he says."So if there is a younger audience out there that is going to consume natural history content, we should focus our digital strategy on them, which is what we've done this year."8.New technology was built to film the series."We built a huge piece of housing which we called the megadome which allowed us to slice the sea in half so you can see above and below at the same time," James says."We also built a tow-cam which can be pulled behind a boat which allowed us to travel with really fast-moving animals like dolphins and tuna."9.They've brought back those 'making of' segments at the end of the episodes.Remember on Planet Earth II, you'd get 50 minutes worth of TV show, and then 10 minutes of how the episode you've just seen was shot?Half the time, the "making of" bit was even more interesting and eventful than the show itself.Well, they've brought that bit back - and this series will have a segment called Into The Blue at the end of each instalment.10.There's some stuff in the series that even Sir David Actual Attenborough didn't know about."When we first showed him some clips, he was like, 'Oh I didn't know this' and 'I didn't know that'," James says."Genuinely he was surprised.It's always good if you can surprise David, it doesn't happen often."11.One Walrus has clearly been watching Titanic.At one point in the first episode, a walrus tries to seek refuge from a preying polar bear on a floating iceberg.Problem is, there are already some walruses (walri?)on said berg.Clearly, this walrus watched Titanic, and, like the rest of us, thought there was plenty of room for Kate Winslet to shift over and make room for Leonardo DiCaprio on that piece of wood.Unfortunately, the extra weight of this particular walrus on this particular iceberg causes it to collapse, ruining the party for everybody (there's always one).12.Bottle-nosed dolphins are super-cute They just look so friendly don't they, you'd definitely go for a drink with one.13.Dolphins surf, Sir David explains, "to strengthen friendships, develop social skills, and for the sheer exhilaration of it".Coincidentally, this is also why humans do karaoke.14.The show doesn't shy away from the impact of pollution."You can't go out there and make a series like this without seeing some really big issues unfolding in front of you," says James."You can go to the middle of the ocean and find plastics from many different continents coming together."The impact that has on the wildlife can be devastating."In the show, we hear Sir David comment: "There are worrying signs that conditions in the oceans that have remained relatively stable for millennia, are changing radically."15.Warning: The first episode includes "mating".In case you're planning to watch with your parents.Fortunately, the mating involves this handsome chap.16.Some shots weren't filmed on location.Earlier this week, The Guardian said some footage had been captured in "controlled laboratory conditions".After the report was published, James explained the series was overwhelmingly shot on location, but in a few select instances, such as rock pools in the Coasts episode, labs were used."Filming in the wild would have been too disruptive for the wildlife," he said."It would have been impossible to film close-ups of this magical world, so we worked with scientists to accurately recreate a rock pool in the controlled conditions of the lab."17.It wasn't originally going to be called Blue Planet II."The series was commissioned as Oceans," explains Tom."It was a very easy commission, instinctively the channel understood it was a brilliant thing to do and it felt like it was the right time to go back to this habitat."It was never designed so that we'd have Planet Earth II last year and Blue Planet II this year, so now it looks like it was a brilliant strategy, but it wasn't exactly conceived that way."18.Tusk fish are determined little creatures.There is one tusk fish who travels to the edge of the coral reef every morning, Sir David explains, looking for some breakfast.While most of us would grab some Special K from the cupboard, this guy travels quite some distance in search of a small clam.Using his mouth, he takes it back to his "kitchen" - which is essentially a massive rock, against which he starts bashing the clam repeatedly in order to crack it open."It's not easy when you have no hands," Sir David observes.19.Not all of the plans for the series came off."There were lots of shoots that failed, to put it bluntly," says Tom."The team set out to capture particular species, and when you watch this, I think James and his team make it look really easy."And when I think about the number of variables when it comes to filming in the ocean, I think it's remarkable what they were able to capture."20.In true W1A style, the show has led to more collaborative BBC working."Some of the new technologies that were invented specifically for this series are already being deployed by the Natural History Unit on future projects," says Tom.James adds: "There was a sequence on The One Show last week about sturgeon [not Nicola], and they borrowed our probe lens, which is great - we built it, they were able to use it."21.There's going to be a podcast to accompany the series.So make sure you're all caught-up on Serial.22.So...Planet Earth II.Blue Planet II.What's next?"We have a big landmark series for next year which is very different to Blue Planet II," says Tom."It's been announced already, it's called Dynasty, not to be confused with Carringtons and Colbys, so who knows if it will stay that title."But the premise of each film is we take one animal family and follow them for a number of years to see the ups and downs of their family lines."I'm already viewing episodes of it, and it's incredibly visceral.It feels so different to this."There's more."One other thing I'm really excited about is a series the NHU have made which is on in January called Animals With Cameras, a really simple proposition."We've built bespoke cameras for different species, that the animals wear, so we can see the world from an animal's point of view."There's meerkats in it," he adds."That's my innovation for 2018, more meerkats."Blue Planet II begins on BBC One at 20:00 GMT on Sunday.The series has been sold to more than 30 countries around the world.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
How science transformed the world in 100 years:::::Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Discovering the structure of DNA was a "big moment" in science In an essay for the BBC, Nobel Prize-winner and Royal Society President Sir Venki Ramakrishnan contemplates the nature of scientific discovery - how it has transformed our worldview in a short space of time, and why we need to be just as watchful today about the uses of research as we've ever been.If we could miraculously transport even the smartest people from around 1900 to today's world, they would be simply astonished at how we now understand things that had puzzled humans for centuries.Just over a hundred years ago, people had no idea how we inherit and pass on traits or how a single cell could grow into an organism.They didn't know that atoms themselves had structure - the word itself means indivisible.They didn't know that matter has very strange properties that defy common sense.Or why there is gravity.And they had no idea how things began, whether it was life on earth or the universe itself.BBC Tomorrow's World These days because of fundamental discoveries we can answer or at least begin to answer those mysteries.That has transformed the way we see the world and often our everyday lives.Much of what we take for granted today is a result of an interplay of fundamental science and technology, with each driving the other forward.Image copyright Royal Society Image caption Modern inventions often rely on discoveries that are a few hundred years old, says Venki Ramakrishnan Almost every modern invention has one or often many fundamental discoveries that make it possible.Sometimes, these fundamental discoveries were hundreds of years old.Neither jet engines nor rockets would be possible without a knowledge of Newton's laws of motion.There are big moments in science, like the discovery of the structure of DNA that shift our perspectives.But even that discovery was a milestone that built on work by Darwin and Mendel and presaged today's biotechnology where the entire DNA of a human being - the human genome - has been sequenced.Global change calculator Image copyright MARK GARLICK/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Which groundbreaking discovery was uncovered in your life time?Find out with the Tomorrow's World Global Change Calculator.That in turn has given us the ability to figure out how things go wrong in genetic diseases and potentially how to fix them.Scientists were recently able to modify the genes of a young girl to cure her cancer.We are no longer a complete black box, although our complexity is such that we are only just beginning to understand how our genes regulate the body and how they interact with our environment.Image copyright SPL Image caption We were able to work out that the Universe began with a Big Bang from a single point Genetic technologies are likely to present society with some big questions about how we see ourselves and what we want to use our greater understanding and capability for.That is also true of the Big Bang theory of how the Universe came into existence.A hundred years ago mysteries such as how the Universe came to exist were, for many, firmly in the realms of faith.Spurred on by the observation that the Universe is not constant, but galaxies are always expanding away from each other, we were able to work out that the Universe began with a Big Bang from a single point.This knowledge gives us insight into perhaps what is the biggest question of all - where did everything come from?That insight makes our small blue dot seem increasingly small, yet our quest for knowledge of what is out there shows no signs of an inferiority complex.Image copyright NASA Image caption Advances in space exploration have made us more inquisitive about the great unknown From the Apollo missions to the Cassini probe, the Hubble telescope to the search for gravitational waves and exoplanets - all of those breakthroughs seem to be making us more inquisitive about space.Today, much of how we see the world is through an electronic screen.Computers in all their many guises are sources of knowledge, but they are also increasingly how we present ourselves to the rest of the world, and how we interact with others.Even a ubiquitous object like a smartphone depends on many fundamental discoveries.Its powerful computer depends on integrated chips made up of transistors, whose discovery depended on an understanding of quantum mechanics.The GPS in a smart phone depends on correcting the time from satellites using both the special and general theories of relativity - theories that people once thought would have no practical value.I wonder how many understand all the discoveries that make the little box work.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Machines that learn have led to the first driverless cars Computers are also driving developments that will continue to challenge our view of the world.Machines that learn are already among us and are changing the world in which we live.They offer great potential in areas including healthcare and improving other public services, and may soon result in driverless cars and very sophisticated robots, but we need to make conscious decisions about how we want smart machines to allow humanity to flourish.Discoveries themselves are morally neutral, but the use we make of them are not.One discovery that shifted our view of the world in two distinctly divergent directions was nuclear fission.Its discovery led to the development of the most destructive weapons known.Some argue that the fear of destruction has been a powerful motivator for peace, but this is hardly a stable solution as can be seen with today's situation with North Korea.On the other hand, nuclear fission also promised a reliable source of energy that was once optimistically predicted to be 'too cheap to meter'.Image copyright AFP Image caption The fear of destruction may have acted as a deterrent once, but may not be a stable situation Science is the pursuit of knowledge about ourselves and the world around us.That pursuit of knowledge has also shaped the way we view the world, as has the application of the knowledge.It has transformed our lives, generally for the better.We live nearly twice as long today as our ancestors did in 1900 and the quality of our lives is far better than it was then.But the uses of science and technology are not shaped by science and scientists alone.They depend on an interplay of cultural, economic and political factors.Science is a triumph of human knowledge and we can all share in its excitement.At the same time, understanding its many uses can help us be engaged in decisions that affect us all.
The place spacecraft go to die:::::Image copyright china manned space engineering Image caption China's Tiangong I spacecraft is expected to fall to Earth soon China's Tiangong-1 space station is currently out of control and expected to fall back to Earth next year.But not in the remote place where many other spacecraft end their days.Explorers and adventurers often look for new places to conquer now that the highest peaks have been climbed, the poles reached and vast oceans and deserts crossed.Some of these new places are called the poles of inaccessibility.Two of them are particularly interesting.One is called the continental pole of inaccessibility - it's the place on Earth furthest from the ocean.There is some debate as to its exact position but it's considered by many to be near the so-called Dzungarian Gate - a mountain pass between China and Central Asia.The equivalent point in the ocean - the place furthest away from land - lies in the South Pacific some 2,700km (1,680 miles) south of the Pitcairn Islands - somewhere in the no-man's land, or rather no-man's-sea, between Australia, New Zealand and South America.This oceanic pole of inaccessibility is not only of interest to explorers, satellite operators are interested in it as well.That's because most of the satellites placed in orbit around the Earth will eventually come down, but where?Smaller satellites will burn up but pieces of the larger ones will survive to reach the Earth's surface.To avoid crashing on a populated area they are brought down near the point of oceanic inaccessibility.Scattered over an area of approximately 1,500 sq km (580 sq miles) on the ocean floor of this region is a graveyard of satellites.At last count there were more than 260 of them, mostly Russian.The wreckage of the Mir space station lies there.It was launched in 1986 and was visited by many teams of cosmonauts and international visitors.With a mass of 120 tonnes it was never going to burn up in the atmosphere, so it was ditched in the region in 2001 and was seen by some fishermen as a fragmenting mass of glowing debris racing across the sky.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A computer-simulated image of Mir's descent and break-up as it entered the Earth's atmosphere in 2001 Many times a year the supply module that goes to the International Space Station burns up in this region incinerating the station's waste.No one is in any danger because of this controlled re-entry into our atmosphere.The region is not fished because oceanic currents avoid the area and do not bring nutrients to it, making marine life scarce.One future visitor to this desolate place will be the International Space Station.Current plans are for it to be decommissioned in the next decade and it will have to be carefully brought down in the oceanic pole of inaccessibility.With a mass of 450 tonnes - four times that of the Mir space station - it will make a spectacular sight.Sometimes however, it's not possible to bring a satellite or space station down in the South Pacific if ground controllers have lost contact with it.Image copyright NASA Image caption The Earth is surrounded by thousands of pieces of space junk (dots not to scale) Such a thing happened with the 36-tonne Salyut 7 space station in 1991 which came down in South America or the American Skylab that struck Australia in 1979.No one on the ground was injured, or indeed as far as we know, ever has been hit by a piece of falling spacecraft debris.We will face that problem again next year.Between January and April the Chinese Tiangong-1 will come back to Earth.It was launched in 2011 as China's first space station.The following year it was visited by China's first female astronaut, Liu Yang.Tiangong-1's orbit is decaying as it heads towards re-entry.But Chinese engineers have lost control of it and cannot fire its thrusters to bring it down in the South Pacific.Instead it will come down somewhere between 42.8 degrees north and south.That's between the latitude of northern Spain and southern Australia, and we won't be able to be more precise than that until just a few hours before it burns up.Tiangong-1 is one space station that probably won't join its companions in the remote South Pacific.Dr David Whitehouse was the BBC's science correspondent from 1988 until 2006, and is a former science editor at the BBC News website.
Can we make fashion greener?:::::Image copyright MIGUEL MEDINA Image caption For big labels, Milan's Fall fashion week is a major event in the calendar We continue to buy new clothes at an incredible rate.How can manufacturers reduce fashion's environmental footprint?According to the Valuing Our Clothes report analysing the contents of British wardrobes by the Waste Resources Action Programme (WRAP), we purchased 1,130,000 tonnes of new clothing last year in the UK.Meanwhile, an estimated 30bn worth of our clothing hangs about gathering dust because we simply don't have time to wear it all or don't really like what we're buying.This is the epoch of "fast fashion" - a rapid production system that promises quick turnaround of trends and low prices, with a supply chain that snakes through some of the lowest wage economies on Earth.Fast fashion brands dominate not just high streets, but our wardrobes and represent the three trillion dollar global fashion industry's greatest success story.But at what cost?The environmental footprint of today's fashion industry is extraordinary, making it one of the top five most polluting industries on earth, alongside the petrochemical industry.Many fashion industry insiders are seriously worried, not necessarily because they fret over greenhouse gases caused by the supply chain, but because there is now so much over-supply of fashion that it's becoming difficult to have a successful season - particularly as we now have 50 seasons rather than the traditional two of spring/summer and autumn/winter.Some commentators refer to today's relentless cycle as a "supermarket of style".Cause for optimism?But according to fashion theory, there are 101 steps to producing a garment from processes such as dyeing and finishing to pressing the garment ready for retail.If you're a pessimist that's 101 chances to introduce pollution, exploitation and planetary degradation.If however you're an optimist, that's 101 opportunities to take the impact out of fashion!So for a new episode of BBC Radio 4's Costing the Earth, I travelled to Milan Fashion week to meet some disruptors (and definitely optimists) who believe we are on the cusp of a green revolution that can turn the industry around.At the Green Carpet Fashion Awards Italia, that took place at the famous La Scala opera theatre during Milan Fashion Week it was difficult not to be blinded by the super star wattage pacing the deliberately "green" carpet (manufactured from old fishing nets and carpets).Image copyright Anne-Marie Bullock Image caption The Green Carpet Fashion Awards honour disruptors who try to reduce fashion's environmental footprint Image copyright Eco Age Image caption The awards were held in the magnificent La Scala opera house But among the stars - Gisele Bundchen, Naomi Campbell, Colin Firth, Giorgio Armani were all in attendance - were a number of eco innovation show stoppers.One model wore an eye catching dress made from apple leather and creating by emerging designer, Matje Benedetti who explained how waste apple pulp from the apple industry is mixed with polyurethane to develop the fibre.The inclusion of ecological innovative fibres at this level - awards on the night also went to Orange Fibre, a company spinning yarn from citrus waste - points to serious investment in revolutionary new materials.Silky skills Case and point is provided by New York biotech start-up Modern Meadows.Here biologists work alongside creative director, Suzanne Lee and fermentation engineers to bio-fabricate leather in the laboratory.This research and development promises a future where cows will not be required for a handbag and where fashion design intersects with biology.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some in the fashion industry are looking at other options for producing fabrics Meanwhile, Californian start up Bolt Threads has raised millions of dollars to bring its brewed spider silk to market (Stella McCartney has designed with the material) and fashion entrepreneur Miroslava Duma recently launched a $50 million fund and accelerator dedicated to bringing new sustainable fibres and fabrics to market.In many ways this fibre revolution is long overdue.The fashion industry, for all its claims of being cutting edge, is remarkably conservative when it comes to fabrics.Humanity is almost exclusive clothed in polyester and cotton fibres, both of which have shocking environmental profiles.This also means that the last significant innovation in materials was polyester, circa 1943!3D printing But what we're also seeing here are levels of and investment in disruptive technology and innovation that have previously been applied to the technology and transport sector, applied to fashion.This is potentially a game changer.However, we do still need to address the issue of our own over consumption, an area where we've made little headway.But there's innovation here too: designer Danit Peleg 3D prints her collections and thinks in the foreseeable future we will be able to effectively design out shopping for fashion by 3D printing to order.It's another innovation to get excited by and a disruption that could represent an enormous gift to the biosphere given the impact of our consumption.But I'd have to concede it's early days for all of this innovation.Image copyright Reuters Image caption The evening was attended by a host of stars of the fashion industry So amid such headline-grabbing, tech-fuelled disruption is there a more immediate, human, low-tech answer right in front of us?Psychologist Professor Carolyn Mair has observed that we're inclined to keep stuff circulating in our wardrobe to which we've attached a strong personal narrative.Mair told me about her favourite example: "a pair of lucky pants".Many people secretly own a pair to which they attach talismanic significance and they have huge longevity!Behaviours like these can turn fashion green.WRAP research shows that extending the life of clothes by an extra nine months of active use, in the UK, reduces the carbon, water and waste impacts of that garment by around 20-30%.Standby then for a wardrobe future where you'll be able to access cutting edge bio-fabricated novel material that's been 3D printed in a pair of very lucky pants.That's what I call fashion forward.Costing the Earth is available now and on BBC Radio 4 on Thursday 11th Oct at 9pm
How do you build the next-generation internet?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Scientists are now developing an ultra-fast quantum internet that will be partly based on light Imagine super-fast computers that can solve problems much quicker than machines today.These "quantum computers" are being developed in laboratories around the world.But scientists have already taken the next step, and are thinking about a light-based quantum internet that will have to be just as fast.It's not easy to develop technology for a device that hasn't technically been invented yet, but quantum communications is an attractive field of research because the technology will enable us to send messages that are much more secure.There are several problems that will need to be solved in order to make a quantum internet possible: Getting quantum computers to talk to each other Making communications secure from hacking Transmitting messages over long distances without losing parts of the message; and Routing messages across a quantum network What is a quantum computer?A quantum computer is a machine that is able to crack very tough computation problems with incredible speed - beyond that of today's "classical" computers.In conventional computers, the unit of information is called a "bit" and can have a value of either 1 or 0.But its equivalent in a quantum system - the qubit (quantum bit) - can be both 1 and 0 at the same time.This phenomenon opens the door for multiple calculations to be performed simultaneously.However, qubits need to be synchronised using a quantum effect known as entanglement, which Albert Einstein termed "spooky action at a distance".There are four types of quantum computers currently being developed, which use: Light particles Trapped ions Superconducting qubits Nitrogen vacancy centres in diamonds Quantum computers will enable a multitude of useful applications, such as being able to model many variations of a chemical reaction to discover new medications; developing new imaging technologies for healthcare to better detect problems in the body; or to speed up how we design batteries, new materials and flexible electronics.Pooling computing power Quantum computers might be more powerful than classical computers, but some applications will require even more computing power than one quantum computer can provide on its own.If you can get quantum devices to talk to each other, then you could connect several quantum computers together and pool their power to form one huge quantum computer.However, since there are four different types of quantum computers being built today, they won't be all be able to talk to each other without some help.Some scientists favour a quantum internet based entirely on light particles (photons), while others believe that it would be easier to make quantum networks where light interacts with matter."Light is better for communications, but matter qubits are better for processing," Joseph Fitzsimons, a principal investigator at the National University of Singapore's Centre of Quantum Technologies tells the BBC."You need both to make the network work to establish error correction of the signal, but it can be difficult to make them interact."It is very expensive and difficult to store all information in photons, Mr Fitzsimons says, because photons can't see each other and pass straight by, rather than bouncing off each other.Instead, he believes it would be easier to use light for communications, while storing information using electrons or atoms (in matter).Quantum encryption Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Quantum encryption will make communications much more secure One of the key applications of the quantum internet will be quantum key distribution (QKD), whereby a secret key is generated using a pair of entangled photons, and is then used to encrypt information in a way that is impossible for a quantum computer to crack.This technology already exists, and was first demonstrated in space by a team of researchers from the National University of Singapore and the University of Strathclyde, UK, in December 2015.But it's not just the encryption that we will need to build in order to secure our information in the quantum future.Scientists are also working on "blind quantum computer protocols", because they allow the user to hide anything they want on a computer."You can write something, send it to a remote computer and the person who owns the computer can't tell anything about it at all except how long it took to run and how much memory it used," says Mr Fitzsimons."This is important because there likely won't be many quantum computers when they first appear, so people will want to remotely run programs on them, the way we do today in the cloud."There are two different approaches to building quantum networks - a land-based network and a space-based network.Both methods work well for sending regular bits of data across the internet today, but if we want to send data as qubits in the future, it is much more complicated.To send particles of light (photons), we can use fibre optic cables in the ground.However, the light signal deteriorates over long distances (a phenomenon known as "decoherence"), because fibre optics cables sometimes absorb photons.It is possible to get around this by building "repeater stations" every 50km.These would essentially be miniature quantum laboratories that would try to repair the signal before sending it on to the next node in the network.But this system would come with its own complexities.Land or space?Image copyright Johannes Handsteiner / AW Image caption Artwork: a ground station beams a message contained in a light signal up to the Micius satellite Then there are space-based networks.Let's say you want to send a message from the UK to a friend in Australia.The light signal is beamed up from a ground station in the UK, to a satellite with a light source mounted on it.The satellite sends the light signal to another satellite, which then beams the signal down to a ground station in Australia, and then the message can be transmitted over a ground-based quantum network or classical internet network to the other party."Because there's no air between the satellites, there's nothing to degrade the signal," says Dr Jamie Vicary, a senior research fellow at Oxford University's department of computer science and a member of the Networked Quantum Information Technologies Hub (NQIT)."If we want to have a really global-scale quantum internet, it looks like a space-based solution is the only way that will work, but it's the most expensive."Quantum teleportation via space has been conducted successfully, and scientists are currently vying to demonstrate longer and longer distances.Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences generated headlines in June when they succeeded in teleporting entangled photons between two towns in China located 1,200km apart.They used a specially developed quantum satellite called Micius.The same Chinese scientists recently topped their own record on 29 September, by demonstrating the world's first intercontinental video call protected by a quantum key with researchers at the Austrian Academy of Sciences - over a distance of 7,700km.The call lasted for 20 minutes and the parties were able to exchange encrypted pictures of the Micius satellite and Austrian physicist Erwin Schrdinger.Rupert Ursin, senior group leader at the Austrian Academy of Sciences' Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information believes the quantum internet will need land-based and space-based networks to operate in parallel."In the cities, we need a fibre network, but long haul connections will be covered by satellite links," he explains.How does quantum key distribution work?Image copyright AW Image caption The video call between Austrian and Chinese scientists on 29 September 2017 To understand how QKD works, let's go back to the video call made between the Austrian and Chinese scientists.The Micius satellite used its light source to establish optical links with the ground stations in Austria and the ground stations in China.It was then able to generate a quantum key.The great thing about quantum encryption is you can detect whether someone has tried to intercept the message before it got to you, and how many people tried to access it.Micius was able to tell that the encryption was secure and no one was eavesdropping on the video call.It then gave the go ahead to encrypt the data using the secret key and transmit it over a public internet channel.Routing messages Multiple groups of scientists are developing land-based networks by working on the technologies for quantum repeater stations, which are located every 50km, connected by fibre optic cables.These repeater stations, also known as "quantum network nodes", will need to perform several actions in order to route, or direct, messages around the network.First, each node needs to repair and boost the signal that was damaged from the previous 50km stretch of the network.Imagine that you're using an old fax machine to send a one-page document to someone else, and each time you send the page, a different part of the message is missing, and the other party has to piece the message together from all the failed attempts.This is similar to how a single message may have to be sent between different nodes on a quantum network.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fibre optic cables will be used for land-based quantum networks There will be many people on the network, all trying to talk to each other.So the node, or repeater station, will also have to figure out how to distribute its available computing power in order to piece together all the messages being sent.It will also have to send messages between the quantum internet and the classical internet.The University of Delft is building a quantum network using nitrogen vacancies in diamonds, and it has so far shown the ability to store and distribute the links needed for quantum communications over quite large distances.The University of Oxford and the University of Maryland are both currently building quantum computers that work in a similar way to a network.Their quantum computers consist of trapped ion nodes that have been networked together to talk to each other.The bigger the computer you want, the more nodes you have to add, but this type of quantum computer only transmits data over a short distance."We want to make them small so they can be well-protected from decoherence, but if they're small then they can't hold many qubits," says Dr Vicary."If we connect the nodes up in a network, then we can still have a quantum computer without being limited by the number of qubits, while still protecting the nodes."Quantum memory The repeater station will also need to have a quantum memory chip.The nodes create "links", which consist of entangled pairs of light particles.These entangled pairs are prepared in advance.While the node calculates the route across the network that the message will need to take, it needs to store the entangled pair of photons somewhere safe, so a quantum memory chip is needed.It has to be able to store the photons for as long as possible.Image copyright Stuart Hay, ANU Image caption Dr Rose Ahlefeldt and associate professor Matthew Sellars operate a high-resolution dye laser to study rare earth crystals at ANU Researchers from the Australian National University (ANU) have developed a telecom-compatible quantum memory chip using an erbium-doped crystal.This device is able to store light in the right colour and it is able to do so for longer than one second, which is 10,000 times longer than all other attempts so far."The biggest challenge is now to demonstrate a quantum memory with a large data storage capacity," associate professor Matthew Sellars, program manager in the Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology (CQC2T) at ANU tells the BBC."It will be the memory's storage capacity that will limit the data transmission rate through the network."I think it will take about five years before the technology [for the quantum internet] is practical."
Sputnik: How the Soviet Union spun the satellite launch:::::Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Space exploration began with Sputnik's successful launch on 4 October, 1957 The launch of Sputnik, the first man-made satellite, 60 years ago kicked off the space race between the Soviet Union and America.The satellite was a success not just in terms of scientific advancement but in terms of providing a propaganda opportunity for the socialist state.Early reports detailed a wealth of technical information about the launch of the "Earth satellite", such was the general interest in it.'Like a flashing spark' One news correspondent described seeing the satellite appear "like a flashing spark over the horizon" and the Communist Party's main newspaper, Pravda, wrote that "all the world heard the announcement of the launching of the artificial moon".But reports by the state news agency Tass also mentioned its orbital velocity of about 8km a second, the fact that it was travelling at up to 900km above the surface of the earth, and that Sputnik was making one complete revolution in an hour and 35 minutes.Image caption Sputnik was just 58cm in diameter and weighed 84kg Russian media also detailed the frequencies and wavelengths on which Sputnik was emitting regular beeps, saying its transmitters were powerful enough for amateur radio operators to be able to receive them.Later, radio broadcasts to America touted the fact that the Soviet magazine Radio was offering "special prizes" for radio hams who submitted reports of the signals.Special broadcasts listed the places and times the satellite was expected to pass over.Image copyright BBC Monitoring Image caption BBC Monitoring, a unit of the World Service, recorded Soviet broadcasts about Sputnik's movements The day after its launch, Tass and Russian radio reported world reaction to it, noting how major media outlets like AFP, the Daily Mail and the BBC had reported it and how "some US radio stations interrupted their programmes in order to broadcast the satellite's signals".'Victory for the Soviet order' On Soviet radio, various scientists, such as jet propulsion expert Professor Kirill Stanyukovich, called it "a great victory not only for Soviet science but also for the Soviet order"."I think that the very fact that this has been achieved in our socialist country must not be regarded as mere chance," another academic told listeners."That we are not as rich as America is no secret to us.Why then has it happened that we have been capable of solving these most advanced and difficult scientific and technical problems ahead of Americans?"Several digs at America made their way into reports."For 40 years they closed their eyes to the enormous successes of Soviet industry and agriculture," one radio broadcast said."Now the most reactionary personalities in the USA are trying to raise some doubts about the tremendous value and great significance of this new success of Soviet science."BBC Monitoring, a unit of the World Service which monitored Soviet broadcasts at the time, notes that "Leading officials were quoted by Tass as showing reluctance to accept the news; and Moscow radio told the home audience on the 7th that the United States Information Agency had adopted a policy of minimising the military and scientific significance of the achievement.US scientists, on the other hand, were given as expressing pleased congratulations."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Komsomolskaya Pravda described Sputnik as "the victory of Soviet power" Influence in a different space Today, the name Sputnik is also associated with an international news agency, which has a presence on the web and radio, and is one of the main media outlets through which Russia influences global opinion.Sputnik tends to seek audiences on the political margins - whether it's supporters of the Front National in France, or the Democrat Bernie Sanders in the US.Its political stances include the idea that NATO is a menace to world peace, criticism of what it sees as US hegemony, and the general decadence of Western democracies and their institutions, especially in the face of the challenges posed by Islamist terrorism and migration into Europe.Sputnik is still potent force for Russian influence, just in a different sort of space now.See also: The team that tracked Sputnik - and the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.You can follow BBC Monitoring on Twitter and Facebook.
